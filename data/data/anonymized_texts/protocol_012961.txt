Study type: interventional, open-label, randomised, multicentre, efficacy a nd safety study   
Study Objectives : 
Primary Objective : 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy  of the regimen of irinotecan 
liposome injection + oxaliplatin + 5 -fluorouracil (5- FU)/leucovorin (LV) versus 
nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine in improving overall survival (OS) in subjects who have not

in Solid Tumours (RECIST) Version 1.1 guidelines 
• To evaluate the overall respons e rate (ORR) according to RECIST  V e r s i o n 1.1 
guidelines  
• To evaluate the safety of this regimen in this patient populati on. 
Exploratory Objectives : 
• To evaluate time to deterioration or worsening of subjects phys ical functioning, 
disease related symptoms and treatment related symptoms of inte rest using patient-
reported outcome (PRO) data collected using the European Organi sation for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life-core questionnaire (EOR TC QLQ- C30), 
specific pancreatic cancer module (QLQ- PAN26) questionnaire and PRO of Common 
Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (PRO- CTCAE) as well as the

• To describe the possible association between genotypes to inclu de but not be limited 
to UGT1A1*28 and other UGT1A genotypes, SN- 38 concentration (only for subjects 
treated with irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5-FU/LV)  and safety 
• To explore the pharmacodynamic biomarker CA 19- 9 for the regimen of irinotecan 
liposome injection+oxaliplatin+ 5-FU/LV compared with nab- paclitaxel+gemcitabine 
in this patient population.  
• To conduct biobanking of samples for future analysis of biomark ers amongst subjects 
who consent to optional biobanking. 
• To collect gene mutation and genomic alteration status a ssociated with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma of subjects determined prior to screening (if av ailable). 
Study hypothesis: Irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5- FU/LV has superior efficacy 
over nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine, demonstrated by a 3-month improvement in OS , in the 
treatment of subjects who have not previously received chemothe rapy for metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 
Methodology :  
This is an open -label, randomised, multicentre, phase III study. Subjects will be randomised 
in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment regimens: 
• Arm 1: irinotecan liposome in jection+oxaliplatin+5-FU/LV 
• Arm 2: nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine 
There is no pre -defined duration of treatment for  each subject. It is intended that subjects will 
be treated until radiologically determined progressive disease per RECIST Versio n 1.1, 
unacceptable study medication related toxicity or withdrawal fr om study. 
Number of subjects planned : 
Approximately 750 subjects are planned to be randomised (approx imately 375 subjects per 
arm). 
Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion :  
Inclusion criteria : 
A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all the following criteria are met: 
General inclusion criteria  
(1) Subject has been informed about  the nature of the study, and has agreed to participate 
in the study, and signed the informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation in any 
study-related activities. 
(2b) Male or non-pregnant and non- lactating female and ≥18 years of age:  
(a) Females of child-bearing potential (i.e. fe rtile, following menarche and until 
becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent s terilisation 
methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilat eral 
oophorectomy) must test negative for pregnancy at the time of s creening based 
on a urine or serum pregnancy test. A postmenopausal state is d efined as no 
menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A hi gh follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may  be used to 
confirm a postmenopausal sta te in women not using hormonal contraception or 
hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Female su bjects of 
reproductive potential must agree to use a highly effective met hod of birth 3URWRFRO$XJ_

Test product, dose and mode of administration : 
Irinotecan liposome injection (also known as Nal -IRI, BAX2398, PEP02, liposomal 
irinotecan and MM -398) is irinotecan in the form of the sucrosofate salt, encapsu lated in 
liposomes for intravenous (i.v.) infusion. The liposome is a un ilamellar lipid bilayer vesicle, 
approximately 110  nm in diameter, which encapsula tes an aqueous space containing 
irinotecan in a gelated or precipitated state as the sucrosofat e salt. It is supplied in sterile, 
single -use vials containing 10 mL of liposome irin otecan injection at a concentration of 
4.3 mg/mL free base equivalent (FBE). Irinotecan liposome injection  must be stored 
refrigerated (2  to 8°C, 36 to 46°F) with protection from light and must not be  frozen.  
Irinotecan liposome injection dose will be exp ressed as FBE. 
The test product irinotecan liposome injection is administered in combination with 
oxaliplatin and 5 -FU/LV. 
Arm 1: Doses and administration of irinotecan liposome injectio n, oxaliplatin, 5 -FU/LV, on 
Days 1 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle will be: 
• Irinotecan liposome injection administered at 50 mg/m2 (FBE) i.v. over 90 minutes 
(±10 minutes) 
• Oxaliplatin administered at 60 mg/m2 i.v. over 120 minutes (±10 minutes) 
• LV (l+d racemic form-ge neric form) 400 mg/m2, i.v. over 30 minutes (±5 minutes) 
• 5-FU administered 2400 mg/m2 i.v. over 46-hours (±120 minutes) 
Dose level reductions required due to toxicity related to irino tecan liposome injection, 
oxaliplatin, LV and 5-FU should be made following the guideline s outlined in Appendix 2 . 
Reference therapy, dose and mode of administration : 
Arm 2: Doses and administration of nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine and on Days 1, 8 and 15 
of each 28 -day cycle will be: 
• Nab-paclitaxel administered at 125 mg/m2 i.v. over 35 minutes (±5 minutes)  
• Gemcitabine administered at 1000 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 minutes (±5 minutes) 
Dose level reductions required due to toxicity related to nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine 
should be made following the guidelines outlined in Appendix 3 . 
Duration of treatment : 
Both regimens are 28 -day cycles unless cycle duration is modified by toxicity. 
The toxicity of each dose must be recorded prior to the adminis tration of a subsequent dose 
and graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTC AE (Version 5.0). All dose 
modifications for all arms s hould be based on the worst precedi ng toxicity . 
Dosing may be delayed to allow for recovery from toxicity relat ed to the study treatment. If 
the time required for recovery from toxicity is more than 14  days in Arm 1 or 21 days in 
Arm 2, consideration should be given to discontinuing the subject f rom further treatment, 
unless the subject is demonstrating benefit overall, in which c ase the possibility of remaining 
on study medication should be discussed between investigator an d sponsor, after review of 
the associated risks and benefits. However, if oxaliplatin is n ot well tolerated in subjects 
randomised to Arm 1, oxaliplatin may be discontinued and subjec ts may continue to receive 
irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV at the discretion o f the investigator and continue in

If a subject’s dose is reduced during the study due to toxicity , it should remain reduced for 
the duration of the study; dose re -escalation is not permitted (with exception, see

event (AE) that would require a fourth dose reduction must be d iscontinued from study 
treatment. In Arm  2, any subject who has two dose reductions and experiences an AE that 
would require a third dose reduction must be discontinued from study treatment. Toxicity 
requiring discontinuation of any of the drugs in either regimen  (apart from oxaliplatin) will 
result in discontinuation from the study treatment.  
A subject  who discontinues study medication and has not  withdrawn from the study must 
continue with all ongoing protocol requirements until confirmed  radiographic disease 
progression or until the star t of alternative anti -cancer therapy. 
A follow -up clinic visit is required approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatme nt 
to complete the final safety assessments. Subsequently, subject s will be followed for survival 
once every 2  months via telephone, email, or clinic visit until death or stu dy closure, 
whichever occurs first.  
Criteria for evaluation (endpoints) : 
Primary and Key Secondary Efficac y Endpoints and main evaluatio ns:  
Efficacy Assessments  
Subjects will have CT scans (or MRI if the subject is allergic to CT contrast media) performed 
every 8  weeks t hat will be evaluated by the investigator site using RECIST gui delines 
Version  1.1 for complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease.  
Subjects will be followed in the study until death to assess OS  time. Subjects who have 
terminated study medication treatment will have follow- up every 2 months to determine 
survival status.  
Efficacy : 
Primary Endpoint(s) and Evaluation(s):  
Primary Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the OS of subjects treated wit h irinotecan liposome 
inject ion+oxaliplatin+5- FU/LV compared to subjects treated with 
nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine.  
Secondary Endpoints(s) and Evaluation(s):  
Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints (PFS and ORR) will only be eva luated if the primary 
efficacy endpoint demonstrates superiority for irinotecan lipos ome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV over nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine. Investigator- assessed 
tumour response will be used in efficacy analys is. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma concentrations of total irinotecan and SN -38 will be used to characterise their 
corresponding PK parameters, in co -administration with 5- FU and oxaliplatin, using a 
nonlinear mixed effects approach. Individual PK parameters will  be estimated if warranted 
by the data. Oxaliplatin and/or 5 -FU concentrations might be used for further PK 
characterisation if more investigations are required.  
Graphical exploration will be performed to investigate any rela tionship between PK and PD 
endpoints. If a trend is shown, PK/PD modelling will be perform ed and reported separately. 
Safety : 
Safety will be monitored through continuous reporting of AEs an d serious adverse events 
(SAEs), laboratory abnormalities, and incidence of subjects exp eriencing dose modifications 
(including dose reductions, dose omissions and dose delays) and /or premature 
discontinuation of study medication (and reason for discontinua tion).  3URWRFRO$XJ_

The safety evaluations include: 
• AEs 
• Clinical laboratory assessments 
• ECG findings 
• Complete physical examination including the evaluation of ECOG,  vital signs, 
measurements and body weight. 
These safety evaluations will be performed from ICF signature, throughout the study to 
30 days after the last study treatment administration. 
An independent data and monitoring  committee (IDMC) will be est ablished for this study to 
operate as an independent expert advisory group with the primar y responsibility of 
monitoring the safety of enrolled subjects by reviewing the clinical data at scheduled time 
points described in the IDMC Cha rter, as well as on an ad hoc b asis, as needed. The IDMC 
will additionally review the saf ety and efficacy of the interim  analysis and make appropriate 
recommendations based on those results. 
Statistical Methods : 
Method of Randomisation:  
• Randomisation ratio 1:1 
• Stratification factors: 
- ECOG Performance Status (0 or 1) 
- Region (North America/East  Asia/Rest of the World) 
- Liver metastases (Yes/No) 
Sample Size and Power Considerations:  
The study sample size required to demonstrate an improvement in  OS of irinotecan liposome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV compared with nab- paclitaxel+gemcitabine has been 
calculated using the following assumptions:  
• expected median OS on nab-pacli taxel+gemcitabine arm of 9 month s 
• expected median OS on irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin +5-FU/LV arm of 
12 months  
• for detection of a true HR of 0.75 
• one-sided test 
• overall type I error rate = 0.025 
• power = 90%  
• randomisation allocation ratio 1:1 (Arm 1: Arm 2). 
Approximately 750 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to  the two treatment arms. 
Accounting for the planned inte rim analysis, follow-up until at least 543 OS events are 
observed across the two treatment arms provide at least 90% pow er to detect a true HR ≤0.75 
(modified OS: 9 versus 12 months), using a stratified log -rank test with overall 1- sided 
significance level  of 0.025 (adjusted for interim analysis). 
Assuming enrolment over 16 months increasing to approximately 6 2 subjects per month and 
lost-to-follow- up rate of 5% across both treatment arms, the timing of the int erim analysis is 
expected to be at 24 months af ter the first subject treated and the timing of the final analysis 
is expected to be at 36.5  months after the first subject treated. 
If blinded projection of the accumulating OS events suggests th at the number required for 
the final analysis will not be reached (due to censoring) withi n 32 months of study initiation, 3URWRFRO$XJ_

the sample size may be increased up to 800 subjects or until pr especified events are met, 
whichever comes earlier. The projection to inform the decision to potentially increase the 
number of su bjects will be carried out within 3 months prior to expected completion of 
planned enrolment of 750  subjects. 
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The final analysis will be performed  using the intention to treat ( ITT) population. The OS for 
each treatment arm will be summarised by median survival time ( including 95% confidence 
intervals (CI)) from Kaplan -Meier estimation. The Kaplan- Meier curve for survival will be 
presented for each treatment arm. Stratified analyses based on the randomisation stratification 
factor s from the IWRS data will be used for treatment comparisons. Differences in the  OS 
curves will be tested using a stratified log -rank test. The estimated treatment effect for Arm 1 
will be summarised by the HR (including 95% CI) from stratified  Cox regression analysis. 
There are two planned analyses of OS: interim analysis and final analysis. The interim 
analysis is planned when at least 272  OS events (i.e. 50% information time) have been 
observed in the ITT population. If that analysis does not indic ate futility or efficacy, then the 
final analysis is planned at 543 OS events when 100% of the pla nned number of subjects 
have been enrol led. The overall type I error is controlled at 1- sided significance level of 0.025 
(adjusted for interim analysis). To control  type I and type II errors, the planned interim 
analysis will utilise Hwang -Shi-Decani (HSD) alpha and (non- binding) beta spending 
function with γ parameter equal to -4 for type I error type and γ equal to  -1 for type II error. 
If interim analysis does not  indicate futility or efficacy, the final analysis is planned when 
543 OS events are observed.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested no more than once. If the primary endpoint of 
OS is declared significant at the interim analysis, secondary e fficacy endpoints will be tested 
at the interim ; otherwise at the final analysis if OS is found to be statistically significant at 
that analysis. Hypothesis testing of secondary efficacy endpoin ts will be conducted in a 
stagewise hierarchical manner incorporating alpha spending for each endpoint using HSD 
γalpha= -4, similar to that specified for the primary efficacy analysis. The nominal level for the 
comparison will depend on whether the analysis is carried out a t the OS interim or at the 
planned OS final analysis.  
The first endpoint in the hierarchy of secondary endpoints will  be PFS. If OS and PFS are 
both significant, then ORR would be tested. Any parameter which  is not formally tested for 
significance (per the hierarchy) will be r egarded as descriptive and exploratory. 
Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. All safety data will be included 
in the subject data listings.  
Tabular summaries will present incidence by treatment arm for a ll treatme nt-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), SAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment discon tinuation, TEAEs leading 
to death, TEAEs related to study medications. All the safety da ta will be described by grade 
(all grades and Grade  3 and higher). All events will be summari sed by Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version  22.0 or later by system organ class and 
preferred term.  
Laboratory data will be presented by treatment arm. Abnormal la boratory values will be 
assessed using all available tests results and toxicity grading  will be assigned according to 
NCI CTCAE (Version  5.0) toxicity scale, where criteria are available to do so. Lab oratory, 
vital signs, and ECG data will be  summarised according to param eter type. 3URWRFRO$XJ_

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON  
1.1 Introduction  
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its variants account for over 90%  of pancreatic malignancies 
and is one of the most difficult to treat cancers [ NCCN  2020 , Lambert  2019 ]. Compared with 
most oth er cancers, pancreatic cancer is associated with a poor prognos is; it is one of the 
tumours with the least favourable outlook in terms of survival:  mortality from pancreatic cancer 
is almost identical to its incidence with a mortality to incide nce ratio of  0.94 [ Bray  2018 ]. 
Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed late in the natural histor y of the disease due to lack of 
screening tests, symptoms being largely nonspecific and not usu ally appearing until the disease 
has progresse d [Evans  2014 , Saftoiu  2020 , Henrikson  2019 ]. Owing to the lack of early 
symptoms and the aggressive nature of the disease, up to 80% of  patients with pancre atic 
adenocarcinoma receive a diagnosis at an advanced stage, by whi ch time the tumour is 
unresectable [ Martinez -Bosch  2018 , Lambert  2019 ]. 
Despite recent advances in the management of pancr eatic adenocarcinoma, poor survival rates 
continue, with a median overall survival (OS) of less than 1 ye ar and a 5 -year survival rate of 
0-11% depending upon the geographic location. However, for patien ts with metastatic disease 
who comprise the majority of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the time of diagn osis, 
the 5 -year survival is only 3% [ ACS  2020 , Rawla  2019 , Cancer statistics in Japan  2017 , 
Lambert  2019 ]. 
The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimated about 56,770 new ca ses of pancreatic cancer 
and about 45,750 deaths from pancreatic cancer in the United St ates (US) in 2019. Although 
pancreatic cancer constitutes only 3% of all new cases of cancers in the US, it is the fourth  
leading cause of cancer deaths, estimated that in 2019 it was r esponsible for 7% and 8% of all 
cancer -related mortalities in men and women respectively [ Siegel  2019 ]. Similar trends have 
been observed in the European Union (EU) - an estimated 90,700 deaths from pancreatic cancer 
have been predicted for 2019 making it the fourth leading cause  of cancer deaths and being 
responsible for 6.7% of all cancer -related m ortalities[ Malvezzi  2019 ]. Projections of the 
number of deaths from cancer indicate that pancreatic cancer wi ll become the second leading 
cause of cancer related mortality by the year 2030 [ Rahib  2014 ]. 
1.1.1 Pancreatic Cancer Treatment  
Gemcitabine monotherapy was the major first -line metastatic pancreatic cancer treatment 
proven to prolong OS over 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) [ Burris 1997 ], leading to the Food and Drug 
Administrat ion (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approvals in 1996 . Various 
gemcitabine -based combination therapies were then assessed with the aim of improving 
survival.  
Attempts to improve on gemcitabine single agent activity by com bining it with other avai lable 
chemotherapies have been largely unsuccessful [ Borazanci  2014, Teague  2015, Ko  2015 ]. Two 
combination chemotherapy regimens have emerged as new standards  of care for first -line 
treatment of metastatic pancreatic cance r: 
• 5-FU/leucovorin (LV)+irinotecan+oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and  
• nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine  
These demonstrate median OS of 11.1 months (PRODIGE study) and 8.5 months (MPACT), 
respectively, in separate phase III studies [ Conroy 2011, von Hoff 2013 ].  
Given the poor prognosis and the low median survival rates of l ess than one year for patients 
with metastatic disease, new treatment options are still needed . In addition, research into novel 
and predictive biomarkers is impor tant to manage this disease [ Ko 2015 ].  3URWRFRO$XJ_

Irinotecan liposome injection has been studied in a randomised,  phase III, international study 
(NAPOLI -1), in which the regimen of iri notecan liposome injection and 5 -FU/LV significan tly 
prolonged OS compared to 5 -FU/LV treatment alone in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients 
who had progressed following gemcitabine -based therapy [ Wang  Gillam  2016 ].  
Irinotecan liposome injection in combination with 5 -FU/LV was approved by the FDA, the 
EMA and other regulatory agencies worldwide for the treatment o f patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression follow ing gemcitabine -based 
therapy.  
Irinotecan liposome injection is also being studied in an ongoing phase II study to assess the 
safety, tolerability and efficacy in combination with oxaliplat in and 5 -FU/LV in subjects with 
unresectable, locally advanced and metastatic adenocarcinoma of  the pancreas who have not 
previously rec eived chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (preliminary resul ts in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and summarised in Section 1.3.2 ). 
The goal of the present study is to assess the efficacy and saf ety of irinotecan liposome injection, 
in combination with other a nticancer therapies (i.e. 5 -FU/LV and oxaliplatin) in subjects not 
previously treated for metastati c pancreatic cancer, compared  to a nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine 
control. Descriptions of the anticancer therapies to be used in  combination regimens in this 
study are briefly described below.  
1.1.1.1  Description of 5 -Fluorouracil and Leucovorin  
5-Fluorouracil is a pyrimidine antagonist that in terferes with nucleic acid biosynthesis. The 
deoxyribonucleotide of the drug inhibits thymidylate synthase, thus inhibiting the formation of 
thymidylic acid from deoxyuridylic acid, thus interfering in th e synthesis of deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA). It also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis and is used in  the treatment 
of carcinoma of the colon, rectum , breast, stomach and pancreas . 
Leucovorin acts as a biochemical cofactor for 1 -carbon transfer reactions in the synthesis of 
purines and pyrimid ines. Leucovorin does not require the enzyme dihydrofolate redu ctase 
(DHFR) for conversion to tetrahydrofolic acid. The effects of m ethotrexate and other 
DHFR -antagonists are inhibited by LV. Leucovorin can potentiate the cytotoxic effects of 
fluorinated p yrimidines (i.e., 5 -FU and floxuridine). After 5 -FU is activated within the cell, it 
is accompanied by a folate cofactor, and inhibits the enzyme th ymidylate synthase, thus 
inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis. Leucovorin increases the folat e pool, thereby incr easing the 
binding of folate cofactor and active 5 -FU with thymidylate synthase.  
1.1.1.2  Description of Oxaliplatin  
Oxaliplatin is a platinum -based drug that acts as a DNA cross -linking agent to effectively inhibit 
DNA replication and transcription, resulting in c ytotoxicity which is cell -cycle non -specific. 
Oxaliplatin is typically used in combination with infusional 5 -FU/LV and is approved for use 
in advanced colorectal cancer (refer to reference information for oxaliplatin  for mo re details).  
1.1.1.3  Description of Gemcitabine  
Gemcitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that exhibits a ntitumour activity and is 
approved for treatment of ovarian cancer in combination with ca rboplatin, breast cancer in 
combination with paclitaxel, non -small cell lung cancer in combinat ion with cisplatin, and for 
pancreatic cancer as a single -agent or in combination with nab -paclitaxel (refer to reference 
information for gemcitabine  for more details).  
Gemcitabine acts on cel ls undergoing DNA synthesis and blocks the progression of cells  
through the G1/S -phase boundary, which ultimately results in the initiation of a poptotic cell 
death.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

1.1.1.4  Description of Nab -paclitaxel  
Nab-paclitaxel (trade name Abraxane®) is an albumin -bound for m of paclitaxel, a microtubule 
inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubul in dimers and stabilises 
microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. Paclitaxel induces  abnormal arrays or “bundles” 
of microtubules throughout the cell cycle an d multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. 
The inhibition of normal microtubule network interferes with es sential interphase and cellular 
functions. It is approved for the treatment of metastatic breas t cancer, non -small cell lung cancer 
in combinat ion with carboplatin, and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in com bination with 
gemcitabine (refer to reference information for nab -paclitaxel  for more details).  
1.2 Irinotecan Liposome Injection  
Irinotecan liposome injection (als o known as Nal -IRI, BAX2398, PEP02, liposomal irinotecan 
and MM -398) is encapsulated in a nanoliposome drug delivery system. Th is is referred to as 
liposomal irinotecan in Europe and has tradename Onivyde® in the USA and Onivyde pegylate 
liposomal® in Euro pe. The active ingredient of the irinotecan liposome injection is a member 
of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class of drugs and is a semi -synthetic and water -soluble 
analogue of the naturally -occurring alkaloid, camptothecin. Topoisomerase I inhibitors wo rk to 
arrest uncontrolled cell growth by preventing the unwinding of DNA and therefore preventing 
replication. The pharmacology of i rinotecan is complex, with ex tensive metabolic conversions 
involved in the activation, inactivation, and elimination of th e drug [Garcia -Carbonero 2002, 
Vanhoefer 2001 , Drummond 2006 ]. Irinotecan is a pro -drug that is converted by nonspecific 
carboxylesterases into a 100 to 1000 -fold more active metabolite, SN -38 [Kang 2014 ]. SN -38 
is cleared via glucuronidation, (for which major pharmacogeneti c differences have been 
shown), and biliary excretion. These drug properties contribute  to the marked differences in 
efficacy and toxicity obs erved in clinical studies with irinotecan [ Kalra  2014, Tsai 2011 ]. 
Drug carrier technologies represent a rational strategy to impr ove the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
and biodistribution of irinotecan while protecting it from prem ature metabolism. Irinotecan 
liposome injection employs a nove l intraliposomal drug stabilis ation technology for 
encapsulation of irinotecan into long -circulating liposome -based nanoparticles with high drug 
load and high in vivo stability. The stable nanol iposome formulation of irinotecan has several 
attributes that may provide an improved therapeutic index.  The  controlled and sustained release 
should improve activity of this schedule -dependent drug by increasing duration of exposure of 
tumour tissue to dr ug, an attribute that allows it to be present in a higher propo rtion of cells 
during the more sensitive S -phase of the cell cycle. The improved PK, high intravascular dr ug 
retention in the liposomes and enhanced permeability and retent ion effect may potent ially result 
in site -specific drug delivery to solid tumours. Stromal targeting resu lts from the subsequent 
depot effect, where liposomes accumulating in tumour associated  macrophages release their 
payload, which is then converted locally to the substantia lly more cytotoxic SN -38. The 
preferentially local bioactivation should result in reduced exp osure to potential sites of toxicity 
and increased exposure to neighbouring cancer cells within the tumour.  
1.2.1 Irinotecan Liposome Injection Pre -Clinical Experience  
Irinotecan liposome injection has been shown in pre -clinical settings to have a broad spectrum 
of activity in a wide range of solid tumours including colon, p ancreatic, gastric, cervical, 
non-small cell lung, small cell lung, ovarian, thyroid, and breast cancers, as well as glioma, 
Ewing’s sarcoma, and neuroblastoma, often with a high degree of  anti-tumour activity against 
resistant or difficult to treat cancer models [ Drummond 2006, Kang 2014, Kalra  2014 ]. 
Irinotecan liposo me injection has also shown potent antitumour activity, includi ng durable 
tumour regressions, and was markedly superior to the equivalent  dose of free drug in a 
bioluminescent -based orthotopic xenograft pancreatic model [ Tsai 2011 ]. 3URWRFRO$XJ_

1.2.1.1  Irinotecan Liposome Injection Pre -Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
The PK properties of irinotecan li posome injection were evaluat ed in an HT -29 colon cancer 
subcutaneous xenograft model, as reported by [ Kalra 2014 ]. Bot h irinotecan and SN -38 were 
cleared very rapidly (within 8 hours) from the plasma following  non -liposomal irinotecan 
administration; however, irinot ecan liposome in jection clearanc e was demonstrated to be 
considerably slower and remained in circulation for  over 50 hours. SN -38 plasma exposure was 
also greater though maximum observed plasma drug concentration (Cmax) levels were reduced 
following irinotecan liposome in jection administration, suggest ing the advantage of the 
irinotecan liposomal formulation in prolonging exposure and half -life via the ability of the lipid 
bilayer to protect the conversion of prodrug CPT -11 to SN -38. Further, both irinotecan and 
SN-38 accumulated in tissues for extended time (at least 1 week af ter administration of 
irinotecan lip osome injection), yet there were relatively higher levels of pr olonged 
accumulation in the tumour compared to normal tissue, where the  metabolites are at very low 
levels after 48 hours ( Figure 1).  
Activation of irinotecan to SN -38 by the liver is the primary path for SN -38 tumoural 
accumulation when non -liposomal irinotecan is administered. In contrast, these data s uggest 
that accumulation of irinotecan liposome injec tion in the tumour and subsequent liposome 
breakdown and local conversion of irinotecan to SN -38 is responsible for the enhanced tumour 
exposure to SN -38 when irinotecan liposome injection is administered. These pr eclinical data 
demonstrating longer retent ion time in tumour lesions with irinotecan liposome injection 
administration compared to non -liposomal irinotecan administration formed the basis for 
clinical development.

Levels of SN -38 in various tissues following a single irinotecan liposome in jection (20 mg/kg) dose are shown. 
Prolonged accumulation of SN -38 (~168 h) seen in tumour compared to other organs (~48 h).  
 
1.2.2 Irinotecan Liposome Injection Clinical Experience  
Irinotecan liposome injection has been studied in subjects with  solid tumours, including cervical 
cancer, gastric cancer, pancreat ic cancer, and colorectal cance r. Disease areas currently being 
studied include glioma (intravenous (i.v.) and convection -enhanced local delivery), breast 
cancer and several paediatric solid tumours, including Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, 
neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Clinical studies of irinotecan 
liposome injection have been completed to date, with over 600 subje cts across multiple tumour 
types exposed to various dosing regimens, with other studies ac tively recruiting subjects across 
multiple tumour types (see IB).

1.2.2.1  Ongoing MM -398-07-02-03 Phase II Stu dy 
Study MM -398-07-02-03 ( , EudraCT Number: 2015 -003086 -28) is an 
ongoing open -label, phase II study to assess the safety, dose -limiting toxicities (Part 1A only), 
tolerability and efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection in c ombination with oxaliplatin and 
5 FU/LV in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced and metas tatic adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas who have not previously received chemotherapy in the m etastatic setting.  
Study MM -398-07-02-03 comprises a complete initial dose exp loration (Part  1A) followed by 
dose expansion (Part 1B: ongoing) of the irinotecan liposome in jection+oxaliplatin+5‑FU/LV 
regimen.  
Subjects were enrolled  in cohorts following a 3+3 dose escalation design in Part 1A, ( n=31), to 
select the dose level of the combination of oxaliplatin and ir inotecan liposome injection. 
Following four dose exploration cohorts (Part 1A), a recommende d dose (irinotecan liposome 
injection 50 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2, LV 400 mg/m2, 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 every 2 weeks - 
Cohort B) for expansion (Part 1B) was selected based on dose -limiting toxicities and 
cumulative safety. The expansion phase enrolled an additional 2 5 subjects at the selected dose 
level. A total of 56 patients have been enrolled and treate d in Parts 1A and 1B.  
An interim data analysis for safety and efficacy was performed with data cut -off 
19 February  2019 after all subjects in the dose -expansion cohort had completed the second 
scheduled tumour evaluation at 16 weeks.  
The pooled population  (n=32) included all subjects treated at the recommended dose fo r 
expansion (irinotecan liposome injection 50  mg/m2, oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2, LV 400 mg/m2, 
5-FU 2400  mg/m2 every 2  weeks - Cohort B of Part 1A n=7; Part 1B n=25). The best overall 
response in th e pooled analysis was complete response (CR) in one subject (di agnosed with 
locally advanced Stage III disease), partial response (PR) in 1 0 subjects, and stable disease (SD) 
in 15 patients (sum of CR+PR+SD: 81.3%), with an overall respon se rate (ORR) of 3 4%. 23 of 
32 patients (71.9%) achieved disease control at 16 weeks. At th e time of data cut -off, 15 of 
32 subjects in the pooled population analysis remained on treatmen t.  
For the 56 subjects treated, all (100.0%) had TEAEs. There were  nine TEAEs that wer e defined 
as dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) that were reported by five s ubjects across the four dose 
exploration cohorts (diarrhoea, n=2; vomiting, anal fissure, an al inflammation, proctalgia, 
neutropenic infection, neutropenic sepsis, and febrile neutrop enia, all n=1), including one 
subject treated in Part 1A Cohort B who was included in the poo led analysis (febrile 
neutropenia).  
Treatment -related TEAEs Grade 3 or higher were reported by 39 of 56 subje cts, including 
20 subjects from the pooled analysis of  32 subjects treated with iri notecan liposome injection 
50 mg/m2 + LV 400 mg/m2 + 5-FU 2400 mg/m2, and oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2. The TEAEs 
included: neutropenia, n=9; febrile neutropenia, hypokalaemia, both n=4; diarrhoea, nausea, 
both n=3; anaemia, vomiting, both n=2, with no reported Grade 3 or higher fatigue or periphe ral 
neuropathy.  
SAEs were reported by 31 of the 56 treated subjects, including 14 of the 32  subjects in the 
pooled analysis, with 23 subjects reporting treatment -related SAEs. In the pooled ana lysis, 10 
of the 32 subjects had treatment -related SAEs: nausea, febrile neutropenia, both n=3; diarrhoea,  
vomiting, both n=2; colitis, enterocolitis, stomatitis, anaemia , pneumonia, and pyrexia, all n=1. 
At the data cut -off there were no treatment -related  TEAEs leading to death.

1.2.2.2  Irinotecan Liposome Injection Safety in Humans  
Preliminary safety results for Study MM -398-07-02-03, where subjects with pancreatic cancer 
were given first line  treatment with irinotecan liposom e injection in a combination r egimen 
with 5 -FU/LV and oxaliplatin are presented in Section 1.2.2.1  and also in the IB.  
The NAPOLI -1 study was the pivotal study for obtaining marketing approval fo r the treatment 
of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas afte r disease progression following 
gemcitabine -based therapy with irinotecan li posome injection in a combinati on reg imen with 
5-FU/LV (i.e. no regimen in the NAPOLI -1 study included oxaliplatin). With respect to 
irinotecan liposome injection, when used in combination with 5 -FU and LV, the most common 
adverse reactions (≥20 %) observed in clinical trials considere d to be  related to the regimen are: 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, neutropenia, f atigue, anaemia, stomatitis and 
pyrexia. The overall safety profile of irinotecan liposome inje ction is presented in detail in the 
IB. Table  2 summarises ≥ Grade 3 safety data from the NAPOLI -1 trial comparing irinotecan 
liposome injection+5 -FU/LV (at a dose of 70  mg/m2 (FBE) given on an every 2  week schedule), 
or irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy (at a dose of 100  mg/m2 (FBE) given on an every 
3 week schedule), with 5 -FU/LV alone (given weekly for 4  weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest) 
in the same population of subjects  who had received prior gemcitabine therapy.

It has been shown in animal and human PK studies that once irin otecan is released from the 
irinotecan liposome injection liposomes, the conversion of irin otecan to SN -38 is similar to that 
of the unencapsulated irinotecan. The safety of irin otecan liposome injection, therefore, may be 
indirectly compared with the safety of non -liposomal irinotecan, primarily based on a 
qualitative comparison of adverse reactions, as reported in the  Camptosar® United States 
package insert (USPI) for irinotecan  [Camptosar® USPI 2016 ]. The comparison is qualitative, 
as both irinotecan and irinotecan liposome injection have been used in different doses and 3URWRFRO$XJ_

schedules as monotherapy and combination therapy with other che motherapeutic agents; 
therefore, quantitative comparisons are diffic ult. The most common adverse reactions of 
irinotecan and irinotecan liposome injection are similar and ar e mainly gastrointestinal events 
and myelosuppression.  
The common adverse reactions (>30%) observed in clinical studie s with irinotecan in 
combination  with other agents are: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrh oea, constipation, 
anorexia, mucositis, neutropenia, leukopenia (including lymphoc ytopenia), anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, asthenia, pain, fever, infection, abnormal bi lirubin, and alopecia. The 
common adverse reactions (>30%) observed in single agent irinot ecan therapy in clinical 
studies are: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, const ipation, anorexia, neutropenia, 
leukopenia (including lymphocytopenia), anaemia, asthenia, feve r, body we ight decreasing, 
and alopecia see Camptosar® USPI [ Camptosar® USPI 2016 ]. 
1.2.2.3  Irinotecan Liposome Injection Clinical Efficacy in Pancreatic Cancer  
Clinical efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection has been dem onstrated in 
gemc itabine -refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer subjects: in a randomis ed, phase III, 
international study (NAPOLI -1), in which irinotecan liposome injection was given as a 
monotherapy, or in combination with 5 -FU/LV, compared to the control arm of 5 -FU/LV alone 
[Wang -Gillam  2016 ]. The majority of subjects enrol led in this study had received prior 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (others received gemcita bine as neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
therapy). Approximately one half of  subjects were categorised as second -line, and 
approximately a third of subjects were post -second line in the metastatic setting. The irinotecan 
liposome injection+5 -FU/LV combination significantly prolonged OS compared to 5 -FU/LV 
treatment alone. The medi an OS for the irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV regimen arm 
was 6.1  months compared to 4.2  months for the 5 -FU/LV alone control arm with an unstratified 
hazard ratio (HR) of  0.67 (95%  confidence interval (CI): 0.49 to 0.92, p=0.012). The irinoteca n 
liposome injection monotherapy arm demonstrated a median OS of 4.9  months (compared to 
4.2 months in the control arm); although this was not a statistical ly significant difference, there 
was numerical improvement in overall response rate (ORR) and CA 19-9 resp onse, suggesting 
activity of irinotecan liposome injection alone. Further, in su bjects who received ≥80% of the 
protocol defined treatment during the first 6 weeks of treatmen t (the per protocol (PP) analysis), 
the irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV reg imen arm achieved a median OS of 8.9  months 
versus 5.1 months for the control arm (HR 0.57, 95%  CI: 0.36 to 0.88, p=0.0117). The ORR in 
the irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV regimen arm was 16% versus  1% on the control 
arm (p<0.001) [ Chen 2015 ]. The results from this study are very promising and provide 
motivation for testing irinotecan liposome injection in pancrea tic cancer patients not previously 
treated with gemcitabine.  
A more detailed description of the product is provided in Secti on 6.1. 
1.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
1.3.1 Risks  
1.3.1.1  Lack of Effic acy  
While there is a potential risk of lack of efficacy of irinotec an liposome injection, as this 
irinotecan formulation has not been studied in a phase III stud y in subjects with untreated 
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, it is considered to be lo w. Activity of non -liposomal 
irinotecan in this setting has been observed in the FOLFIRINOX clinical study [ Conroy  2011 ] 
and irinotecan liposome injection has demonstrated activity in this disease supported by the 
NAPOLI -1 trial [von Hoff  2014 ]. 3URWRFRO$XJ_

1.3.1.2  Safety Risks  
Irinotecan liposome injection in combination with 5 -FU/LV has been approved in 39  countries 
since 2015 for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenoc arcinoma of the pancreas after 
disease progression following gemcitabine -based therapy. The safety profile has been described 
in the IB and in labelling (e.g. the USPI).  
The results for 56 subjects treated in the ongoing phase II Stu dy MM-398-07-02-03 with the 
regimen irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+ 5 -FU/LV can be found in the IB and are 
summarised in Section 1.2.2.1 . As seen from these results, the overall safety risks for the 
combination regimen irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV are similar to those 
observed in the PRODIGE phase III study in pancreatic cancer [ Von Hoff  2013 ], which include 
neutropenia, hypokalaemia, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia and vomiting. No new safety signals 
were observed when compared to the Onivyde® USPI [ Onivyde® USPI  2017 ]. 
Caution should be exercised when using irinotecan liposome inje ction in subjects with body 
mass index <18.5  kg/m2. 
Specific safety risks for 5 -FU, LV and oxaliplatin, separately, in Arm 1 and nab -paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine in Arm 2, are described below.  
Potential Toxicities with 5 -Fluorouracil (Arm 1 only)  
Stomatitis and esophago -pharyngitis (which may lead to s loughing and ulceration), diarrhoea, 
anorexia, nausea, emesis and myelosuppression are commonly seen  with treatment; alopecia 
and dermatitis, in the form of pruritic rash usually appearing on the extremities, may also be 
seen (see the reference information for 5 -FU). Very common adverse events (AEs) (≥20%) that 
were observed with irinotecan liposome injection in combination  with 5 -FU/LV in clinical trials 
considered to be related were: diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, dec reased appetite, neutropenia, 
fatigue, anaemia, stomatitis and pyrexia.  
Part of the toxicities following treatment with 5 -FU may be related to deficiency in the activity 
of the main enzyme enabling elimination of 5 -FU, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). 
This deficiency can be low (around 3 to 8% of individuals) or absent  (between 0.01 and 0.5% 
of individuals).  
In March 2020, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Comm ittee (PRAC) has 
recommended that patients should be tested for deficiency of DP D before starting cancer 
treatment with 5 -FU. PRAC recommends that patients with a known complete DPD def iciency 
must not be given 5 -FU intravenously as a complete lack of working DPD puts them at  higher 
risk of severe and life -threatening side effects. In addition , for patients with a partial DPD 
deficiency, PRAC recommends a reduced starting dose of 5 -FU; since the effectiveness of a 
reduced dose has not been established, following doses may be i ncreased if there are no serious 
side effects [ PRAC Guidelines  2020 ]. 
Given the heterogeneity in clinical practice and lack of consen sus clinical guidelines for starting 
dose modifications, subjects with known low or absent DPD activ ity will be excluded from this 
study.  
Potential Toxicities with Oxaliplatin (Arm 1 only)  
The following AEs are relatively common (≥40%) with oxaliplatin  treatment in combination 
with 5 -FU/LV and are to be expected with the irinotecan liposome injec tion containing 
regimen: peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia , thrombocytopenia, anaemia, nausea, 
increases in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhoea,  fatigue, emesis, and stomatitis. 
In a phase  III study of the FOLFIRINOX regimen (5 -FU/LV+irinotecan+oxaliplatin), the most 
common (>5%) Grade 3 or 4 AEs we re: neutropenia, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
thrombocytopenia, sensory neuropathy, anaemia, elevated alanine  aminotransferase (ALT) 
level, thromboembolism, and febrile neutropenia [ Conroy 2011 ]. Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitiv ity 3URWRFRO$XJ_

reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been observed  in 2 to 3% of colon cancer 
patients receiving ox aliplatin. See Section 6.2.4  for guidelines on the management of infusion 
reactions. Additional AEs such as nausea, fever and injection s ite reaction, may be anticipated, 
as described in the reference information for oxaliplatin . There needs to be caution  if oxaliplatin 
is co -administered with other medicinal products known to cause QT in terval prolongation or 
rhabdomyolysis.  
Potential Toxicities with Nab -paclitaxel and Gemcitabine (Arm 2 only)  
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) for single agent gemcitabine are nausea/vomiting, 
anaemia, hepatic transaminitis, neutropenia, increased alkaline  phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, 
hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and peripheral oede ma. 
The following AEs are relatively common (≥20%) with nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine 
combination treatment: neutrope nia, fatigue, peripheral neuropa thy, nausea, alopecia, 
peripheral oedema, diarrhoea, pyrexia, vomiting, decreased appe tite, rash, and dehydration.  
Severe hypersensitivity reactions with fatal outcome h ave been reported with nab -paclitaxel 
treatment; see Section 6.2.4  for guidelines on the management of infusion reactions. Additio nal 
AEs may be ant icipated, as described in the reference information for  nab-paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine . 
Other Toxicities Requiring Special Attention  
For both treatment arms, QTc prolongation that occurs in the setting of diarrhoea induced 
electrolyte imbalance should be  treated with appropriate electr olyte repletion. Once the 
underlying abnormality is corrected and the electrocardiogram ( ECG) abnormalities have 
reversed, treatment may continue under careful monitoring and with appropriate dose 
modification for diarrhoea as described in Section 6.3.3.2 . 
Care of Intravenous Site:  
Care should be taken to avoid extravasation , and the infusion site should be monitored for signs 
of inflammation. Should extravasat ion occur, flushing the site with sterile saline and 
applications of ice ar e recommended, or as per institutional st andard of care.  
NAPOLI -1 Study Risk Assessment  
Safet y results from the NAPOLI -1 study, which was the pivotal study for obtaining marketing 
approval for second line treatment  of pancreatic cancer with ir inotecan liposome injection in a 
combination regimen with 5 -FU/LV, are summarised in Section  1.2.2.2  and the IB.  
Irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate is a known active substance , with a well -established safety 
profile. In the NAPOLI -1 study, most of the treatment -emergen t adverse events (TEAEs) in 
combination with 5 -FU/LV were manageable with supportive therapy, dose delays or b oth 
[Onivyde European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) ]. The following adverse reactions, 
considered to be possibl y or probably related to the administration of irinotecan lipos ome 
injection, were reported in 264  subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and 
listed in the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), 147  of whom received irinotecan 
lipos ome injection in monotherapy (100 mg/m2 FBE) and 117 subjects received irinotecan 
liposome injection (70  mg/m2 FBE) in combination with 5 -FU/LV. The most common adverse 
reactions (incidence ≥20%) with combination treatment were: dia rrhoea, nausea, vomiting, 
decreased appetite, neutropenia, fatigue, asthenia, anaemia, st omatitis and pyrexia. The most 
common serious  adverse reactions (≥2%) of irinotecan liposome injection therap y were 
diarrhoea, vomiting, febrile neutropenia, nausea, pyrexia, seps is, dehydration, septic shock, 
pneumonia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The EPAR states that ‘no unexpected 
safety findings emerged so far from the liposomal irinotecan dev elopment program to challenge 
what is previously known from standard irinotecan’.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

The EU Risk Management Plan lists potential risks (embryotoxici ty or teratogenicity, 
hypersensitivity reactions, medication errors related to drug/dose confusion wit h non -liposomal 
irinotecan and interstitial lung disease) as well as missing in formation (use in patients with 
hepatic impairment and patients with renal impairment) [ Onivyde EPAR 2016 ]. Subjects with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pa ncreas, who will receive iri notecan liposome injection in 
this study might be exposed to the same potential safety risks.  These are listed in the irinotecan 
liposome injection IB a nd considered or mitigated in the different sections of the stu dy protocol, 
e.g. exclusion criteria (Section  4.2), description of study medications including investi gational 
medicinal products (IMPs) (Section  6.2) and use of concomitant therapies (Section  6.3). 
1.3.2 Benefits  
Based on current clinical experience, it is considered that iri notecan liposome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV represents a novel therapeutic approach for first -line treatment 
of patients w ith metastatic pancreatic cancer, which is currently a high unm et clinical need. By 
adding oxaliplatin to irinotecan liposome injection and 5 -FU/LV the potential to increase DNA 
damage and potentiate efficacy exists. In addition, due to the prolonged PK pr operties of 
irinotecan liposome injection and sustained tumour exposure, it  is thought that using irinotecan 
liposome injection instead of conventional irinotecan would imp rove upon the efficacy and 
tolerability of the standard FOLFIRINOX regimen. Building  on prior experience from the 
standard FOLFIRINOX regimen, the objective is to demonstrate a 3-month improvement in OS 
versus the approved regimen of gemcitabine+nab -paclitaxel.  
The IB gives efficacy (and safety) results from the ongoing pha se II Study  MM-398-07-02-03, 
during which subjects received first -line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer with 
irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV. Overall 56 subjects were enrolled and 
treated, and as of data cut off 32 subjects had been treated ( in both parts of the study) at the 
selected dose level (see Section  1.2.2.1 ).The best overall response (BOR) in the pooled analysis 
for 32  subjects treated with irino tecan liposome injection 50  mg/m2 + oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2+ 
5-FU/LV 2400/400 mg/m2 was: complete response in one subject (diagnosed with locally 
advanced Stage III disease), partial response in 10 subjects, a nd stable disease in 15  subjects 
(sum of complete response +partial response +stable disease: 81.3%), with an ORR  of 34%.  
1.4 Selection of Investigational Medicinal Products and Dosages  
The rationale for the proposed combination regimen is based on the clinical results of 
Study  MM-398-07-02-03. This study inc luded an initial dose exploration (Part 1A) followed 
by dose expansion (Part 1B) of the irinotecan liposome injectio n+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV 
regimen as detailed in Section 1.2.2.1 . This preliminary safety analysis provides reassurance 
that the safety profile of each of the drugs is in line with th e expected safety profile of each of 
the drugs within the regimen and can be administered to subject s with pancreatic cancer.  
The proposed study design regimen for Arm 1 includes irinotecan  liposome injection at a dose 
of 50 mg/m2 (FBE), the recommended starting dose for subjects homozygous fo r the 
UGT1A1*28 allele; hence, there is no reason to suggest a differ ent starting dose f or subjects 
homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. As part of this study, pha rmacogenomic data will be 
collected on all subjects for determination of UGT1A1*28 status  at baseline. As per the 
scheduled assessments, all subjects will be monitored closely f or haematological toxicities, with 
specific guidance for full blood count thresholds prior to dosi ng and dose modifications for 
haematological toxicities, which will also be monitored and eva luated by the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC) (see Secti on 11.6 for information about the IDMC).  
Nab-paclitaxel (tradename: Abraxane®) in combination with gemcitabine has been chosen as 
the control arm based on its approval in the US, in the EU and in other territories for firs t-line 
treatment of patients with meta static adenocarcinoma of the pan creas, its robust OS benefit 3URWRFRO$XJ_

perform ance status 0 or 1, which is similar to Karnofsky Performance S tatus  ≥70, 
[Oken  1982 ]), on its inclusion in clinical practice guidelines and on its  widespread clinical use 
in this disease setting.  
• An OS benefit was demonst rated in this patient population in the registration study for 
nab-paclitaxel (the MPACT study). The median OS was 8.5 months in t he 
gemcitabine+nab -paclitaxel arm compared with 6.7 months in the gemcitabine arm 
(HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.83, p<0.001). [ von Hoff 2013 ] 
• The administration of nab -paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine is recommended 
by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [ NCCN Guidelines Pancreatic 
Adenocarcinoma , Version  1.0 2020 ] and European Society for Medical Oncology 
(ESMO) Clinical Prac tice Guidelines [ Ducreux 2015  with 2019 update ] as a category  1

• There is widespread clinical use of nab -paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine in 
this disease setting. [ Abrams 2017 ].  
Further details on administrati on procedures and dosage are pro vided in Section  6.2. 
1.5 Population to be Studied  
The study will enrol adult subjects with metastatic adenocarcin oma of the pancreas who have 
not previously received chemotherapy. Because subjects will be randomised to either of the two 
arms, the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Sections 4.1 and 4.2) reflect contraindications and 
restrictions for both regimens.  
Similar to the population included in the MPACT study of first -line treatment of subjects with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pa ncreas, subjects will be enrol led with ECOG performance 
status 0 or 1 (similar to Karnofsky performance status ≥70 [ von Hoff 2013 ]). Table  3 
summarises the Karnofsky performance status of subjects at base line in the MPACT study.

2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  AND STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
2.1 Purpose of the Study  
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the regimen of irinotecan liposome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV versus nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine in improving OS in 
subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who hav e not previously received 
chemotherapy.  
Nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine has been selected as the comparator arm treatment, as it is FDA 
and EMA approved and widely used regimen for first -line treatment of a well characterised and 
identifiable population of adult p atients with metastatic ade nocarcinoma of the pancreas.  
2.1.1 Study Rationale  
Given the limited options for patients, the overall poor progno sis and the low median survival 
rates of less than one year for patients with metastatic diseas e, development of new trea tments 
is still a necessity. In addition, research into novel and pred ictive biomarkers is important to 
manage this disease [ Ko 2015, Garrido -Laguna  2015 ]. 
2.1.1.1  Unmet Clinical Need  
Pancreatic cancer is associated with an extreme ly poor prognosis for several reasons. It is 
usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, which is often due to p resentation with non -specific or 
no symptoms, a lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers, and d ifficulties in imaging early stage 
disease. Pancreat ic cancer is also very aggressive, with perineural and vascular  early growth 
and early distant metastases which preclude curative surgery in  most cases. It is also 
characterised by a remarkable resistance to most conventional t reatment options, including 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecularly targeted therapy. Fin ally, pancreatic cancer 
harbours multiple genetic and epig enetic alterations and have d ense tumour microenvironments 
shown to impede drug delivery. Despite some incremental progres s in areas of  research and 
patient care, the overall effect on the prognosis of patients w ith advanced pancreatic cancer has 
been marginal and these factors result in low observed OS rates . Thus, the development of 
improved systemic treatments remains a top priority fo r pancreatic cancer.  
During the last two decades since gemcitabine approval, two gem citabine combination 
regimens emerged as FDA approved therapies for first -line treatment of metastatic pancreatic 
cancer: nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine, and erlotinib+gemcita bine. Erlotinib+gemcitabine was not 
chosen for the control arm due to modest improvements in the OS  and limited clinical use in 
the disease setting. The median OS in the gemcitabine+erlotinib  arm was 6.4  months compared 
with 6.0  months in the gemcitabine+p lacebo arm (HR  0.81, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.97, p=0.028). 
[Erlotinib 2010 ].  
Since the approval of gemcitabine in 1997, no phase III trial i n advanced/metastatic disease had 
demonstrated a clinically and statistically significan t improvement in OS over gemcitabine 
monotherapy until recently. The t reatment landscape for metasta tic disease has evolved to 
include two key regimens: irinotecan, oxaliplatin and 5 -FU/LV (FOLFIRINOX) and 
nanoparticle albumin -bound paclitaxel (nab -paclita xel) plus gemcitabine. [ von Hoff  2013, 
Conroy 2011 ] The nab -paclitaxel plus gemcitabine regimen is the only FDA and EMA 
approved regimen for this patient population. Currently, the NC CN [ NCCN Clinical Guidelines 
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, Version 1.0 2020 ] and ESMO [ Ducreux 2015  with 2019 update ] 
recommend treatment with FOLFIRINOX or nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine as standards of care 
for patients with metastati c pancreatic cancer. Age, performance status and other clinical  factors 
are considered when deciding which regimen is appropriate. Gemc itabine monotherapy is 
currently reserved for patients who are not eligible to receive  combination chemotherapy.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

2.1.1.2  Targetin g a Validated Target: Topoisomerase I  
Irinotecan is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I (T OP 1) inhibitor class. DNA 
topoisomerases are a class of enzymes involved in the regulatio n of DNA supercoiling. Type  I 
topoisomerases change the degree o f supercoiling of DNA by causing single -strand breaks and 
relegation. Inhibition of TOP I stabilises the complex between TOP I and DNA which collides 
with moving DNA replication forks, eventually leading to double  stranded DNA damage and 
ultimately cell de ath. It is a well -established fact that increased cytotoxicity of TOP I inhibitor s 
is associated with sustained exposure.  
TOP I is a validated drug target in metastatic adenocarcinoma o f the pancreas. Irinotecan and 
irinotecan liposome injections are both  referred to in guidelines for the treatment of metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas as per the FOLFIRINOX regimen me ntioned above for 
irinotecan and as part of a combination with 5 -FU/LV for irinotecan liposome injection. 
Irinotecan and its active me tabolite SN -38 bind to the TOP I - DNA complex and prevent 
relegation of the single -strand breaks. Liposomal delivery of irinotecan provides a mech anism 
for sustained inhibition of TOP  I and prolong the duration of active therapy at the site of tum our 
cells to inhibit tumour growth.  
2.1.1.3  Clinical Data Generated in Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Irinotecan 
Liposome Injection  
Clinical efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection has been dem onstrated in 
gemcitabine -refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer patients: in a randomised, phase  III, 
international study (NAPOLI -1), irinotecan liposome injecti on was given as a monotherapy, o r 
in combination with 5 -FU/LV, compared to the control arm of 5 -FU/LV alone 
[Wang -Gillam  2016 ]. The majority of subjects enrolled in this study had received prior 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (others received gemcita bine as neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
therapy). Approximately half of subjects were categorised as se cond -line, and approximately 
one third of subjects were post -second line in the metastatic sett ing. The irinotecan liposome 
injection+5 -FU/LV regimen significantly prolonged OS compared to 5 -FU/LV treatment alone. 
The median OS for the irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV regimen arm  was 6.1 months 
compared to 4.2 months for the 5 -FU/LV alone control arm with an unstratified HR of 0.67 
(95% CI: 0.49 to 0.92, p=0.012). The irinotecan liposome inject ion monotherapy arm 
demonstrated a median OS of 4.9 months (compared to 4.2 months in the control arm); although 
this was not a statistically significant difference, there was numerical improvement in ORR and 
CA19 -9 response, suggesting activity of irinotecan liposome injectio n alone. Further, in 
subjects who received ≥80% of the protocol def ined treatment during the first 6  weeks of 
treatment (the per protocol ana lysis), the irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV regimen arm 
achieved a median OS of 8.9 months versus 5.1 months for the co ntrol arm (HR 0.57, 95% CI: 
0.36 to 0.88, p=0.0117). The ORR in the irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV regimen arm 
was 16% versus 1% on the control arm (p <0.001). The results fr om this study were very 
promising and provide motivation for testing irinotecan liposom e injection in pancreatic cancer 
patients not  previously treated with gemcitabine.  
2.1.1.4  Irinotecan+5 -FU/LV+Oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)  
The regimen of 5 -FU/LV+irinotecan+oxaliplatin (the FOLFIRINOX regimen) has been studied 
in multiple clinical trials. As mentioned previously, FOLFIRINO X has become a standa rd of 
care regimen for patients with good performance status based on  the results of a single phase  III 
trial conducted in France with 342 subjects showing median OS o f 11.1  months 
versus  6.8 months for the gemcitabine alone control arm (HR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.73, 
p<0.001) [ Conroy 2011 ]. The FOLFIRINOX regimen has been recommended by the NCCN 
and ESMO as a preferred option for first -line metastatic disease since 2011 [ NCCN  2020 , 
Ducreux  2015 with 2019 update ]. 3URWRFRO$XJ_

In the current study, a modified FOLFIRINOX regimen will evalua te irinotecan liposome 
injection instead of conventional irinotecan, in order to impro ve the safety, tolerability and 
ultimately efficac y of the original FOLFIRINOX regimen. With irinotecan liposome injection 
dosing, the C max of SN -38 is predicted to be lower than would be expected for standard  dosing 
with non -liposomal irinotecan. Additionally, in a small phase II study i n colorectal canc er, data 
suggest that irinotecan  liposome injection+5 -FU/LV may have less toxicity than non -liposomal 
irinotecan+5 -FU/LV (the FOLFIRI regimen) [ Chibaudel 2016 ]. Therefore, toxicity of the 
irinotecan liposome injection -containing triplet regimen is not expected to be greater than t hat 
seen with FOLFIRINOX.  
In humans, the standard dose regimen of FOLFIRINOX which demons trated efficacy is 
85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 180 mg/m2 irinotecan (non -liposomal), LV infusion 400  mg/m2 followed 
by 5-FU at a dose of 400  mg/m2 administered by i.v. bolus followed by a continuous infusion 
of 2400 mg/m2 [Conroy 2011 ]. Yet due to toxicity, modified FOLFIRINOX regimens are often 
used (e.g.  elimination of the 5 -FU bolus) with unknown effects on the efficacy and safety of 
modified schedules [ Ducreux 2015 ]. In the current study, a modified triplet regimen is 
proposed, whereby no bolus of 5 -FU will be administered. The doses of  oxaliplatin and 
irinotecan liposome injection de termined from the phase II comb ination regimens will be 
combined with the standard continuous infusion dose of 5 -FU (excluding the bolus)/LV.  
In the current study, the nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine regimen wil l be compared to a regimen 
containing irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -F U / L V .  W h i l e  m a n y  
gemcitabine -based combination regimens have been tested in clinical trials,  nab-paclitaxel plus 
gemcitabine is the only approved standard of care regimen th at offers significant benefit for 
first-line treatment of metastatic pa ncreatic cancer. The nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine regimen is 
a preferred first -line treatment option according to the NCCN recommendations and  ESMO 
Clinical Practice Guidelines [ NCCN 2020, Ducreux 2015  with 2019 update ]. In a phase  III, 
international study of 861 subjects (MPACT trial), nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine demonstrated a 
median OS of 8.5  months versus 6.7 months for gemcitabine alone (HR 0.72, 95% CI : 0.62 to 
0.83, p; <0.001) [ von Hoff 2013 ]. While nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine is generally thought to be 
more tolerable than FOLFIRINOX, this regimen is associated with  neuropathy and neutropenia, 
and has not been compared d irectly with FOLFIRINOX ( Table  4) including the modified triplet 
regimen which substitutes irinotecan liposome injection instead  of irinotecan.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

2.1.1.5  Clinical Data for the CA19 -9 Biomarker  
Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19 -9), is a prognostic tumour marker used to detect and monitor 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas [ Reni 2009, Chan 201 4].  
During the MPACT study, A total of 379 subjects i n the nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine group and 
371 subjects in the gemcitabine group had a baseline CA19 -9 measurement [ von Hoff 2013 ]. 
A total of 61% of the subjects in the nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine group, as compared with 44 % 
of those in the gemcitabine group, had a decrease from baseline  of at least 20% (p<0.001), and 
31% versus 14% had a decrease of at least 90% (p<0.001). Subjec ts in the two treatment groups 
who had a decrease of at least 90% in the CA19 -9 level had a medi an survival of 13.5  months, 
as compared with 8.2 months among those with a decrease of less  than 90% (HR for death, 
0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.67; p<0.001). A higher percentage of su bjects in the 
nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine group than in the gemcitabine group had a reduction of at least 90% 
in the CA19 -9 level.  
During the NAPOLI -I study, serial imaging studies and assessment of CA19 -9 were undertaken 
at baseline and every 6  weeks until either disease progression, a new antineoplastic tr eatment 
was started, or w ithdrawal of consent [ Wang -Gillam  2016 ]. There were 28 (29%) of 97  subjects 
allocated nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5 -F U /L V  w h o  a c h i e v e d  a  C A 19 -9 response (≥50% 
decrease from abnormal baseline) versus seven (9%) of 81  assig ned 5 -FU/LV (p=0.0006).  
2.1.1.6  Clinical Data in UGT1A1*28 Homozygous Patients  
Human uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1 A1 is the enzyme that 
detoxifies neurotoxic bilirubin by conjugating it with glucuron ic acid. Human UGT1A1 plays 
a critica l role in the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and ex ogenous lipophilic 
compounds mainly in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. UGT1A 1 is responsible for the 
glucuronidation of SN -38 to SN -38G as part of the mechanism of SN -38 clearance. Variat ion 
in TA -repeat length of a critical TATA box in the UGT1A1 promoter sig nificantly contributes 
to enzyme activity with longer TA -repeat lengths showing lower expression than the wild -type. 
UGT1A1*28 (TA7) 7/7 homozygosity results in reduced UGT enzymat ic activity and may 
result in elevated SN -38 levels and thereby contribute to increased SN -38 mediated toxicity 
following treatment with non -liposomal irinotecan.  
Multiple studies have evaluated the association between UGT1A1* 28 7/7 homozygosity, 
SN-38 conce ntration and safety in patients treated with non -liposomal irinotecan and suggest 3URWRFRO$XJ_

the associations are dose -dependent. Much higher SN -38 concentrations were observed for 
UGT1A1*28 6/7 and 7/7 (compared to 6/6) when irinotecan was adm inistered at a high dos e 
of 300 mg/m2 than when it was administered at a low dose of 15 to 75 mg/m2 daily for 5 days 
for 2 consecutive weeks (41 to 159% versus 10  to 40%, respectively) [ Iyer 2002,  Stewart 2007 ]. 
In a study of 66 subjects who received single -agent non -liposomal irinotecan (350 mg/m2 every 
3 weeks), the incidence of Grade  4 neutropenia in subjects heterozygous (UGT1A1*28 6/7) and 
homozygous (7/7) for the UGT1A1*28 was 12.5% and up to 50% resp ectively  [Camptosar® 
USPI 2016 ]. In a subsequent study, association between UGT1A1*28 homozyg osity and 
haematological toxicity was observed only in subjects treated w ith >150 mg/m2 non-liposomal 
irinotecan. By contrast, at lower do se of non -liposomal irinotecan (100 to 125 mg/m2 every 
week) similar haematological toxicities were observed for both homozygous and 
non-homozygous subjects [ Hoskins 2007 ]. However, more recent publications from 
prospective  trials studying the FOLFIRI regimen (irinotecan dose of 180  mg/m2) and the role 
of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism in toxicity and efficacy further sugg est that the data are 
insufficient for recommending different dose adjustments in UGT 1A1*28  homozygous patients 
[Toffoli 2006 ]. 
In patients treated with irinotecan liposome injection, the ass ociation between 
UGT1A1*28  homozygosity, SN -38, and haematologic toxicity is primarily obtained from 
study NAPOLI -1, where UGT1A1*28 homozygous subjects were treated at reduced dose 
(50 versus 70  mg/m2 (FBE) every 2 weeks in combination with 5 -FU/LV, or 70 versus 
100 mg/m2 (FBE) every 3 weeks monotherapy). The NAPOLI -1 study Population PK results 
are described in the IB and together with safety da ta confirms that the predicted Grade 3 or 
higher neutropenia was also similar if treated at 70  mg/m2 (FBE) monotherapy (8.7% versus. 
7.4%, respectively), or if treated at 100  mg/m2 (FBE) monotherapy (15% versus 13%, 
respectively). An additional Population PK study presented in the IB showed that overall 
exposure to SN -38 was deemed similar between Japanese and non -Japanese populations with 
unrecognisable influence of UGT1A genotypes. Additionally, in a  phase  I study (UCSF 8103), 
no differences in toxicity w ere seen in cohorts of UGT1A1*28 6/7 (n=18) or 6/6 (n=16) 
subjects, and similar rates of dos e limiting toxicities were se en in both cohorts. Based on these 
data, patients homozygous for UGT1A1*28, administered with the same dose of irinotecan 
liposome inje ction administration as non -homozygous patients, do not appear to be at 
significant clinical risk of increased Grade 3 or higher neutro penia.  
Mechanistically, these data indicate that the association of UG T1A1*28 polymorphism to 
SN-38 concentration and to haematological toxicity appear to depend on the incoming load o f 
SN-38 to be metabolised by UGT enzymes. The dose -dependent association of UGT1A1*28 
and SN -38 or neutropenia observed with non -liposomal irinotecan administration is consistent 
with this hypo thesis. Furthermore, liposomal encapsulation appears to spread out the incoming 
load of SN -38 by controlling the release of irinotecan. This is supported by a study in subjects 
with advanced gastric cancer in which 100 mg/m2 irinotecan liposome injection a dministration 
resulted in five times lower plasma SN -38 C max as compared to 300 mg/m2 non-liposomal 
irinotecan (PEP0206) [ Roy 2013 ]. Reduced load of SN -38 may allow for metabolism by 
UGT  enzymes even in patients with reduce d UGT enzyme activities (for example, 
UGT1A1*28  homozygous patients).  
Despite the lack of associations between UGT1A1*28 homozygosity , safety, and PK, the 
irinotecan liposome injection USPI [ Onivyde® USPI 2017 ] followed the  NAPOLI -1 protocol 
that started homozygous patients at a lower dose due to the com paratively small number of 
patients with UGT1A1*28 homozygous treated with irinotecan lipo some injection. Therefore, 
the absence of a relationship between UGT1A1*28 homozygos ity and increased SN -38 
exposure or toxicity following i rinotecan liposom e injection ad ministration warrants further 
study. In this study, the starting dose of irinotecan liposome injection will be the same 3URWRFRO$XJ_

a safety biomarker to further analyse the association between UGT1A1*28 homozygosity, 
SN-38 concentration and toxicity. Iri notecan liposome injection do se reduction will follow the 
same dose reduction rules for all subjects  regardless of UGT1A1*28 genotype. Regular safety 
monitoring of subjects will be conducted by the sponsor medical  monitor(s) and by the IDMC 
during the study. The safety and any available PK of UGT1A1*28 homozygous subjects will 
be compared to thos e who are non -homozygous for UGT1A1*28 to determine whether any 
different dosing strategy (such as a lower starting dose and/or  different dose reduction for 
irinotecan liposome injection) is required for subjects who are  homozygous.  
2.2 Study Objectives  
The pr imary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the  regimen of irinotecan

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 General Design and Study Schema  
This is an open -label, randomised, multicentre, phase III study to evaluate the  efficacy and 
safety of the irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV combination regimen versus 
nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine in adult subjects with metastatic adenoc arcinoma of the pancreas. 
After informed consent is obtaine d and subjects have been succe ssfully screened, subjects will 
be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment regimens:  
• Arm 1: irinotecan liposom e injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV  
• Arm 2: nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine.  
Approximately 750 subjects are planned to be randomised (1:1 ap proximately 375 subjects per 
arm).  
Subjects will be stratified according to:  
• ECOG performance status (0/1)  
• Region (North America/East  Asia/Rest of the World)  
• Liver metastases (Yes/No).  
Dose adjustment is permitt ed as described in Section 3.6. 
An IDMC will be established for this study to operate as an ind ependent expert advisory group 
with the responsibility of evaluating cumulative safety and oth er clinical trial data at regular 
intervals (see Section 11.6).

3.2 Primary and Secondary Endpoints and Evaluations  
3.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Eva luations  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the OS of subjects treated wit h irinotecan liposome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV compared to subjects treated with nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine.  
Survival will be defined, in the standard way for OS evaluation , as time from the date of 
randomisation to the date of death (any cause). Subjects who do  not have a date of death 
recorded at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the last known  time that the subject 
was alive.  
3.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint and Evaluations  
3.2.2.1  Tumour Assessments  
Tumour assessments are obtained by imaging, as described in Sec tion 5.4.

Tumour response will be evaluated according to the Response Eva luation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours (RECIST) Version 1.1 [ Eisenhauer 2009 ], to establish disease progression by 
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if the subject is alle rgic to 
CT contrast media. In addition, other imaging procedures, as de emed appropriate by the 
investigator, will be performed to assess sites of neoplastic i nvolvement. The same method of 
assessment for each lesion must be used throughout the study. Inves tigators should select target 
and non -target lesions in accordance with RECIST Version 1.1 guidelines . Follow -up 
measurements and overall response should also be in accordance with these guidel ines. 
Tumour assessments should be completed until it has been determ ined that the subject has 
progressive disease (in accordance with RECIST Version  1.1). For subjects who do not have 
documented disease progression per RECIST Version 1.1 at the ti me of tr eatment termination, 
imaging studies should continue to be performed into the follow -up period every 8 weeks until 
radiological disease progression is documented or until the sta rt of another anti -cancer 
treatment, whichever comes first. Continued imaging follow -up on schedule is recommended 
to reduce potential bias in the evaluation of the impact of the  experimental treatments on disease 
[Fleming  2009 ]. 
The PFS is the time from randomisation to the first documented objectiv e disease progression 
using RECIST Version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever o ccurs first. Determination of 
PFS will be per investigator assessment.  
The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a BOR cha racterised as either a complete 
respo nse or partial response. BOR is defined as the best response as  recorded from 
randomisation until documented objective disease progression us ing RECIST Version 1.1. To 
classify BOR as stable disease, there should be a qualifying st able disease assessment a t least 
8 weeks after randomisation. ORR of irinotecan liposome injection +oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV arm 
will be compared to the nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine arm. Differences in ORR between Arm 1 
and Arm  2 will be provided with 95% CIs and compared using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
test, adjusting by randomisation strata.  
3.2.3 Safety Endpoints and Evaluations  
3.2.3.1  Safety Assessments  
Safety will be monitored through continuous reporting of AEs an d serious adverse events 
(SAEs), laboratory abnormalities, incidence of subjects ex periencing dose modifications 
(including infusion interruptions, dose omissions and dose dela ys) and/or premature 
discontinuation of study medication (and reason for discontinua tion).  
These safety evaluations will be performed from ICF signature, throughou t the study to 30  days 
after the last study treatment administration (see Table  5). 
3.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
3.3.1 Patient -Reported Outcomes  
The PRO exploratory endpoints are as follows:  
• Assess time to deterioration or worsening of subjects physical functioning, disease 
related symptoms and treatment related symptoms of interest usi ng the European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality -of-life-core questionna ire 
(EORTC -QLQ -C30) and specific pancreatic cancer module (QLQ -PAN26) 
questionnaire and PRO of Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse  Events (CTCAE)  
• Assess time to deterioration or worsening on remaining quality of life (QoL) subscales 
of QLQ -C30 and QLQ -PAN26  
• Compare % of subjects with stable, improved or worsened QoL sco res as assessed by

• Summarise HRQoL score at each visit as assessed by QLQ -C30, QLQ -PAN26, 
PRO -CTCAE and EQ -5D-5L. 
3.3.2 Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic s (PK), and the relationship between PK exposure and efficacy a nd safety, 
of the regimen of irinotecan l iposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV (Arm 1) in this patient 
population will be evaluated.  
3.3.3 Time to Treatment Failure  
The time to treatment failure (TTF ) between treatment arms will be compared. The TTF is 
defined as the time from randomisation to treatment discontinua tion for any reason, including 
disease progression, treatment toxicity, subject preference, or  death.  
3.3.4 Duration of Response  
Duration of resp onse (DOR) is defined as the time of initial response (complete  response or 
partial response) until documented tumour progression using REC IST guidelines Version 1.1 
or death. For subjects who do not have documented tumour progre ssion or death, DOR will be  
censored at the time of the last evaluable tumour assessment.  
3.3.5 Time to Response  
Time to response (TTR) will be computed only for subjects who a chieved complete response 
or partial response . The TTR is the time from randomisation to the first objective  t u m our 
response.  
3.3.6 Genotyping: UGT1A1 and SN -38 
The possible association between genotypes to include but not l imited to UGT1A1*28 and other 
UGT1A  genotypes, SN -38 concentration (only for subjects treated with irinotecan lip osome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV)  and safety will be described.  
3.3.7 Biomarkers CA 19 -9 
The biomarker CA 19 -9 will be measured and concentrations compared between treatmen t 
arms.  
3.3.8 Biobanking  
The exploratory endpoint comprises biobanking of samples for fu ture analysis, among subjects 
who conse nt. Analysis of biobank samples will be performed outside the scope  of the main 
study and reported separately.  
Instructions for collection, processing, handling and shipment of the biobanking samples will 
be outlined in the laboratory manual.  
3.3.9 Gene Mutation s and Genomic Alterations  
The exploratory endpoint comprises of collection of gene mutati on and genomic alteration 
status associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the subject s, determined prior to screening 
where available. Several genes are associated  with an increased risk of developing PDAC. 
Those of key interest include:  
• Germline mutations and genomic alterations: BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 , ATM, 
CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, TP53 and EPCAM [ Rainone 2020 ]. 
• Somatic mutations and genomic alterations: KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, RNF43, 
ARID1A, TGFβR2, GNAS, RREB1 and PBRM1 [ Raphael  2017 ]. 
Gene mutations and genomic alteration may be used for explorati on of potential predictive 
biomarkers and correlation with clinical outcome; the results m ay be reported separately.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

3.4 Randomisation and Blinding  
This is an open -label study and there is no blin ding.  
The sponsor’s randomisation manager or a designee, who is a sta tistician independent from the 
study, will prepare a list of randomisation numbers. It will be  produced in blocks, on a balanced 
ratio [1:1] and will be stratified according to:  
• ECOG perf ormance status (0/1)  
• Region (North America/East  Asia/Rest of the World)  
• Liver metastases (Yes/No).  
The randomisation and treatment arm assignation will be managed  by interactive web response 
system (IWRS ). After eligibility is confirmed, at Day 1 of Cycle 1 (or within 4  days prior to 
Cycle 1 Day 1 where required by local procedures) subjects will  be assigned a randomisation 
number and to the associated treat ment arm, in sequential order  at each centre and within each 
level of strata.  
The quantity of treatme nt kits will be also allocated by I WRS  each time drug is dispensed, 
according to the allocated treatment group and subject body sur face area (BSA). The I WRS  
will also manage all the logistical aspects of treatments (e.g.  drug supplies, replacement of lost,  
damaged, quarantined, expiring and expired kits).  
This service provides investigators, site co -ordinators and project team members with a 24 -hour 
per day, 7 -day per week service. In case of medical or technical randomisa tion or dispensation 
queries, a 24 -hour helpline is available. See supporting information in the I WRS  reference 
manual.  
The investigator will under no circumstances change the randomi sation number or the treatment 
group allocated to the subject. Recruitment will stop once appr oximately 750  subjects (or up to 
800 subjects in the circumstance that over enrolment is necessary t o meet 543  OS events, due 
to heavy censoring) have been randomised (see Section  11.2). However, subjects in screening 
at that time will be allowed to proceed in the study if they ar e eligible for entry, and subject 
data will be used in the analysis.  
Randomised subjects who terminate their study participation for  any reason before 
administration of the first dose of randomised study medication wi ll retain their randomisation 
number (i.e. this number will not be reused). The next subject will be assigned another 
randomisation number, even if he/she should receive the same tr eatment. Sub jects who leave 
the study early will not be replaced.  
The sponsor’s randomisation manager will keep the master random isation list. A copy of this 
list will be also confidentially supplied to the I WRS  vendor. The master list and the copy 
supplied to the I WRS vendor will be kept confidential in a secure location. Access t o the 
randomisation list must be restricted until authorisation is gi ven to release it for final analysis.  
3.5 Maintenance of Randomisation and Blinding  
This is an open -label study and there is n o blinding.  
3.6 Study Treatments and Dosage  
Irinotecan liposome injection will be administered in combinati on with oxaliplatin and 
5-FU/LV, as follows:  
Arm 1: Doses and administration of irinotecan liposome injectio n, oxaliplatin, 5 -FU/LV, on 
Days 1 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle:

A more detailed description of administration procedures for Ar m 1 is given in Section  6.2.1 . 
The comparator treatment will be administered as follows.  
Arm 2: Doses and administration of nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine (established doses as per 
USPI and EU SmPC nab -paclitaxel), on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle:  
• Nab-paclitaxel will be administered at 125 mg/m2 i.v. over 35 minutes (±5 minutes)  
• Gemcitabine will be administered at 1000 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 minutes (±5 minutes).  
A more detailed description of administration procedures for Ar m 2 is given in Section  6.2.2 . 
For all drugs listed above a variation of 5% between the dose c alculated by the I WRS  and the 
total dose administered is perm itted.  
The label text for all study medication provided by the sponsor  w i l l  b e  t r a n s l a t e d  a n d / o r  
adjusted, to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requir ements (e.g. Good 
Manufacturing Practice guidelines (Volume  4 Annex  13)), national laws in force  and in 
accordance with the local languages.  
The investigator or designee will only dispense study medicatio n to subjects included in this 
study. Each subject will only be given the regimen for the trea tment group that the subject has 
been randomised to. The regimen administration for each subject will be documented in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Both regimens are 28 -day cycles unless cycle duration is modified by toxicity. (see 
Section  6.2.5  for details on dose modifications).  
It is intended that subjects will be treated until radiological ly determined progressive disease 
per RECIST Version 1.1 or unacceptable study medication related  toxicity. However,  a subject 
may discontinue study treatment at any other time (see Section 4.3.1 ).  
3.7 Study Duration  
For each subject, this study will consist of a 28 -day screening p eriod followed by 28 -day cycles 
of treatment until radiologically determined progressive diseas e per RECIST Version  1.1, 
unacceptable study medication related toxicity or withdrawal fr om study. An EoT clinic visit is 
required approximately 30 days after la st dose of study treatment to complete the final safety 
assessments of the treatment phase (see Section 8.1.4  for follow -up of AEs). Subsequently, 
subjects will be fo llowed for survival once every 2 months via telephone, email, o r clinic visit 
until death or study closure, whichever occurs first (see Secti on 4.3.3 ). 
The subject’s participation in the treatment phase of the study wil l be considered to have ended:  
• at the time of the last visit  
• in the case that the subject does not attend the last visit, 30  days after last study 
medication intake  
• the death of the subject, i f this occurs within 30 days after last study medication intake . 
The overall duration of the study will be approximately 2.5  years. The study will be considered 
to have started when the first subject has provided signed info rmed consent.  
The study will be  completed once all subjects have discontinued the study treatment and at least 
543 OS events have occurred in the randomised subjects . 
3.8 Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form  
Data will be collected in the eCRF in compliance with FDA 21 CF R Part 11. A s required by 
GCP guidelines, the sponsor assigned monitor will verify, by di rect reference to the source 
documents, that the data require d by the protocol are accuratel y reported on the eCRF.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

a clinical study, the date that informed consent was obtained p rior to participation in the study, 
the identity of the study, diagnosis and eligibility criteria, visit dates, study medication 
administration and any AEs and as sociated concomitant medication.  
As required by Section 6.4.9 of the International Conference on  Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline 
E6(R2) [ ICH E6 (R2) 2016], if some items are recorded directly on the eCRF and are considered 
as source da ta, the identification of these data must be documented and agr eed between the 
investigator and the sponsor.  
Definition for source data and sourc e documents are given below : 
• Source data: All original records and certified copies of original records o f clin ical 
findings, observations, or other activities necessary for the r econstruction and evaluation 
of the study. Source data are contained in source documents (or iginal records or certified 
copies).  
• Source documents:  Original documents, data and records (e.g . hospital records, clinical

hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. Howeve r, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a 
single FSH measurement is insufficient. Female subjects of repr oductive potential

4.3 Stopping Rules, Discontinuation  and Withdrawal Criteria and Pro cedures  
4.3.1 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
It is intended that subjects will be treated until radiological ly determined progr essive disease 
per RECIST Version 1.1 or unacceptable study medication related  toxicity. However, a subject 
may discontinue study treatment at any other time. Reasons for discontinuation of study 
treatment include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Radiologically determined progressive disease, per RECIST Version 1.1 
• Clinical deterioration sufficien t to prevent further radiologic al assessment  
• A study medication related AE, prior to disease progression, wh ich: 
- in the opinion of the investigator, preclude s further treatment with all study 
medication  
- requires treatment regimen to be withheld (see maximum duration s described in 
Section  6.2.5 ), unless in the opinion o f the investigator the subject is receiving 
benefit overall from the study treatment  
- would result in more dose reductions than allowed in the study protocol (details 
can be found in Appendix 2  and 3 
- requires discontinuation of irinotecan liposome injection, 5 -FU or LV in Arm 1 or 
nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine in Arm 2  
• Development of an intercurrent medical condition or need for co ncomitant therapy that 
precludes further treatment with all study medications  
• Withdrawal of consent for further treatment  
• Withdrawal of consent for further treatment and survival follow -up 
• Discretion of the treating physician  
• Pregnancy.  
Subject may be permitted to conti nue study treatment after RECI ST v1.1 criteria for progressive 
disease are met if in the investigator’s opinion that subject is re ceiving clinical benefit from 
study treatment. Documented evidence of clinical benefit must i nclude all of the following 
criteria: absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of  laborato ry values) indicating 
unequivocal progression of disease, meaningful reduction from b aseline of tumo ur biomarker 
CA19 -9, and no decline in ECOG performance status. At the time of in itial progression 
investigator must discuss with the subject deferring any standard treatment options and 
possibility of continuing study treatment. Decision made by the  investigator and the subject 
should be documented in the clinic notes. Investigator must rec eive written sponsor or sponsor’s 
delegate approval before subject wi th radiologically confirmed progressive disease by RECIST 
v1.1. continues any study treatment.   3URWRFRO$XJ_

Dosing may be delayed from when it was scheduled (permitting a total of 28  days between the 
scheduled Day 1 and Day 15 doses for Arm 1 and up to 21 days fo r Arm  2, Section  6.2.5  – note 
that Arm 2 has scheduled Day 1, Da y 8 and Day 15 dosing and the  maximum delay between a 
missed scheduled dose and the next  one, whichever dose was missed, should not be longer than 
21 days) to allow for recovery from  toxicity related to the study treatment. If the time required 
for recovery from toxicity is more than described in Section  6.2.5 , consideration should be 
given to discontinuing the subject from further treatment, unle ss the subject is demonstrating 
benefit overall, in which case the possibility of remaining  on study medication should be 
discussed between investigator and sponsor, or delegate after r eview of the associated risks and 
benefits. However, if oxaliplatin is not well tolerated in subj ects randomised to Arm 1, 
oxaliplatin may be discontinued and sub jects may continue to receive irinotecan liposome 
injection+5 -FU/LV at the discretion of the investigator and continue in the  study (see Sections 
6.2.1  and 6.2.5.1 ). Toxicity requiring discontinuation of any of the drugs in ei ther regimen 
(apart from oxaliplatin) will  result in discontinuation from the study treatment.  
An EoT clinic visit is required approximately 30 days after las t dose of study treatment to 
complete the final safety assessments. Subsequently, subjects w ill be followed for survival once 
every 2 months via telephone, email, or c linic visit until death or study closure, whichever 
occurs first. A subject who discontinues study medication but has not withdrawn from the study 
should also continue the disease evaluation assessment (CT/MRI)  until confirmed radiographic 
disease progression as described in Section 5 or until the subject starts alternative anti -cancer 
therapy, whichever comes first.  
4.3.2 Withdrawal from the Study  
Reasons for withdrawal from treatment, but continuation in foll ow-up in the study are described 
in Section 4.3.1 . Withdrawal from the study (including withdrawal from both tre atment and 
follow -up) include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Death of the subject  
• Subject is lost to follow -up (see Section 4.3.3 ) 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Study termination by the sponsor  
• Significant noncompliance with the protocol, per investigator’s  assessment.  
4.3.3 Procedures Following Study Medication Discontinuation or Study Withdrawal  
The date the subject discontinues study treatment or withdraws from the study, the primary 
reason for study treatment discontinuation, study termination, and/or terminati on of 
participation (e.g. withdrawal of c onsent) will be captured wit hin the eCRF.  
Following study medication discontinuation all procedures and e valuations required at the 
30-day EoT visit should be completed. All subjects who discontinue  study  medication  as a 
result of an AE must be followed until resolution or stabilisat ion of the AE. Subjects who 
discontinue study medication prior to radiologically determined  disease progression should 
continue to be assessed radiologically, according to the protoc ol-specified schedule, until 
radiologically determined progressive disease per RECIST Versio n 1.1, has been documented 
or until the subject starts alternative anti -cancer therapy, whichever comes first.  
Subjects are instructed to continue using highly effective  methods of birth control (females) 
and condoms (males) for the duration of the study and for 7  months  (females) and 6  months  
(males) months after receiving the last dose of any study treat ment.  
The OS follow -up contacts should continue every 2 months from  the 30 -day EoT visit until 
death or study closure, whichever comes first. If a subject doe s not return to the clinic or respond 
to follow -up visit telephone calls, attempts should be made to contact th e subject or their family 3URWRFRO$XJ_

via phone, email, or mail. A t least three documented attempts, including one via certified mail, 
should be made to contact the subject before declaring a subjec t potentially lost to follow -up. 
If the subject is considered potentially lost to follow -up, the date of death may be captur ed from 
public records or all other means allowed per local regulations . No subject can be considered 
as lost to follow -up before final study closure.  
If a subject withdraws from the study treatment at any point, a complete final evaluation at the 
time of the subject’s withdrawal should be made with an explanation of the reason for 
withdrawal. At the time of discontinuation from the study treat ment, it should be clarified with 
the subject that they will continue to be assessed radiological ly, according to t he 
protocol -specified schedule, until radiologically determined progressive  disease per RECIST 
Version  1.1, has been documented or until the subject starts alternativ e anti -cancer therapy, 
whichever comes first.   
Afterwards, the subject will be followed up  for survival status (including where appropriate 
through publicly available records).  
Subjects participating to the optional research biobanking prog ram have the right to withdraw 
their consent at any time and for any reason during the study o r during th e period of sample 
storage (i.e. the entire 15 years during which the sample is ke pt). If a subject wishes to withdraw 
consent for biobanking, and the samples are still at the invest igator site or at the central 
laboratory at this time, the investigator mu st inform the study monitor in writing of the subject’s 
decision and destroy the samples. If the samples are in the spo nsor’s central biorepository, the 
investigator must inform Ipsen directly of the withdrawal using  t h e  e -mail address, 
, mentioning only the patient  ID in this e -mail. Ipsen will ensure 
the destruction of the samples and all corresponding aliquots a nd issue confirmation of the 
destruction, which will be forwarded to the investigator. Analy ses conducted before withdra wal 
will not be affected.  
4.3.4 Study Termination  
The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any si te and at any time. Reasons for 
study termination may include , but are not limited to, the foll owing:  
• Investigator non -compliance with the protocol, GCP or regulatory requirements  
• Insufficient enrolment  
• Safety concerns  
• Drug supply or manufacturing issues  
• The sponsor’s decision to modify or discontinue the development  of irinotecan liposome 
injection  
• A request to discontinue the study by the relevant re gulatory authorities.  
The sponsor will promptly inform all investigators and the rele vant regulatory authorities if the 
study is suspended or terminated for any reason. The investigat or will promptly notify their 
IRB/EC if the study is suspended or termina ted. 3URWRFRO$XJ_

5 STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1 Study Schedule  
The schedule of procedures and assessments during the study is summarised in Table  5. 
If the COVID -19 pandemic pre vents subjects from coming to the site, subjects can have their  
study visit assessments performed remotely as judged appropriat e by the investigator. This must 
be discussed with the sponsor (or delegate) before being implem ented. In such a case, the 
invest igator will perform a telemedicine visit and will make every ef fort to confirm  all 
important medical information and safety event(s) occurring sin ce the last visit are collected. 
Guidance on how to collect protocol -planned assessments is provided in Append ix 8. 
Independent ethics committees (IECs)/institutional review board s (IRBs) will be notified of the 
changes as applicable locally. Of note, as the adapted visit de viates from the regular protocol 
plan, the changes will be rec orded as protocol deviations related to COVID -19. 3URWRFRO$XJ_

should al ways be completed prior to study assessments.  
h ECG : For screening, ECG to be measured within 28 days prior to ran domisation. Arm 1 only: ECG to be performed pre and post oxali platin infusion on D1 and D15 of C1 only and repeated 
as clinically indicated du ring the study. Arm 2 only: ECG to be performed pre infusion of  nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine on D1 of Cycles C1, C2, C3 and C4 an d repeated as clinically 
indicated during the study. In addition, ECG to be repeated as clinically indicated during the study . 
i Haematology : For the screening sample, collection should occur within 7 da ys before randomisation. Routine or historical samples taken b efore signing ICF within this timeframe can be 
used for the screening sample. Day 8 collections are required f or Arm  2 only. Results of samples taken must be obtained and reviewed prior to dosing (D1, D8 and D15 ). Refer to Section  8.2.1  
for the required results, e .g. coagulation testing.  
j Biochemistry and Urinalysis : For the screening sample, collection should occur within 7 da ys before randomisation. Serum biochemistry must be assessed c entrally  but can also be analysed 
locally in the case of requiring timely res ults for medical management. Screening central biochemistry res ults must be obtained prior to randomisation. Urinalysis will be performed locally. 
Refer to the eCRF completion guideline for the required results . 
k UGT1A1*28 : Sample to be collected within 7  days prior to randomisation. Biomarker result not required prio r to enrolment in the study or prior to dosing on C1D1.  
l CA19 -9: First sample to be collected within 7 days prior to randomisa tion. Sample to be collected at D1 of every other cycle, i.e. C1D 1, C3D1, C5D1, etc.  
m Pregnancy test (urine or serum βHCG) :  Sample to be collected and results reviewed prior to randomi sation and before treatment on D1 of each cycle. Any positive urine pregnancy test 
must be confirmed via serum β -HCG.  
n PK sampling (Arm 1 only) : C1D1: Samples collected at the following timepoints: pre -dose (within 24 hours prior to irinotecan liposome injection in fusion); at the end of the irinotecan 
liposome injection infusion (+15 mins) and at the end of the ox aliplatin infusion (+ 5 mins). C1D3: Sample collected within 2 hours prior to the com pletion of the 5 -FU infusion. C1D15: 
Sample collected just prior to dosing with irinotecan liposome injection (within 24 hours). If subject is seen in clinic betw een C1D3 and C1D15 then an addi tional PK sample should be 
collected at the time of the visi t (subject does not need to co me to clinic for this sample only).  
o Disease evaluation : For screening to be performed within 28 days before randomisa tion. CT (or MRI if the subject is allergic to CT contrast media) according to RECIST Version  1.1. 
Routine or historical scans taken before signing ICF within thi s timeframe can be used to perform the screening assessment ac cording to RECIST Version 1.1. Scan schedule is Q8W after 
randomisation. The sc an schedule of every 8 weeks (± 7 days) after randomisation is to be adhered to, regardless of whether the subject has a trea tment delay. EoT visit: Disease evaluation 
to be performed u nless completed in the 8 weeks before the EoT visit . Q2M after EoT visi t: For subjects who discontinue the study  treatment  for reasons other than radiologically confirmed 
disease progression  per RECIST version 1.1  and have not started any further anti -cancer treatment (e.g.  subjects who are removed due to adverse events).  
p Pre-medication Arm 1 : Dexamethasone and a 5 -HT3 antagonist, or equivalent other anti -emetics. Atropine may be prescribed as per standard of care and /or prophylactically for subjects 
who experienced acute cholinergic symptoms. Arm 2:  As per standard practice  or Prescribing Information/SmPC. Prior to each dosing for Arm 1  and prior to each cycle for Arm 2, subjects 
must comply with the relevant blood count criteria (see Section  6.2.3 ). 
q Arm 1: Nal -IRI +oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV : Infusions to be administered ±2 days from scheduled date of a dministration in the following order: irinotecan liposome inje ction, followed by 
oxaliplatin infusion, followed by LV (30 m inutes after oxaliplatin end) and then 5 -FU infusion (within 60 minutes after LV). On D1 of every cycle,  treatment experience during the previous 
cycle(s) will be reviewed in case dose modification(s) are requ ired. 
r Arm 1: Removal of 5 -FU pump : Pump remov al might occur at a home visit, rather than a visit to site exc ept at C1D3. For C1D3 the subject will visit the site and a PK  sample will be taken 
2 hours before the pump finishes delivering 5 -FU. Time of PK sample and time of finishing pump infusion must be recorded.   
s Arm 2: gemcitabine+nab -paclitaxel : Infusions to be administered ±2 days from scheduled date. The re must always be at least 6 days between Day 1 and Day 8 and Day 8 and Day 15.

5.2 Study Visits  
5.2.1 Procedures for Screening and Enrolment  
The screening phase will begin once the subject signs the ICF. All procedures for screening are 
outlined in  Table  5. 
For further descriptions of the clinical and laboratory assessm ents required, please refer to 
Section 8.2.  
Subjects will be offered to participate in an optional research  biobanking programme. Subjects 
who agree to participate will be requested to sign a separate i nformed consent. Subjects can 
participate in the study even if they are not participating in the optional biobanking programme.  
After informed consent is obtained, all subjects will be alloca ted a subject number. Screened 
subjects must be identifiable throughout the study. The investi gator will maintain a list of 
subject numbers and names to ena ble records to be found at a la ter date if required.  
Under no circumstances will subjects be screened more than once , however, on discussion with 
the sponsor medical monitor (or delegate), it may  be required that some assessments need to be 
repeated, such as safety assessments and blood sampling.  
Following confirmation of eligibility for the study, subjects w ill be given a randomisation 
number and allocated to one of t he dosing groups specified in  Section  3.6. 
In the event that the subject does not receive study medication , the primary reason will be 
recorded.   
5.2.2 Procedures During Study Treatme nt Phase  
Procedures will be performed during the study treatment phase a s per Table  5.  
5.2.3 Procedures After Study Treatment (Follow -up Phase)  
5.2.3.1  End of Treat ment Visit  
Subjects will continue to receive treatment until radiologicall y determined progressive disease 
per RECIST Version 1.1, unacceptable study medication related t oxicity or withdrawal. An 
EoT visit is required approximately 30 days (±14 days) after  last dose of study treatment to 
complete the final safety assessments.  
For subjects who withdraw prematurely from the study, final eva luations will be performed at 
the EoT visit (30±14 days after the last dose).  
Subjects with ongoing AEs or clinically s ignificant laboratory test abnormalities (as determined 
by the investigator) will be monitored as described in Section  8.1.4  and Section  8.1.2.5 , 
respectively.  
All procedures and assessments are outlined in Table  5. 
Subjects are to use contraception throughout the study, as well  as after they stop receiving study 
medication, as described in Section 4.3.3 . 
5.2.3.2  Follow -up Visits  
After the EoT visit, subjects s hould continue to be followed fo r survival status once every 
2 months (±7 days) via telephone, email, clinic visit, or medical  record review u ntil death, 
withdrawal of consent or study cl osure, whichever occurs first.  Additionally, data on 
subsequent anti -cancer treatments should be collected during these contacts and  documented in 
the eCRF. In the case of subjects who are discontinued from trea tment for reasons other than 
progressive disease per RECIST Version 1.1, disease evaluations  (including imaging studies) 
should continue into the follow -up period, as described in Section 4.3.3 . 3URWRFRO$XJ_

If a subject does not respond to the OS follow -up contacts, at least three documented attempts, 
including one via certified mail, should be made to contact the  subject before declaring a subject 
potentially lost to follow -up. If the subject does not respond to these requests, the date o f death 
may be captured from public records or all other means allowed by local regulations.  
5.3 Laboratory Asse ssments  
The total volume of blood drawn for all evaluations throughout this study is dependent on the 
numbers of cycles of treatment completed and is estimated in Table  6 (see Section  10 for 
biobanking sample volumes, which are not included in this estim ate).

Notes: Estimates given t o the nearest +5mL 
An additional 16.5 to 19 mL of blood will be collected from sub jects who have signed the optional biobanking informed 
consent. 
Technical instructions will be  provided in a separate laborator y manual.  
The following samples will be analysed locally:  
• Haematology samples will be assessed at the site’s local laboratory (see Section  8.2.1 ) 
• Blood biochemistry samples can be assessed at the site’s local laboratory only if needed 
to allow for immediate decision -making (see Section 8.2.2  and also note that centrally 
assessed biochemistry results are required to confirm eligibili ty). Blood biochemistry 
samples will be assessed at central laboratory (in the list below).  
• Dipstick urinalysis  
• Pregnancy test (see Section 8.2.5 ). 
• DPD testing will be performed using a validated method which is recommended by local 
health authorities at the site’s local laboratory (See Section  8.2.7  and Appendix  7). 
The following samples will be sent for central analysis:  
• Blood biochemistry (see Section 8.2.2 ) 
• CA19 -9 (see Section 8.2.4 ) 
• UGT1A1*28 (see Section 8.2.3 )  
• PK samples (see Section 9.1). 
5.4 Imaging  
Subjects will have CT scans (or MRI if the subject is allergic to CT contrast media) performed 
every 8 weeks (see Table  5) that will be evaluated by the investigator using RECIST guide lines 
Version  1.1 for complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease.  
The sponsor will collect and st ore all tumour assessment images  for all subjects throughout the 
study.  
For subjects who discontinue the study  treatment  for reasons other than radiologically 
confirmed disease progression per RECIST version 1.1  and have not started any further 
anti-cancer treatment , will have follow -up Q2M after EoT for disease evaluation.  
Technical instructions will be  provided in separate image acqui sition guidelines.  
The CT scans (or MRI) will be retained by the sponsor for centr al independent assessment, 
should this be required.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

6.1 Study Medication Preparation, Storage, Security and Accountability  
All medication provided to the subject (i.e. irinotecan liposom e injection, oxaliplatin, 5 -FU, 
LV, nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine) is classed as study medication. The  study medication that 
is provided to th e clinical site by the sponsor is also referred to as IMP. All IMP is study 
medication but not all study medication may be defined as IMP.  
6.1.1 Study Medication Storage and Security  
The investigator or an approved representative (e.g. pharmacist ) will ensure th at all study 
medication (i.e.  irinotecan liposome injection, oxaliplatin, 5 -FU, LV, nab -paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine) is stored in a secured area, under recommended tem perature monitored storage 
conditions, in accordance with applicable regulatory requiremen ts and the pharmacy manual.  
Temperature of storage for irinotecan liposome injection is des cribed in Section 6.2.1.1  and 
accompanying packaging information provides  the relevant storage conditions for the other 
study medications.  
6.1.2 Investigational Medicinal Product Preparation  
The investigator or an approved representative (e.g. pharmacist ) will ensure that all study 
medication is prepared and dispensed by qualified st aff members.  
6.1.3 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability  
All IMP sourced by the sponsor is to be accounted for in the Dr ug accountability module within 
the IWRS system.  
The investigator, institution or the head of the medical instit ution (where appli cable) is 
delegated by the sponsor to be responsible for IMP accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconc iliation and final disposition  records). The sponsor will provide 
guidance on the destruction of unused IMP. If destruc tion is authorised to take place at the 
investigational site, the investigator must ensure that the mat erials are destroyed in compliance 
with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy  and any special instructions 
provided by the sponsor. All destruction must be adequatel y documented. Further guidance  and 
information for the receipt,  preparation, management, disposal and return  of the IMP are 
provided in the “Investigational Medicinal Product Handling Man ual”.  
6.2 Study Medications Administered  
At screening, subjects will be allocated a subject number. Foll owing confirmation of eligibility 
for the study, subjects will be allocated to one of the followi ng treatment groups:  
• Arm 1: irinotecan liposom e injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV  
or  
• Arm 2: nab -paclitaxel+gemcitabine  
6.2.1 Irinotecan Liposome Injection+Oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV (Arm 1)  
Prior to the infusions contained in Arm 1 all subjects must be pre-medicated as detailed in 
Section 6.3.1 . The order of the infusions to be administered in the clinic i s as follows: irinotecan 
liposome injection, followed by oxaliplatin infusion, followed by LV and then 5 -FU infusion. 
(Refer to study schedule Table  5). 
Arm 1: Doses and administration of irinotecan liposome injectio n, oxaliplatin, 5 -FU/LV on 
Days  1 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle:

• Oxaliplatin infusion , after completion of irinot ecan liposome injection, will be 
administered at 60 mg/m2 i.v. over 120 minutes (±10 minutes). Note that oxaliplatin may 
be omitted due to toxicity (see Section 6.2.5.1  for dose modification to an alternative 
regimen without oxaliplatin for Arm 1 in the case of toxicity).  
• LV (l+d racemic form -generic form) infusion will start 30 min utes (+10  minutes) after 
completion of oxaliplatin administration, at 400 mg/m2, i.v. over 30 minutes (±5  minutes)  
• 5-FU infusion will start within 60 minutes after completion of LV  administration, 
at 2400  mg/m2 i.v. over 46 -hours (± 120 minutes).  
As the infusion of 5 -FU is administered over 46 hours the subject will go home with an 
administration pump. The subject w ill either need to return to the clinic at the end of 
infusion for removal of the pump or, alternatively, if possible , arrangements might be 
made for the pump to be removed at the subject’s home (except on  Cycle 1 Day 3).  
6.2.1.1  Irinotecan Liposome Injection, Dose, Mode of Administration:  
Irinotecan liposome injection is irinotecan in the form of the sucrosofate salt, encapsulated in 
liposomes for i.v.  infusion. The liposome is a unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicle, approximately 
110 nm in diameter, which encapsulates an aqueous space containing irinotecan in a gelated or 
precipitated state as the sucrosofate salt. It is supplied in s terile, single -use vi als containing 
10 mL of irinotecan liposome injection at a concentration of 4.3  mg/mL free base equivalent 
(FBE).  
Irinotecan liposome injection must be stored refrigerated (2 to  8°C, 36 to 46°F) with protection 
from light and must not be frozen.  
Responsi ble individuals should inspect vial contents for particulate ma tter before and after they 
withdraw the drug product from a vial into a syringe. They must  contact the sponsor or its 
designee if they notice a problem with the study medication.  
Irinotecan li posome injection must be diluted prior to administration. Becau se of possible 
microbial contamination during dilution, the diluted solution s hould be used immediately, but 
the diluted solution may be stored at room temperature (15 to 2 5°C) for up to 4  hours prior to 
infusion or may be refrigerated (2 to 8°C) for up to 24 hours p rior to use. Diluted solution must 
be protected from light prior to infusion. The diluted solution  must not be frozen.  Further 
instructions are provided in the pharmacy manual .

6.2.3 Combination Therapy Study Cycles  
Both regimens are 28 -day cycles unless cycle duration is modified by toxicity.  
The toxicity of each dose must be recorded prior to the adminis tration of a s ubsequent dose and 
graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE ( Version 5.0). All dose 
modifications for all arms should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. D ose modification 
details are given in Section  6.2.5 . 
• Arm 1: irinotecan liposom e injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV  
Prior to each dosing , subjects must have:  
- ANC ≥2000/mm3 
- Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 
- Diarrhoea ≤ Grade 1.  
• Arm 2:  nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine  
Prior to each cycle , subjects must have:  
- ANC ≥1500/mm3 
- Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 
- Diarrhoea ≤ Grade 1.  
Dosing may be delayed as detailed in Section  6.2.5 , to allow for recovery from toxicity. If the 
subject does not recover this may lead to discontinuation of st udy treatment (see Section  4.3 for 
details). However, if oxaliplatin is not well tolerated in subjects rando mised to Arm  1, 
oxaliplatin may be discontinued and subjects may continue to re ceive irinotecan liposome 
injection+5 -FU/LV  at the discretion of the investigator and continue in the study . Toxicity 
requiring discontinuation of any of the drugs in either regimen  (apart from oxaliplatin) will 
result in discontinuation from the study treatment ( see Section 4.3 and Section  6.2.5 ). 
6.2.4 Management of Infusion Reactions  
The guidelines described in this section can be followed in cas e of infusion reactions to any 
study treatment in either arm given per protocol. Infusion re actions will be defined according 
to the NCI -CTCAE (Version 5.0) definitions of an allergic reaction or anap hylaxis as defined 
below:  
6.2.4.1  Allergic Reaction  
An allergic reaction is a disorder characterised by an adverse local or general response from 
exposure t o an allergen:  
• Grade 1:  Transient flushing or rash, drug fever <38°C (<100.4°F); interv ention not 
indicated  
• Grade 2:  Intervention or infusion interruption indicated; responds promp tly to 
symptomatic treatment (e.g. antihistamines, NSAIDS, narcotics);  proph ylactic 
medications indicated for ≤ 24 hrs  
• Grade 3:  Prolonged (e.g. not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medicatio n and/or 
brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms followi ng initial improvement; 
hospitalisation indicated for clinical seque lae (e.g. renal impairment, pulmonary

6.2.4.2  Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is a disorder characterised by an acute inflammator y reaction resulting from the 
release of histamine and his tamine -like substances from mast cells, causing hypersensitivity 
immune response. Clinically, it presents with breathing difficu lty, dizziness, hypotension, 
cyanosis and loss of consciousness and may lead to death):  
• Grade 1:  Not applicable  
• Grade 2:  Not app licable  
• Grade 3:  Symptomatic bronchospasm, with or without urticaria; parenteral  
intervention indicated; allergy -related oedema/angioedema; hypotension  
• Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; ur gent intervention indicated.  
6.2.4.3  Treatment Guidelines  
Institutio nal policies or the following treatment guidelines shall be use d for the management of 
infusion reactions.  
(1) Grade 1:  
• Slow infusion rate by 50%  
• Monitor subject every 15 minutes for worsening of condition  
• Future infusions may be administered at a reduced rate  (e.g. over 120 minutes for 
irinotecan liposome injection), a t the discretion of the invest igator.  
(2) Grade 2:  
• Stop infusion  
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg i.v., acetaminop hen 650  mg 
orally, and oxygen

For subjects who experience a second Grade 1 infusion reaction,  administer dexamethasone 
10 mg i.v. All subsequent infusions should be pre -medicated with diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride 50 mg i.v., dexamethasone 10 mg i.v. and acetamin ophen 650 mg orally or as 
per institutional guidelines.  
6.2.5 Dose Modifications  
In both treatment arms the toxicity of each dose must be record ed prior to the administration of 
a subsequent dose and graded according to the NCI -CTCAE (Version 5.0). All dose reductions 
for all arms should be based on the worst preceding toxicity.  
Prior to D1 and D15 of each new dose of treatment, the dose of drug should be determined by 
re-calculating the subject’s BSA and it must be confirmed that sub jects have haematology 
within the limits described in Section 6.2.3 . A variation of 5% between the dose calculated by 
the IWRS  and the total dose administered is permitted.  
If a subject’s dose is reduced during the study due to toxicity , it should remain reduced for the 
duration of the study; dose re -escalation is not permitted (with exception, see Appendix  3). 
Treatment should be delayed allowing suff icient time for recovery to levels noted above, and 
upon recovery, treatment should be  administered according to th e guidelines in Appendix  2 for 
Arm 1 or Appendix 3  for Arm 2. The use of transfusions is perm itted if within normal 
institutional policies and procedures (see also Section  6.3.3 ). If the subject had febrile 
neutropenia, the ANC must have res olved to 2000/mm3 in Arm  1 and 1500/mm3 in Arm  2; and 
the subject must have recovered from infection.  
Dose modifications are therefo re defined as the following:  
• Dose reduction: the new dose should be specified.  
• Infusion interruption: the timepoint, reason  and timing of interruption of infusion will be 
recorded.  
• Dose delay:  
- Arm 1: documented as such if delayed dose is given within the p er-protocol 
maximum days permitted between doses i.e. 28 days.  
- Arms 2: documented as such if delayed dose is given within t he per -protocol 
maximum days permitted between doses i.e. 21 days.  
Any dose delays longer than the  above must be discussed with th e sponsor or delegate.  
• Dose omission  
- Arm 1: documented as such if delayed dose >28 days i.e. more th an the 
per-protocol maximu m permitted days between doses.  
- Arm 2 - documented as such if delayed dose >21 days i.e. more than the 
per-protocol maximum permitted days between doses.  
6.2.5.1  Dose Modifications and Omissions Arm 1: Irinotecan Liposome 
Injection+Oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV  
In Arm 1, dos ing may be delayed for up to 14 days from when it was scheduled  (permitting a 
total of 28 days between the scheduled Day 1 and Day 15 doses) to allow for recovery from 
toxicity related to the study treatment, administrative,  or personal reasons. If the tim e required 
for recovery from toxicity is more than 14  days, the dose is marked as omitted and consideration 
should be given to withdrawal from treatment in the study, unle ss the subject is demonstrating 
benefit overall, in which case the possibility of rem aining on study medication should be 
discussed between investigator and sponsor (or delegate), after  review of the associated risks 
and benefits.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

Dose level reductions required due to toxicity related to irino tecan liposome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV sh ould be made following the guidelines outlined in 
Appendix  2. 
Any subject who has three dose reductions and experiences an AE  that would require a fourth 
dose reduction must be discontinued from study treatment.  
If oxaliplatin is not well tolerated in subjects randomised to Arm 1, oxaliplatin  m a y  b e  
discontinued and subjects may continue to receive irinotecan li posome injection+5 -FU/LV at 
the discretion of the investigator and continue in the study. ( For discontinuation details ple ase 
see Section  4.3). In the case that oxaliplatin is removed from the regimen, th e following doses 
and administration of irinotecan liposome injection, 5 -FU/LV wi ll occur on Days  1 and 15 of 
each 28 -day cycle:  
• Irinotecan liposome injection will be administered at 50 mg/m2 i.v. over 90  minutes 
(±10  minutes)  
• LV (l+d racemic form -generic form) infusion will start 30 minutes (+10  minutes) after 
completion of irinotecan  liposome injection administration, at 400 mg/m2, i.v. over 
30 minutes (±5  minutes)  
• 5-FU infusion will start within 60 minutes after completion of LV  administration, 
at 2400  mg/m2 i.v. over 46 -hours (± 120 minutes).  
No dose adjustments for toxicity are requ ired for LV.  
6.2.5.2  Dose Modifications and Omissions  Arm 2: Nab -paclitaxel+Gemcitabine  
Dose level reductions required due to toxicity related to nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine should 
be made following the guidelines outlined in Appendix 3 . 
Recommended dose modifications for neutropenia and thrombocytop enia and adjustments 
related to other toxicities are also provided in Appendix 3 . 
In Arm 2 any subject who has two dose reductions and experience s an AE that would requ ire a 
third dose reduction must be discont inued from study treatment (Appendix  3). 
The following rules will be applied if any of the following dos es are missed in the 28 -day cycle 
for Arm 2:  
• CxD1: can be delayed by a maximum of 7 da ys to accommodate 21 days between the 
previous cycle’s D15 and CxD1.  
• CxD8: cannot be delayed and if the subject is not well, this do se is not given, and the 
next dose scheduled for the CxD15 date.  
• CxD15:  
- in the case that the CxD8 dose was missed, the CxD1 5 dose can be delayed by a 
further week (leading to 21 days between CxD1 and the reschedul ed CxD15 dose)  
- in the case that the CxD8 dose was given on schedule, CxD15 may  be delayed by 
a maximum of 2 weeks (leading to 21 days between CxD8 and the r eschedule d 
CxD15 dose):  
In Arm 2, the maximum delay between a missed scheduled dose and  the next one (whichever 
dose is missed) should not be longer than 21 days to allow for recovery from toxicity related to 
the study treatment, and administrative, or personal re asons (see Appendix 3  for dose 
modification guidance). If the time required for recovery from toxicity is more than 21  days, 
consideration should be given to withdrawal from treatment in the study, unless the subject is 
demonstrating benefit overall, in which case the possibility of  remaining on study medication 
should be discussed between investigator and sponsor (or delega te), after review of the 
associated r isks and benefits.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

6.2.5.3  UGT1A1*28 Monitoring  
As part of this study, pharmacogenomic data will be collected o n all subjects and assessed 
centrally for determination of the genotype at the UGT1A1 (TA)n  repeat polymorphism, 
especially of UGT1A1*28 status. Results will be provided to the sponsor.  
Based on previous experience with non -liposomal irinotecan, individuals who are homozygous 
for the UGT1A1*28 allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype) are at increased  risk for neutropenia 
following initiation of irinotecan treatment. According to the prescribing information for 
irinotecan [ Camptosar® USPI 2016 ], in a study of 66 subjects who received single -agent 
non-liposomal irinotecan (350  mg/m2 once every 3 -weeks), the incidence of Grade  4 
neutropen ia in subjects homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was as high as 50%, and in 
subjects heterozygous for this allele (UGT1A1  6/7 genotype) the incidence was 12.5%.  
Importantly however, no Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in sub jects homozygous for the 
wild-type allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype). Additionally, in other studi es, a lower prevalence of 
life-threatening neutropenia has been described (for details refer t o the prescribing information 
for irinotecan [ Camptosar® USPI 201 6]. Population PK studies of irinotecan liposome injection 
have not identified a clinically significant relationship betwe en UGT1A1*28  homozygosity and 
increased SN -38 exposure (see IB). In a phase I study (UCSF 8103, as referen ced in 
Section  2.1.1.6 ) no differences in toxicity were seen in cohorts of heterozygo us or wild -type 
subjects, and dose limiting toxicities of diarrhoea with or wit hout accompanying dehydratio n 
or fatigue, were seen in both cohorts.  
All subjects treated in Arm 1, regardless of the results of the  UGT1A1*28 genotype, will be 
treated with the same starting dose of irinotecan liposome inje ction and will follow the same 
dose reduction rules. Regular  safety monitoring of subjects will be conducted by the sponsor 
medical monitor(s) (or delegate) and by the IDMC during the stu dy. The safety and any 
available PK of UGT1A1*28 homozygous subjects will be compared to those who are 
non-homozygous for UGT1A1* 28 to determine whether any different dosing strategy (such as 
a lower starting dose and/or different dose reduction for irino tecan liposome injection) is 
required for subjects who are homozygous for UGT1A1*28.  
6.3 Concomitant Medication/Treatment/Therapy  
All concurrent medical conditions and complications of the underlyi ng malignancy will be 
treated at the discretion of the investigator according to acce ptable local standards of medical 
care. Subjects should receive analgesics, antiemetics, antibiot ics, anti -pyretics, and blood 
products as necessary.  
Careful monitoring of coagulation parameters is imperative, in order to avoid complications of 
any possible drug interactions (see below). All concomitant med ications, including transfusions 
of blood products, wil l be recorded on the appropriate case report form.  
Guidelines for treating certain medical conditions are discusse d below; however, institutional 
guidelines for the treatment of these conditions may also be us ed. The concomitant therapies 
that warrant spe cial attention are discussed below.  
Any prior or concomitant therapy or medication given to a subje ct within 4 weeks, or within a 
time interval less than at least five half -lives (whichever is shorter) before study medication 
administration or during study  medication administration will be recorded on the eCRF. Dose 
and generic name or trade  name will be recorded.  
6.3.1 Pre-Medication  
6.3.1.1  Arm 1: Irinotecan Liposome Injection+Oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV

standard institutional practices ). In situations where differen ces in standard institutional 
practices and recommendations within the coun try relevant SmPC occur, standard institutional 
practice will take precedence, excluding prohibited medications  as per Section 6.3.2 . Atropine 
may be  prescribed as per standard of care and/or prophylactically for subjects who experienced 
acute cholinergic symptoms.  
6.3.1.2  Arm 2: Nab -paclitaxel+Gemcitabine  
Pre-medication administration is not required prior to nab -paclitaxel treatment, as 
hypersensitivity rea ctions are not expected, although initial antiemetic prophylaxi s is 
recommended due to administration of gemcitabine following nab -paclitaxel treatment.  
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the infusion will be sto pped and not restarted. If it is in the 
subject’s best interests, at the investigator’s discretion, tre atment may continue over subsequent 
cycles using the pre -medication regimen that the institution typically uses for gemc itabine.  
6.3.2 Prohibited Therapy and Therapy to be Monitored Closely  
The following drugs are noted in the irinotecan liposome inject ion prescribing information as 
interacting with irinotecan (see Appendix 1 , which lists examples of prohibited strong CYP3A, 
CYP2C8, and UGT1A inhibitors or inducers ): 
• Strong CYP3A4 inducers, e.g. St. John’s Wort, CYP3A4 inducing an ticonvulsants 
(phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine), rifampin, rifabu tin, rifapentine  
• CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g. clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole , ketoconazole, lopinavir, 
nefazodon e, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole,  troleandomycin, 
erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil  
• Strong UGT1A1 inhibitors, e.g. atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinav ir, ketoconazole.  
Treatment with these agents and any others that interact wi th irinotecan, oxaliplatin, 5 -FU, LV, 
nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine should be avoided wherever possible. Aprepitant is a moderate 
CYP3A inhibitor and mild inducer of CYP3A4. Fosaprepitant and a prepitant interact with 
irinotecan: caution should be exercised  when administering either agent as their use may result 
in increased toxicity  (neutropenia and diarrhoea) . For the prevention of chemotherapy -induced 
nausea and/or vomiting, selection of an appropriate antiemetic should avoid potential drug -drug 
interacti ons and employ a multimodal combination with either a 5 -HT3 antagonist, 
dexamethasone, olanzapine and a NK -1 antagonist that does not interact with the CYP3A4 
pathway (e.g. rolapitant). Where anti -emetic options are limited to aprepitant and fosaprepitant,  
these should only be used based on investigator judgement consi dering the risk/benefit to the 
subject. Because 5 -FU interacts with warfarin, caution should be exercised if conc omitant use 
is necessary. Standard institutional practices should be used f or any other drug interactions.  
No live attenuated vaccines should be given to subjects in the study and for 3 months after last 
dose of study therapy (e.g. yellow fever vaccine and polio viru s vaccine). If a subject receives 
SARS -CoV -2 vaccinations (COVID -19 vaccinations) during study participation, it is the 
responsibility of the investigator to determine the suitability  of the vaccine being given with the 
information provided by the manufacturer.  
The following therapies are not permitted during the study tre atment phase (see also Section  6.4 
for lifestyle recommendations):  
(a) Other anti -neoplastic therapy, including cytotoxics, targeted agents, endo crine therapy 
or antibo dies  
(b) Potentially curative radiotherapy; palliative radiotherapy is p ermitted  
(c) Other antiretroviral therapies with overlapping toxicities with  the irinotecan liposome 
injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV regimen, including the agent zidovudine, which has an 
overla pping toxicity for increased risk of neutropenia.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

(d) Any other investigational therapy.  
6.3.3 Permitted Concomitant Medication/Therapy  
Concomitant medications for treatment of febrile neutropenia wi th G-CSF and diarrhoea are 
permitted during this study, but they mu st be monitored closely and every effort should be made 
to keep their dose and dose regi men constant throughout the cou rse of the study.  
6.3.3.1  Granulocyte Colony -Stimulating Factors  
Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been rep orted in patients  treated with 
non-liposomal irinotecan and irinotecan liposome injection. In subj ects with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer in the NAPOLI -1 study, neutropenic fever/sepsis appeared more frequently 
in the irinotecan liposome inject ion containing arms (4.8% irin otecan liposome injection 
monotherapy arm, 3.4% irinotecan liposome injection+5 -FU/LV arm and 0.7% 5 FU/LV 
control arm). The incidence of Grade  3 or 4 neutropenia was higher among Asian subjects (18 
of 33 (55%)) compared to white  subjects (13 of 73 (18%)) (see the IB for further details).  
In the ongoing phase I/II open -label, dose -expansion study of irinotecan liposome injection plus 
5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin in subjects with previously untreated met astatic pancreatic cancer 
(MM 398 -07-02-03) Grade 3 or highe r treatment -related febrile neutropenia occurred in 12.5% 
of the pooled population treated with 50  mg/m2 irinotecan liposome injection, LV 400 mg/m2, 
5-FU 2400 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 oxaliplatin (n=4/32) (see Section  1.2.2.1  and the IB for further 
details).  
For both arms, neutropenic complications should be managed prom ptly and adequately with 
antibiotic support. Granulocyte -colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) may b e used at the 
investigator's discretion for the treatment of neutropenic feve r or infections associated with 
neutropenia and for the prevention of febrile neutropenia in su bjects with an ANC 
<500  cells/μL. Prophylactic use of G -CSF should be considered if subjects are considered high 
risk in the opinion of the investigator (e.g. age >60, co -morbidities, poor nutritional status, 
previous episode of febrile neutropenia) [ Smith 2015, Klastersky 2016, Lyman 2005 ]. Subjects 
with prolonged a diarrhoeal episode lasting ≥48 hours should be c losely monitored for a trend 
of decrease in white blood cells (WBC) and/or neutropenia with high consideration given to 
administer G -CSF to avoid infectious/septi c complications. See Section  6.3.3.2  and the detailed 
algorithm of diarrhoea management for chemotherapy -induced diarrhoea provided in  Appendix 
5.  
6.3.3.2  Therapy for Diarrhoea  
Acute diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, developing during or with in 24 hours after irinotecan 
liposome injection administrati on, may occur as part of a choli nergic syndrome. The syndrome 
can be treated with atropine. Prophylac tic or therapeutic administrati on of atropine, according 
to institutional standards, should be considered in subjects ex periencing cholinergic symptoms 
during the study.  
Diarrhoea can be debilitating and on rare occasions is potentially life -threatening. 
Anti-diarrhoea management should be initiated at the first episode o f poorly formed or loose 
stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements that are more f requent than normal. For both 
arms, diarrhoea should be managed acc ording to institutional guidelines, or according to the 
guidelines developed by an American Society of Clinical Oncolog y panel and ESMO Clinical 
Practice Guidelines for treating chemotherapy -induced diarrhoea [ Benson  2004 , Utaris 2015 , 
Bossi 2018 ].

6.4 Lifestyle Restrictions/Recommendations  
Vacations or holidays of 14 calendar days in length can be acco mmodated in the schedule.  
Besides restrictions already presented in the exclusion criteri a (see Section  4.2) and any related 
to smoking or alcohol consumption, subjects will also be reques ted to avoid the following from 
48 hours prior to Day  1 and until EoT visit : 
• poppy -seeds consumption  
• cannabis (including medicinal).  
Subjects are to use contraception thr oughout the study, as well as after they stop receiving study 
medication, as described in Section 4.3.3 . 
Prior to treatment, male subjects will be informed of the possibility of irreversible 
infertility/testicular damage and they will be advised to consi der conservation of sperm.  
Subjects in Arm 1 receiving 5 -FU will be advised to take measures to minimise exposure to UV 
light for the duration of the  study and for one week after the last dose of 5 -FU because of the 
associated risk of photosensitivity.  
6.5 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance  
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring subject com pliance. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from the study at any time if the investigator or the sponsor determines  that the 
subject is not in compliance with the study protocol.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

7 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
For the timing of assessments in this study, refer to the sched ule in Table  5. 
7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Evaluation  
As described in Section 3.2.1 , the primary efficacy endpoint is the OS of subjects randomise d 
to irinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV compared to subjects randomised to 
nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine.  
7.2 Secondary E fficacy Endpoints and Evaluations  
7.2.1 Time to Event Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are PFS and ORR. These are defined  in Section 3.2.2 . These 
endpoints will onl y be evaluated if the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrates su periority for 
irinotecan liposome injection+ oxaliplatin+5 FU/LV over nab pacl itaxel+gemcitabine. 
Investigator -assessed tumour response will be used in efficacy analysis . 
7.3 Exploratory Efficacy En dpoints and Evaluations  
The exploratory endpoints TTF, DOR and TTR are described in Sec tions 3.3.3 , 3.3.4  and 3.3.5 , 
respectively. These will be sum marised as described in the stat istical analysis plan (SAP).  
The PRO exploratory endpoi nts are as follows:  
• Assess time to deterioration or worsening of subjects  physical functioning, disease 
related symptoms and treatment related symptoms of interest usi ng the European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality -of-life-core qu estionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ -C30) and,  specific pancreatic cancer module (QLQ -PAN26 ) 
questionnaire and PRO  of Common Terminology Criteria  of Adverse Events ( CTCAE)  
• Assess time to deterioration or worsening on remaining QoL subs cales of QLQ -C30 and 
QLQ -PAN26  
• Compare % of subjects with stable, improved or worsened QoL sco res as assessed by 
QLQ -C30, QLQ -PAN26 and PRO -CTCAE  
• Summarise  HRQoL score at each visit as assessed by QLQ -C30, QLQ -PAN26, 
PRO -CTCAE and EQ -5D-5L. 
EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -PAN26 questionnaire data  will be collected to assess how 
subjects’ functioning, disease -related symptoms and treatment -related symptoms are affected 
by treatment with irinotecan li posome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV in comparison with 
nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine.  
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a generic questionnaire that has been developed and vali dated to 
assess the QoL of cancer patients. The QLQ -PAN26 is a disease -specific module that 
complements the QLQ -C30 questionnaire to capture concepts that are specific to panc reatic 
cancer (all disease stages) such as jaundice, digestive function, decr eased muscle strength. It 
has not yet undergone psychometric testing in a large internati onal group of subjects, but 
pre-testing has already been conducted and it is currently tested i n interna tional clinical trials. 
The QoL questionnaires should be completed in a language that i s understood by the subject. 
The sponsor (or delegate) is to be consulted should a subject b e illiterate or not understanding 
local language for advice.  
Scoring will be performed as described in the EORTC QLQ -C30 scoring manual [ EORTC 
QLQ -C30, 2001 ]. Scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for the global heal th status/QoL 
representing a high QoL; a high score for the functional scale representing a high/healthy level 
of functioning; but a high score for a symptom scale/item repre senting a high level of 
symptomatology/problems.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time that the subject  gives informed consent until 
30 days after the last dose of study medication (see Section  3.7 for a definition of the study 
duration) and will be elicited by direct, nonleading questionin g. Further details for AE reporting 
can be found in Section  8.1.4  and 8.1.5 . 
Reference information for safety of study medication is listed at the beginning of Section  18. 
8.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or  the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a phar maceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product. An u ndesirable medical condition can 
be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia,  enlarged live r) or the abnormal 
results of an investigation (e.g.  laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies an AE can includ e 
an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, includi ng run in or washout periods, 
even if no study medication has been administ ered.  
This definition includes events occurring from the time of the subject giving informed consent 
until 30 days after last study medication administration (as de fined in Section  3.7).  
Natural progression or deteriorati on of the disease under study  will be recorded as part of the 
efficacy evaluation and should not be recorded as an AE/SAE.  
Death due to disease progression will be recorded as part  of the efficacy evaluation and will not 
be regarded as an SAE.  
Signs and symptoms should not be reported as AEs/SAEs if they a re clearly related to a relapse 
or an expected change or progression of the baseline disease.  
These signs and symptoms should only be reported as AEs/SAEs (depending on the 
investigator’s judgement) if they are:  
• Judged by the investigator to be unusually severe or accelerate d disease, or  
• If the investigator considers the deterioration of disease sign s and symptoms to be caused 
directly by the IMP.  
If there is any uncertainty about an AE being due solely to the  disease under study, it should be 
reported as an AE/SAE as appropriate.  
8.1.2 Categorisation of Adverse Events  
8.1.2.1  Intensity Classification  
Adverse events will be recorded and graded according to NCI -CTCAE (Version 5.0). In view 
of meta -analyses and for conversion purposes, the following conversion mapping will apply if 
the NCI -CTCAE scale is not available for a given AE:  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 corresponds to mild,  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 corresp onds to moderate,  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 corresponds to severe,  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 4 corresponds to life threatening/disabling,  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 5 corresponds to death (related to AE).  
Where:  
• Mild : symptoms do not alter the subject’s normal functioning  
• Moderate : symptoms produce some degree of impairment to function, but are  not 
hazardous, uncomfortable or embarrassing to the subject  3URWRFRO$XJ_

PROTOCOL: VERSION 5. 0 WITH AMENDMENT #4 – 19 AUGUST 2021  PAGE 74  
• Severe : symptoms definitely hazardous to wellbeing or causing signifi cant impairment 
of function or incapacitation.  
• Life threatening : any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred, i.e. it does not include a reaction that,  had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death (also see Section  8.1.5 ). 
8.1.2.2  Causality Classification  
The relationship of an AE will be assessed for each drug of the  regimen  for each arm and will 
be classified according to the following:  
• Related : reports i ncluding good reasons and sufficient information (e.g.  plausible time 
sequence, dose response relationship, pharmacology, positive de challenge and/or 
rechallenge) to assume a causal relationship with each drug of the regimen  in the sense 
that it is plausib le, conceivable or likely.  
• Not related : reports including good reasons and sufficient information (e. g. implausible 
time sequence and/or attributable to concurrent disease or othe r drugs) to rule out a causal 
relationship with each drug of the regimen.  
8.1.2.3  Assessment of Expectedness  
The reference document for each study medication for assessing expectedness of AEs/event in 
this study is listed at the beginning of Section 18. 
8.1.2.4  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Abnormalities in laboratory test values should only be reported  as AEs if any of the following 
apply:  
• They result in a change in study medication schedule of a dministration (change in 
dosage, delay in administration, study medication discontinuati on), 
• They require intervention or a diagnosis evaluation to assess t he risk to the subject,  
• They are SAEs,  
• They are considered as clinically significant by the investig ator. 
8.1.2.5  Abnormal Physical Examination Findings  
Clinically significant changes, in the judgement of the investi gator, in physical examination 
findings (abnormalities) will be recorded as AEs.   
8.1.2.6  Other Investigation Abnormal Findings  
Abnormal test findings judge d by the investigator as clinically significant (e.g. ECG chang es) 
that result in a change in stud y medication dosage or administr ation schedule, or in 
discontinuation of the study medication, or require interventio n or diagnostic evaluation to 
assess the risk to the subject, should be recorded as AEs.   
8.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study includ e: 
• Thrombo -embolic events, NCI -CTCAE Grade 1 to 5  
These events must be collected in the CRF using the AESI r eporting option on the AE page of 
the eCRF. If they meet the seriousness criteria, they should al so be reported as SAEs (refer to 
Section  8.1.5 ). 
8.1.4 Reco rding and Follow -up of Adverse Events  
At each visit, the subject should be asked a nonleading questio n such as: “How have you felt 
since the last visit?”  3URWRFRO$XJ_

 CONFIDENTIAL  
PROTOCOL: VERSION 5. 0 WITH AMENDMENT #4 – 19 AUGUST 2021  PAGE 75  
All AEs, regardless of treatment group or suspected causal rela tionship to study medication, 
will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the eCRF. Events involving drug r eactions, accidents, 
illnesses with onset during the treatment phase of the study (i .e. from signing consent up to 
30 days after last study medication administration), or exacerbati ons of pre -existing illnesses 
should be recorded according to the NCI terminology if applicab le. Any AEs already recorded 
and designated as ‘continuing’ s hould be reviewed at each subse quent assessment.  
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain informatio n adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criter ia for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to the sponsor or its designat ed representative. For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtain ed by the investigator to determine the causality of the 
AE (i.e. study medication or other illness). The investigator i s required to assess causality and 
record that assessment in the source documentation and the eCRF. Follow -up of the AE, after 
the date of study medication discontinuation, is required if the AE or i ts sequelae persist. 
Follow -up is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabi lise at a level acceptable to 
the investigator and the sponsor’s clinical monitor or his/her designate d representative.  
8.1.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs (as defined below), regardless of treatment group or s uspected relationship to study 
medication, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of th e investigator or staff becoming 
aware of the  event) using the SAE reporting option on the AE page of the eCRF. In c ase of no 
access to eCRF then a paper SAE form should be completed and em ailed to 
. If the immediate report is submitted by telephone or using th e paper 
SAE form , then this must be followed by reports using the eCRF.  
An SAE  is any AE that:  
(1) Results in death  
(2) Is life threatening, that is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event tha t, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death  
(3) Results in in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisa tion, excluding 
admission for social or administrative reasons (see below)  
(4) Results in a persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity, where disability is a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functio ns 
(5) Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received the 
study medication  
(6) Is an important medical event th at may not result in death, be life  threatening, or require 
hospitalisation when, based upon appropriate medical judgement,  it may jeopardise the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definit ion. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchosp asm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospitalisation, or the development of drug 
dependency or dru g abuse.  
In addition to the above criteria, any suspected or confirmed c oronavirus COVID -19 
(SARS -CoV -2) infection should be considered serious and be immediately re ported to the 
sponsor. The seriousness criteria should be “other medically si gnificant” if no other seriousness 
criteria are present (e.g. hospitalisation).  
• Hospitalisation  is defined as any in -patient admission (even if less than 24  hours). For 
chronic or long -term in -patients, in -patient admission also includes transfer within the 
hospital to an acute/intensive care in -patient unit.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

• Prolongation of hospitalisation  is defined as any extension of an in -patient 
hospitalisation beyond the stay anticipated/required in relatio n to the original reason for 
the initial admission, as determined by the in vestigator or treating physician . For 
protocol -specified hospitalisation in clinical studies, prolongation is defined as any 
extension beyond the length of stay described in the protocol. Prolongation in the absence 
of a precipitating, treatment emergent, clinical AE (i.e. not associated with the 
development of a new AE or worsening of a pre -existing condition) may meet the criteria 
for “seriousness” but is not an adverse experience and thus is not subject to immediate 
reporting to the sponsor.  
• Preplanned or elective treatments/surgical procedures should be noted in t he subject’s 
screening documentation. Hospitalisation for a preplanned or el ective treatment/surgical 
procedure should not be reported as an SAE unless there are com plications or sequelae 
which  meet the criteria for seriousness described above.  
Any SAE must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator or staff becoming 
aware of the event), using the SAE reporting option on the AE page of the eCRF. In c ase of no 
access to eCRF the n a paper SAE form should be completed and emailed to the email  specified 
at the beginning of this protocol, independent of the circumsta nces or suspected cause, if it 
occurs or comes to the attention of the investigator at any tim e during the study period . 
Any AE/SAE with a suspected causal relationship to study medication administration occurring 
at any other time after completion of the study must be reporte d promptly.  
The following information is the minimum that must be provided to the sponsor within 2 4hours 
for each SAE:  
• study number  
• centre number  
• subject number  
• AE 
• investigator's name and contact details.  
The additional information included in the SAE page or form mus t be provided to the sponsor 
or representative as soon as it is available. The invest igator should always provide an 
assessment of causality for each event reported to the sponsor.  Upon receipt of the initial report, 
the sponsor will ask for the investigator's causality assessmen t if it was not provided with the 
initial report.  
The investi gator should report a diagnosis or a syndrome rather than indiv idual signs or 
symptoms. The investigator should also try to separate a primar y AE considered as the foremost 
untoward medical occurrence from secondary AEs which occurred a s complications.  
8.1.6 Pregnancy  
Information regarding pregnancies must be collected as an SAE o n the AE page of the eCRF 
and reported to the sponsor wit hin 24 hours as described in Sec tion 8.1.5.  
If pregnancy occurs during the study, the outcome of the pregna ncy will be collect ed following 
completion of the study and it may be necessary to discontinue administration of the IMP.  
The sponsor will request further information from the investiga tor as to the course and outcome 
of the pregnancy using the Standard Pregnancy Outcome Re port Form.  
The investigator must instruct all female subjects to inform th em immediately should they 
become pregnant during the study. The investigator should couns el the subject, discuss the risks 
of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects  on the foetus. Monitoring of the 
subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy, whic h may involve follow -up after 
the subject’s involvement in the study has ended.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

PROTOCOL: VERSION 5. 0 WITH AMENDMENT #4 – 19 AUGUST 2021  PAGE 77  
Pregnancies with a conception date within 7  months after a female subject’s las t dose of study 
medication must also be reported to the investigator for onward  reporting to the sponsor.  
If the investigator becomes aware of a pregnancy occurring in t he partner of a male subject 
participating in the study, this should be reported to the  sponsor as described above. Pregnancies 
in the partner with a conception date until 6  months after subject’s last dose of study medication 
should be reported after the partner has given written consent and the partner should be 
counselled and followed as described above. Monitoring of th e partner should continue unti l 
conclusion of the pregnancy.  
8.1.7 Deaths  
For AEs leading to death, NCI CTCAE Grade 5 is the only appropr iate grade 
(see Section  8.1.2.1 ). Deaths that cannot be attributed to an NCI CTCAE term associ ated with 
Grade  5 or that cannot be reported within an NCI CTCAE category as ‘O ther’ have to be 
reported as one of these four AE options:  
• death n ot otherwise specified (NOS)  
• multi -organ failure  
• sudden death.  
8.1.8 Discontinuation/Withdrawal due to Ad verse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
Discontinuation/withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished f rom 
discontinuation/withdrawal due to insufficient response to the study medication (see 
Section  4.3). 
If the study medication is discontinued due to an SAE, it must be reported immediately to the 
sponsor’s designated representative (see Section  8.1.5 ). 
In case of suspected or confirmed COVID -19 infection, the administration of study medication 
may be temporarily discontinued depending on the subject clinic al presentation. In some cases, 
the investigator may request a subject be retested before the  administration of study medication 
is resumed. The decision to restart a subject’s study treatment  will be managed on an individual 
subject basis per the sponsor (or delegate).  
In all cases, the investigator must ensure that the subject rec eives appropria te medical follow -up 
(see Section  8.1.4 ). 
8.1.9 Reporting to Competent Authorities /IECs/IRBs/Other Investigators  
The sponsor will ensure that processes are in place for the  submission of reports of suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) occurring during the study to the CAs, IECs 
and other investigators concerned by the study medication . Reporting will be in accordance 
with the applicable regulatory requirem ents. 
8.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Full details regarding the required processing, labelling, ship ment and destruction processes for 
these samples are provided i n the laboratory manual.  
Blood samples will be collected at screening, prior to each dos ing visit and at the EoT follow -up 
visit (as per Table  5) for the evaluation of haematology and chemistry. As described i n 
Section  6.2.3 , ANC, WBC and platelets results must be obtained and reviewed prior to each 
dosing.   
The investigator will review the safety laboratory test results , document the review and record 
any c linically relevant changes occurring or observed during the stu dy in the source 
documentation and in the AE section of the eCRF (see Section  8.1.2.4  for abnormal laboratory 
tests that should be recorded as AEs).  3URWRFRO$XJ_

All clinically relevant abnormal laboratory tests occurring dur ing the study will be repeated at 
appropriate intervals until they return to baseline or to a lev el deemed acceptable by the 
investigator and the sponsor’s clinical monitor (or his/her designa ted representative) or until the 
abnormality is explained by an appropriate diagnosis.  
8.2.1 Haematology  
Haematology samples will be analysed at each site’s local labor atory and results must be 
available and reviewed prior to dosing . 
Blood samples will be collected to assess the following variabl es: haemoglobin, WBC count 
with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinop hils, basophils and others), 
platelet count and coagulation (Prothr ombin Time with International Normalised Ratio and 
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time).  
8.2.2 Blood Biochemistry  
Serum samples for blood biochemistry must be analysed centrally  but can also be analysed 
locally in the case of requiring timely results for medical man agement. Centrally assessed 
biochemistry is required to conf irm eligibility. If local labor atory results are required, the local 
laboratory ranges for ULN and lower lim its of normal (LLN) should be included in the 
reporting. Central laboratory samples should always be taken, e ven if local laboratory samples 
have also been taken:  
• creatinine, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin  
• sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate  
• alkal ine phosphatase, AST, ALT, gamma glutamyl transferase  
• albumin, total protein.  
8.2.3 UGT1A1*28 Genotyping  
A whole blood sample will be collected and assessed centrally a t baseline to test for 
UGT1A1(TA) repeat polymorphism, which includes UGT1A1*28 allele  status.  The result is 
not needed prior to the initial  dose of irinotecan liposome inj ection.  
8.2.4 CA19 -9 Biomarker  
Blood samples will be collected and assessed centrally througho ut the study for the assay of 
CA19 -9 biomarker levels. The CA19 -9 biomarker levels will b e collected for all subjects as per 
Table  5. 
8.2.5 Pregnancy Test  
A urine or beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) serum test will be performed locally for 
all female sub jects of childbearing potential as per Table  5. Any positive urine pregnancy test 
must be confirmed via serum β -HCG. Exempt female subjects will include those who have 
undergone a bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy or who are 
menopausal (defined as absence of a menstrual cycle for at leas t 2 years). Any subject becoming 
pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. All pregnancies th at oc cur during the study are to 
be reported as described in Section  8.1.6 . 
8.2.6 Urinalysis  
Urinalysis (dipstick) will be completed locally and undertaken as per schedule of assessments 
in Table  5. 
8.2.7 Dihydropyrimidine De hydrogenase Testing  
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) testing, where required b y local  regulations, will be

DPD activity will not be enrol led in this study.  
8.3 Physical Examination  
Physical examinations, including neurological examination will be conducted as per schedule 
of assessment s in Table  5. 
Any clinically significant physical examination findings (abnor malities) observed during the 
study will be reporte d as AEs. Any physical  examination findings (abnormalities) persisting at 
the end of the study will be followed by the investigator until  resolution or until reaching a 
clinically stable endpoint.  
8.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include height (at screening only) weight, res ting b lood pressure, pulse and 
temperature. BSA is calculated within 2 days before D1 and  D15 of each cycle before treatment 
administration.  
8.5 Electrocardiography  
The ECGs will be recorded at the timepoints described in Table  5, including footnotes 
specifying the different requirements for Arm  1 and Arm  2.  
Any clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded as AE s. 
A 12 -lead ECG will include a de scription of the cardiac rate, rhythm, interval durations and an 
overall clinical interpretation. If the ECG is abnormal, clinic al significance or non -significance 
should be indicated. Any QTc prolongation that occurs in the se tting of diarrhoea induced 
electrolyte imbalance shoul d be treated with appropriate electrolyte repletion. Once the 
underlying abnormality is corrected and the ECG abnormalities h ave reversed, treatment may 
continue under careful monitoring and with appropriate dose mod ification for diarrhoea as 
described in Appendices  2 and 3. 
8.6 Performance Status  
The ECOG performance status will be recorded at the timepoints in Table  5. The ECOG will 
be assessed by the investigator or his/her designee via questio ning of the subject about their 
functional capabilities. See Appendix 6  for ECOG.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

9.1 Pharmacokinetics  
9.1.1 Sample Collection  
For subjects in Arm 1, blood samples for the determination of t otal irinotecan, SN -38, 5 -FU 
and oxaliplatin plasma concentrations will be collected at the timepoints indicated in Table 7. 
Additional analytes which may impact the PK of irinotecan lipos ome injection may also be 
measured from this sample.  
During the study, the nominal sample colle ction times may be changed, but the total number of 
samples will not increase. The exact dates and times of blood s ample collection, study 
medication administration must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Directions for collection, processing and shipping the PK pla sma samples can be found in the 
laboratory  manual. Full details regarding the destruction processes for th ese samples are 
documented in the PK Sample Management Plan.  
The number of draws (and consequently the number of aliquots co llected) are detailed in Table 
7. 
Irinotecan and SN -38 levels will be measured in a same aliquot. 5 -FU and oxaliplatin levels 
will be measured in different aliquots.  
• Sample 1: three aliquots w ill be collected for irinotecan and SN -38, 5 -FU, oxaliplatin 
determination  
• Sample 2: one aliquot will be c ollected for irinotecan and SN -38 determination  
• Sample 3: two aliquots will be collected for irinotecan and SN -38, oxaliplatin 
determination  
• Sample 4:  three aliquots will be collected for irinotecan and SN -38, 5 -FU, oxaliplatin 
determination  
• Sample 5: two aliquots will be collected for irinotecan and SN -38, oxaliplatin 
determination  
• Sample 6: two aliquots will be collected for irinotecan and SN -38, oxal iplatin

9.1.2 Analytical Procedures  
Plasma samples will be analysed  to determine concentrations of total irinotecan, SN -38, 5 -FU 
and oxaliplatin using validated, specific and sensitive liquid chromatography -mass 
spectrometry methods.   
9.1.3 Use of Samples After Study Completion  
Leftover samples (plasma) may be used, during the course of the  study, or after completion of 
the study to develop new laboratory tests (such as sample stabi lity assessment, analytical 
comedication interference or cr oss-validation of the bioanalytical method or other bioanalytical 
assessments such as additional analytes that may impact the pha rmacokinetics of the drug). If 
the subject consents to this, the samples will be stored up to 1 year after the end of the study  in 
a bioanalytical contracted resea rch organisation (CRO) contract ed by the sponsor. Subjects will 
be informed that they are free to refuse to participate and may  withdraw their consent at any 
time and for any reason during the storage period.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

10 EXPLORATORY  BIOMARKERS AND BIOB ANKING  
Biobanking sample collection is optional, requiring separate op tional informed consent from 
participants (see Section  14.2.1 ). Samples for biobanking will be collected as follows:  
• Archived tumour samples at baseline, if available  
• Whole blood for DNA (2.5 mL)  
• Whole blood for RNA (2.5 mL)  
• Whole blood for plasma (4 mL)  
• Stool sample  
• Whole blood for circulating free DNA (10 mL) . 
An additional 16.5 to 19  mL of blood will be collected from subjects who have signed the  
optional biobanking informed consent. This will be taken prior to treatment dosing, for a total 
of 19  mL at Cycle 1 Day 1 and 16.5  mL at Day 1 of every other cycle ( C3D1, C5D1, C7D1 
etc). Whole blood (for DNA, RNA, circulating free DNA and plasm a) and stool samples will 
be collected as follows in both Arm 1 and Arm  2: 
• At baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) prior to treatment dosing: whole bl ood samples (for DNA, 
RNA, circulating  free DNA and plasma) and stool sample.  
• At Day  1 of every other additional cycle (i.e. C3D1, C5D1, etc) prior to treatment dosing: 
whole blood samples (for  RNA, circulating free DNA and plasma) and stool sample.  
Instructions for collection, processing, han dling and shipment of the biobanking samples will 
be outlined in the laboratory manual. Full details regarding th e destruction processes for these 
samples are documented in the Biobanking Sample Management Plan . 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
The biobanked samples will be stored for up to 15 years from the end of the study to be made 
available for future research towards further understanding of:   
(1) treatment response including, but not limited to, the safety pr ofile 
(2) drug treatment mode of actions, and  
(3) disease understanding.  
Samples will be archived in a central biorepository designated by the sponso r and according to 
local administration regulations and/or the EMA and will not ca rry personal identification 
(e.g. social security number or name). Analysis of additional biomark ers (including  potential 
genetic research) from the biobank samples will be performed ou tside the scope of the main 
study and reported separately.  
Only people designated by the sponsor will be allowed access to  the samples. All information 
collected will be kept strictl y confidential and all clinical information will be de -identified. This 
means that no personally identifiable information will be retai ned with the results of the 
exploratory analyses, so that no individual or collective resul ts will be linked to the indiv idual 
subject whose sample was taken in the study. No individual gene tic results will be 
communicated to the investigator or subject unless required by local regulation.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

11 STATISTICS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of th e data collected in this study 
will be documented in the SAP, which will be dated and complete d before first subject being 
randomised. The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol;  however, any major 
modifications of the primary e ndpoint and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment.  
Statistical evaluation will be performed using Statistical Anal ysis System (SAS)® (Version  9.3 
or higher)  
11.1 Analysis Populations  
The following populations will be used during statistical analy ses: 
• Screened population : All subjects screened (i.e. who signed the informed consent).  
• Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population : This pop ulation includes all randomised subjects 
who have given their informed consent. A subject is randomised (after informed consent 
has been provided ) if there is confirmation of successful allocation of a random isation 
number through the study treatment alloc ation system (I WRS ). This population is the 
primary population for all efficacy parameters. All analyses us ing this population will be 
based on the treatment assigned by I WRS .  
• Safety population: The safety population is a subset of the ITT population that  received 
at least one dose (including a partial dose) of any study medication. This population is 
for safety analyses. All analyses using this population will be  based on the treatment 
actually received.  
• Per protocol (PP) population : This is a subset of t he ITT population. It includes subjects 
who have no major protocol deviations (i.e. that could potentia lly affect the primary 
efficacy analysis for the subject) as described in the protocol  deviations document. 
Subjects will be analysed as randomised.  
• PRO  population: All subjects of the randomised ITT population that have provide d 
baseline and at least one subsequent assessment on each PRO instrument . 
• Pharmacokinetics population : All subjects who received at least one irinotecan 
liposome injection and who have at least one plasma concen tration and no major protocol 
deviations affecting PK variables.  
11.1.1  Populations Analysed  
The final analysis based on the primary efficacy endpoint will be perform ed on the 
ITT population. In addition, PP analysis may be performe d as secondary/confirmatory.  
The analyses of safety data will be performed based on the safe ty population.  
11.1.2  Reasons for Exclusion from the Analyses  
Any major protocol deviation (see Section  13.1.2  for definition) will be described and its impact 
on inclusion in each analysis population (ITT, PP and safety po pulations) for any subject will 
be specified. The final list of protocol deviat ions impacting the safety, ITT and PP populations 
will be reviewed prior to database lock. The list may be update d, up to the point of database 
lock, to include any additional major protocol deviations impac ting inclusion in the PP 
population.  
11.2 Sample Size Determination  
The primary objective of this study is to compare OS in subject s treated with irinotecan 
liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV to OS in subjects treated with

PROTOCOL: VERSION 5. 0 WITH AMENDMENT #4 – 19 AUGUST 2021  PAGE 85  
Approximately 750 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1  ratio to the two treatment arms. 
Accounting for the planned interim analysis, follow -up until at least 543  OS events are observed 
across the two treatment arms provides at least 90% power to de tect a true HR ≤0.75 (modified  
OS: 9 versus 12 months) using a  stratified log rank test with overall 1 -sided significance level 
of 0.025 (adjusted for interim analysis). The study plans to en rol 750 subjects, with expected 
follow -up time for the final analysis at 15 months from the last subject enrolled to the 543 rd 
OS event. For operational purposes, the expected timing of the final analysis triggering event 
will be periodically projected using blinded study data regardl ess of treatment arm. The sample 
size may be increased if a review of the accumulating OS events  suggests that the timing of the 
final analysis will be extended. If blinded projection of the accumul ating OS events suggests 
that the number required for the final analysis will not be reached (due to censoring) within 
32 months of study initiation, the sa mple size may be increased up to 800 subjects or until 
prespecified events are met, whichever comes earlier. The proje ction to inform the decision to 
potentially increase the number of subjects will be carried out  within 3 months prior to expected 
completi on of planned enrolment of 750 subjects . 
Assuming enrolment over 16 months increasing to approximately 6 2 subjects per month and 
lost-to-follow -up rate of 5% across both treatment arms, the timing of the int erim analysis is 
expected to be at 24 months afte r the first subject treated and the timing of the final analysis, 
estimated via simulation, is expected to be at 36.5  months after the first subject treated.  
11.3 Significance Testing and Estimations  
The evaluation of the primary endpoint OS includes an interim  analysis for futility and efficacy, 
and a final analysis with a prospective error -spending plan to control the overall type I error 
rate at a one -sided 0.025 level and overall type II error rate at 0.100 level . The interim analysis 
is planned when at leas t 272 OS events (i.e. 50% of information time) have been observ ed in 
the ITT population. If the OS analysis does not indicate futili ty at interim analysis, the final 
analysis is planned when 543  OS events are observed.  
An alpha and beta spending function a ccording to Hwang -Shi-Decani (HSD) γalpha= -4 and 
γbeta= -1 will be utilised to control type I and type II error for the OS comparison. In the 
computation of the type I error rate, futility analyses are con sidered non -binding. Since the 
futility and efficacy  boundary is dependent on the number of OS events, the actual bo undary 
used will be re -calculated, incorporating the spending function as defined, bas ed on the number 
of actual OS events analysed a t the time of analysis. P -boundary will be used as the crit eria for 
the formal statistical inference.  
The interim analysis specifications per the plan are provided i n Table  8.

nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine. Investigator -assessed tumour respo nse will be used in secondary 
efficacy analyses. If the primary endpoint of OS is declared si gnificant at the interim, secondary 
endpoints will be tested at the interim. Otherwise, secondary e fficacy endpoints will be tested 
at the final analysis if OS is found to be statistically significant at that analysis. Hypothe sis 
testing of secondary endpoints will be conducted in a stagewise  hierarchical manner 
incorporating alpha spending for each endpoint using HSD γ alpha= -4, similar to that specified 
for the primary efficacy  analysis. The nominal level for each comparison will depend on 
whether the analysis is carried out at the interim or at the pl anned final analysis.  
The first endpoint in the hierarchy of secondary endpoints will  be PFS. If OS and PFS are bot h 
significant, then ORR would be tested. Any parameter which is n ot formally tested for 
significance (per the hierarchy) will be regarded as descriptiv e and exploratory.  
11.4 Statistical/Analytical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be performed by an external C RO, managed by the sponsor’s biometry 
department. All planned efficacy and safety analyses will be do ne using SAS®. 
Categorical variables will be summarised  by frequency distributions (number and percentage 
of subjects). Continuous variables may be summari sed by a clinically relevant discretisation  
of the variable.  
All CIs for parameters to be estimated will be constructed with  a significance level α =0.05 (i.e. 
a 95% CI). Additional exploratory  analyses may be conducted as deemed appropriate.  
The interpret ation of study results will be the responsibility of a sponsor physician and 
statistician. The sponsor’s  phy sician and statistician will al so be responsible for the appropriate 
conduct of an internal review process for both the final study report and any study related 
material to be authorised  by the sponsor for publication.  
11.4.1  Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD ), median, minimum, 
maximum) or frequency c ounts of demographic and baseline data will be presented by 
treatment group on the ITT population. No formal statistical an alysis will be performed on these 
data.  
Subject characteristics will  be summarised and compared between  study treatment arms.  
This will include a comparison o n: 
• Subject demographics  
• Baseline disease characteristics  
• Baseline disease -related symptoms  
• Pre-existing conditions  
• Prior and concomitant drugs ongoing at baseline . 
Additional subject characterist ics may be summarised and compar ed between Arm 1 and Arm  2 
as deemed appropriate.  
Unless prohibited by local regulation, race and ethnicity will be collected to ensure data 
robustness for safety and efficacy evaluation and to prevent ad verse reactions or improve 
benefits in the target population.  
11.4.2  Subject Disposition  and Withdrawals  
The numbers and percentages of subjects enrolled and included i n each of the ITT and safety 
populations will be tabulated. In addition, the numbers of subj ects who were randomised, 
treated, discontinued and compl eted at each of the study p eriods will be tabulated by treatment 
group. Primary reasons for discontinuation of study treatment w ill be tabulated.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

11.4.3  Pharmacokinetic Data  
11.4.3.1  Listing s and Summary Statistics of Concentrations  
Individual plasma concentrations for total irinotecan, SN -38, 5 -FU and oxaliplatin will be listed 
and summarised by timepoint and dose level using descriptive st atistics for continuous variables 
(number of availab le observations, mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum, geometric mean 
and geometric coefficient of variation assuming log -normally distributed data).  
Linear and semilogarithmic plots of individual and mean plasma concentration -time profiles of 
irinotecan an d SN -38 as well as spaghetti plots will be reported.  
11.4.3.2  Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis  
Plasma concentrations of total irinotecan and SN -38 will be used to characterise their 
corresponding PK parameters, in co -administration with 5 -FU and oxaliplatin, using a nonlinear 
mixed effects approach. If warranted by the data, parameters re ported after single dose could 
include, but not be limited to:

• Maximum observed plasma drug concentration (C max) 
• Concentration at the end of the dosing interval (C trough) 
• Time to maximum observed plasma drug concentration (t max) 
• Area Under the plasma concentration ̻time curve over the dosing interval (AUC Tau) 
If warranted by the data, plasma concentrations for 5 -FU and/or oxaliplatin will be used to 
calculate individual PK parameter s after single dose. These may include, but not be limited to:  
• Total clearance of drug from plasma  
• Area Under the plasma concentration ̻time curve over the dosing interval (AUC Tau) 
A full description of the analysi s of the concentration data wi ll be captur ed separately in a data 
analysis plan, and PK results will be reported in a standalone report.  
11.4.3.3   Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Relationship  
Graphical exploration will be performed to investigate any rela tionship between PK and 
pharmacodynamic endpoints (efficacy, safety) . If a trend is shown, PK/ PD modelling will be 
performed and this will be described in a separate Data Analysi s Plan and reported in a 
standalone report.  
11.4.4  Efficacy Evaluation  
11.4.4.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary endpoint of this study is OS, which is defined as t he time from the date of subject 
randomisation to date of death or the date last known alive. Fo r each subject who is not known 
to have died as of the data -inclusion cut -off date for a particul ar analysis, OS will be censored 
for that analysis at the date of last contact prior to the data  cut-off date.  
The OS for each treatment arm will be summarised by median surv ival time (including 
95% CIs) from Kaplan -Meier estimation. The Kaplan Meier curve  for survival will be presented 
for each treatment arm. Stratified analyses based on the random isation stratification factors 
from the IWRS  data will be used in all stratified analyses for treatment comp arisons on the ITT 
population. Differences in the OS curves will be tested using a stratified log -rank test. The 
estimated treatment effect for Arm 1 will be summarised by the HR (including 95% CI) from 
stratified Cox regression analysis.  
The following additional sensitivity analyses may be carried ou t for OS on the ITT population 
and/or PP population to evaluate the robustness of the final analysis results:  
• log-rank comparisons of treatments on the PP population  
• Wilcoxon comparisons of treatments on the ITT population and PP  population  
• log-rank test compari sons of treatments with OS censored at the date where any 
post-treatment anti -cancer therapy is first administered on the ITT population  
• Cox regression model with stepwise selection (p value to enter <0.25, p -value to remain 
<0.15) of model terms where tre atment and the prognostic factors (noted below) are 
candidates for inclusion  
• univariate analyses to evaluate potential independent prognosti c factors using Cox 
regression.  
Subgroup analyses will also be performed to examine differences  in the effects of tr eatment in 
different segments of the study population.  
Prognostic factors to be examined may include: baseline ECOG, b aseline albumin, ethnicity, 
geographic location, disease stage at diagnosis, original tumour  location, prior radiotherapy, 
prior surgery, time since last treatment, best response on prior treatment, ba seline CA  19-9, 
gender and age.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

11.4.4.2  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The secondary efficacy endpoints (PFS and ORR) will only be eva luated if the primary efficacy 
endpoint demonstrates superiority for i rinotecan liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV over 
nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine. Investigator -assessed tumour response will be used in the 
secondary efficacy analyses.  
The PFS is defined as time from the date of randomisation to th e date of death or progr ession, 
whichever occurred earlier (per RECIST Version 1.1). If neither  death nor progression is 
observed, data will be censored on the date of the last evaluab le tumour assessment.  
General censoring rules for the analysis of PFS are described b elow:  
• Subje cts who receive non -protocol therapy before a PFS event (documented progression 
or death) will be right censored at the date of the last evalua ble tumour assessment prior 
to the date of initiation of s ubsequent therapy/surgery  
• Subjects who have not experie nced a PFS event (and are not otherwise censored) at the 
time of data cut-off will be right censored on the date of their last evaluable tumo ur 
assessment post randomisation  that is on or prior to the data cut-off. If there is no such 
tumour assessment pos t randomisation , the subject will be right censored on the date of 
randomisation  
• Subjects who miss two or more scheduled tumour assessments foll owed by a PFS event 
will be right censored on the date of their most -recent tumour assessment prior to the 
missing assessments.  
Detailed censoring rules and sensitivity analyses will be speci fied in the SAP. 
For each arm, PFS will be estimated by Kaplan -Meier methodology. Treatment arms will be 
compared for PFS using stratified log -rank test and the estimated HR from stratified Cox 
regression analysis will be prese nted to summarise the effect o f Arm 1. Estimates of median 
PFS and HR will be presented with corresponding 95% CIs. In add ition, different censoring 
and missing data imputing methods may be used to perform sensit ivity analyses on PFS. 
Methodology for the sensitivity analyses will be fu lly specified in the SAP.  
Analysis of PFS will be performed for ITT and PP populations.  
The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a BOR of confirmed complete response 
or partial response per RECIST Version 1.1. BOR is defined as t he best respon se as recorded 
from randomisation until documented objective disease progressi on using RECIST Version 1.1. 
To classify BOR as stable disease, there should be a qualifying  stable disease assessment at 
least 8 weeks from randomisation.  
The ORR of irinotecan  liposome injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV arm will be compared to the 
nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine arm. Differences in ORR between Arm 1 an d Arm  2 will be 
provided with 95% CIs. A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test, adjusting by randomisation strata, 
will be used to  compare ORR. Analysis of ORR will be performed for ITT and PP p opulations.  
11.4.4.3  Patient -Reported Outcomes Analysis  
The PRO exploratory endpoints are described in Section 7.3. 
Analyses of quality of life is an exploratory analysis that wil l be carried out on treated subjects 
who provide baseline and at least one post -baseline assessment (i.e. there will be 
instrument -specific analysis populations). EORTC QLQ -C30, QLQ -PAN26, EQ -5D-5L and 
PRO -CTCAE results will be summarised at each visit by treatment gro up. More details of the 
PRO analyses will be provided in the SAP.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

11.4.5  Safety Evaluation  
The safety endpoints are indicated in Section  3.2.3 . 
All safety data will be included in the subject data listings. Analyses and summary tables will 
be based upon the safety population.  
All AEs will be coded according to MedDRA  Version 22.0 or later and will be classified by 
MedDRA preferred term and system organ class. Adverse event lis tings will be presented by 
subject, system organ class and preferred term.  
The incidence of all reported TEAE and SAEs will be tabulated b y arm and overall. In addition, 
summary tables will be presented by maximum severity (per NCI -CTCAE) drug relationship 
and TEAEs associated with premature discontinuation of study tr eatment. All the safety data 
will be described by grade  (all grades and Grade 3 and higher).  
A TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs during the active phase  of the study (between first 
dose of study medication and 30 days after the end of study tre atment) if:  
• it was not present prior to receiving the first dose of study m edication, o r 
• it was present prior to receiving the first dose of study medic ation but the grade increased 
or became serious during the active phase of the study, or  
• it was present prior to receiving the first dose of study medic ation, the grade/seriousness 
is the sam e but the causality changed to “ related” during the active phas e of the study.  
All TEAEs will be flagged in the AEs listings.  
Summary statistics (mean, median, SD and range as appropriate) will be presented by treatment 
group and overall  for vital signs, b lood pressure, heart rate, ECG variables, clinical laboratory 
tests etc. at each assessment, with change from baseline. For l aboratory data, abnormal values 
will be flagged in the data listings and a list of clinically s ignificant abnormal values will be 
presented. Shift tables will be presented for the number and per centage of subjects with low, 
normal or high values and normal or abnormal examinations.  
The AEs reported by investigators using the NCI -CTCAE classification (Version 5.0) will be 
coded using M edDRA (Version  22.0 or later).  
Summary incidence tables will be provided by treatment arm, cla ssified by body system, 
preferred term and associated NCI -CTCAE worst grade. In the event of multiple occurrences 
of the same AEs being reported by the same subj ect, the maximum intensity (Grade  5 >Grade  4 
>Grade  3 >Grade  2 >Grade  1 >missing >not applicable) will  be chosen. Dose delays, 
omissions, and infusion interruptions will be listed by cycle. Summaries of events that resulted 
in dose modifications (e.g. dela y, reduction) will also be provided.  
Haematological and biochemical toxicities will be recorded and graded according to the 
NCI-CTCAE criteria, where available. The NCI -CTCAE Grade 3 and 4 haematology and 
biochemistry variables by subject and by cycle will  be listed.  
11.5 Subgroup Analyses  
Descriptive statistics for primary and key secondary endpoints may be provided within each 
category of the following variables:  
• presence of liver metastases at baseline  
• number of metastatic sites  
• baseline ECOG performance status (0/1)  
• region (North America/East Asia/Rest of the World)  
• disease stage at diagnosis

11.6 Independent Data Monitoring B oard and Interim Analysis  
An IDMC will be established for this study to operate as an ind ependent expert advisory group 
with the responsibility of evaluating cumulative safety and  other clinical trial data at regular 
intervals. As such, the primary objective of the IDMC is to mon itor the safety of the subjects 
enrolled in the study by reviewing the available clinical data at scheduled time points, to be 
described in the IDMC Charte r, as well as on an ad hoc basis, as needed. Items reviewed wil l 
include (but not limited to) safety events, any available resul ts of PK testing, and UGT1A1*28 
genotype. Attention will be paid to determining whether any stu dy procedure needs to be 
modified  for subjects who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele.  
The same IDMC will evaluate also the efficacy data as well as t he safety data at the time of the 
interim analysis. The IDMC will be responsible for reviewing th e futility and efficacy results 
in the interim analysis and making appropriate recommendations based  on those results.  
The operating procedures of the IDMC will be based on and in co mpliance with the FDA’s 
“Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors [on the] Establishment an d Operation of Clinical Trial 
Data Monitoring Committees” (March 2006, OMB Control Number: 09 10-0581) and with the 
EMA’s “Guideline on Data Monitoring Committees” (January 2006, 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/5872/03 Corr).  
The planned frequency of the IDMC is planned to be as follows and will be  agreed with the 
IDMC experts:  
• After the 50th randomised subject has been followed for at leas t 28 days (follow -up time -
frame equivalent of one cycle)  
• Every 6 months and additionally timed with the planned interim analysis:  
- Interim analysis for futility an d efficacy (no less than 50% of the planned final 
number of OS events in ITT  population i.e. 272 of 543)  
All the details of IDMC activities will be described in the IDM C charter.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

12 DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA AND DOCUMEN TS 
Authorised personnel from external  Regulatory Authorities and sponsor authorised Quality 
Assurance personnel may carry out inspections and audits. The p urpose of an audit is to ensure 
that ethical, regulatory and quality requirements are fulfilled  in all studies performed by the 
sponsor.  
Auditors and inspectors must have direct access to study documen ts and site facilities as 
specified in Section  13.4 and to any other locations used f or the purpose of the study in question 
(e.g. laboratories).  
In the event of the site being notified directly of a regulator y inspection, the investigator must 
notify the sponsor’s representative as soon as possible, to ass ist with preparations for the 
inspection.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations  
13.1.1  Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be in itiated without the prior written 
approval or favourable opinion by the IEC/IRB, e xcept when necessary to eliminate immediate 
safety concerns to the subjects or when the change involves onl y logistics or administration.  
In the event that an amendment to this protocol is required, it  will be classified into one of the 
following three ca tegories:  
• Non-substantial amendments  are those that are not considered ‘substantial’ 
(e.g. administrative changes) and as such only need to be notified to  the IECs or 
regulatory authorities for information purposes.  
• Substantial amendments  are those conside red ‘substantial’ to the conduct of the clinical 
study where they are likely to have a significant impact on:  
• the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects;  
• the scientific value of the study;  
• the conduct or management of the study; or  
• the quality or safety of the study medication used in the study.  
Substantial amendments must be  submitted to and approved by the  IECs and relevant 
regulatory authorities, according to local regulations, prior t o implementing changes.  
• Urgent amendments  are those that require urgent safety measures to protect the st udy 
subjects from immediate hazard and as such may be implemented i mmediately by the 
sponsor with subsequent IECs and regulatory authority notificat ion, forthwith.  
The principal investigator a nd the sponsor will sign all protocol amendments.  
13.1.2  Protocol Deviations and Exceptions  
All protocol deviations will be identified and recorded by the sponsor or sponsor’s 
representative.  
A major protocol deviation is any significant divergence from t he proto col, i.e. nonadherence 
on the part of the subject, the investigator, or the sponsor to  protocol specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective evaluation crit eria and/or GCP guidelines. 
Generally, a protocol deviation qualifies as major if:  
(1) The d eviation has harmed or posed a significant or substantive risk of harm to the 
research subject  
(2) The deviation compromises the sc ientific integrity of the data collected for the study  
(3) The deviation is a wilful or knowing breach of human subject pr otection re gulations, 
policies, or procedures on the part of the investigator(s)  
(4) The deviation involves a serious or continuing noncompliance wi th any applicable 
human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures  
(5) The deviation is inconsistent with the spon sor’s research, medical and/or ethical 
principles.  
See also  Section  11.1.2  for details on the impact of major protocol deviations on the i nclusion 
of subjects in each analysis population.  
As a matter of policy, the sponsor will not grant exceptions to  protocol specific entry criteria to 
allow subjects to enter a study. If investigative centre person nel learn that a subject who did not 
meet protocol el igibility criteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation ), they must 3URWRFRO$XJ_

immediately inform the sponsor. Such subjects will be discontin ued from the study, except in 
an exceptional instance following review and written approval b y the sponsor and the 
responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP. Retention o f these subjects in the study 
will be discussed between sponsor and investigator, taking into  account subject safety and data 
reliability. The IRB/IEC will be informed if subject safety/pro tection is ignorantly impacted.  
13.2 Information to Study Personnel  
To ensure accurate, complete and reliable data, the sponsor or its representatives will provide 
instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate. A st udy initiation visit will be conducted  
prior to screening start to instruct the investigators and stud y coordinators. This session will 
give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the eCRF an d all study procedures. The 
investigator is responsible for giving information about the st udy to all staff members involved 
in the study or in any element of subject management, both befo re starting any study procedures 
and during the course of the study (e.g. when new staff become involved). The investigator 
must assure that all study staff member s are qualified by education, experience and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study staff memb ers must be listed on the study 
centre log, which includes a clear description of each staff me mber’s responsibilities. This list 
must b e updated throughout the study, as necessary.  
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to  all study staff, including the 
investigator and for ensuring their compliance with the protoco l. Additional information will 
be made available dur ing the study when new staff become involved in the study and a s 
otherwise agreed upon with either the investigator or the study  monitor.  
13.3 Study Monitoring  
The investigator is responsible for the validity of all data co llected at the site.  
The sponsor is re sponsible for monitoring these data to verify that the rights and wellbeing of 
subjects are protected, that study data are accurate (complete and verifiable to source data) and 
that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol, GC P guidelines and  regulatory 
requirements.  
Sponsor assigned monitors will conduct regular site and/or remo te visits. The investigator will 
allow direct access to all relev ant files (for all subjects) an d clinical study supplies (dispensing 
and storage areas) for the purpos e of verifying entries made in the eCRF and will assist with 
the monitor’s activities, if requested. Adequate time and space  for monitoring visits should be 
made available by the investigator.  
The site must complete the eCRFs on an ongoing basis to allow r egular review by the study 
monitor, both remotely by the internet and during site visits.  The central study monitor at the 
sponsor will use functions of the EDC system to address any que ries raised while reviewing the 
data entered by the study site personn el in a timely manner.  
Whenever a subject name (or other identifiable details) is reve aled on a document required by 
the sponsor (e.g. laboratory print outs) the information must b e blacked out permanently by the 
site personnel and the document annotated w ith the subject number as identification.  
13.4 Investigator’s Regulatory Obligations  
All clinical work under this protocol will be conducted accordi ng to GCP guidelines. This 
includes that the study may be audited at any time by a quality  assurance personnel designated 
by the sponsor or inspected by regulatory bodies. The investiga tor must adhere to ICH  GCP 
guidelines in addition to any applicable local regulations.  
If requested, the investigator will provide the sponsor, applic able regulatory agencies and 
applicable EC with direct access to any original source documents.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

The investigator(s) should demonstrate due diligence in recruit ment and screening of potential 
study subjects. The enrolment rate should be sufficient to comp lete the study as agreed with the 
sponsor. The sponsor should be notified of any projected delays , which may impact the 
completion of the study.  
This clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with all in ternational laws and regulations 
and national laws and re gulations of the country( ies) in which the clinical trial is performed, as 
well as any applicable guidelines.  
13.5 Audit and Inspection  
Authorised personnel from external CAs and the sponsor’s author ised Quality Assurance 
personnel may carry out inspections and audits (see Section  12). 
13.6 Data Quality Assurance  
All eCRFs completed by the investigational site will be reviewe d (secondary monitoring) for 
completeness, consistency, legibility and protocol compliance.  
Reasons sho uld be given on the relevant eCRF for any missing data and othe r protocol 
deviations. Any electronic queries and items not adequately exp lained will require additional 
electronic manual queries to be raised to the investigator by t he monitor for 
clarificat ion/correction. The investigator must ensure that queries are d ealt with promptly. All 
data changes and clarifications  can be viewed in the audit trai l function of the eCRF.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

14 ETHICS  
14.1 Compliance with Good Clinical Practice and Ethical Consideratio ns 
This stud y will be conducted in compliance with IECs/IRBs, informed cons ent regulations, the 
Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP guidelines (Section  1.6). 
For EDC studies the following regulations are adhered to: FDA 21  CFR Part 11, Electronic 
Records, Electronic Signatures and FDA, Guidance for Industry: Computerized Systems Used 
in Clinical Trials.  
In addition, this study will adhere to all local regulatory  requirements.  
Before initiating the study, the investigator/institution shoul d have written and dated 
approval/favourable opinion from the IEC/IRB for the study prot ocol/amendment(s), written 
ICF, any consent form updates, subject emergency study contact  cards, subject recruitment 
procedures (e.g. advertisements), any written information to be  provided to subjects and a 
statement from the IEC/IRB that they comply with GCP requiremen ts. The IEC/IRB approval 
must identify the protocol version as well as the  documents reviewed.  
After IEC/IRB approval, changes will require a formal amendment . Once the study has started, 
amendments should be made only in exceptional circumstances. Ch anges that do not affect 
subject safety or data integrity are classified as adm inistrative changes and generally do not 
require ethical approval. If ethically relevant aspects are con cerned, the IEC/IRB must be 
informed and, if necessary, approval sought prior to implementa tion. Ethical approval on 
administrative changes will be obta ined if required by local/site IEC/IRB.  
14.2 Informed Consent for Par ticipation in the Study  
Prior to study entry, the investigator, or (if applicable under  local regulatory guidelines) a 
person designated by the investigator, will explain the nature,  purpose, benefits and risks of 
participation in the study to each subject, subject’s legally a cceptable representative or impartial 
witness. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to the  subject entering the study 
(before initiation of any study -related pr ocedure and administration of the study medication). 
Sufficient time will be allowe d to discuss any questions raised  by the subject.  
As applicable under local regulatory guidelines, the sponsor wi ll provide a sample ICF. The 
final version controlled form m ust be agreed to by the sponsor and the IEC/IRB and must 
contain all elements included in the sample form, in language r eadily understood by the subject. 
Each subject’s original consent form, personally signed and dat ed by the subject or by the 
subject’s l egally acceptable representative and by the person who conducte d the informed 
consent discussion, will be retained by the investigator. The i nvestigator will supply subjects 
with a copy of their signed ICF.  
The ICF may need to be revised during the study s hould important new information become 
available that may be relevant to the safety of the subject or as a result of protocol amendments. 
In this instance, approval should always be given by the IEC/IR B. It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure th at all subjects subsequently entered into the study and those c urrently 
in the study are informed of these changes and sign the amended  form. This is documented in 
the same way as described above. Subjects who have completed th e study should be informed 
of any new information that may impact on their welfare/wellbeing.  
The investigator should, with the consent of the subject, infor m the subject’s primary physician 
about their participation in the clinical study.  
14.2.1  Optional Informed Consent for Biobanking  
This study has the option for subjects to consent to the collection of samples for biobanking for 
future exploratory analysis and storage for up to 15 years (whe re local regulations allow). A 3URWRFRO$XJ_

specific informed consent is required for the collection of the se sa mples and will be explained 
after the subject has given writ ten informed consent for the ma in study.  
Subjects must receive an explanation that they are completely f ree to refuse to enter the 
exploratory part of the study and may withdraw from it at any t ime and for any reason up to 
15 years after the end of the study  and will still be allowed to t ake part in the main study.  
14.3 Contractual and Financial Details  
The investigator (and/or, as appropriate, the hospital administ rative representative) and the 
sponsor will sign a clinical study agreement prior to the start  of the study, outlining overall 
sponsor and investigator responsibilities in relation to the st udy. Financial remuneration will 
cover the cost per included subject, based on the calculated co sts of performing the study 
assessments in accordance with the protocol and the specified t erms of payment will be 
described in the contract. The contract should describe whether  costs for pharmacy, laboratory 
and other protocol require d services are being paid directly or indirectly.  
Financial disclosure statements will be completed, as requested  by FDA  21 CFR Part  54. 
14.4 Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutio nal Review 
Boards  
As required by local regulations, the sponsor’s Regulatory Affairs group (or delegate CRO) will 
ensure all legal regulatory aspects are covered and obtain appr oval of the appropriate regulatory 
bodies, prior to study initiation in regions where an approval is required.  
The following documents should be submitted t o the relevant ethics committee(s) (EC) for 
review and approval to conduct the study (this list may not be exhaustive and is dependent on 
country requirements):  
• protocol/amendment(s) approved by the sponsor;  
• currently applicable IB or package labelling;  
• relevant investigator’s curriculum vitae;  
• subject information and informed consent document(s) and form(s ); 
• subject emergency study contact cards;  
• recruitment procedures/materials (advertisements), if any.  
The EC(s) will review all submission documents as required and a written favourable opinion 
for the conduct of the study should be made available to the in vestigator before initiating the 
study. This document must be dated and clearly identify the ver sion number(s) and date(s) of 
the documents submitted/r eviewed and should include a statement from the EC that they 
comply with GCP requirements.  
The study may begin at the investigative site(s) only after rec eiving this dated and signed 
documentation of the EC a pproval or favourable opinion.  
During  the study ,  any update to the following documents will be sent to the EC, e ither for 
information, or for review and approval, depending on how subst antial the modifications are: 
(1) IB; (2)  reports or listings of SAEs; (3) all protocol amendments and re vised informed  
consent(s), if any.  
At the end of the study, the EC will be notified about the stud y completion.  
14.5 Confidentiality Regarding Study Subjects

15 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
15.1 Recording of Study Data  
In compliance with GCP guidelines, the medical records/medical notes, etc., should be clearly 
marked and permit easy identification of a subject’s parti cipation in the specified clinical study.  
The investigator must record all data relating to protocol proc edures, study medication 
administration, laboratory data, safety data and efficacy ratin gs on the eCRFs provided for the 
study. The investigator, by co mpleting the signature log, may formally designate authority to  
complete eCRFs to appropriately qu alified staff having certifie d user access to the eCRF. 
Subjects’ questionnaires will be collected using an electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) 
system.   
The investigator (or delegated sub -investigator) must provide an electronic signature 
(e-signature) to each case report book to attest to the accuracy a nd completeness of all the data. 
If any changes are made to the eCRF after a form has been locke d and electronically signed, 
the investigator (or delegated sub -investigator) will be required to perform an additional 
e-signature authorising agreement with any new information or cha nges to the eCRF.  
All corrections on the eCRF and ePRO system will be automat ically tracked and a reason for 
change is always required. In the eCRF, the audit trail functio n will allow the changes made to 
be viewed on each item entered.  
15.2 Data Management  
Electronic data capture will be utilised for collecting subject  data. Each site is required to have 
a computer and internet connecti on available for site entry of clinical data. All entries in the 
eCRF will be made under the e -signature of the person performing the action. This electronic 
signature consists of an individual and confid ential username and password combination. It is 
declared to be the legally binding equivalent of the handwritte n signature. Only sponsor authorised 
users will have access to the eCRF as appropriate to their stud y responsibilities. Users must have 
successfu lly undergone software applicati on training prior to entering d ata into the eCRF.  
Data management will be conducted by a CRO, directed by the spo nsor’s Biometry department. 
All data management procedures will be completed in accordance with the contracted CRO SOPs.  
The sponsor will ensure that an appropriate eCRF is developed t o capture the data accurately 
and suitable queries are raised to resolve any missing or incon sistent  data. The investigator will 
receive their data, from the clinical study, in an electronic format (PDF files) which will be an 
exact copy of the eCRF and will include the full audit trail, f or archiving purposes and future 
reference.  
Any queries generated during the data management process will a lso be tracked by the 
contracted data m anagement CRO/will be raised within the EDC system. It is the c entral study 
monitor’s responsibility to ensure that all queries are resolve d by the relevant parties.  
The sponsor will also ensure that SAE data collected in the eCR F are consistent with 
infor mation provided to the sponsor’s pharm acovigilance department ( and vice versa).  
The coding of an AE, medical history, surgical procedures and c oncomitant medication terms 
will be performed by the sponsor’s central coding group and rev iewed and approved by  the 
sponsor. Concomitant medications will be coded using WHODRUG an d AEs/medical history 
terms will be coded using Me dDRA (Version 22.0 or later).  
Only data from screened subjects will be reported in the eCRFs and collected in the sponsor’s 
database.  
For screen failure subjects, only the Unique Subject Identifier, th e date of informed consent 
signature, the reason why the subject failed screening and the potential AEs which occurred 3URWRFRO$XJ_

database.  
15.3 Record Archiving and Retention  
During the prestudy and initiation visits, the monitor must ens ure the archiving facilities are 
adequate and archiving/retenti on responsibilities of the invest igator have been discussed.  
Study documen ts should be retained until at least 2 years after the last app roval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or planned marketing applications 
in an ICH region (that is at least 25 years) or at least 2 year s have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the product. However , these documents should be 
retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regu latory requirements or by an 
agreement with the sponsor. The investigator should take  measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents. The final archiving a rrangements will be confirmed by 
the monitor when closing out the site. The sponsor will inform the investigator, in writing, as to 
when these documents no lo nger need to be retained.  
If the principal investigator relocates or retires, or otherwis e withdraws his/her responsibility 
for maintenance and retention of study documents, the sponsor m ust be notified (preferably in 
writing) so that adequate provision ca n be made for their future m aintenance and retention.  
15.4 Use of Data After Study Completion  
The study data from consenting subjects may be used, after the end of the study, outside the 
strict context of this study for further or complementary analy sis, to bet ter understand the study 
disease or related conditions. The data will be retained while related research activities continue 
but no longer than 25  years after study completion or other period as per local requi rements. 
Each subject must be informed that hi s/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor in accordance with local data protection law and will b e informed that they are free to 
refuse. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the s ubject who will be required to 
give consent  for their data to be used as desc ribed in the informed consent.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

17 REPORTING AND PUBLIC ATION OF RESULTS  
17.1 Publication Policy  
The sponsor is committed to disclosing information about the cl inical trials it sponsors. Results 
will be communicated at scientific meetings and all reasona ble efforts must be made to seek 
publication in a peer -reviewed scientific journal. Specific publication concepts, inc luding data 
to be covered, target congress/journal and proposed authors, sh ould be discussed with the 
appropriate Global Publications Mana ger and incorporated in the relevant publication plan 
before initiation. A dedicated P ublications Committee, involvin g interested members of the 
study Steering Committee as well as the Global Publications Man ager, may be established to 
plan specific public ations. As a minimum, summary results of this study should be p osted on 
the relevant clinical trial registry. When the trial has been c onducted by a large multicentre 
group, the principal investigator, the study steering committee  (if applicable) and the s ponsor’s 
responsible physician should discuss and agree the selection of  authors for planned publications 
in advance. They may decide to use a group name and nominate au thors on behalf of the study 
group. All contributing investigators will be listed in th e acknowledgements together with any 
others who may have contributed but not sufficiently to qualify  for authorship.  
Selection of authors for scientific publications will follow th e International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors guidelines  
[http://www.icmje.org/rec ommendations/browse/roles -and-responsibilities/defining -the-role-
of-authors -and-contributors.html]. In particular, those named as authors, whet her employed by 
a sponsor’s affiliate or the sponsor, or external investigators , ‘should  have participated 
sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for the content’.  
Authorship should be based on:  
• Substantial contributions to the conception and design, or acqu isition of data, or analysis 
and interpretation of data; AND  
• Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectua l content; AND  
• Final approval of the version to be published; AND  
• Agreement to be accountable for all  aspects for the work, there by ensuring that questions 
related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work were appropriately investigated 
and resolved.  
All authors of a publication should meet all four criteria. Eac h author must agree to their 
inclusion in the list of authors. Use of professional medical w riting support may be employed.  
Resolution of scientific differences in the presentation or int erpretation of study findings will 
be conducted along principles of honest scientific debate. The sponsor shall be promptly 
notified of any amendments subseque ntly requested by referees o r journal editors.  
The sponsor requests acknowledgement of all individuals/organis ations involved in the funding 
or conduct of the study, including statisticians subject to the  consent of each individual and 
entity concerned, including acknowledgement of the s ponsor. Any medical writing support 
should also be acknowledged.  
The author undertakes to reasonably consider the sponsor's requ est for delay to the proposed 
publication should the sponsor reasonably deem premature to pub lish the results obtained at the 
then stage of the study  
All publications arising from this study will be reviewed by re levant functions at the sponsor, 
coordinated by the Global Publications team. Requests and sugge stions for changes will be 
discussed with all authors (and medical writer, if applicable). Resolution of scientific 
differences in the presentation or interpretation of study find ings will be conducted along 3URWRFRO$XJ_

a final version for submissio n can be approved by the author team.  
If patentability would be adversely affected by publication, th is will be delayed until (i) a patent 
application is filed for the content of the publication in acco rdance with applicable provisions 
of the clinical tria l agreement concerned, (ii) the sponsor consents to the publica tion, or (iii) the 
time period as may be agreed in the contractual arrangements, i ncluding clinical trial 
agreements, governing the relationship between the sponsor and authors (or authors’ ins titution) 
after receipt of the proposed publication by the sponsor, which ever of (i), (ii) or (iii) occurs 
first. 
17.2 Clinical Study Report  
A final clinical study report (CSR) will be prepared according to the ICH guideline on structure 
and contents of CSRs. A  final CSR will be prepared where any subject has signed informe d 
consent, regardless of whether the study is completed or premat urely terminated. Where 
appropriate, an abbreviated report  may be prepared. The CSR wil l comply with any applicable 
regulatory requirements, national laws i n force and will be in English.  
As indicated in Section  11.2, an analysis will be performed on the final OS data after the last 
subjec t has completed the treatment period. This analysis will be inc luded in the final study 
report. Should any subjects remain on treatment at the time of the final analysis an addendum 
to the report will be prepared aft er the last subject completes  study trea tment.  
Analysis of biobank samples will be performed outside the scope  of the main study and reported

PROTOCOL: VERSION 5. 0 WITH AMENDMENT #4 – 19 AUGUST 2021  PAGE 109  
Appendix 1  Concomitant Use of Enzyme Inducers and Inhibitors  
The use of strong CYP3A, CYP2C8, and UGT1A i nhibitors or inducers are not allowed during 
the study and specific moderate CYP3A inhibitors and mild induc ers of CYP3A4 should be 
approached with caution, as detailed below. Specific stopping p eriods prior to randomisation 
for enzyme inhibitors and induc ers are described below. CYP3A/2C* and UGT1A enzyme 
inhibitors and inducers include prescribed medicines, over the counter medicines, 
complementary and alternative medicines, food supplements and f ood substances.  
Examples of strong inducers and inhibitors  
• Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifa butin, rifapentine, 
phenobarbital, St. John's wort, avasimibe, lumacaftor, mitotane , avasimibe, apalutamide, 
ivosidenib, enzalutamide.  
• Strong CYP3A inhibitors: grapefruit juice, clarithromycin,  indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saq uinavir, telaprevir, 
voriconazole, troleandomycin, telithromycin, danoprevir, bocepr evir, tipranavir, 
posaconazole, mibefradil, conivaptan, regorafenib, cobicistat, elvitegravir, mifepristone, 
ceritinib, ribociclib, idelalisib, LCL161, VIEKIRA PAK  
• Strong UGT1A inhibitors: atazanavir, gemfibrozil, ketoconazole,  indinavir, regorafenib.  
• Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors: ketoconazole and other imidazole anti fungals, fluoxetine, 
gemfibrozil, ritonavir, saquinavir , indinavir, nelfinavir, clopido grel 
• Strong CYP2C8 inducers: rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, e favirenz, and 
nevirapine  
Moderate inhibitor and mild inducer  
• Moderate CYP3A inhibitor and mild inducer of CYP3A4: aprepitant , fosaprepitant  
• Moderate CYP3A inhibitor: netupitant  
See for further examples e.g. http://medicine.iupui.edu/CLINPHA RM/ddis/clinical -table 
or  https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/Developm entApprovalProcess/Developmen tResources/DrugIn
teractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm.  
Arm 1: irinotecan liposomal injection+oxaliplatin+5 -FU/LV  
Following administration of non -liposomal irinotecan exposure to irinotecan or its active 
metabolite, SN -38, is substantially reduced in subjects concomitantly receivin g the CYP3A 
enzyme -inducing a nticonvulsants phenytoin and strong CYP3A inducers. CYP3A induc ers 
may impact irinotecan liposome in jection similarly. Avoid the u se of strong CYP3A inducers 
if possible. Substitute for non -enzyme inducing therapies at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of 
liposomal irinotecan  therapy.  
Following administration of non -liposomal irinotecan, subjects receiving concomitant 
ketoconazole, a CYP3A and UGT1A inhibitor, have increased expos ure to irinotecan and its 
active metabolite SN -38. Concomitant administration of aprepitant and fosaprepitant (moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A4) with irinotecan should be approached with  caution as the combination 
might result in increased toxicity  (neutropenia and diarrhoea) . Where anti -emetic options are 
limited to aprepitant and fos aprepitant, these should only be used based on investigator 
judgement considering the risk/benefit to the subject. Co -administration of irinotecan liposome 
injection with CYP3A or UGT1A inhibitors may increase systemic exposure to irinotecan or 
SN-38. Avoi d the use of strong CYP3A or UGT1A inhibitors if possible. Disc ontinue strong 
CYP3A inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting irinotecan l iposome injection therapy. (Data

Appendix 3  Arm 2 (Nab -paclitaxel+Gemcitabine) Dose Modifications  
Prior to each cycle, subjects must have:  
• ANC ≥1500/mm3 
• Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 
• Diarrhoea ≤ Grade 1.  
Two levels of dose modifications are permitted according to the  criteria described below. If a 
toxicity requiring dose modification occurs following the  second dose reduction of either study 
medication, further treatment should be discontinued. Any furth er dose modification requires 
prior sponsor approval. Subjects experiencing study medication -related toxicities that require a 
delay in scheduled nab -paclitaxel or gemcitabine dosing for more than 21 days will be 
discontinued from further treatment in this study.  
When a dose reduction is required, no dose re -escalation will be permitted for the duration of 
study treatment (with the exception that on Day 15 , re-escalation with G -CSF support is 
permitted, after a previous dose reduction on Day 8 of the same  cycle).  
Dose level reductions required due to toxicity related to nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine should 
be made following the guidelines outlined in Table  12.

Primary prophylactic use of G -CSF should be considered if subjects are considered high risk in the opinion of the 
investigator. Secondary prophylactic use of G -CSF after one episode of febrile neutropenia, infection associ ated with 
neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis should be considered.  
Periphera l Neuropathy  
Nab-paclitaxel treatment should be withheld in subjects who experie nce ≥Grade 3 peripheral 
neuropathy. Gemcitabine administration can continue during this  period. Nab -paclitaxel 
treatment may be resumed at the next lower dose level in subseq uent cycles after the peripheral 
neuropathy improves to ≤Grade 1. Subjects experiencing peripher al neuropathy that requires a 
delay in scheduled nab -paclitaxel dosing for ≥21 days will discontinue study treatment . The 
time to resolution to Grade ≤1 should be  the AE duration used for AE reporting.  
Cutaneous Toxicity  
Subjects who develop Grade 2 or 3 cutaneous toxicity should hav e their dose reduced to the 
next lower dose level for both drugs. If the subject continues to experience these reactions, 
despite dose  reduction, treatment should be discontinued. Subjects who devel op Grade  4 
cutaneous toxicity should have treatment discontinued.  
Gastrointestinal Toxicity  
If Grade 3 mucositis or diarrhoea occurs, study medication shou ld be withheld until resolution 
to ≤G rade 1, then reinstituted at the next lower dose level of both drugs. Subjects who develop 
Grade 4 mucositis or diarrhoea should have treatment discontinu ed. 
Pulmonary Embolism  
Asymptomatic or clinically mild pulmonary embolism can be treat ed with low -mole cular -
weight heparin without interruption of therapy. Moderate to sev ere pulmonary embolism will 
require permanent discon tinuation of treatment.  
Interstitial Pneumonitis  
During study participation, subjects should be carefully monito red for signs and symptoms of  
pneumonitis (i.e. episodes of transient or repeated dyspnoea wi th unproductive persistent cough 
or fever) and, if observed, immediate clinical evaluation and t imely institution of appropriate 
management (emphasising the need for corticosteroids  if an infectious process has been ruled 
out as well as appropriate ventilation and oxygen support when required). Study medication 
administration should be permanently discontinued upon making a  diagnosis of interstitial 
pneumonitis.  
Hypersensitivity Reac tions  
Hypersensitivity reactions are not expected with either nab -paclitaxel or gemcitabine. If they 
do occur, minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dysp noea, hypotension, or 
tachycardia may require temporary interruption of the infusion.  Howeve r, severe reactions, such

Appendix 4   Recommended Birth Control Method s for Women of Child Bearing 
Potential (WOCBP)  
Below is a guideline which lists contraceptive methods that can  achieve a failure rate of less 
than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, and are considered a s highly effective 
birth control methods, as published by the Clinical Trials Faci litation Group:  
• combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contra ception associated 
with inhibiti on of ovulation:  
• oral 
• intravaginal  
• transdermal  
• progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovula tion: 
• oral 
• injectable  
• implantablea 
• intrauterine device (IUD)a 
• intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)a 
• bilateral tubal occlusiona 
• vasectomised partnera,b 
• sexual abstinencec 
a Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency.  
b Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method  provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of 
the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised partner h as received medical assessment of the surgical 
success.  
c In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered  a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from  heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk assoc iated with the study treatments. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relat ion to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subje ct 
 
Note: A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until 
becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent s terilisation methods include hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oo phorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months 
without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulati ng hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not usin g horm onal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of am enorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

Appendix 5  Recommendations for Management of  Chemotherapy Induced Diarrhoe a
Proposed algorithm for the assessment and man agement of treatment -induced diarrhoea is 
provided below in Table  15. These guidelines are adapted from those developed by an 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO ) panel and ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines 
for treating chemotherapy -induced diarrhoea [ Benson 2004, Utaris  2015, Bossi  2018 ]. Also 
Appendix  2, Table  10 for Arm  1 management of dose modifications.  
Anti-diarrhoea management should be initiated at the first episode o f poorly formed or loose 
stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements that are more f requent than normal.  
Table  15 Recommendations for Management of Chemotherapy Induced Diarrhoe a 
Dietetic  
Dietetic Measures (applicable for all grades of diarrhoea)  
Stop all lactose -containing products 
Drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day 
Eat frequent small meals  
Recommend low -fat diet enriched with bananas , rice, apple sauce and toast i. e. BRAT diet  
Fluid Intake 
Approximately 2L should be maintained  
Ensure appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement  
Pharmacological Treatment  
First Line Therapy: loperamide 
Clinical Presentation Intervention  
If receiving prophylaxis:  Increase loperamide dose to a maximum of 16  mg/day.  Continue until 
diarrhoea free for 12  hours. If no improvement within 48 hours implement 
second -line therapy. 
If new -onset diarrhoea: Take loperamide 4 mg with first bout of diarrhoea followed by 2  mg every 
4 hours or after every unformed stool (maximum 16  mg/day). Continue 
until diarrhoea free for 12  hours. If no improvement within 48 hours 
implement second -line therapy. 
With recovery to ≤Grade 1:  Take loperamide 4 mg one dose with each subsequent cycle of iri notecan 
liposome injection administration.  
Second Line Therapy 
Grade 1  
If persistent diarrhoea on loperamide: Add diphenoxylate, hydrochloride plus atropine suffate (Lotomil®) 2.5 mg 
every 6 -8 hours. 
Monitor for trend in decreas ing WBC and/or neutropenia.  
Recommend G -CSF if decreasing WBC and/ or neutropenia to avoid 
infectious/septic complications. See Section  6.3.3 . 
Grade 2  
If persistent diarrhoea on loperamide: Add octreotide (short acting) 150  μg subcutaneously tid or after initial dose 
of short acting octreotide, if well tolerated, a single dose of  octreotide LAR 
20 mg intramuscularly. 
Monitor for trend in decreas ing WBC and/or neutropenia.  
Recommend G -CSF if decreasing WBC and/ or neutropenia to avoid 
infectious/septic complications. See Section  6.3.3 . 
Consider stool cultures to ex clude infectious causes (e.g.  Clostridium 
difficile) prior to prophylactic antibiotics, especially if dia rrhoea is 
persi stent beyond 24 hours or if there is a fever or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 3URWRFRO$XJ_

Appendix 7   Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogena se (DPD) Testing Requirements  
Requirements for France  
The Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) (French National Authority fo r Health) and the Institut 
National du Cancer (IN Ca) (French National Cancer Institute) recommend testing for DP D 
deficiency by determination of uracil plasma concentration (ura cilemia) where 
fluoropyrimidine treatment is planned.  
This test is recommended in the following conditions:  
• pre-analytical conditions: use of blood collection tubes without separator gel  and with 
anticoagulant, maximum delay between sample and centrifugation 1 hour 30  minutes if 
the sample is stored at ambient temperature, and 4  hours if it is stored at +4°C, 
centrifugation pr eferably at +4°C then immediate freezing of the resulting plasm a, 
transport respecting the cold chain,  
• assay technique: by high or ultra -high performance liquid chromatography (several 
possible detection modalities).  
Failure to comply with these conditions  must lead to a report of non -compliance brought to 
the attention of the clinician as soon as possibl e so that a new sample can be sent to the 
laboratory quickly.  
• interpretation and expression of the results:  
- uracilemia ≥150  ng/ml suggests complete DPD def iciency  
- uracilemia ≥16  ng/ml and <150  ng/ml suggests partial DPD deficiency  
• interpretation of the results on the basis of these threshold v alues must take account the 
fact that uracilemia is a cont inuous variable and that the risk  of severe toxicity increa ses 
therefore theoretically a s uracilemia increases.  
Subjects with low or absent DPD activity (complete deficiency i .e. blood uracil level 
≥150  ng/ml and partial deficiency i.e. blood uracil level between ≥1 6 ng/ml and <150  ng/ml) 
will not be eligible for inclusion in this study.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

Appendix 8  Temporary Measures and Procedures Related to COVID -19 Pandemic  
This appendix is intended to provide temporary measures to mana ge study assessments that 
cannot be done in compliance with the current protocol version approved at your  site, because 
of the COVID -19 pandemic.  
The implementation of the below measures must be in line with a pplicable country regulation 
or national temporary COVID -19 measures guidance and must remain temporary until situation 
resolves, at which point the pro tocol assessments will return to those specified in the current  
approved protocol effective at that time. The temporary measure s may remain in place for 
differing periods of time per country/site.  
The temporary measures specified in the appendix must be re ported as deviation related to 
COVID -19 and must still be documented and reported to the EC s/IRB and/or Health 
Authorities, based on the regulatory requirements applicable at  your country/site, in addition to 
any deviation to the current protocol.  
Investig ators will determine the feasibili ty of starting or continuing study treatment on a 
subject -by-subject basis, depending on the ability to conduct safety monit oring and providing 
subjects an adequate supply of study treatment, in accordance w ith local requi rements.  
Specific Guidance for Study Visits and Assessments  
Study Schedule  
If the COVID -19 pandemic prevents subjects from coming to the site, subjects  can have their 
study visit assessments performed remotely as judged appropriat e by the investigator. This must 
be discussed with the sponsor or delegate before being implemen ted. In such a case, the 
investigator will perform a telemedicine visit and will make ev ery effort, where applicable, to 
contact the subject’s general practitioner or specialist physi cian to ensure all important medical 
information and safety event(s) occurring since the last visit are collected. Guidance on how to 
collect protocol -planned assessments is provided below.  
The IECs/IRBs will be notified of the changes as applicable locally. Of note, as the adapted 
visit deviates from the regular protocol plan, the changes will  be recorded as protocol deviations 
related to COVID -19. 
Screening and Enrolment  
Subjects cannot be screened more than once. However, if a subje ct tests positiv e for COVID -19 
during the screening period, this should be escalated to the sp onsor (or delegate), in case an 
extension of the screening period is required for the subject t o recover. In exceptional 
circumstances, where a subject starts screening procedure s, which are then delayed due to 
COVID -19 (for example testing positive for COVID -19), the subject might continue with the 
screening assessment once a negative test is confirmed to confi rm all eligibility criteria are met 
prior to randomisation, even if th is is outside the normal 28 -day screening window, after 
discussion with the sponsor (or delegate).  
Informed Consent (including Re -consent)  
As per guidelines issued by the FDA in the US and in line with guidance in other countries, the 
use of electronic si gnatures is authorised to obtain the subject’s informed consent . The sponsor 
and IRB need to be notified of the use of electronic informed c onsent signature and the accepted 
electronic formats need to be clearly documented. This is not m eant to replace the  important 
discussion between the subject, investigator and site staff. Su ch a discussion must still occur 
and be part of a screening visit (in -person, by telemedicine, or home health visit). A clearly 3URWRFRO$XJ_

documented process on how subjects are contacted virtu ally to explain the study and close 
monitoring needs to be in place.  
Screening visit and assessments (apart from informed consent as  described above) must be 
performed on site.  
Dosing Visits (Arm 1 and Arm 2)  
In case of dosing visit delayed due to COVID -19 (temporary closure of the site, subject 
unable to travel etc).  
• Dose delay rules should be followed as per last protocol versio n approved at your site. 
In case of dosing visit delays outside of the protocol, these s hould be discussed between 
the investigat or and the sponsor or delegate  
In case of suspected COVID -19 infection  
• The administration of study medication may be temporarily disco ntinued depending on 
the patient clinical presentation. In some cases, the investiga tor may request a subject be 
retested before the administration of study treatment is resumed.  
• In all cases, the investigator must ensure that the subject rec eives appropriate medical 
follow -up. It will be in the PI’s medical judgement to assess the bene fit and risks of 
restarting study treatm ent. If a subject has temporarily discontinued study treatment,  the 
decision to restart subjects on study treatment will be managed  on an individual subject 
basis in discussion with the sponsor (or delegate) and investig ator. 
In case of confirmed COVID -19 infection  
• Subjects who presents with COVID -19 positive -confirmed infection should be placed on 
immediate study treatment delay as per institutional guidelines  [Curigliano 2020 ]. In 
addition, any suspected or confirmed coron avirus COVID -19 (SARS -CoV -2) infection 
should be considered serious a nd be immediately reported to the  sponsor.  
• Since there is lack of data on risk/benefit analysis of the stu dy treatment arms and 
COVID -19 infection, in the absence of a confirmatory negati ve COVID -19 PCR test in 
an asymptomatic subject, it is in the investigator ’s medical judgement to assess the 
benefit and risks of restarting s tudy treatment. The management  of subjects following 
this quarantine period and decision to restart subjects on st udy treatment will be managed 
on an individual subject basis in discussion with the sponsor ( or delegate) and 
investigator.  
• In addition to the above criteria, any suspected or confirmed c oronavirus COVID -19 
(SARS -CoV -2) infection should be considered serio us and be immediately reported to 
the sponsor. The seriousness criteria should be “other medicall y significant” if no other 
seriousness criteria are present (e.g. hospitalisation).  
Physical Examinations and ECOG Performance Status   
Assessment can be done v ia telemedicine (as per the rules below) and should be done acc ording 
to local practice.  
Quality of Life Assessments  
The subject has access to the ePRO application via their own de vices (mobile phone, tablet) via 
an electronic application. Site staff are  to ensure this has been set up for a subject and provide 
training where required. If the subject is unable to use the ap plication on their own then the 
information can be collected via a telephone call; the site sta ff will call the subject, ask the 
questi ons as per the assessment in exactly the same order and wording  (paraphrasing is not 
allowed) and directly enter the data into the eCRF on behalf of  the subject. Answers to questions 
must not be noted down first and then entered into the eCRF as this could  impact validation of 3URWRFRO$XJ_

the ePRO tool. Details of the verification of the patient and t he site personnel conducting the 
assessment should be documented.  
Disease Evaluation: CT/MRI Scans  
This study assessment does not always coincide with a dosing da y, thoug h it might coincide if 
the subject has had no dosing delays (e.g. due to toxicity). In  the case where the assessment 
does not coincide with a dosing visit, to reduce the risk assoc iated with travelling to a study 
site, imaging may be performed at a local i maging facility. The modality to be used for the 
imaging is to be documented and shared with the local imaging f acility. The same imaging 
modality must be used to ensure consistency and secure central reading. Also, central reading 
requires that consistent  slide thickness (deemed acceptable <5mm) and same methodology 
(with vs without contrast agent) across acquisitions timepoints  is met. Please secure scan 
modality slide thickness and methodology used from baseline are  shared with local imaging 
facility.  
Documentation of the imaging facility is to be collected by the site and retained. Scanned 
images are to be shared with the site. The site is responsible for submitting scans for Medpace 
Imaging Central Laboratory. The RECIST reading is to be done by  t h e  i n vestigator for 
treatment choices. The local  facility must be informed about po tential queries that may be sent 
from the central reader after image upload by the main site. Th ese queries may need to be 
addressed by the local imaging facility. A clear proces s should be documented in writing to 
explain how the queries issued from central image QC will be ma naged between the local 
facility and the site.  
Sample Collection  
Haematology and Biochemistry:  To reduce the risk associated with travel to the site if the 
patient comes in the day prior to dosing for haematology sampli ng, or to reduce the risk 
associated with time the subject spends at the study site, a lo cal laboratory may be used to obtain 
and analyse the haematology sam ples. Results of haematology sam ples taken need to be shared 
with the investigational site and assessed prior to dosing as p er protocol requirements. 
Documentation of the local laboratory (accreditation and refere nce ranges) are required to be 
collected and shared with the sponsor. As the su bject attends the site for dosing, effort should 
be made to collect biochemistry samples for central laboratory assessment, as well as all other 
central laboratory samples. If this is not possible, local bioc hemistry samples are to be collected 
as describe d above.  
Pregnancy Test:  Pregnancy testing is required on Day 1 of each cycle. To reduce  the risk 
associated with travel to the site, if the subject comes in the  day prior to dosing for pregnancy 
testing, or to reduce the risk associated with time the subj ect spends at the study site, a local 
laboratory, hospital or general medical practice may be used to  obtain the pregnancy test. 
Results of the pregnancy test need to be shared with the invest igational site and assessed prior 
to dosing as per protocol requ irements.  
Arm 1: 5 -FU Pump Removal  
To reduce the risk associated with travel to site, pump removal  can be performed at home, a 
local hospital or at a general medical practice. In case of a h ome visit, the patient must agree 
that someone will visit them at home for this pump removal. Agreement between the study site 
and the responsible personnel removing the pump needs to be in place, including documentation 
of how information will be shared, and must be in line with loc al regulations with regards to 
privacy  and confidentiality. Details of the time of pump removal must b e shared by the 
responsible personnel with the site. The site staff should call  the subject on the day of the pump 
removal to discuss the medications the subject may be taking as  well as any A E updates since 
the previous visit. Details of the verification of the identity  of the subject and the site personnel 
conducting the assessments (both the pump removal as well as th e phone call) must be 3URWRFRO$XJ_

will have to be reported as deviation.  
Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Details can be collected by site staff via telephone call as pe r the rules relating to use of 
telemedicine below.  
COVID -19 vaccines and or medication shall be reported as concomitant medication.  
AE Reporting  
Of note, as per protocol Section 8.1.5 , all COVID -19 cases (suspected or confirmed) should be 
considered as Serious Adverse Events.  
“Other Medically significant” should be selected as seriousness  criterium if no other seriousness 
criteria are present (e.g. hospitali sation).  
Details can be collected by site staff via telephone call as pe r the rules relating to use of 
telemedicine below.  
Note that further information about measures adopted for the CO VID-19 situation to cover SAE 
reporting and temporary discontinuations are found in Sections 8.1.5  and 8.1.8, respectively.  
Specific Rules Relating to use of Telemedicine  
The form of telemedicine u sed (phone call or use of a platform), the legal and privacy pr otection 
of the subjects as well as details of the verification of the i dentity of the subject and site 
personnel conducting the assessment should be documented at sit e level and should be avai lable 
for review by the monitor.  
Source Data Verification  
When remote data monitoring is allowed per local regulations/na tional guidance and possible 
at site, PI or delegate must:  
• document in the source documents verbal consent from their subj ect for remot e 
monitoring of their data by the sponsor during the pandemic  
or 
• obtain written consent from their subject for remote monitoring  of their data if required 
by local regulations and/or “on site” monitoring of subject dat a is specified in the local 
ICF. 
Guida nce on COVID -19 Vaccine and/or Medication  
Currently available COVID -19 vaccines do not contain live virus; therefore, they are perm itted 
during the study period.  
Future approved COVID -19 vaccines and or medication will be assessed by the Sponsor.  
Subjects may receive COVID -19 vaccination if they have no contraindications to any 
component of the specific vaccine. However, they should be coun selled by the investigator 
about benefit/risk of getting th e vaccination based on their in dividual health conditions as  well 
as with the healthcare physician administrating the vaccination , about the unknown vaccine 
safety profile and effectiveness in immunocompromised populatio ns, as well as the potential 
for insufficient immune responses, and the need to continue to follow all current guidance to 
protect themselves against COVID -19. 
The co -administration of the COVID -19 vaccines with study treatment has not been studied. 
Based on the lack of evidence following is recommended [ Desai 2021 ]: 
• Avoiding administration of study treatment within 48  to 72 hours of vaccination to 
minimize confusion and/or inaccurate attribution of adverse eve nt causation.  3URWRFRO$XJ_

 Introduction  
1.1 Background and Significance 
Scientific Premise : Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is now a leading cause of 
mortality in persons living with HIV (PLWH), accounting for approximately 10% of deaths in 
large HIV clinical cohorts.1-5 With widespread availability of effective antiretroviral therapy, 
deaths due to AIDS-related conditions will continue to decrease. Concurrently, ASCVD will 
continue to increase as a proportion of overall mortality among PLWH, especially in light of the 
aging HIV population.6 Multiple cohort studies have shown a 40-50% higher incidence of 
myocardial infarction (MI) among PLWH with suppressed viremia compared to uninfected persons.
7-9,  These observations highlight the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to 
decreasing ASCVD risk in this population, beyond durable viral suppression. Although chronic immune activation is thought to drive vascular inflammation and atherogenesis in PLWH
10-12, 
the higher prevalence of reversible ASCVD risk factors (smoking, hyperlipidemia and hypertension) among PLWH is also well established.
13-16 Recent studies show that these risk 
factors are more deleterious in PLWH than in uninfected persons. As an example, in a l arge 
Danish cohort (n= 16,255), 72% of MIs observed among persons with HIV were at least partially attributable to smoking compared to 24% of MIs in uninfected persons.
17 These data emphasize 
the need for investigating models of HIV care that are responsive to the complexities of ASCVD 
risk among PLWH. 
Despite the increased risk of major ASCVD events in PLWH, ASCVD primary prevention 
i
n this group may be inferior to that of uninfected persons.18 A study at the University of 
Alabama showed that 17% of persons who were eligible for aspirin by USPSTF guidelines had 
received recommendations from their provider to take it.19 Similarly, data from our group 
showed that PLWH were 30% less likely to receive statins, 47% less likely to receive aspirin 
and 37% less likely to receive anti -hypertensives when indicated than age, sex and race matched 
controls.20 Unfortunately, behavioral interventions targeted at modifying provider practices 
pertaining to CVD risk reduction are often ineffective.21-24 Using non- physician cl inical staff to 
augment care is a potentially effective way to overcome barriers to improving CVD risk management in this setting.  
Behavioral interventions conducted by non- physician clinical staff are effective in reducing 
ASCVD risk. A meta -analysis of 3 9 randomized controlled trials assessing nurse and/or 
pharmacist -led CVD risk -reduction interventions, reported that systolic blood pressure dropped 
by 7.6mm Hg from baseline readings compared to usual care. The mean duration of the interventions assessed was only 8.3 months (range 3-13 months), demonstrating the rapid 
impact these interventions can have on CVD risk parameters.
25 In a randomized study of 636 
patients with hypertension, patients who received a 2- year nurse -administered behavioral 
interventio n were 11% more likely to achieve blood pressure control than patients who received 
usual care.26 The scientific premise of the proposed intervention is that clinical encounter 
supplementation provided by telephone, and delivered by trained professionals, will provide 
additional time and opportunity to establish and reinforce behaviors associated with CVD risk reduction. A measurable manifestation of this intervention will be reduction of blood pressure 
and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels . 27,28 
 
3 
 Significance of the Expected Research Contribution: With the large sample size of the 
retrospective analysis from Aim 1, findings from our study will provide insight into what care 
delivery models have worked historically for ASCVD primary prevention in PL WH. Our 
proposed study will also look at the utility of leveraging the unique, multidisciplinary structure  
of the HIV clinical  care team  for improving ASCVD outcomes  in this high-risk 
population. If the proposed telephone-based intervention proves effective, similar interventions could be applied to addressing other non-AIDS chronic diseases including non- AIDS -related 
cancer, chronic kidney disease and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Our findings will also give validation to the paradigm of incorporating, non-provider HIV clinical staff into longitudinal chronic disease management initiatives for HIV clinic patients.  
 1.2 Innovation 
1) Our study will be the first comparative analysis to examine ASCVD -related outcomes 
based on models of healthcare delivery in an HIV population. By 2019, 50% of all 
patients with HIV in the United States will be aged 50 or older.29,30 Understanding trends i n 
chronic disease care delivery (particularly ASCVD primary prevention) in this aging 
population is critical to informing healthcare delivery interventions that are responsive to the ever-increasing burden of HIV clinical care. Although our data suggest that PLWH who 
receive medical care solely from HIV subspecialists are prescribed CVD medications less 
frequently than uninfected persons,20 how these outcomes deviate from PLWH receiving 
chronic disease care from non -HIV PCPs is unclear. The retrospective an alysis proposed in 
Aim 1 will provide valuable insight on whether or not the intervention proposed in Aim 3 
(and other interventions aimed at improving CVD risk management) should be restricted to persons who receive all non- AIDS chronic disease care exclu sively from their HIV provider. 
In addition, no studies to date have looked at whether receiving CVD preventative care exclusively from an HIV provider has an adverse impact on hard CVD risk factor outcomes (successful blood pressure and lipid control). Our study will be the first to address this question.  
2) The intervention design will be customized based on patient and provider input . 
Telephone- based interventions have been previously shown to improve blood pressure in 
patients with hypertension.
26, 31 -33 The framework of our proposed intervention will be based 
upon the nurse and pharmacist administered instruments from the Hypertension Intervention 
Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS) and the Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) respectively.26,34 However, implementing such interventions 
in the context of HIV care presents unique complexities. To better understand the nuances of HIV care relevant to the development of the intervention, we will adopt a mixed methods 
approach. Semi - structured interviews and focus groups of HIV clinic patients and clinical 
case managers will be used to inform our research team of precise ways to modify our proposed intervention to best fit the needs of the HIV clinic population. This approach will 
provide the unique opportunity to tailor a previously validated ASCVD risk management 
intervention to specifically meet the needs of HIV -infected persons. 
 
3) The intervention will be generalizable, sustainable and time -efficient . Unlike the HINTS 
and CITIES  studies which were administered by nurses and pharmacists hired specifically 
for the research study,  
26,34 we will pilot our proposed intervention with clinical case managers 
(CCMs) who are primarily employed by the HIV clinic, and are part of many HIV clini cs. 
4 
 Given the prominent role of CCMs in HIV care, our intervention (if effective) will be highly 
generalizable to a variety of clinical settings. The total telephone encounter time of the proposed intervention is approximately 30- 45 minutes per encounter. In addition, the short 
duration of the intervention (24 weeks) also enhance ease of implementation in real -world 
practice. Most importantly, using clinic -employed CCMs will allow for easy incorporation 
of this strategy into practice, making it more sustainable over time, and immediately applicable.  
 
4) The intervention  will leverage  the therapeutic  rapport  between CCMs  and HIV  
clinic  patients  to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed intervention. CCMs typically 
have a nuanced knowledge of the HIV clinic patient’s psychosocial barriers to care and how to resolve them. Of all the members of the HIV clinical care team, this depth of knowledge is usually exclusive to the CCM, given them the ability to quickly establish a unique therapeutic rapport with clinic  patients. According to the New York State AIDS Institute, the 
goal of case management is “to promote and support independence and self -sufficiency”.
35 
This goal aligns with the central tenets of the HINTS and CITIES interventions predicated on enhancing s elf-efficacy in accordance with the Health Belief Model (HBM), one of the 
preeminent psychological theories of health behavior.
36 These parallel objectives make HIV 
CCMs ideal providers to implement the proposed interventions. The pre -existing therapeutic 
rapport between CCMs and their clinic patients is centered around the restoration of self -
efficacy, a key component absent from both aforementioned studies. Given the work- time 
compression characteristic of the physician -patient interaction, CCMs may be more effective 
than providers in motivating lifestyle modification because they have more time to promote change in a systematic manner based on sound cognitive constructs. Although using CCMs will increase the amount of training needed to implement the intervention, the benefits of using these professionals to deliver chronic disease interventions have never been formally assessed. Examining the role of this therapeutic dynamic in the in the implementation of the behavioral intervention is novel and a primary focus of our study. 
 
Study Objectives  
The overall objective of this study is to assess the impact of telephone- based case manager 
administered interventions in improving ASCVD risk factor outcomes among HIV- infected 
clinic patients.   2.1 Primary Objective  
To assess the effect of a telephone based CVD risk reduction intervention on decreasing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and fasting LDL- c levels from baseline.  
 2.2 Secondary Objective 
To assess the effect of a telephone based CVD risk reduction intervention on weight loss and change in 10 -year ASCVD risk score.  
 
Study Design  
3.1 General Design 
Fifty high CVD  risk clinic patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a series of 
educational pamphlets on CVD risk reduction plus a telephone-based CVD risk reduction 
5 
 curriculum delivered over 24 weeks [intervention arm], or the educational pamphlets alone 
[control arm]. Anthropomorphic data, blood pressure and lipid profiles will be obtained from patients at baseline and at the end of the study (24 weeks) to assess the efficacy of the intervention in reducing blood pressure and serum low-density lipoprotein leve ls (LDL).  
 
3.2 Design Team Consultations  
 We will conduct a series of participatory, iterative design consultation team meetings held over the course of 2-4 weeks.  The design team will include a combination of 2- 4 clinical social 
workers from Clinic 1K, 1-3 persons living with HIV. Each member of the design team will be recruited by personal invitation.  The purpose of the design teams will be to provide refine the intervention designed by the study investigator and SW consultant. The design process will involve three main phases: brainstorming, conceptualization, and creation described below in study procedures. The results from the first two design team meetings will inform one additional design team meeting to iteratively refine the intervention. Informe d consent will be obtained 
from all members of the consultation team. We anticipate that each design team session will take between 3 -4 hours. Design team members will be compensated $150 per session completed.

4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Pre-screening: we will use the electronic medical records at our site to identify potential 
subjects for our study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Potential subjects may also be recommended by providers within the Division of Infectious Diseases based on the inclusion/exclusion crit eria. Potential subjects will initially be mailed a recruitment 
letter signed by his or her primary HIV provider. Potential subjects will have the opportunity to opt out of the study by calling a toll-free number.   In addition to receipt of letters, prospective participants will be approached with the permission of their providers during routinely scheduled clinical encounters, by a member of the study team. During such encounters, the study team will inform participants about the study and the reasons why they are eligible to participate. At that point, the patient will have the option to proceed with a baseline screening visit or not.   This study will also utilize cold -calling recruitment methods. This will include contacting 
the patients directly if they meet eligibility criteria to enroll them into this study. Research coordinator(s) will refer to patients’ electronic medical records ( EMR) to 
confirm that the patient(s) have not opted out from being contacted for research studies.   Screening: A research coordinator will contact all subjects who do not opt out. Following a telephone script, the research assistant will describe the study  in detail, 
ensure the patient is eligible and willing to participate, and schedule a baseline study visit at the next clinical visit with an HIV provider where they will be enrolled following the informed consent process described below in section 5.1.  
   4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects 
 
Throughout the course of the study, patients will be encouraged to complete the all study 
assessments. However, it is possible that a subject may discontinue study participation at any time for any reason. The reason for early withdrawal must be documented in the subject’s case file, subject tracking document and subject withdrawal form on REDCap.   4.4.1 Reasons for withdrawal: 
The voluntary nature of studies allows for participants to withdraw from the study at any point for any reason. Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if a serious adverse event (SAE) occurs. Subjects may be withdrawn if: 
1. They withdraw their consent  
2. In the opinion of the investigator, continuation of study participation would be hazardous to the participant, or compromise study findings.  
 The reason for any subject’s discontinuation and the date of withdrawal will be recorded in the subject’s case file. The subject’s case file, which will be completed up to the point of withdrawal will be retained for six years. The study report will include reasons for subjects’ withdrawals as 
7 
 well as details relevant to the subjects’ withdrawals. Any subject withdrawn from the trial prior 
to completion will undergo all procedures indicated in this protocol as being scheduled to occur at discharge or upon early withdrawal. Any subject withdrawn due to an adverse event (whether serious or non- serious) or any clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value will be 
evaluated by the principal investigator, and will be treated and followed up until the symptoms or values return to normal or acceptable levels, as judged by the Principal Investigator. 
Relevant 
post-study procedures will be performed, wherever possible, on subjects who elect to withdraw. 
 
4.4.2 Handling of Withdrawals:  
If a subject is withdrawn from participation in the study at any time at his or her request, at the 
IRB or Principal Investigator’s discretion, the reason(s) for discontinuation shall be documented thoroughly in the source documents and subject’s case file. If a subject is discontinued because of an adverse event, this event will be followed until it is resolved or the subject is clinically stable and will also be documented in the source documents and the subject’s case file.  
Study  Procedures  
 5.1 Design Team Procedures: 
 This intervention adaptation aim will involve three phases: brainstorming, conceptualization, and creation:  
 During the brainstorming (meeting #1) : the design team will review the mixed -methods data 
obtained during aim 2 of the study, which sought to gain detailed knowledge about HIV clinic patients’ perception of their own CVD risk and the HIV clinic’s role in CVD risk reduction. The following topi cs will be discussed: 
perception of CVD risk (perceived susceptibility), provider 
accessibility (perceived barriers), provider prioritization of CVD risk management (perceived 
barriers), and interventions likely to motivate risk reducing behaviors (perceived benefits and 
cue to actions). The team will discuss these findings and brainstorm ideas to refine the SWOBI 
intervention in response to the data. Possible targets for adaptation include a) targeting the staff 
training to include relevant aspects of perceived risk into the care coordination and adherence 
support; (b) developing and tailoring staff training to facilitate acceptance, uptake, and effectiveness; and (c) helping us to quickly identify and troubleshoot any problems with the implementation of th e intervention. 
 During the conceptualization phase (meeting #2) : the team will evaluate advantages and 
disadvantages of ideas generated during the brainstorming phase, and the educational material developed ahead of this meeting. The team will then develop concrete changes to the intervention. The feasibility of each of the discussed intervention modification will be discussed and finalized into the intervention by the study PI.   During the creation phase (meeting #3) : the team will be involved in the cre ation of refined 
manuals of procedures and education materials. After the feasibility testing is completed, the design team will meet for a final time to discuss feasibility testing results from meeting #2 and refine the intervention as needed. At this meeting, the design team members who have given consent to participate in a focus group discussion will reflect on the design process.  
8 
 5.2 Pre-trial demonstration 
Prior to the commencement of the trial, we will recruit one clinic patient to participate in a 
demonstration of the study intervention telephone modules. The purpose of this demonstration is to give the study social worker the opportunity to execute the trial intervention modules and resolve workflow/logistical concerns with the intervention prior to study launch. The demonstration patient will be recruited by personal invitation of the study investigator. They will be consented prior to their participation in the process. The study patient will be expected to participate in no more than three demonstration sessions. They will serve as a mock recipient of the telephone-based intervention. After conclusion of the demo intervention call, the study team will ask the demo participant questions about the acceptability of the telephone call, as well as their perceived strengths and weaknesses of the telephone module. The demonstration participant 
will be compensated $ 50 for each session  for a total of $150.  
 
5.3 Study Timeline  
 
All enrolled patients will complete 4 study visits as outlined in the flow chart below:              5.4 Informed Consent  
Each subject will give informed consent, either using a hard copy consent in person or via the e-
consent process in REDCap, prior to enrollment into study during the baseline visit. Research coordinator(s) will read, review, and discuss consent forms with all potential participants prior to asking them to sign. If the candidate appears confused or indicates a lack of understanding, the interviewer will attempt to identify the misunderstanding and to explain the form again. Any candidate who still does not comprehend the form will be excluded from the study. We will ask questions to confirm understanding of the material covered in the consent procedure, both open ended (e.g. “Could you tell me what’s going to happen of you enroll in this study?) and closed (e.g. “is your parti cipation in this study voluntary?”). Persons who understand the consent form 
and agree to participate in the study will be asked to sign an authorization for the release of medical information to us. Interviewers will witness and date the signed forms and complete the corresponding informed consent checklist to document the participant’s understanding of the informed consent process. Consent procedures will take place in a private room or office. Consent forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet within a locked room.   5.5 Data collection Baseline

 Data will be collected through the electronic data capture system – REDCap. Patients will have 
the option of providing e-consent on this platform. Participants will be asked to complete patient reported outcome measures via REDCap at various timepoints throughout the study including: single item health literacy, demographics, adherence, IPAQ physical activity, and perception of risk of heart disease scale. In addition, the clinical research coordinators will collect patie nt 
information for: medical chart screen, participant screening, BP and cholesterol medications, physical measurements, and outcomes. Adverse events will also be collected to track and ensure safety of the patient throughout the duration of their participation in the study.  
 5.6 Randomization 
 We will conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial of the intervention vs. education control group among 50 PLWH on suppressive ART who have either hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. Control participants will rece ive general prevention education. The 
intervention will consist of prevention education plus a 24- week intensive telephone-based, social work administered intervention focused on heart-healthy behaviors.   5.7 Control group   
Participants assigned to the control group will receive usual clinical care enhanced with a series of 12 packets of educational handouts delivered to patients every two weeks for 24 weeks. . Educational pamphlets will be delivered on one of six topics on a rotational basis (two rotations over a 6 -month study period) . The topics to be covered by the educational material are as 
follows: CVD Knowledge and Risk Perception, Medication Reconciliation, Dietary Assessment and Education, Physical Activity and Weight Management, Smoking Cessation, Stress Management. On enrollment, participants will determine the optimal mode of delivery for the educational material (email, regular mail, or text). All participants in the control and intervention arm will complete the f ollowing study assessments: 1) in-office BP obtained by a trained 
research assistant (0, 6, 12, 18 months) 2) lipid profile (0, 6, 12, 18 months )(the default will be to 
collect data from lipid profiles done as part of routine clinical care, within 4 weeks of baseline visit; if lipid information is not available or exceeds acceptable time point, lipid panel will be collected by the research staff).  3) 10- year ASCVD risk score (0, 6, 12, 18 months 4) provider 
trust and communication survey (0, 6, 12, 18 months ).  
 5.8 Study Intervention  
In addition to the educational material delivered to the control arm participants, participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive a 24- week telephone- based  intervention, 
customized for the delivery to PLWH by social workers (SW). Participants will be contacted every 2 weeks for a total of 12 calls in the 24-week period by the study social worker. During each call, the participant will have the chance to select a module from 6 modules in a rotating fashion on topics relevant to CVD risk (Table 2). Once a module is chosen, it can only be chosen once more for the duration of the study period. Each telephone session will involve the study SW providing education on the selected module to promote improved CVD health. For the diet, physical activity, and overview of CVD risk factors modules, there will be a low and high literacy version. At baseline the coordinator will assess whether the participant should be low or high literacy based on their discussions. The coordinator will then relay this assessment when notifying the social worker that the participant has been randomized to intervention. During the 
10 
 first module, the social worker will make a secondary assessment of the participant’s health 
literacy level. The social worker will have the final dec ision as to which version of the module 
the participants will receive. During the call, the social worker will follow the prompts of a telephone script. As part of the intervention, the SW will incorporate MI techniques at different times during the phone call based on the direction of the conversation. Towards the end of each call, the participant will have the option to review any or all of the corresponding educational materials relevant to the module. Each of these calls will take between 30 -45 minutes to 
administer.  At the conclusion of the study telephone visit, participants will be delivered a 
package of educational pamphlets similar to those administered to participants in the control arm. Like the control arm, a total of 12 packets will be delivered to intervention participants via their method of choice. Since this pilot study seeks to determine the independent effect of the SW-based intervention, SWs will be instructed not to feedback on study- related telephone 
interactions to the participant’s provider. This will be facilitated by the physical separation between the SW offices and the provider work area. Recruitment efforts will also be tailored to inform providers about the study with the minimal amount of details on the intervention available to avoid undue influence on their practice patterns.   All study follow up visits will be conducted within a +/- 21 day window.  
 5.9 Social Worker Responsibilities  
Responsibilities of interventionist social worker (ISW) are as follows:  
a. The ISW will assist in the development of educational material and scripts for the intervention  
b. The ISW will participate in all design consultation team sessions aimed at refining the modules for the intervention  
c. The ISW will edit and review modified versions of the study intervention after feedback from the design consultation team is obtained.  
d. The ISW will participate in post design consultation forums for finalization of the study intervention  
e. The ISW will participate in all pre -intervention training associated with the intervention, 
including (and not limited to): training on medication side effects, simulation sessions for scripted material, review of all educational material, use of Zoom (or other teleconferencing platform for consultation)  
f. The IS W will deliver the intervention as configured including: pre- telephone call 
documentation, study-telephone call, telephonic transmission of visual educational aids (when applicable), post-telephone call documentation (including use of SW- based 
techniques). The ISW will also be called to use their discretion in employing SW -based 
techniques for individual patients. All techniques used during the interaction must be documented as part of the study fidelity worksheet to be provided to the ISW by the study team   
g. The ISW will answer questions posed by study participants to the best of their ability. Any questions that cannot be answered, and deemed outside their scope of practice by the ISW as part of the intervention will be documented and sent on to the study investigator for resolution. The ISW is specifically instructed not to answer detailed questions on:  
a. CVD medication interactions with current medications  
11 
 b. Medical issues not directly related with CVD primary prevention related topics 
(hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking cessation etc)  
c. Medication dosing, up-titration or down- titration  
d. Referrals to specialty providers with the exception of mental  health practitioners  
e. Medications or supplements not-approved by the US Food and Drug Administration  
f. Other questions by the ISW’s determination is outside the scope of routine social work practice  
h. This documentation and transmission to the study investigator should be conducted as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after completion of the phone call. Notification will be conducted ideally via institutional e -mail o r MyChart messaging. The 
study investigator will be expected to give a response to such questions within 48 hours of receipt.  
i. The ISW will communicate all concerns about logistics of the study to the study coordinator in a timely manner 
j. The ISW will report all potential adverse events to the study team (study coordinator and study PI)  as soon as they are aware as delineated in Section 7.2. 
 The following documents will be provided to the ISW by the study team prior to study launch:   
a. Telephone call intake forms  
b. Educational material associated with module administration  
c. Baseline asses sment data for individual participants including participant’s learning 
preferences  
d. Current contact information (phone and e-mail) of the study PI and the study coordinator  
e. A cell phone for the execution of study phone call with SMS transmission capability and associated data  
f. List of CVD -related community resources in Raleigh -Durham Metropolitan area  
g. Resource document with side effect profiles of major classes of medication used in cardiovascular disease primary prevention.  
h.  
5.10 Post study intervention  
Participants will be followed after the 24 -week intervention at 48 (6-month post intervention) 
and 72 weeks (1 year post intervention) to assess the durability of the intervention’s impact. At those visits, we will collect blood pressures, anthropomorphic and lipid panels similar to the first two study visits. We will also conduct patient-reported data on the durability of the intervention using formal assessment tools for heart- healthy behaviors at each visit.  
 5.11 Post Intervention Interviews 
After the 6 month intervention is complete, we will approach a convenience sample of 10 participants to participate in an additional key informant interview. All interviews will be completed between the end of the intervention and the participants 12 month visit. These interviews will take place at the participants 6 month visit or by phone at a mutually agreed upon time. Questions will address the participants perception of the intervention’s characteristics and program outcomes. All interviews will take  approximately 30 minutes and audio recordings 
using an encrypted recorder  if participant agrees to be recorded, will later be transcribed using a 
12 
 Duke-approved transcription service (rev.com) to transcribe the audio files . Audio recordings 
will be destroyed after results of study are published. An interview information sheet will be 
shared with participants asked to participate in interview. They will be verbally consent ed to 
participate or decline if they choose. Participan ts who complete this key informant interview will 
be compensated an additional $50 by check for their time and insights.   
Statistical Plan  
6.1 Sample size Determination: 
Given that this is a pilot study, our goal is to determine the effect size of the intervention to determine the statistical power needed for subsequent larger studies. Based on our assessment of the recruitment pool and resources available through the award, we will enroll 25 patients in each arm (n = 50) with anticipated 20% dropout rate over 6 months for an estimated final analysis sample of 40 patients. Based on previous studies,
 25 we can anticipate a mean systolic 
blood pressure change of 7.6 mmHg, and a standard deviation of 15 mm Hg, for an effect size of 0.51. An effect size of < 0.3 will be considered insignificant.  
6.2
 Statistical Methods  
Data on the outcome variables (blood pressure, non- HDL/LDL, 10 -year ASCVD risk score) for 
each arm will be collected at weeks 0, 6, 12 and 18  months . Summary statistics of the study 
cohort will be reported for every interim timepoint. Generalized linear mixed regression models will be used to assess the changes in systolic blood pressure and LDL-c over the period of the intervention. Models will be fi t with an interaction term to account for the difference of 
differences (DID) at each timepoint in the study (on intervention and post intervention timepoints to assess durability of the intervention’ s effect) to assess the treatment effect between the two  
arms. The p -value of the interaction term will serve as significance testing for the difference 
between the outcome value difference of the two study arms. The same technique will be used for the secondary analysis of ASCVD risk scores.   Missing data will be handled as follows:  
• Variables with more than 30% missingness will be dropped from the analysis regardless of 
reason  
• Variables with less than 30% missingness will be evaluated by individual observations. If the data point is determined to be missing at random, then values will be imputed in its place 
using multiple dataset imputation methods. If the data point is determined to be not missing at 
random, then the observation of missingness will be reported in the summative reporting after the reasons for the patterns of missingness have been determined. The missing values will 
then be imputed by the predicted linear regression model.  
• Any observations without data from the intervention completion (week 24) timepoint will be 
excluded from the analysis 
 
6.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
All randomized subjects with at least partial outcome data for the baseline and week 24 timepoints will be included in the analysis, regardless of missingness of the post-intervention timepoints.  
Safety  
7.1 Potential Risks 
13 
  
 Loss of confidentiality  
The risks associated with potential loss of confidentiality are low. The staff obtaining data will be properly trained and supervised. Participant data, including audio recordings, will be stored in files on the Duke Division of Infectious Diseases private server, managed by the Duke Office of Information Technology.   Detection of clinically significant problems  
Although not caused by study participation, it is possible that clinically significant problems will be detected by study staff. Subjects entering the study will have a history of hypertension or hyperlipidemia so abnormal systolic, diastolic and lipid values are expected. All values that reach a safety threshold (<90 or >18 0 systolic BP, or <40 or >110 diastolic BP) will be reported 
to the subjects’ care provider immediately (See Section on Adverse Event Reporting).   Physical activity  
During the course of the study, SWs may encourage participants to increase their physical activity, increasing the possibility of musculoskeletal injury or unmasking of ischemic heart disease. Risks from increased physical activity will be minimized by encouraging moderate rather than vigorous activity. Providers will respond to these patient problems per usual medical care.  
 Smoking  Smoking participants will be encouraged to quit smoking, increasing the possibility of withdrawal symptoms from nicotine dependence.   Psychological risks For the purpose of the study assessments, participants will be asked about personal characteristics such as race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status that may be uncomfortable to answer. Only questions that are important to inform the study outcomes will be asked during the course of the trial. Participants will b e informed that they may refuse to answer any questions, 
and continue to participate in the study. It is also possible that participants may be uncomfortable talking to the SW about some topics that will be discussed as part of the intervention.      7.2 Protection against risks 
 Protection of participants’ confidentiality  Since this study involves people with HIV, steps will be taken to protect patient data and identities. All research staff will be trained in initial, follow up and monitoring training specific to the trial in addition to the Research Ethics and Compliance training via Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI), which will ensure the understanding of all the ethical issues involved in research. All consent forms signed by the participants will be maintained in locked files with limited access, se parate from any subject data and will only be accessible to the 
study team. Any personal identifiers linked to the data will be replaced with subject IDs in all patient records. Participants will be made aware of these risks at the time of informed consent, prior to study participation.     Blood Pressure  
14 
 The participants will have a high risk for CVD and thus many will be prescribed hypertension 
medications by their health care provider at the outset of the study. It is likely that as a result of increased  monitoring, we will detect more episodes of abnormal BP values. BP will be measured 
at each follow up visit. Participants will have access to their regular providers as well as the study investigator designated as the clinical contact for the study: Dr. O keke (infectious disease 
physician; Duke Health). An average SBP at any study visit >180 mm Hg and/or diastolic is >110 mm Hg will be considered an alert value and will trigger assessment by the study clinician. Additionally, an average BP at any study visit that is <90 systolic of <40 diastolic would also be considered an alert value and would trigger an assessment by the study clinician.   Participants who have an alert BP reading during study visits will be directly assessed for cardiovascular symptoms during the visit. Once an alert value has been confirmed, the participant will be triaged according to follow -up recommendations from Joint National 
Committee Recommendations (JNC 8). If at any time, participants have symptoms of acute end organ damage (i.e. current chest pain, dyspnea at rest, new onset of blurry vision, or new neurological deficits consistent with a stroke) in the context of an elevated BP measurement (SBP >180, and/or DBP >110), participants will be asked to contact the clinician and will be advised and assisted in seeking emergency medical care.  
 For participants in the intervention group whose average SBP >180 and DBP >110 or SBP < 90 or DBP < 40 but are without acute symptoms, the participant’s primary provider will be notified. Follow up contact with the study staff will occur within one week. All abnormal blood pressure results will be communicated to the clinic director at each site who will be an integral part of triage and ensuring follow up. The SW will then generate a note to be entered into the electronic medical record and will communicate directly with the subject’s PCP.
 
 Medication adverse effects  
The usual health care provider of the participants on antihypertensive and/or on lipid lowering medication will take primary responsibility for counseling the patient about side -effects and 
ordering follow-up laboratories. In addition, each participant will be counselled by the SW about possible side effects, drug interaction with ART and adherence.    Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: a) results in study withdrawal; b) is associated with a serious adverse event; c) is associated with clinical signs or symptoms; d) leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests; or d) is con sidered by the investigator to be of clinical significance.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that is: fatal, life- threatening, requires or prolongs 
hospital stay, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly o r 
birth defect, an important medical event (an event that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance).  
 All subjects will be informed about their rights prior to participation and will be encouraged to report a ny incidents or adverse effects to the investigators and the Duke University Institutional 
15 
 Review Board (IRB). Contact information for the investigators and the IRB will be provided in 
the consent forms. During assessments the research staff will inquire about AEs and complete an AE form for each subject. At baseline, clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded along with other preexisting conditions. If a preexisting condition is reported at baseline, it will be reported as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. All reportable AEs will be captured in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) on the AE Case Report Form (CRF) where the responsible research staff will report the nature, the sever ity 
and the resolution of the AE. When an AE is considered to be a SAE and study -related, the study 
PI will be responsible for reviewing and signing off on the AE.   Research staff will be trained on procedures for AE identification, collection and reporti ng in 
detail. Study staff will also be trained to provide crisis intervention and referral as standard operating procedure within each clinic for such situations, should they become dangerous or life-threatening (i.e. suicidal ideation or attempts).   
 AEs will be managed in conjunction with clinic medical staff, with permission from the 
participant. All subjects will be ongoing patients at a study site clinic and thus subjects can be monitored and have access to medical staff through the study period.     All unresolved adverse events at the end of the study will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator will notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occ urring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated 
study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.   
 
Data Handling and Record Keeping  
8.1 Confidentiality 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). A signed subject authorization will be obtained on the informed consent document informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, will retain the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 8.2 Source Documents  
Any s ource data (i.e. all information original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the construction and evaluation of this trial) collected during the course of the trial, will be kept in a locked fi ling cabinet in a locked office. All subject 
16 
 data with PHI will be kept separate from the master list that links subjects to their subject IDs. All 
data stored on the computer will be maintained on duke computers secured by duke firewall. All essential stu dy documents will be retained for 6 years after study completion.  
 8.3 Case Report Forms 
All study CRFs will be obtained via an electronic data capture (EDC) called REDCap. All data will be monitored by a designated data manager at the Duke Office of Clin ical Research (DOCR), 
who will be responsible for developing, generating, and managing ongoing study data to ensure accuracy and complete acquisition of study data. To minimize data -entry error and data -
management miscoding, questionnaire data will be coll ected via tablet computers and immediately 
uploaded to a secure web- based server, ensuring backup. Source documents and electronic data 
will also be checked for accuracy and adherence to study protocols.  
  
Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before commencement of this study. The investigator should provide a list of EC/IRB members and their affiliate to th e sponsor. 
 All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the EC/IRB for the study. The formal consent of a subject, using the EC/IRB-approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure. This consent form must be signed by the subject or legal ly acceptable surrogate, and the investigator -
designated research professional obtaining the consent.   
Study Finances  
 10.1Funding Source 
This study is funded by a grant through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI; K23HL137611).  10.2 Conf l
ict of Interest

going to ask you some questions about the intervention to hear about your experiences and  
perspectives. Please know that there is no right or wrong answer. You will notice that I won’t  
give you a lot of feedback on your responses because I don’t want to influence your answers.  
Finally, you are under no obligation to talk about anything that you are not comfortable  
discussing with me. Do you have any questions or concerns before we begin?

Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/ day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by the following : 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA) 
concentration from baseline to end  of treatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• The proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over the 24 -week Treatment P eriod  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine amin otransferase (ALT) concentration  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the sa fety and tolerability of repeated daily doses of A4250 for 2 4 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µg/kg/day and 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in children with PFIC  (deficiencies of familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screenin g Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µ g/kg/day or 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day 168)  in this study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72 -week open- label extension  study (A4250-0 08) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study and one scheduled telephone contact.

A4250  
Safety:    
Safety criteria are as follows:  
• Occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse events including severity and relatedness to study drug at all 
visits  
• The incidence of treatmen t-emergent serious adverse events ( SAEs ), based upon informati on from 
patient reports, including the description, incidence, and severity of an SAE  
• Trends evaluated for the following assessments: physical examinations, concomitant medications, vital 
signs, laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hemato logy, urinalysis, alfa -fetoprotein, 
vitamins A and E, 25- hydroxy vitamin D and INR), and abdominal ultrasound  
Statistical Methods:  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 40  µg/kg/day and 
120 µg/kg/day  A4250 in children with PFIC Types 1 and 2. 
  
The Cochran Mantel Haenzel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare 
the proportion in fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment  (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same response. The proportion together with the corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -Pearson exact CI and p- value for the CMH test will be presented.  
 
 
For the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at subject level over the 24-
week treatment period , an ANCOVA model will be used to a nalys e the comparisons between the treatment 
groups. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score,  PM baseli ne pruritus score, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS mean  (SE) by treatment arm and LS  mean 
difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and p- values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day 
and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. 
normality and homogeneity of variances, a non -parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used as a 
sensitivity analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean difference/SE between active 
dose and placebo will be provided.   
 
For each primary endpoint  by region (EU & RoW and US),  a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure 
will be applied to control the 1 -sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the placebo at 
the 0.025 level, as specified below:  
 
In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with the placebo group 
first. If the 1 -sided p- value is  ≤0.025, the 1- sided p- values for low dose vs. placebo and high dose vs. placebo  
will be calculated  respectively. If both individual p- values are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be 
declared on both dose groups. If only one of them is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on 
the corresponding dose group.  
 
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups. No adjustment s will be performed for multiple 
comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product 
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This  transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids since it facilitates the hig h-affinity, high-c apacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofm ann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.  In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gastrointestinal (GI) related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral 
doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks .  A4250 reduced mean levels  of serum bile acids  
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug, and most  adverse events  (AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Backgrou nd 
5.2.1 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis 
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10% to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children  and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].  The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1, 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also ref erred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis -1 (FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular

 membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer 
to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease. 
• PFIC, Type 2:  also refer red to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency.”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations  in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease. 
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by a deficiency of the multidrug- resistance protein 3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid tra nslocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus i s experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver  biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosi s.  Serum biochemistry indicate s cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase  (GGT ) activ ity 
(exception being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of 
portal hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -
Spraul 2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of s ymptoms is 
2 months, and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The 
life-threatening and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those 
not resorting  to surgery is 50% at 10 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  
Approximately half of PFIC patients undergo liver transplantation [ Davit -Spraul 2009] and 
treatment -resistant pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external 
biliary diversion, mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.  Currently, the treatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.  A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have liver failure or per sistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Clinical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ( [IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals  seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.  In addition, no safety signals were seen in repea t-dose oral toxicity 
studies in r ats with up to 2 6 weeks  of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic e xposure in both humans and other 
species .  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome 
P450 ( CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µmol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a singl e-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg , the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 19 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo.  A4250 was generall y well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg  [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be  fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not 
related to A4250.  The 3 AEs experienced by 2 subjects  reported as related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea  (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg/day  for 4 weeks .  Twenty 
patients  (8 females  and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 1 7 years  were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a second dose level.  No

 treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs,  including some increased 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment with A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s -BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients  (ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11 non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patient -reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 24 patients  during treatment.  
The dose with the greatest improvement showed a mean decrease (±  standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results from this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and  is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption  
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988]. A portion 
of patients who have biliary diversion surgery continue to have elevated serum bile acids and 
pruritus . Liver transplantation is typically used as an option when p atients have failed 
medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus. 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function witho ut surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achieves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 i s to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transplantation .  For those patients who have undergone biliary diversion surgery and 
continue to have elevated serum bile acids and symptomatic pruritus, IBAT inhibition ha s the 
potential to reduce both the serum bile acid levels and the pruritus. 
The doses selected, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re -entered) and supporting data from all 
patients ( n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in the PFIC subgroup was at 
30 µg/kg/day for both s-BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg /day; however, a clear dose relationship could not be

 established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3 study.  As efficacy was observed 
at both low and high doses, 40 µg/kg and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Patients completing 2 4 weeks  of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-l abel treatment with  A4250. 
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit  
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo- sponsored clinical studies: a double -blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator- sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. 
Healthy subjects have been exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as 
part of a multiple -dose evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated 
with up to 0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; 
both were judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acids in the liver resulting  in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepat ic 
circulation of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study 
showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing.

Final Amendment 06, 24 June 2019  
 Additional clinic visits may be required for pat ients who need direct site assistance, e.g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil  screening requirements , and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After 
signing the I CF, patients will be considered enrolled and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily recording of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study.  After 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re -screened .  
Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not allowed to 
re-screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily us e of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observe r-reported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO), and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period (study Days  -56 to 0), throughout the 24-w eek Treatment Period 
(study Days  0 to 168), and Follow-up (Day 196). 
The 14 consecutive days prior to randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of the 
diary entrie s.  If a patient does not meet the minimum number of observations (see 
Section  9.2.2 for scoring and missing data definitions) to determine eligibility, the patient 
may be re- screened.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients  of all ages  will be recorded by a 
caregiver .  If possible, the same caregiver  will complete the Albireo ObsRO items throughout 
the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit 2) additional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit 3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports fr om the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, clinical genetic 
confirmation of diagnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  
visits.  Two weeks after Visit 3, there will be a telephone contact with the caregiver/patient  to 
evaluate any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete t he Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers will be requested to use the diary to report the time each 
dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period. 
The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A425 0-008) should they

the last visit in this study and the first visit in Study A425 0-008.  Visit 9/EOT  should also be 
performed at the time  patients are prematurely withdrawn from the study.

Patients /caregivers  will be  informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their 
reasons.  
Any withdrawal, and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the  electronic case 
report form  (eCRF ) and source documents and the patient followed by the 
investigator/investigative s taff.  Even after the study is completed at the Follow-up Visit, the 
investigator/investigative s taff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal , recor d any patient 
data they receive concerning SAEs, and all drug-r elated no n-serious AEs, and subsequently 
report these according to Section 10.1.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances:  
• A patient’s /caregiver’s  desir e for withdrawal for any reason 
• Lost to follo w-up (every effort must be made to contact the patient /caregiver ; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• A worsening of the symp toms related to diarrhea occurs  
• Death  
• Patient /caregiver  estimation of intolerable symptoms

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that should be swallowed intact .  These size 3 capsules may be opened 
only under exceptional circumstances, e.g., patient cannot swallow capsule intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and pl acebo.   Bottles with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.   Refer to the investigational product manual. 
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks .  Study drug will be dispensed to the patient  at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses, and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed whole 
will be documented through the eDiary and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after 
laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowing the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water. 
For a patient unable to swallow capsule  intact , the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce, or fruit 
purée .  A list of food options can be found in the Pharmacy manual . The amount of food 
should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and should be followed by water.  
1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée, or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to the patient will be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category (identified in Table 2 ), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Label ing 
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in high-density polyethylene containers, with child-proof 
polypropylene caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength specified in Table 2 above will be manufactured. 
Packaging and labeling  will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment pa cks containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers.  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15 °C and 25°C. 
Patients /caregivers  shou ld be informed of appropriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature, between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo. 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by 
a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and

Final Amendment 0 6, 24 June  2019 
 allocat ed by the  Intera ctive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at Screening .  The randomization codes will be compute r-generated by  
Biostatistics  and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The randomizat ion 
will be done  in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) and age class 
(6 months to 5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ) to ensure approximate balance 
between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prep ared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization. 
Patients who are eligible for randomi zation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization  
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who withdraw from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  
Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 according to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once  a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the st udy 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized to.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured by the study drug number. 
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study drug number corresponding to the randomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will 
not be displayed t o end-users in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently required, i.e., only where knowledge of 
the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situatio n, the investiga tor 
at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS .  The responsibility to 
break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator.   The 
investigator should make every effort to discuss the ra tionale (status and outcome) for 
emergency unblinding with the sponsor Medical Monitor or the  Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible to review the individual patient details . 
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be a uthorized to 
access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS.  Emergency unblinding 
takes place in the IWRS via a dedicated emergency unblinding module.  The system will 
require the user to enter their emergency unblinding, which is typically provided at the  same 
time login credentials are distributed.   The exact description of the treatment assigned to the 
individual patient then will be accessible  to the user.  Once the randomization code is broken 
for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures at 
EOT  should be performed.  As a follow -up, Visit  10, will be performed according to the time

 schedule.  Once a randomization code has been broken, the investigator must inform the 
 and sponsor Medical Mo nitor in writing  within 24 hours.  In case of technical issues 
accessing the system online, please see the IWRS site user manual for country -specific 
contact telephone numbers for the  HelpDesk 24/7 system support. 
8.5 Patient  Compliance 
The study nurse  will monitor eDiar y compliance by routine review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both diary entr ies on a day  are missing , the study n urse will call the 
patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entries .  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents. Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, patients 
will return all unused study drug at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug, assess c ompliance, and r ecord details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient , and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records sh all include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients . 
The investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were prov ided the quantities  specified in the protocol and that all study drug 
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator will note a ll ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or changes in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medications (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sle ep will be 
recorded.  
All medications taken by a patient within 3 months prior to the first intake of study drug are 
regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the study, are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1.

 9 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
9.1 Efficacy Endpoint s 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint s are as f ollows: 
• Europe an Union  (EU) and rest of the world  (RoW ): Proportion of patients 
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration from baseline to 
the end of treatment or reaching  a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to pla cebo  after 24 
weeks of treatment.  
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization 
and the previous visit (Clinic Visit 2) .  The end value is the average of the values at 
Weeks  22 and 24 after the start of double-blind treatment.  
• United States (US ): Proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level 
over the 24- week Treatment Period. A positive pruritus assessment is defined as a 
scratching score of ≤1 or at least a one-point drop from baseline on the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument . At each assessment, the AM score will be compared to the AM 
baseline, and the PM score will be compared to the PM  baseline. Both AM baseline 
and PM baseline pruritus assessments will be included in th e analysis of this endpoint. 
AM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose of study medications will be 
averaged as AM baseline. PM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose will be averaged as PM baseline.   
9.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
Secondary  efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over 
the 24- week Treatment Period. A positive pruritus assessment is defined as a 
scratching score of ≤1 or at least a one- point drop f rom baseline on the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument. At each assessment, the AM score will be compared to the AM 
baseline, and the PM score will be compared to the PM baseline. Both AM baseline 
and PM baseline pruritus assessments will be included in the analysis  of this endpoint. 
AM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose of study medications will be averaged as AM baseline. PM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose will be 
averaged as PM baseline.

9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids  
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during

 the treatment period and follow -up will be blin ded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching , Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients  and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session dur ing 
Visit 1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients < 8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 18 year s of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years  of age, the  caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case the 
patient is confused or requires clari fication about the meaning of a question.  The Albireo 
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratching and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code ( Appendix 2).  To meet eligibility criteria, a scratch score will be calculat ed from  daily 
diary entries (ObsRO items) the 14 consecutive days prior to randomization.  
A daily AM & PM score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be averaged  from the 2 
ratings for each day.  A daily score will be considered missing if both of the daily assessments are missing.  A weekly  score will be calculated by averaging the daily scratching 
scores.  A weekly  score will be considered missing if ≥4 out of 7 days a week of data are 
missing.  For AM & PM baseline, a 14- day daily score of AM & PM prior to the first dose of 
study medications will be averaged as the baseline score.  
For AM baseline, a 14-day AM score prior to the first dose of study medications  will be 
averaged as the AM baseline score.  The same approach will be used for PM baseline  and to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.   The handling of missing data is described in 
Section 11.2.2.2. 
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as height ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)
2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to a standard  growth curve  (Z-score, SD 
from P50).

 9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be asked to complete  a QoL questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4. 
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and PK Samples  
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  >10 kg.  Blood for A4250 PK assessment will only be drawn at Visits 4 
and 9 (only for children with body weight  >10 kg), and as close to the onset of an SAE as 
possible , should an SAE occur .  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory 
per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomiz ation and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years  of age .  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated. 
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin) + 4.36 ( if 
patient <1 year : scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the patient's first

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table 1  
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo.  
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations 
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
vitamins  A and E, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and INR ) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefore be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled 
(ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not 
related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exam ination findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not limited to, events causing withdrawal from the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant 
by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
 
 A4250 – IND 130591  
EudraCT 2017-002338- 21 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 48 
Final Amendment 0 6, 24 June  2019 
 is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, non-serious AE. 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE: • The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results  in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in 
Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet 
serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE. 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medical judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, 
temporal relationship to the study drug, and de-c hallenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows .

Final Amendment 0 6, 24 June  2019 
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused t he event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient  
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrel ated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug  
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whethe r each untoward event is a clinically 
significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10) or 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs o r SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information  for any 
patient with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on  
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as 
an AE and the ass ociated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if 
an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has 
signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit 10), and 28 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.    
Report of a SAE must include at least the following  information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date 
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset 
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious 
• The rel ationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality) 
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared  and the information collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain furth er 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any

timelines as for initial reports.  
The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE and follow-up to the Albireo medical monitor 
for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 28 days after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE form should be completed including the main and 
contributory causes of death. 
All SAE reports must be e-mailed to the following e-mail address within 24 hours : 
 
 
If email is unavailable,  SAEs may be transmitted via fax to the following number: 
 
In a study-r elated medical emergency situation, when the assigned medical monitors for the 
study cannot be reached by a caller, an on call physician can be reached 2 4 hours per day, 
7 days per week, via the  call center.  The following number is a chargeable telephone 
number allowing a global reach from both landlines and mobile phones and the internet page

as indicated o n the “24/7 Medical Help desk” index.  Countries without tol l-free numbers 
need to dial the chargeable number as indic ated below .  Furthermore, tol l-free numbers might 
not be available from mobile phones. 
 
 
10.1.4 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that occurs in a patient , 
the nature or severity of which is not expected per  the applicable product information (e.g., 
the IB for an unauthorized investigational product or summary of product characteristics for an authorized product).   
Reporting and tracking of SUSARs will be in accordance to all applicable competent 
authority regulations.  The Ethics Committee and all investigators involved in this study will 
be informed according to national and international requirements.

 10.2 Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Physical Examinations and Other Safety 
Assessments 
10.2.1 Laboratory Assessments 
Samples will be collected for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing at the 
time points specified in Table 1. The parameters assessed are presented in Table 3. 
Blood for AFP will be drawn at Visits  3 and 9.  F at-soluble vitamin  level s including vitamins 
A and E, and 25- hydroxy vitamin D will be drawn at Visit 2  (vitamins A & E  only) , 
Visit 3 (25- hydroxy vitamin D  only), Visit 6, and Visit 9.  Blood for INR (surrogate for 
vitamin K) will be draw n at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  Patients will fast (water intake only is 
permissible) for at least 4  hours prior to the collection of samples for vitamin A.  Exceptions 
can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 4 hours.  If a patient 
has any vitamin level(s) that are outside of the reference range, vitamin supplementation adjustments may be required.  Target ranges and supplementation strategy guidelines can be found in Appendix 5. 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit  1 and Visit 9 if the patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study. A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the 
confi rmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see 
Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be p rocessed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the 
laboratory manual. 
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples  may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

10.2.2.1 Liver Monitoring  
Strategies to monitor markers of liver dis ease throughout the study are outlined below where 
the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and gender.  
If isolated transaminase elevations are observed, defined as: 1. Normal bilirubin AND absence of clinical hepatitis symptoms AN D 
• ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 
800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR) within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met: 
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations

 2. Transaminase elevations alone (ALT or AST >10  × ULN or 5  × baseline or absolute 
threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first) in presence of normal LDH and CPK 
3. Total bilirubin increased, unrelated to hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count) or 
established genetic diseases, such as Gilbert’s syndrome 
a. Doubling if total bilirubin was <3 mg/dL (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >3 mg/d L (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) if total bilirubin was ≥3 mg/d L 
(equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline  
4. INR increase refractory to vitamin K administration  
a. INR >1.5 if INR was normal at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >0.4 if INR was abnormal at baseline 
5. Any increase in total bilirubin and transaminases if accompanied by EITHER a symptom 
of clinical hepatitis (e.g., vomiting, nausea, right upper quadrant pain) OR immunological 
reaction (rash or >5% eosinophilia) 
Then: 
a) Interrupt study medication 
b) Initiate drug-induced liver injury work -up for alte rnative etiologies  
c) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin) and PT  or INR within 
48 to 72 hours 
d) Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
e) If a patient lives in a remote area, they may be tested locally and the results 
communicated to the investigator site promptly  
10.2.2.2 Close Observation 
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  Frequency of re -testing can decrease to once a week or l ess if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases 
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medicat ions and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets   
• Consider ruling out  alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, 
and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non-alcoholic s teatohepatitis ; 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease 
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.

 • Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin) 
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re -challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, etc.). 
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration 
requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances, fever (≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days. 
If there
 is gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved .  If the 
diarrh ea re -occurs within 1 week after the re- challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5. 
10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug, the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical parameters have norm alized/stabilize d. 
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF

performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
For previous confirmatory clinical genetic testing  results  for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 performed 
prior to Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be 
verified  to determine eligibility.  
If the historical clinical genetic result is equiv ocal, unavailabl e, or unobtainable, clinical 
genetic analysis to confirm pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes 
will be performed and verified to determine eligibility.   No other diagnostic genetic testing 
will be offered.  
10.2.5 Physical Examination 
A physician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography of skin lesions due to scratching, at  Visits  1, 3, 
6, and 9.  A skin exam ination  will be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table 1).  
A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for  study purposes any dose exceeding a total of > 3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 24 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-adverse-e ffect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 mo nth toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in

predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative st aff should immed iately and not later than within 2 4 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 
10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study  and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient .  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled  
in the study after the end of dosing, the patient will continue in the study per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE .  However , if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Safety Manager  (please refer to Section

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATION 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power 
For the EU and RoW, the primary analysis will relate to the serum bile acid responder 
endpoint .  For the US, the primary analysis will relate to the pruritus endpoint. For each 
primary endpoint, a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure will be applied to control 
the 1 -sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the p lacebo at the 0. 025 
level (Kane et al, 2015, Lehmacher et al, 1991, and Marcus et al, 1976). The study will enroll 
60 to 70 patients in order to obtain at least least 20 evaluable patients  in each arm. For each 
primary endpoint, simulations with 5000 iter ations using 20 patients per arm were conducted 
to estimate the power after multiplicity adjustment, resulting in a standard error of <0.7% for 
each estimated power.   
Based on the Phase 2 A4250- 003 study data both dose groups are predicted to have similar  
treatment effect s for both serum bile acid s and pruritus. For serum bile acids , simulated 
proportions were analyz ed using the CMH test to generate the following 1- sided p- values: 
both A4250 arms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. placebo. 
Assuming 60% responders in the A4250 arms and 10% responders in the placebo arm, the 
power to claim significance for a particular A4250 arm after multiplicity adjustment is 
approximately 94%. The power to claim significance for at least one arm or both arms are 
approximately 99% and 91%, respectively.  
For the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level in pruritus scores, simulated proportions were analy zed using AN COVA to generate the following 1- sided p-
values: both A4250 ar ms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. 
placebo. With an effect size of 1.0526, the simulated power to claim significance for a 
particular arm after multiplicity adjustment is approximately 89%. The probability to claim significance for at least one arm  or both arms are approximately 95% and 83%, respectively.   
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients wil l be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set

Final Amendment 0 6, 24 June  2019 
 The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received  at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set i s a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no major  protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patient s to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study. 
11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses 
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of  
40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with PFIC Types 1 and 2.  
In the EU and RoW, for the primary efficacy variable of fasting bile acid responder endpoint 
(at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration or reaching a level ≤70 µmol/L a t the 
end of tre atment), the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age 
class will be performed to compare the proportion in fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose groups to placebo group. To 
ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be pooled if all 
subjects in a stratum have the same response. Dropouts will be treated as non -responders. The 
proportion together with corresponding 95% C I, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented.   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments 
at subject level over the 24 -week treatment perio d, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will 
be used. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score, PM baseli ne 
pruritus score, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS 
mean(SE) by treatment arm and LS m ean difference (S E), 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) 
vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. normality and 
homogeneity of var iances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores will be used 
as a sensitivity analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean 
difference/SE between active dose and placebo will be provided.  
The procedure for multiplicity adjustment is specified as follows:    
In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with 
the placebo group first. If the 1- sided p -value is ≤0.025, the 1- sided p- values for low dose vs.

Final Amendment 0 6, 24 June  2019 
 placebo and high dose vs. placebo  will be calculated , respectively. If both individual p- values 
are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effe ct will be declared on both dose groups. If only one of 
them is ≤0.025, a significa nt treatment effect will be declared on the corresponding dose 
group.  
Other secondary an d exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and 
safety informat ion regarding the differences between the treatment groups. No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy 
variables.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter prior to the first intake of study treatment.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data 
In the primary analysis of the pruritus endpoint, all intermi ttently missing a ssessments will be 
classified as negative pruritus assessments. Similarly, all plann ed assessments after the 
intercurrent events (premature treatment discontinuation, death or initiation of rescue 
treatments such as biliary diversion surge ry or liver transplantation) will be counted as 
negative pruritus assessments. However, as described above, all 336 assessments planned 
over the 24- week  treatment period will be included in the denominator of the endpoint 
definition.  
In the primary analys is of fasting bile acid responder endpoint, dropouts and patients with a 
missing average at the end o f the treatment will be treated as non -responders. Patients in need 
of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant will be cla ssified as 
non-responders. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatme nt 
will be made as far as possible.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (incl uding medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior and concomitant medication  use during the study will be summarized by treatment 
group and overall using the safety analysis set. 11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable): • Patients enrolled  (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study  
• Patients withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)

 Additionally, patients enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region. 
 
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables 
For EU and RoW, t he primary responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids  will 
be analy zed in terms of the proportion of patients achieving the event of interest. Patients in  
need of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant , will be classified 
as non-responders. Dropouts will be treated as non- responders.  
CMH st ratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are use d in the CMH anal ysis, 
neighboring strata will be pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same r esponse. The 
proportion together with corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented  
Logisti c regression wi ll be performed as a supportive  analysis to compare the proportion in  
fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose groups to the placebo group. The model will include treatment arm, baseline val ue, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. Baseline value will be 
calculated as the average of serum  bile acid values at randomization and the previous visit 
(Clinic Visit 2).   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments 
at the subject level over the 24 -week treatment period, ANCOVA will be used to analyz e the 
pruritus endpoint. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score, PM 
baseli ne pruritus score, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. 
LS mean(SE)  by treatment arm and LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and 
p-values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day , 
respectively) v s. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. 
normal ity and homogeneity of variances, a non -parametric ANCOVA based on the rank 
scores can be used. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean 
diffe rence/SE between  active dose and placebo will be provided.  
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted t o assess the impact of intermittently missing data as 
well as intercurrent events and will be specified in the SAP. Subgroup analyses will also be 
performe d for each of the  3 age groups (6 months to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 
years) and for pati ents who were not included in the previous Study A4250-003. 
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
The change in the secondary endpoint s such as serum b ile acids, total bilirubin, ALT, growth, 
Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters, and patient -reported itch severity will be

 summariz ed by visit using descriptive statistics. Change in growth (weight for age and BMI 
for age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations.  
Proportion of responders at Weeks 12 and 24 based on the PRO/ObsRO instruments 
estimated from both distribution and anchor -based approaches will be analy zed using the 
same model as specified for the primary analysis for EU and RoW. 
Proportion of individual assessments meeting the definition of a positive pruritus assessment 
at the subject level from Weeks 0 -4, Weeks 0 -8, Weeks 0- 12, Weeks 0- 18, Weeks 0-24, 
respectively, or the proportion of positive pruritus assessment s at each 4 -week  interval over 
the 24- week treatment period for AM or PM, respectively will be analyz ed using the same 
model as specified for the primary analysis for US.   
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or liver transplant, all -cause mortality,  and liver 
decomp ensation events will mainly be analy zed by using descriptive statistics. Kaplan- Meier 
curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data.  Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week 24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups w ill be conducted using ANCOVA. The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC 
class, age class, and treatment.  
Other exploratory variables (Global Symptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of bile acid synthesis, additional Albireo PRO and ObsRO sl eep parameters, P ELD/MELD 
score, APRI score, and Fib -4 score) will be analy zed descriptively for categorical and 
continuous data, as applicable. For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analy zed in addition to the actual visit values. For cate gorical data, shift tables or frequency 
and percentages of patients will be presented as appropriate. Additional details on secondary 
and exploratory efficacy variables and subgroup analyses by age class (6 months to 5 years, 6 
to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years)  will be specified in the SAP.  
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical c hemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class  [SOC] and MedDRA preferred t erm) will include  the 
following:  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs) 
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term

Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC ) class and World Health Organization ( WHO) preferred name.  
Summaries of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.   For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS 
values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analy zed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatment group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.  
11.2.3 Blinded A nalyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this analysis; data will be collapsed  across treatment groups. 
The analyses will include distribution - and ancho r-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distribution-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of m easurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will involve examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and s ymptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will be included in a stan d-alone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items .

 11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically  (approximately on a quarterly basis)  meet for the 
review of accumulating study data, including safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver 
values .  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping the study early for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo Medical/  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and 
taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical/  
if the study requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own writte n standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the t rial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate 
unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the 
study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB statistician w ill have access to these data.

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance procedures 
with writte n standard operating procedures to ensure that the study is conducted and data are 
generated,  documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki ( October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accor dance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations , Sections  312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IEC/IRB, 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient  or when the change(s) 
involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in the patient  having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient  non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative or designee will review the  protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative s taff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) 
will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements, and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study- related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of 
primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study- specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the fre quency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine 
the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding 
documentation.

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or  administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient  recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers , IB, available safety information, information about  payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consent s and Assents 
The investigator (physician) or investigative s taff, in accordance with local regulation s, will 
explain to each patient  (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected dur ation, alternative treatment, the potential 
risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur .  Each caregiver /patient will 
be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she or their child may 
withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her 
subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. 
Caregivers /patients will be informed that they/their children may experience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  Caregivers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular  blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that 
some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with  ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory 
authorities .  The caregiver (s)/patient should read and consider the statements before signing 
and dating them and should be given a copy of each signed document.  If written consent is 
not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement 
from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to 
sign the form.  No patient can enter the study before his/her or care giver (s) informed consent 
has been obtained, as required by country regulations. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/investigative s taff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed eCRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient  visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start.  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory. 
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the 
eCRF will be the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as defined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact discs of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approva ls and all related correspondence including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.

Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following: 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA) 
concentration from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• The proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over the 24 -week Treatment Period 
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine amin otransferase (ALT) concentration  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the sa fety and tolerability of repeated da ily doses of A4250 for 2 4 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a double-b lind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µ g/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in  children with PFIC  (deficiencies of familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 2 4-week Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screenin g Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit  3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 4 0 µg/kg/day or 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit  9 (Day 168)  in thi s study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72- week open -label extension  study (A425 0-008) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

Safety:    
Safety criteria are as follows:  
• Occurrence of treatment- emergent adverse events including severity and relatedness to study drug at all 
visits  
• The incidence of treatmen t-emergent serious adverse events ( SAEs ), based upon information from 
patient reports, including the description, incidence, and severity of an SAE  
• Trends evaluated for the following assessments: physical examinations, concomitant medications, vital 
signs, laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hemato logy, urinalysis, alfa -fetoprotein, 
vitamins A and E, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D and INR), and abdominal ultrasound 
Statistical Methods:  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 40  µg/kg/day and 
120 µg/kg/day  A4250 in children with PFIC Types 1 and 2. 
  
The Cochran Mantel Haenzel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare 
the proportion in fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment  (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be 
pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same response. The proportion together with the corresponding 95% 
CI, odds ratio and corresp onding 95% Clopper -Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented.   
 For the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at subject level over the 24 -
week treatment period, an ANCOVA model will be used to a nalys e the comparisons between the treatment 
groups. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score,  PM baseli ne pruritus score, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS mean  (SE) by treatment arm and LS  mean 
difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and p- values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day 
and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. 
normality and homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used as a 
sensitivity analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean difference/SE between active 
dose and placebo will be provided.   
 
For each primary endpoint  by region (EU & RoW and US),  a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure 
will be applied to control the 1 -sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the placebo at 
the 0.025 level, as specified below:  
 In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with the placebo group 
first. If the 1 -sided p -value is  ≤0.025, the 1 -sided p -values for low dose vs. placebo and high dose vs. placebo  
will be calculated  respectively. If both individual p -values are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be 
declared on both dose groups. If only one of them is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on 
the corresponding dose group.  
 
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups. No adjustment s will be performed for multiple 
comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane  glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic circulati on of bile acids since  it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.   In the 
first clinical study  of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg/day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gastrointestinal (GI)  related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral 
doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks.  A4250 reduced mean levels of serum bile acids 
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic c holestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug, and most  adverse events ( AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholesta tic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10 % to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].  The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commo nly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also refe rred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis-1 ( FIC1) protein deficienc y.” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular

 membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer 
to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also refer red to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency. ”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is express ed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by a deficiency of the multidrug- resistance protein  3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosis.  Serum biochemistry indicate s cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile 
acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) activity 
(exception being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of 
portal hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -
Spraul 2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 
2 months, and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The  
life-threatening and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those 
not resorting  to surgery is 50% at 1 0 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age .  
Approximately half of PFIC patients undergo l iver transplantation [ Davit-Spraul 2009] and 
treatment- resistant pruritus is the leading indicat ion for the surgical procedure partial externa l 
biliary diversion, mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 p atients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.  Curre ntly, the treatment for PFIC is  palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are  
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the sympto ms and signs of the disease such as nutritiona l 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatm ent of extrahepatic features.  Medical 
treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.  A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have li ver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Clinical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ([ IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective I BAT inhibitor with no safety signals seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition , no safety signals were seen in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 2 6 weeks of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure in both humans and other 
species.  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µ mol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a single-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 1 0 mg or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg, the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 19 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo. A4250 was generally well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity  in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not related to A4250. T he 3 AEs  experienced by 2 subjects reported a s related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg/day for 4 weeks.  Twenty 
patients  (8 females and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 17 years were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a second dose level.  No

 treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs, including some increased 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment wi th A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s- BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients ( ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11  non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patien t-reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during treatment.  
The dose with the greatest improvement showed a mean decrease (± standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results f rom this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no  medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988]. A portion  
of patients who have biliary diversion surgery continue to have elevated serum bile acids and 
pruritus. Liver transplantation is typically used  as an option when patients have failed 
medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus. 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achie ves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transplan tation .  For those patients who have undergone biliary diversion surgery and 
continue to have elevated serum bile acids and symptomatic pruritus, IBAT inhibition has the 
potential to reduce both the serum bile acid levels and the pruritus. 
The doses select ed, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re -entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for

 established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3 study.  As efficacy was observed 
at both low and high doses, 40 µg/kg  and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
Patients completing 2 4 weeks of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-label treatment with A4250. 
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit 
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo -sponsored clinical studies: a double- blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. Healthy subjects have been exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as 
part of a multiple -dose evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated 
with up to 0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; 
both were judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acids in the liver resulting in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be 
of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study 
showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing.

 6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
6.1 Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate th e efficacy of repeated daily doses of 40 µ g/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day 
A4250 in children with PFIC  Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following: 
• The p roportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
concentration from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 µ mol/L 
compared to placebo after 2 4 weeks of treatment  
• The proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over the 24- week 
treatment period.   
6.2   Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum ALT  concentration  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomi zed, placebo-c ontrolled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically (approximately on a quarterly basis) reviewed by an 
unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). 
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow-Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited to participate in a 72-week open -label extension  study (A4250-008 ; EudraCT Number 
2017-002325- 38, subject to a separate study approval ) in which all patients will receive  
active treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to intolerable symptoms  and has 
completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment Period and End of Treatment (EOT) Visit, will 
also be offered the opportunity to enter Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments (Table  1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study (Figure 1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact, as follows: • Visit 1: Screening Period start. Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -35) 
• Visit 2: second Screening Visit ( Days -28 to - 7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone C ontact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit (Day  28) 
• Visit 5: Clinic Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit 6: Clinic  Visit  (Day 84) 
• Visit 7: Clinic Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit 8: Clinic Visit (Day 154) 
• Visit 9: Clinic  Visit, EOT  (Day 168)

Final Amendment 0 5, 29 April 2019 
 • Visit 10: Follow -Up V isit, 28 days after last dose of study drug ( Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow-up Visit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance,  e.g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil screening requirements, and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After 
signing the ICF , patients will be considered enroll ed and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily recording of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study.  After 
consultation with the Medical Moni tor, patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re -screened .  
Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not allowed to 
re-screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observer-r eported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period (study Days  -56 to 0) , throughout the 24-w eek Treatment Period 
(study Days  0 to 168), and Follow-up (Day 196). 
The 14 consecutive days prior to randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of the 
diary entrie s.  If a patient does not meet the minimum number of observations (see 
Section  9.2.2 for scoring and missing data definitions) to determine eligibility, the patient 
may be re -screened.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients of all ages will be recorded by a 
caregiver .  If possible, the same caregiver  will complete the Albireo ObsRO items throughout 
the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit  2) additional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit  3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports f rom the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, clinical genetic 
confirmation of diagnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  
visits.  Two weeks after Visit 3, there will be a telepho ne contact with the caregiver/patient  to 
evaluate any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit  4, Visit 5, Visit  6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers will be requested to use the diary to report the time each 
dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period.

 The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A4250-008) should they 
meet the required entry criteria.  If the patient is continuing into Study A4250-008 this will be 
the last visit in this study and the first visit in Study A4250-008.  Visit 9/EOT  should also be 
performed at the time  patients are prematurely withdrawn from the study. 
Clinic Visit  10 will take place 2 8 days after Visit  9 for all patients not continuing into S tudy 
A4250-008.

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that should be swallowed intact .  These size 3 capsules may be open ed 
only under exceptional circumstances, e.g., patient cannot swallow capsule intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.  Bottle s with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.  Refer to the investigational product manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 a t a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks.  Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses,  and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed whole 
will be documented through the eDiary and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after  
laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowin g the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water.  
For a patient unable to swallow capsule intact, the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauc e, or fruit 
purée.  A list of food options can be found in the Pharmacy manual . The amount of food 
should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and should be followed by water.  1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée , or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to the patient w ill be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category  (identified in  Table  2), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Label ing 
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in hig h-density polyethylene containers, with child- proof 
polypropylene caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength specified in 
Table  2 above will be manufactured. 
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers .  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C and 25°C. 
Patients/caregivers  should be informed of ap propriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature , between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo.  
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by 
a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and

Final Amendment 0 5, 29 April  2019 
 allocated by the  Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at Screening .  The randomization codes will be compute r-generated by  
Biostatistics and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The randomization 
will be done in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) and age class 
(6 months to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years ) to ensure approximate balance 
between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prepared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization.  
Patients who are eligible for randomiz ation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization 
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who wi thdra w from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  
Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 acco rding to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once  a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the study 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized to.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured  by the study drug number. 
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study drug number corresponding to the randomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will 
not be displayed to end-u sers in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently r equired , i.e., only where knowledge of 
the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situation, the investigator 
at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS .  The responsibility to 
break the treatment code in emerg ency situations resides solely with the investigator.   The 
investigator should make every effort to discuss the rationale (status and outcome) for 
emergency unblinding with the sponsor Medical Monitor or the Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible to revi ew the individual patient details. 
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be authorized to access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS.  Emergency unblinding 
takes place in the IWRS via a dedicated emer gency unblinding module.  The system will 
require the user to enter their emergency unblinding, which is typically provided at the same time login credentials are distributed.   The exact description of the treatment assigned to the 
individual patient then will be accessible to the user.  Once the randomization code is broken 
for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures at EOT  should be performed.  As a follow -up, Visit  10, will be performed according to the time

 schedule.  Once a randomization code has been broken, the investigator must inform the 
 and sponsor Medical Monitor in writing within 24 hours.  In case of technical issues 
accessing the system online, please see the IWRS site user manual for country -specific 
contact telephone numbers for the  HelpDesk 24/7 system support. 
8.5 Patient  Compliance  
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance by routine review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both diary entr ies on a day  are missing , the study nurse will call the 
patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entries.  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents. Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, patients 
will return all unused study drug at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug, assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/numb er of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient, and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients. 
The investigator  will be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were provided the quantities specified in the protocol and that all study drug 
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therap y and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator will note a ll ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or cha nges in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medications (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sleep will be 
recorded.  
All medications taken by a patient within 3 month s prior to the first intake of study drug are 
regarded as prior medicati on. 
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the study , are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1.

 9 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
9.1 Efficacy Endpoint s 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint s are  as follows: 
• Europe an Union ( EU) and rest of the world  (RoW ): Proportion of patients 
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration from baseline to 
the end of treatment or reaching  a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to pla cebo  after 24 
weeks of treatment.  
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization 
and the previous visit (Clinic Visit 2).  The end value is the average of the values at 
Weeks 22 and 24 after the start of double-b lind treatment.  
• United States ( US): Proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level 
over the 24 -week Treatment Period. A positive pruritus assessment is defined as a 
scratching score of ≤1 or at least a one-point drop from baseline on the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument . At each assessment, the AM score will be compared to the AM 
baseline, and the PM score will be compared to the PM  baseline . Both AM baseline 
and PM baseline pruritus assessments will be included in th e analysis of this endpoint. 
AM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose of study medications will be 
averaged as AM baseline. PM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose will be averaged as PM baseline.   
9.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over 
the 24- week Treatment Period. A positive pruritus assessment is defined as a 
scratching score of ≤1 or at least a one- point drop f rom baseline on the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument. At each assessment, the AM score will be compared to the AM 
baseline, and the PM score will be compared to the PM baseline . Both AM baseline 
and PM baseline pruritus assessments will be included in the analysis of this endpoint.  
AM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose of study medications will be averaged as AM baseline. PM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose will be 
averaged as PM baseline.    
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at lea st a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA 
concentration  from baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 µ mol/L 
compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment.

9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids 
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during

 the treatment period and follow -up will be blin ded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching, Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients  and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session dur ing 
Visit 1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients <8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 18 year s of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years of age, the  caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case the 
patient is confused or requires clarification a bout the meaning of a question.  The Albireo 
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratchi ng and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code (Appendix 2).  To meet eligibility criteria, a  scratch score will be calculat ed from  daily 
diary entries (ObsRO items) the 14 consecutive days prior to randomization.  
A daily AM & PM score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be averaged  from the 2 
ratings for each day.  A daily score will be consider ed missing if both of the daily 
assessments are missing.  A weekly  score will be calculated by averaging the daily scratching 
scores.  A weekly  score will be considered missing if ≥4 out of 7 days a week of data are 
missing.  For AM & PM baseline, a 14-day daily score of AM & PM prior to the first dose of 
study medications will be averaged as the baseline score.  
For AM baseline, a 14-day AM score prior to the first dose of study medications  will be 
averaged as the AM baseline score.  The same approach will be used for PM baseline  and to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.   The handling of missing data is described in 
Section 11.2.2.2. 
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)
2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to a standard growth curve  (Z-score, SD 
from P50).

 9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be asked to complete a QoL  questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4. 
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and PK Samples  
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  >10 kg.  Blood for A4250 PK assessment will only be drawn at Visits 4 
and 9 (only for children with body weight  >10 kg), and as close to the onset of an SAE as 
possible , should  an SAE occur .  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory 
per instructions in the laboratory manual. 9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomiz ation and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years of age.  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin) + 4.36 ( if 
patient < 1 year : scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the patient's first 
birthday continue to include the value assigned for age (< 1 year ) until the patient reaches the 
age of 24 months) + 6.67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 SD ]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin) + 11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine valu es greater than 
4.0 mg/dL (equivalent to  353.6 µmol/L) will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score.  
9.2.7 Fibroscan
® 
Where available, Fibroscan® will be performed as per institution standard practice at Visits 3 
and 9. 
9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and  Fib-4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST in U/L) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Imp ression of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age), caregivers, and clinicians will complete the P GIC and the PGIS 
measures (Appendix 3) at randomization (Visit 3; PGIS only ), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9 ). 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug .  The PGIS items assess itch

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table  1 
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo. 
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
vitamins  A and E, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and INR) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefore be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled 
(ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not 
related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exam ination findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not limited to, events causi ng withdrawal from the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
 
 A4250 – IND 130591  
EudraCT 2017-002338-21 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 49 
Final Amendment 0 5, 29 April  2019 
 is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, no n-serious AE . 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE: 
• The outcome of the AE is death 
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires m edical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in 
Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example , nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet 
serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE . 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study d rug using medical judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, 
temporal relationship to the study drug, and d e-challenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows.

Final Amendment 0 5, 29 April  2019 
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused t he event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environment al or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient 
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It 
should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrel ated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in  Section 10.1.1  will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10)  or 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs o r SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information  for any 
patient with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

Final Amendment 0 5, 29 April  2019 
 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on  
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as 
an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has 
signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit  10), and 2 8 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.     
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date 
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious  
• The rel ationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared  and the information collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain furth er 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any

 request for follo w-up information or answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same 
timelines as for initial reports.  
The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE and follo w-up to the Albireo medical monitor 
for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 28 days after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE form should be completed including the main and 
contributory causes of death. 
All SAE reports must be e-mailed to the following e-mail address within 24 hours : 
 
 
If email is unavailable,  SAEs may be transmitted via fax to the following number: 
 
In a study-r elated medical emergency situation, when the assigned medical monitors for the 
study cannot be reached by a caller, an on call physician can be reached 2 4 hours per day, 
7 days per week, via the  call center.  The following number is a chargeable telephone 
number allowing a global reach from both landlines and mobile phones and the internet page 
indicated below contains  a list of country-s pecific tol l-free telephone numbers that is 
provided.  It should be noted that not all countries globally have access to tol l-free numbers 
as indicated o n the “24/7 Medical Help desk” index.  Countries without tol l-free numbers 
need to dial the chargeable number as indic ated below .  Furthermore, tol l-free numbers might 
not be available from mobile phones. 
 
 
10.1.4 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that occurs in a patient , 
the nature or severity of which is not expected per  the applicable product information (e.g., 
the IB for an unauthorized investigational product or summary of product characteristics for an authorized product).   
Reporting and tracking  of SUSARs will be in accordance to all applicable competent 
authority regulations.  The Ethics Committee and all investigators involved in this study will be informed according to national and international requirements.

 10.2 Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Physical Examinations and Other Safety 
Assessments 
10.2.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Samples will be collected for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing at the 
time points specified in  Table  1. The parameters assessed are presented in Table 3. 
Blood for AFP will be drawn at Visits  3 and 9.  F at-soluble vitamin  level s including vitamins 
A and E, and 25- hydroxy vitamin D will be drawn at Visit 2  (vitamins A & E  only) , 
Visit 3 (25- hydroxy vitamin D  only), Visit 6, and Visit 9.  Blood for INR (surrogate for 
vitamin K) will be draw n at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  Patients will fast (water intake only is 
permissible) for at least 4  hours prior to the collection of samples for vitamin A.  Exceptions 
can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 4 hours.  If a patient 
has any vitamin level(s) that are outside of the reference range, vitamin supplementation adjustments may be required.  Target ranges and supplementation strategy guidelines can be 
found in Appendix 5.  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit  1 and Visit 9 if the patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study. A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the confi rmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see 
Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be p rocessed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the 
laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples  may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

10.2.2.1 Liver Monitoring  
Strategies to monitor markers of liver dise ase throughout the study are outlined below where 
the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and gender.  
If isolated transaminase elevations are observed, defined as:  
1. Normal bilirubin AND absence of clinical hepatitis symptoms AND • ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 
800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR) within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met:  
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations

 • Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin)  
• Consider gastroenterolog y or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re- challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal he morrhage, ascites, hepatic 
encephalopathy, etc.). 
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration 
requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances, fever (≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days. 
If there
 is gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrh ea re- occurs within 1 week after the re- challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5. 
10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug, the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized. 
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF

 Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
For previous confirmatory clinical genetic testing  results for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 performed 
prior to Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be 
verified  to determine eligibility.  
If the historical clinical genetic result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable, clinical 
genetic analysis to confirm pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes 
will be performed and verified to determine eligibility.   No other diagnostic genetic testing 
will be offered.  
10.2.5 Physical Examination  
A physician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography  of skin lesions due to scratching, at  Visits  1, 3, 
6, and 9.  A skin exam ination  will be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table  1).  
A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of >3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 2 4 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-advers e-effect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 mo nth toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in

 a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immediately and not later than within 2 4 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 
10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient.  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled  
in the study after the end of dosing, the patient will continue in the study per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE .  However, if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Safety Manager  (please refer to Section 
10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as possible, details of the period of gestation at the time 
of exposure must be given. 
The pregnancy should be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous termination, 
details of birth, and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or newborn or 
maternal complication.  The infant who was exposed in- utero will be followed for up to 
2 years after delivery.   Individual cases with an abnormal outcome in association with the 
study drug should be reported on an expedited basis, i.e., reported rapidly to a competent authority.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified. 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW, the primary analysis will relate to the serum bile acid responder 
endpoint.  For the US, t he primary analysis will relate to the pruritus endpoint. For each 
primary endpoint, a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure will be applied to control 
the 1- sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the placebo at the 0. 025 
level (Kane et al, 2015, Lehmacher et al, 1991, and Marcus et al, 1976). The study will enroll 
60 to 70 patients in order to obtain at least  least 20 evaluable patients in each arm. For each 
primary endpoint, simulations with 5000 iterations using 20 patients per arm were conducted to estimate the power after multiplicity adjustment, resulting in a standard error of <0.7% for 
each estimated power.   
Based on the Phase 2 A4250- 003 study data both dose groups are predicted to have similar 
treatment effect s for both serum bile acids and pruritus. For serum bile acids , simulated 
proportions were analyz ed using the CMH test to generate the following 1- sided p-values: 
both A4250 arms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. placebo. 
Assuming  60% responders in the A4250 arms and 10% responders in the placebo arm, the 
power to claim significance for a particular A4250 arm after multiplicity adjustment is approximately 94%. The power to claim significance for at least one arm or both arms are 
approximately 99% and 91%, respectively.  
For the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level in pruritus scores, 
simulated proportions were analyz ed using AN COVA to generate the following 1- sided p-
values: both A4250 arms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. placebo. With an effect size of 1.0526, the simulated power to claim significance for a 
particular arm after multiplicity adjustment is approximately 89%. The probability to claim significance for at least one arm  or both arms are approximately 95% and 83%, respectively.   
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set

Final Amendment 0 5, 29 April  2019 
 The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set i s a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no major  protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study. 
11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses  
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 
40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with PFIC Types 1 and 2.  
In the EU and RoW, for the primary efficacy variable of fasting bile acid responder endpoint 
(at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration or reaching a level ≤70 µmol/L at the 
end of tre atment), the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age 
class will be performed to compare the proportion in fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose groups to placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be pooled if all 
subjects in a stratum have the same response. Dropouts will be treated as non -responders. The 
proportion together with corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented.   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments 
at subject level over the 24 -week treatment period, an analysis of  covariance (ANCOVA) will 
be used. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score, PM baseli ne 
pruritus score, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS 
mean(SE) by treatment arm and LS mean difference (S E), 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) 
vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. normality and 
homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores will be used 
as a sensitivity analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean 
difference/SE between active dose and placebo will be provided.  
The procedure for multiplicity adjustment is specified as follows:    
In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with 
the placebo group first. If the 1- sided p -value is ≤0.025, the 1- sided p- values for low dose vs.

Final Amendment 0 5, 29 April  2019 
 placebo and high dose vs. placebo  will be calculated , respectively. If both individual p -values 
are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on both dose groups. If only one of 
them is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on the corresponding dose 
group.  
Other secondary an d exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups. No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy 
variables.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment of that parameter prior to the first intake of study treatment.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data  
In the primary analysis of the pruritus endpoint, all intermittently missing a ssessments will be 
classified as negative pruritus assessments. Similarly, all planned assessments after the intercurrent events (premature treatment discontinuation, death or initiation of rescue 
treatments such as biliary diversion surgery or liver transplantation) will be counted as 
negative pruritus assessments. However, as described above, all 336 assessments planned over the 24 -week  treatment period will be included in the denominator of the endpoint 
definition.  
In the primary analysis of fasting bile acid responder endpoint, dropouts and patients with a 
missing average at the end of the treatment will be treated as non -responders. Patients in need 
of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant will be classified as non- responders. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made as far as possible.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including medical and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior and concomitant medication  use during the study will be summarized by treatment 
group and overall using the safety analysis set.  
11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable): 
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study  
• Patients withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)

 Additionally,  patients enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region. 
 
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables  
For EU and RoW, t he primary responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will 
be analy zed in terms of the proportion of patients achieving the event of interest. Patients in 
need of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant , will be classified 
as non-responders. Dropouts will be treated as non-responders.  
CMH st ratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH anal ysis, 
neighboring strata will be pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same response. The proportion together with corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented  
Logisti c regression wi ll be performed as a supportive  analysis to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose groups to the placebo group. The model will include treatment a rm, baseline val ue, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. Baseline value will be 
calculated as the average of serum  bile acid values at randomization and the previous visit 
(Clinic Visit 2).   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable  of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments 
at the subject level over the 24- week treatment period, ANCOVA will be used to analyz e the 
pruritus endpoint. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score, PM 
baseli ne pruritus score, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. 
LS mean(SE) by treatment arm and LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and p-values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day, 
respectively) v s. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. 
normality and homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank 
scores can be used. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean 
difference/SE between  active dose and placebo will be provided.  
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of intermittently missing data as 
well as intercurrent events and will be specified in the SAP. Subgroup analyses will also be 
performed for each of the  3 age groups (6 months to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 
years) and for patients who were not included in the previous Study A4250-003. 
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables

 summariz ed by visit using descriptive statistics. Change in growth (weight for age and BMI 
for age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations.  
Proportion of responders at Weeks 12 and 24 based on the PRO/ObsRO instruments 
estimated from both distribution and anchor -based approaches will be analyz ed using the 
same model as specified for the primary analysis for EU and RoW.  
Proportion of individual assessments meeting the definition of a positive pruritus assessment 
at the subject level from Weeks 0 -4, Weeks 0- 8, Weeks 0- 12, Weeks 0- 18, Weeks 0-24, 
respectively, or the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at each 4- week  interval over 
the 24- week treatment period for AM or PM, respectively will be analy zed using the same 
model as specified for the primary analysis for US.   
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or liver transplant, all- cause mortality, and liver 
decompensation events will mainly be analy zed by using descriptive statistics. Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data.  
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week 24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using ANCOVA. The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC 
class, age class, and treatment.  
Other exploratory variables (Global Symptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, additional Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters, P ELD/MELD 
score, APRI score, and Fib -4 score) will be analy zed descriptively for categorical and 
continuous data, as applicable. For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analy zed in addition to the actual visit values. For categorical data, shift tables or frequency 
and percentages of patients will be presented as appropriate. Additional details on secondary 
and exploratory efficacy variables and subgroup analyses by age class (6 months to 5 years, 6 
to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years)  will be specified in the SAP.  
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests (h ematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class [SOC] and MedDRA preferred t erm) will include  the 
following:  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs)  
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term

Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) class and World Health Organization ( WHO ) preferred name.  
Summaries of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant  (PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.   For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS 
values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analyz ed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment  group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatment group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.  
11.2.3 Blinded A nalyses to  Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clini cally meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this 
analysis; data will be collapsed  across treatment groups. 
The analyses will include distribution - and anchor-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distributio n-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of m easurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will involve examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and s ymptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will be included in a stan d-alone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items .

A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically  (approximately  on a quarterly basis)  meet for the 
review of accumulating study data, including safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver 
values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping  the study early for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo Medical/  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be infor med by Albireo Medical/  
if the study requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own writte n standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the trial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate 
unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the 
study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB statistician w ill have access to these data.

This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations , Sections 312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IEC/IRB, 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient or when the change(s) 
involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations ma y result in 
the patient having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative or designee will review the  protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative s taff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) 
will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements,  and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of 
primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study- specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the fre quency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine 
the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding 
documentation.

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or  administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers, IB, available safety information, information about  payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents and Assents  
The investigator (physician) or investigative s taff, in accordance with local regulation s, will 
explain to each patient ( or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur.  Each caregiver /patient will 
be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she or their child may 
withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her 
subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. 
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their children may experience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  Care givers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that 
some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with  ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory 
authorities .  The caregiver (s)/patient should read and consider the statements before signing 
and dating them and should be given a copy of each signed document.  If written consent is 
not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement 
from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to 
sign the form.  No patient can enter the study before his/her or care giver (s) informed consent 
has been obtained, as required by country regulations. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/i nvestigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with

 regulatory requir ements and country laws and is considered appropriate for the study.  Any 
changes to the ICF suggested by the investigator must be agreed to by Albireo before 
submission to the IEC and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the clinical  
monitor after IEC approval.

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed e CRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance wit h the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start .  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medica l history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the eCRF will be the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as def ined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact discs of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approva ls and all related corresponden ce including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/i nvestigative staff must retain copies of these essential documents for the 
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essential 
documents .  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

Principal  Investigator:  
 
Study Centers:  
Up to 50 sites will be initiated for this study in the United States (US), Ca nada , Europe an Union  (EU) , Middle 
East, and Australia.  
Publication(s):  
None.  
Planned Study Period:  
Q2 2018 to Q4 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following: 
•Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA)
concentration from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
•The proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over the 24 -week Treatment Period
Secondary Objectives  
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine amin otransferase (ALT) concentration
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver
transplantation)
•To assess the sa fety and tolerability of repeated da ily doses of A4250 for 2 4 weeks
Methodology:  
This is a double-b lind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µ g/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in  children with PFIC  (deficiencies of familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 2 4-week Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screenin g Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit  3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 4 0 µg/kg/day or 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit  9 (Day 168)  in thi s study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72- week open -label extension  study (A425 0-008) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

Safety:    
Safety criteria are as follows:  
• Occurrence of treatment- emergent adverse events including severity and relatedness to study drug at all 
visits  
• The incidence of treatmen t-emergent serious adverse events ( SAEs ), based upon information from 
patient reports, including the description, incidence, and severity of an SAE  
• Trends evaluated for the following assessments: physical examinations, concomitant medications, vital 
signs, laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hemato logy, urinalysis, alfa -fetoprotein, 
vitamins A and E, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D and INR), and abdominal ultrasound 
Statistical Methods:  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 40  µg/kg/day and 
120 µg/kg/day  A4250 in children with PFIC Types 1 and 2. 
  
The Cochran Mantel Haenzel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare 
the proportion in fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment  (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be 
pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same response. The proportion together with the corresponding 95% 
CI, odds ratio and corresp onding 95% Clopper -Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented.   
 For the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at subject level over the 24 -
week treatment period, an ANCOVA model will be used to a nalys e the comparisons between the treatment 
groups. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score,  PM baseli ne pruritus score, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS mean  (SE) by treatment arm and LS  mean 
difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and p- values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day 
and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. 
normality and homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used as a 
sensitivity analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean difference/SE between active 
dose and placebo will be provided.   
 
For each primary endpoint  by region (EU & RoW and US),  a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure 
will be applied to control the 1 -sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the placebo at 
the 0.025 level, as specified below:  
 In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with the placebo group 
first. If the 1 -sided p -value is  ≤0.025, the 1 -sided p -values for low dose vs. placebo and high dose vs. placebo  
will be calculated  respectively. If both individual p -values are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be 
declared on both dose groups. If only one of them is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on 
the corresponding dose group.  
 
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups. No adjustment s will be performed for multiple 
comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane  glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic circulati on of bile acids since  it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.   In the 
first clinical study  of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg/day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gastrointestinal (GI)  related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral 
doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks.  A4250 reduced mean levels of serum bile acids 
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic c holestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug, and most  adverse events ( AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholesta tic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10 % to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].  The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commo nly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also refe rred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis-1 ( FIC1) protein deficienc y.” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular

 membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer 
to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also refer red to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency. ”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is express ed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by a deficiency of the multidrug- resistance protein  3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosis.  Serum biochemistry indicate s cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile 
acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) activity 
(exception being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of 
portal hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -
Spraul 2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 
2 months, and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The  
life-threatening and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those 
not resorting  to surgery is 50% at 1 0 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  
Approximately half of PFIC patients undergo liver tr ansplantation [ Davit-Spraul 2009] and 
treatment- resistant pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external 
biliary diversion, mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.  Currently, the treatment for PFIC is  palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatm ent of extrahepatic features.  Medical 
treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.  A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have li ver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Clinical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ([ IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective I BAT inhibitor with no safety signals seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition , no safety signals were seen in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 2 6 weeks of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure in both humans and other 
species.  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µ mol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a single-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 1 0 mg or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg, the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 19 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo. A4250 was generally well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity  in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not related to A4250. T he 3 AEs  experienced by 2 subjects reported a s related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg/day for 4 weeks.  Twenty 
patients  (8 females and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 17 years were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a second dose level.  No

 treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs, including some increased 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment wi th A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s- BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients ( ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11  non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patien t-reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during treatment.  
The dose with the greatest improvement showed a mean decrease (± standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results f rom this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no  medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988]. A portion  
of patients who have biliary diversion surgery continue to have elevated serum bile acids and 
pruritus. Liver transplantation is typically used  as an option when patients have failed 
medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus. 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achie ves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transplan tation .  For those patients who have undergone biliary diversion surgery and 
continue to have elevated serum bile acids and symptomatic pruritus, IBAT inhibition has the 
potential to reduce both the serum bile acid levels and the pruritus. 
The doses select ed, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re -entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in the PFIC subgroup was at 
30 µg/kg/day for both s-BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg/day; however, a clear dose relationship could not be

 established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3 study.  As efficacy was observed 
at both low and high doses, 40 µg/kg  and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
Patients completing 2 4 weeks of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-label treatment with A4250. 
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit 
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo -sponsored clinical studies: a double- blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. Healthy subjects have been exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as 
part of a multiple -dose evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated 
with up to 0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; 
both were judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acids in the liver resulting in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be 
of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study 
showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing.

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomi zed, placebo-c ontrolled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically (approximately on a quarterly basis) reviewed by an 
unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). 
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow-Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited to participate in a 72-week open -label extension  study (A4250-008 ; EudraCT Number 
2017-002325- 38, subject to a separate study approval ) in which all patients will receive  
active treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to intolerable symptoms  and has 
completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment Period and End of Treatment (EOT) Visit, will 
also be offered the opportunity to enter Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments (Table  1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study (Figure 1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact, as follows: • Visit 1: Screening Period start. Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -35) 
• Visit 2: second Screening Visit ( Days -28 to - 7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone C ontact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit (Day  28) 
• Visit 5: Clinic Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit 6: Clinic  Visit  (Day 84) 
• Visit 7: Clinic Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit 8: Clinic Visit (Day 154) 
• Visit 9: Clinic  Visit, EOT  (Day 168)

Final Amendment 0 4, 01 March 2019 
 • Visit 10: Follow -Up V isit, 28 days after last dose of study drug ( Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow-up Visit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance,  e.g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil screening requirements, and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After 
signing the ICF , patients will be considered enroll ed and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily recording of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study.  After 
consultation with the Medical Moni tor, patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re -screened 
after 2 months.  Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not 
allowed to re -screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observer-r eported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period (study Days  -56 to 0) , throughout the 24-we ek Treatment Period 
(study Days  0 to 168), and Follow-up (Day 196). 
The 14 consecutive days prior to randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of the 
diary entrie s.  If a patient does not meet the minimum number of observations (see 
Section  9.2.2 for scoring and missing data definitions) to determine eligibility, the patient 
may be re -screened.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients of all ages will be recorded by a 
caregiver .  If possible, the sam e caregiver  will complete the Albireo ObsRO items throughout 
the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit  2) additional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit 3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports f rom the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, clinical genetic 
confirmation of diagnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  
visits.  Two weeks after Visit 3, there wi ll be a telephone contact with the caregiver/patient  to 
evaluate any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit  4, Visit 5, Visit  6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers will be requested to use the diary to report the time each 
dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period.

 The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A4250-008) should they 
meet the required entry criteria.  If the patient is con tinuing into Study A4250-008 this will be 
the last visit in this study and the first visit in Study A4250-008.  Visit 9/EOT  should also be 
performed at the time  patients are prematurely withdrawn from the study. 
Clinic Visit  10 will take place 2 8 days after Visit  9 for all patients not continuing into S tudy

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that should be swallowed intact .  These size 3 capsules may be open ed 
only under exceptional circumstances, e.g., patient cannot swallow capsule intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.  Bottle s with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.  Refer to the investigational product manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 a t a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks.  Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses,  and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed whole 
will be documented through the eDiary and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after  
laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowin g the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water.  
For a patient unable to swallow capsule intact, the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauc e, or fruit 
purée.  A list of food options can be found in the Pharmacy manual . The amount of food 
should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and should be followed by water.  1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée , or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to the patient w ill be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category  (identified in  Table  2), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Label ing 
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in hig h-density polyethylene containers, with child- proof 
polypropylene caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength specified in 
Table  2 above will be manufactured. 
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers .  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C and 25°C. 
Patients/caregivers  should be informed of ap propriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature , between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo.  
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by 
a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and

Final Amendment 0 4, 01 March  2019 
 allocated by the  Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at Screening .  The randomization codes will be compute r-generated by  
Biostatistics and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The randomization 
will be done in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) and age class 
(6 months to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years ) to ensure approximate balance 
between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prepared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization.  
Patients who are eligible for randomiz ation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization 
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who wi thdra w from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  
Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 acco rding to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once  a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the study 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized to.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured  by the study drug number. 
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study drug number corresponding to the randomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will 
not be displayed to end-u sers in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently r equired , i.e., only where knowledge of 
the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situation, the investigator 
at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS .  The responsibility to 
break the treatment code in emerg ency situations resides solely with the investigator.   The 
investigator should make every effort to discuss the rationale (status and outcome) for 
emergency unblinding with the sponsor Medical Monitor or the  Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible to revi ew the individual patient details. 
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be authorized to access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS.  Emergency unblinding 
takes place in the IWRS via a dedicated emer gency unblinding module.  The system will 
require the user to enter their emergency unblinding, which is typically provided at the same time login credentials are distributed.   The exact description of the treatment assigned to the 
individual patient then will be accessible to the user.  Once the randomization code is broken 
for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures at EOT  should be performed.  As a follow -up, Visit  10, will be performed according to the time

9.1 Efficacy Endpoint s 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint s are  as follows: 
•Europe an Union ( EU) and rest of the world  (RoW ): Proportion of patients
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration from baseline to
the end of treatment or reaching  a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to pla cebo  after 24
weeks of treatment.
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization
and the previous visit (Clinic Visit 2).  The end value is the average of the values at
Weeks 22 and 24 after the start of double-b lind treatment.
•United States ( US): Proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level
over the 24 -week Treatment Period. A positive pruritus assessment is defined as a
scratching score of ≤1 or at least a one-point drop from baseline on the Albireo

9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids 
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during

 the treatment period and follow -up will be blin ded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching, Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients  and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session dur ing 
Visit 1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients <8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 18 year s of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years of age, the  caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case the 
patient is confused or requires clarification a bout the meaning of a question.  The Albireo 
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratchi ng and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code (Appendix 2).  To meet eligibility criteria, a  scratch score will be calculat ed from  daily 
diary entries (ObsRO items) the 14 consecutive days prior to randomization.  
A daily AM & PM score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be averaged  from the 2 
ratings for each day.  A daily score will be consider ed missing if both of the daily 
assessments are missing.  A weekly  score will be calculated by averaging the daily scratching 
scores.  A weekly  score will be considered missing if ≥4 out of 7 days a week of data are 
missing.  For AM & PM baseline, a 14-day daily score of AM & PM prior to the first dose of 
study medications will be averaged as the baseline score.  
For AM baseline, a 14-day AM score prior to the first dose of study medications  will be 
averaged as the AM baseline score.  The same approach will be used for PM baseline  and to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.   The handling of missing data is described in 
Section 11.2.2.2. 
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)
2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to a standard growth curve  (Z-score, SD 
from P50).

Patients and caregivers will be asked to complete a QoL  questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4. 
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and PK Samples  
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  >10 kg.  Blood for A4250 PK assessment will only be drawn at Visits 4 
and 9 (only for children with body weight  >10 kg), and as close to the onset of an SAE as 
possible , should  an SAE occur .  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory 
per instructions in the laboratory manual. 9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomiz ation and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years of age.  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin) + 4.36 ( if 
patient < 1 year : scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the patient's first 
birthday continue to include the value assigned for age (< 1 year ) until the patient reaches the 
age of 24 months) + 6.67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 SD ]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin) + 11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine valu es greater than 
4.0 mg/dL (equivalent to  353.6 µmol/L) will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score.  
9.2.7 Fibroscan
® 
Where available, Fibroscan® will be performed as per institution standard practice at Visits 3 
and 9. 
9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and  Fib-4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST in U/L) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Imp ression of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age), caregivers, and clinicians will complete the P GIC and the PGIS 
measures (Appendix 3) at randomization (Visit 3; PGIS only ), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9 ). 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug .  The PGIS items assess itch

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table  1 
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo. 
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
vitamins  A and E, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and INR) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefore be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled 
(ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not 
related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exam ination findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not limited to, events causi ng withdrawal from the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
 
 A4250 – IND 130591  
EudraCT 2017-002338-21 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 49 
Final Amendment 0 4, 01 March  2019 
 is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3) .  For example, the 
development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, no n-serious AE . 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE: 
• The outcome of the AE is death 
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires m edical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in 
Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example , nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet 
serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE . 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study d rug using medical judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, 
temporal relationship to the study drug, and d e-challenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows.

Final Amendment 0 4, 01 March  2019 
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused t he event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environment al or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient 
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It 
should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrel ated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1  will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10)  or 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs o r SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information  for any 
patient with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

Final Amendment 0 4, 01 March  2019 
 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on  
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as 
an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has 
signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit  10), and 2 8 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.     
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date 
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious  
• The rel ationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared  and the information collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain furth er 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any

timelines as for initial reports.  
The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE and follo w-up to the Albireo medical monitor 
for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 28 days after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE form should be completed including the main and 
contributory causes of death. 
All SAE reports must be e-mailed to the following e-mail address within 24 hours : 
 
 
If email is unavailable,  SAEs may be transmitted via fax to the following number: 
 
In a study-r elated medical emergency situation, when the assigned medical monitors for the 
study cannot be reached by a caller, an on call physician can be reached 2 4 hours per day, 
7 days per week, via the  call center.  The following number is a chargeable telephone 
number allowing a global reach from both landlines and mobile phones and the internet page 
indicated below contains  a list of country-s pecific tol l-free telephone numbers that is

10.1.4 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that occurs in a patient , 
the nature or severity of which is not expected per  the applicable product information (e.g., 
the IB for an unauthorized investigational product or summary of product characteristics for an authorized product).   
Reporting and tracking  of SUSARs will be in accordance to all applicable competent 
authority regulations.  The Ethics Committee and all investigators involved in this study will be informed according to national and international requirements.

 10.2 Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Physical Examinations and Other Safety 
Assessments 
10.2.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Samples will be collected for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing at the 
time points specified in  Table  1. The parameters assessed are presented in Table 3. 
Blood for AFP will be drawn at Visits  3 and 9.  F at-soluble vitamin  level s including vitamins 
A and E, and 25- hydroxy vitamin D will be drawn at Visit 2  (vitamins A & E  only) , 
Visit 3 (25- hydroxy vitamin D  only), Visit 6, and Visit 9.  Blood for INR (surrogate for 
vitamin K) will be draw n at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  Patients will fast (water intake only is 
permissible) for at least 4  hours prior to the collection of samples for vitamin A.  Exceptions 
can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 4 hours.  If a patient 
has any vitamin level(s) that are outside of the reference range, vitamin supplementation adjustments may be required.  Target ranges and supplementation strategy guidelines can be 
found in Appendix 5.  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit  1 and Visit 9 if the patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study. A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the confi rmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see 
Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be p rocessed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the 
laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples  may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

10.2.2 Individual Patient Safety Monitoring  
10.2.2.1 Liver Monitoring  
Strategies to monitor markers of liver dise ase throughout the study are outlined below where 
the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and gender.  
If isolated transaminase elevations are observed, defined as:  
1. Normal bilirubin AND absence of clinical hepatitis symptoms AND • ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 
800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR) within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met:  
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations

 2. Transaminase elevations alone (ALT or AST >10  × ULN or 5  × baseline or absolute 
threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first) in presence of normal LDH and CPK 
3. Total bilirubin increased, unrelated to hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count) or 
established genetic diseases, such as Gilbert’s syndrome  
a. Doubling if total bilirubin was <3 mg/dL (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline  
b. OR Increase by > 3 mg/d L (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) if total bilirubin was ≥3 mg/d L 
(equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline 
4. INR increase refractory to vitamin K administration  
a. INR >1.5 if INR was normal at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >0.4 if INR was abnormal at baseline  
5. Any increase in total bilirubin and transaminases if accompanied by EITHER a symptom 
of clinical hepatitis (e.g., vomiting, nausea, right upper quadrant pain) OR immunological 
reaction (rash or >5% eosinophilia) 
Then: 
a) Interrupt study medication 
b) Initiate drug- induced liver injury  work -up for alte rnative etiologies  
c) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin) and PT  or INR within 
48 to 72 hours 
d) Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
e) If a patient lives in a remote area, they may be tested locally and the results 
communicated to the investigator site promptly  
10.2.2.2 Close Observation 
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  Frequency of re -testing can decrease to once a week or l ess if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases  
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medicat ions and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets   
• Consider ruling out  alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, 
and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non- alcoholic s teatohepatitis ; 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.

 • Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin)  
• Consider gastroenterolog y or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re- challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal he morrhage, ascites, hepatic 
encephalopathy, etc.). 
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration 
requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances, fever (≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days. 
If there i
s gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrh ea re- occurs within 1 week after the re- challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5. 
10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug, the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized. 
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF

 Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
For previous confirmatory clinical genetic testing  results for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 performed 
prior to Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be 
verified  to determine eligibility.  
If the historical clinical genetic result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable, clinical 
genetic analysis to confirm pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes 
will be performed and verified to determine eligibility.   No other diagnostic genetic testing 
will be offered.  
10.2.5 Physical Examination  
A physician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography  of skin lesions due to scratching, at  Visits  1, 3, 
6, and 9.  A skin exam ination  will be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table  1).  
A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of >3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 2 4 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-advers e-effect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 mo nth toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in

 a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immediately and not later than within 2 4 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 
10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient.  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled  
in the study after the end of dosing, the patient will continue in the study per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE .  However, if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Safety Manager  (please refer to Section 
10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as possible, details of the period of gestation at the time 
of exposure must be given. 
The pregnancy should be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous termination, 
details of birth, and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or newborn or 
maternal complication.  The infant who was exposed in- utero will be followed for up to 
2 years after delivery.   Individual cases with an abnormal outcome in association with the 
study drug should be reported on an expedited basis, i.e., reported rapidly to a competent authority.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified. 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW, the primary analysis will relate to the serum bile acid responder 
endpoint.  For the US, t he primary analysis will relate to the pruritus endpoint. For each 
primary endpoint, a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure will be applied to control 
the 1- sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the placebo at the 0. 025 
level (Kane et al, 2015, Lehmacher et al, 1991, and Marcus et al, 1976). The study will enroll 
60 to 70 patients in order to obtain at least  least 20 evaluable patients in each arm. For each 
primary endpoint, simulations with 5000 iterations using 20 patients per arm were conducted to estimate the power after multiplicity adjustment, resulting in a standard error of <0.7% for 
each estimated power.   
Based on the Phase 2 A4250- 003 study data both dose groups are predicted to have similar 
treatment effect s for both serum bile acids and pruritus. For serum bile acids , simulated 
proportions were analyz ed using the CMH test to generate the following 1- sided p-values: 
both A4250 arms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. placebo. 
Assuming  60% responders in the A4250 arms and 10% responders in the placebo arm, the 
power to claim significance for a particular A4250 arm after multiplicity adjustment is approximately 94%. The power to claim significance for at least one arm or both arms are 
approximately 99% and 91%, respectively.  
For the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level in pruritus scores, 
simulated proportions were analyz ed using AN COVA to generate the following 1- sided p-
values: both A4250 arms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. placebo. With an effect size of 1.0526, the simulated power to claim significance for a 
particular arm after multiplicity adjustment is approximately 89%. The probability to claim significance for at least one arm  or both arms are approximately 95% and 83%, respectively.   
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.

Final Amendment 0 4, 01 March  2019 
 The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set i s a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no major  protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study. 
11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses  
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 
40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with PFIC Types 1 and 2.  
In the EU and RoW, for the primary efficacy variable of fasting bile acid responder endpoint 
(at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration or reaching a level ≤70 µmol/L at the 
end of tre atment), the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age 
class will be performed to compare the proportion in fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose groups to placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be pooled if all 
subjects in a stratum have the same response. Dropouts will be treated as non -responders. The 
proportion together with corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented.   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments 
at subject level over the 24 -week treatment period, an analysis of  covariance (ANCOVA) will 
be used. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score, PM baseli ne 
pruritus score, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS 
mean(SE) by treatment arm and LS mean difference (S E), 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) 
vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. normality and 
homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores will be used 
as a sensitivity analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean 
difference/SE between active dose and placebo will be provided.  
The procedure for multiplicity adjustment is specified as follows:    
In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with 
the placebo group first. If the 1 -sided p -value is ≤0.025, the 1- sided p- values for low dose vs.

Final Amendment 0 4, 01 March  2019 
 placebo and high dose vs. placebo  will be calculated,  respectively. If both individual p -values 
are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on both dose groups. If only one of 
them is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on the corresponding dose 
group.  
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between th e treatment groups. No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy 
variables.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter prior to the first intake of study treatment.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data  
In the primary analysis of the pruritus endpoint, all intermittently missing assessments will be classified as negative pruritus assessments. Similarly, all planned assessments after the intercurrent events (premature treatment discontinuation, death or initiation of rescue 
treatments such as biliary diversion surgery or liver transplantation) will be counted as 
negative pruritus assessments. However, as described above, all 336 assessments planned over the 24- week  treatment period will be included in the denominator of the endpoint 
definition.  
In the primary analysis of fasting bile acid responder endpoint, dropouts and patients with a 
missing average at the end of the treatment will be treated as non -responders. Patients in need 
of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant will be classified as non-responders. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made as far as possible.  
11.2.2.3 Demo graphic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including medical and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior and concomitant medication  use during the study will be summarized by treatment 
group and overall using the safety analysis set.  
11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable): 
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patie nts randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study  
• Patients withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)

 Additionally, patients enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region. 
 
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables  
For EU and RoW, t he primary responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will 
be analy zed in terms of the proportion of patients achieving the event of interest. Patients in 
need of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant , will be classified 
as non-responders. Dropouts will be treated as non-responders.  
CMH stratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, 
neighboring strata will be pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same response. The 
proportion together with corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented  
Logistic regression wi ll be performed as a supportive  analysis to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responders at the end  of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. The model will include treatment arm, baseline value, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. Baseline value will be 
calculated as the average of serum  bile acid values at randomization and the previous visit 
(Clinic Visit 2).   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments 
at the subject level over the 24- week treatment period, ANCOVA will be u sed to analyz e the 
pruritus endpoint. The model will include treatment arm, AM baseli ne pruritus score, PM 
baseli ne pruritus score, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. 
LS mean(SE) by treatment arm and LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and 
p-values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day, 
respectively) vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. normality and homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank 
scores can be used. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean 
difference/SE between active dose and placebo will be provided.  
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of intermittently missing data as 
well as intercurrent events and will be specified in the SAP. Subgroup analyses will also be 
performed for each of the 3 age groups (6 months to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years) and for patients who were not included in the previous Study A4250-003. 
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables

 summariz ed by visit using descriptive statistics. Change in growth (weight for age and BMI 
for age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations.  
Proportion of responders at Weeks 12 and 24 based on the PRO/ObsRO instruments 
estimated from both distribution and anchor -based approaches will be analyz ed using the 
same model as specified for the primary analysis for EU and RoW. 
Proportion of individual assessments meeting the definition of a positive pruritus assessment at the subject level from Weeks 0 -4, Weeks 0- 8, Weeks 0- 12, Weeks 0- 18, Weeks 0-24, 
respectively, or the proportion of positi ve pruritus assessments at each 4 -week interval over 
the 24- week treatment period for AM or PM, respectively will be analy zed using the same 
model as specified for the primary analysis for US.   
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or liver transplant,  all-cause mortality, and liver 
decompensation events will mainly be analyz ed by using descriptive statistics. Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data.  
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week 24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using ANCOVA. The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC 
class, age class, and treatment.  
Other exploratory variables (Global Symptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, additional Alb ireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters, PELD/MELD 
score, APRI score, and Fib -4 score) will be analy zed descriptively for categorical and 
continuous data, as applicable. For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analy zed in addition to the actual v isit values. For categorical data, shift tables or frequency 
and percentages of patients will be presented as appropriate. Additional details on secondary 
and exploratory efficacy variables and subgroup analyses by age class (6 months to 5 years, 6 
to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years)  will be specified in the SAP.  
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests (h ematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class [SOC] and MedDRA preferred t erm) will include  the 
following:  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs)  
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term

from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant  (PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.   For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS 
values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analyz ed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment  group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatment group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.  
11.2.3 Blinded A nalyses to  Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clini cally meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this 
analysis; data will be collapsed  across treatment groups. 
The analyses will include distribution - and anchor-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distributio n-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of m easurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will involve examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and s ymptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will be included in a stan d-alone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items .

 11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically  (approximately  on a quarterly basis)  meet for the 
review of accumulating study data, including safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver 
values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping  the study early for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo Medical/  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be infor med by Albireo Medical/  
if the study requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own writte n standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the trial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate 
unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the 
study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB statistician w ill have access to these data.

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance procedures 
with writte n standard operating procedures to ensure that the study is conducted and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations , Sections 312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IEC/IRB, 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient or when the change(s) 
involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations ma y result in 
the patient having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative or designee will review the  protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative s taff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) 
will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements,  and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of 
primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study- specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the fre quency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine 
the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding 
documentation.

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or  administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers, IB, available safety information, information about  payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents and Assents  
The investigator (physician) or investigative s taff, in accordance with local regulation s, will 
explain to each patient ( or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur.  Each caregiver /patient will 
be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she or their child may 
withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her 
subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. 
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their children may experience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  Care givers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that 
some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with  ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory 
authorities .  The caregiver (s)/patient should read and consider the statements before signing 
and dating them and should be given a copy of each signed document.  If written consent is 
not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement 
from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to 
sign the form.  No patient can enter the study before his/her or care giver (s) informed consent 
has been obtained, as required by country regulations. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/i nvestigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed e CRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance wit h the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start .  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medica l history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the eCRF will be the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as def ined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact discs of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approva ls and all related corresponden ce including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/i nvestigative staff must retain copies of these essential documents for the 
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essential 
documents .  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

Title of Study:  
A Double -Blind, Randomi zed, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Demonstrate Effic acy and Safety of A4250 
in Children with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  Types 1 and 2 (PEDFIC 1)  
Principal  Investigator:  
 
Study Centers:  
Up to 50 sites will be initiated for this study in the United States (US), Ca nada , Europe an Union  (EU) , Middle 
East, and Australia.  
Publication(s):  
None.  
Planned Study Period:  
Q2 2018 to Q4 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following: 
•Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA)
concentration from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
•The proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over the 24 -week Treatment Period
Secondary Objectives  
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine amin otransferase (ALT) concentration
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance
•To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver
transplantation)
•To assess the sa fety and tolerability of repeated da ily doses of A4250 for 2 4 weeks
Methodology:  
This is a double-b lind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µ g/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in  children with PFIC  (deficiencies of familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 2 4-week Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screenin g Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit  3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 4 0 µg/kg/day or 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit  9 (Day 168)  in thi s study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72- week open -label extension  study (A425 0-008) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

Safety criteria are as follows:  
• Occurrence of treatment- emergent adverse events including severity and relatedness to study drug at all 
visits  
• The incidence of treatmen t-emergent serious adverse events ( SAEs ), based upon information from 
patient reports, including the description, incidence, and severity of an SAE  
• Trends evaluated for the following assessments: physical examinations, concomitant medications, vital 
signs, laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hemato logy, urinalysis, alfa -fetoprotein, 
vitamins A and E, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D and INR), and abdominal ultrasound 
Statistical Methods:  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of A425 0 (120 µg/kg/day and 
40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo  in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2 . 
The Cochran Mantel Haenzel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare 
the proportion in fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment  (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be 
pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same response. The proportion together with the corresponding 95% 
CI, odds ratio and corresp onding 95% Clopper -Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented.   
 
For the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at subject level over the 24 -
week treatment period , an ANCOVA model will be used to a nalys e the comparisons between the treatment 
groups. The model will include treatment arm, the averaged AM and PM baseli ne pruritus scores, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS mean(SE) by treatment arm and LS mean 
difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and p -values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day 
and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. 
normality and homogeneity of variances , a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used as a 
sensitivity analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean difference/SE between active 
dose and placebo will be provided.   
 
For each primary endpoint  by region (EU & RoW  and US),  a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure 
will be applied to control the 1 -sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the placebo at 
the 0.025 level, as specified below:  
 In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with the placebo group 
first. If the 1 -sided p-value is ≤0.025, the 1- sided p -values for low dose vs. placebo and high dose vs. placebo  
will be calculated  respectively. If both individual p -values are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be 
declared on both dose groups. If only one of them i s ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on 
the corresponding dose group.  
 
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups. N o adjustments will be performed for multiple 
comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This  transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids since  it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofm ann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.   In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg/day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gastrointestinal (GI)  related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks.  A4250 reduced mean levels  of serum bile acids 
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug, and most  adverse events ( AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Backgrou nd 
5.2.1 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10 % to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children  and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liv er [Jacquemin 2000].  The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also ref erred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis-1 ( FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular

 membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer 
to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also refer red to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency. ”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes, and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by a deficiency of the multidrug- resistance protein  3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid tr anslocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibros is.  Serum biochemistry indicate s cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) activity 
(exception being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of 
portal hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -
Spraul 2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 
2 months, and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The 
life-threatening and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those 
not resorting  to surgery is 50% at 1 0 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  
Approximately half of PFIC patients undergo liver transplantation [ Davit -Spraul 2009] and 
treatment- resistant pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external 
biliary diversion, mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.  Currently, the treatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.  A minority of pa tients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Clinical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is  provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ([ IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition , no safety signals were seen in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 2 6 weeks of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure in both humans and other 
species.  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µ mol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies:  a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a singl e-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  In total, 98 subjects have been exposed to 
A4250. 
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 1 0 mg or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg, the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (ser um fibroblast growth factor 19 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo. A4250 was generally well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not 
related to A 4250. T he 3 AEs  experienced by 2 subjects reported a s related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg/day for 4 weeks.  Twenty 
patients  (8 females and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 17 years were enrolled in this ope n-label

 dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a s econd dose level.  No  
treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs, including some increased 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment with A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s- BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients ( ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11  non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patient- reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during tr eatment.  
The dose with the greatest improvement showed a mean decrease (± standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results from this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988].  Liver 
transplantation is typically used  as an option when patients have failed medical treatment 
and/or biliary diversio n and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus . 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achieves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent li ver failure and liver 
transplantation. 
The doses selected, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re -entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose  groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in the PFIC subgroup was at 
30 µg/kg/day for both s-BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg/day; however, a clear dose relationship could not be 
established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3 study.  As efficacy was observed at both low and high doses, 40 µg/kg  and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.

Final Amendment 0 3, 22 November 2018 
 This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the Inte rnational 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
Patients completing 2 4 weeks of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-label treatment with A4250. 
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit 
A4250 has been e valuated in three Albireo -sponsored clinical studies: a double -blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been  conducted in patients with PBC. 
A total of 98  subjects/patients have been exposed to A4250.  Healthy subjects have been 
exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as part of a multiple -dose 
evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated with up to 
0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; both were 
judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. 
Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acid s in the liver resulting in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby inte rrupting the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be 
of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study 
showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  
However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing.

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a double-b lind, randomi zed, placebo-c ontrolled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically (approximate ly on a quarterly basis) reviewed by an 
unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). 
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow-Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, e ligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited to participate in a 72-week open -label extension  study (A4250-008 ; EudraCT Number 
2017-002325- 38, subject to a separate study approval ) in which all patients will receive  
active treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to intolerable  symptoms , and has 
completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment Period and End of Treatment (EOT) Visit, will 
also be offered the opportunity to enter Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments (Table  1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study (Figure 1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact, as follows: • Visit 1: Screening Period start. Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -35) 
• Visit 2: second Screening Visit ( Days -28 to - 7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone C ontact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit (Day  28)

 • Visit 10: Follow -Up V isit, 28 days after last dose of study drug ( Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow-up Visit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance, e.g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil screening requirements, and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After signing the ICF , patients will be considered enrolled and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily recording of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirm ation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study.  After 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re -screened 
after 2 months.  Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not 
allowed to re -screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observer-r eported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period (study Days  -56 to 0) , throughout the 24-w eek Treatment Period 
(study Days  0 to 168), and Follow-up (Day 196). 
The 14 consecutive days prior to randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of the 
diary entrie s.  If a patient does not meet the minimum number of observations (see 
Section  9.2.2 for scoring and missing data definitions) to determine eligibility, the patient 
may be re -screened.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients of all ages will be recorded by a 
caregiver .  If possible, the same caregiver  will complete the Albireo ObsRO items throughout 
the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit  2) additional laboratory samples  will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit  3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports f rom the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, clinical genetic 
confirmation of dia gnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  
visits.  Two weeks after Visit 3, there will be a telephone contact with the caregiver/patient  to 
evaluate any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit  4, Visit 5, Visit  6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, car egivers will be requested to use the diary to report the time each 
dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period.

 The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A4250-008) should they 
meet the required entry criteria .  If the patient is continuing into Study A4250-008 this will be 
the last visit in this study and the first visit in Study A4250-008.  Visit 9/EOT  should also be 
performed at the time  patients are prematurely withdrawn from the study. 
Clinic Visit  10 will take place 2 8 days after Visit  9 for all patients not continuing into S tudy 
A4250-008.

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets cont aining A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different 
capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that should be swallowed intact .  These size 3 capsules may be opened 
only under exceptional circumstances, e.g., patient cannot swallow capsule intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.  Bottles with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.  Refer to the investigational product manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks.  Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial  doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses,  and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed whole 
will be documented through the eDiary and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with foo d.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after  
laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowing the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water.  
For a patient unable to swallow capsule intact, the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce , or fruit 
purée.  A list of food options can be found in the Pharmacy manual . The amount of food 
should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and should be followed by water.  1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée , or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to the patient will  be based on body weight  at Visit 3 .  At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category  (identified in Table  2), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in hig h-density polyethylene containers, with child- proof 
polypropyle ne caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength specified in 
Table  2 abo ve will be manufactured. 
Packaging a nd labeling will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers .  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C and 25°C. 
Patients/caregivers  should be informed of appropriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature , between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo. 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identifica tion number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by 
a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and

8.5 Patient  Compliance  
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance by routine review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both diary entr ies on a day  are missing , the study nurse will call the 
patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entries.  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents. Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, patients 
will return a ll unused study drug at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug, assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient, and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients. 
The investigator  will be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were provided the quantities specified in the protocol and that all study drug 
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy  and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator will note a ll ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or chan ges in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medications (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sleep will be 
recorded.  
All medications taken by a patient within 3 month s prior to the first intake of study drug are 
regarded as prior medicatio n. 
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the study , are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1.

 9 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
9.1 Efficacy Endpoint s 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint s are  as follows: 
• Europe an Union ( EU) and rest of the world  (RoW ): Proportion of patients 
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration from baseline to 
the end of treatment or reaching  a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to pla cebo  after 24 
weeks of treatment.  
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization 
and the previous visit (Clinic Visit 2).  The end value is the average of the values at 
Weeks 22 and 24 after the start of double-b lind treatment.  
• United States ( US): Proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level 
over the 24 -week Treatment Period. A positive pruritus assessment is defined as a 
scratching score of ≤1 or at least a one-point drop from baseline on the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument . At each assessment, the AM score will be compared to the 
baseline AM average, and the PM score will be compared to the baseline PM average. 
Both AM and PM pruritus assessments will be included in the analysis of this 
endpoint. AM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose of study medications will 
be averaged as AM baseline. PM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose will be 
averaged as PM baseline.   
9.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level over 
the 24- week Treatment Period. A positive pruritus assessment is defined as a 
scratching score of ≤1 or at least a one- point drop fro m baseline on the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument. At each assessment, the AM score will be compared to the 
baseline AM average, and the PM score will be compared to the baseline PM average. 
Both AM and PM pruritus assessments will be included in the analysis of this 
endpoint. AM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose of study medications will 
be averaged as AM baseline. PM scores from the 14 days prior to the first dose will be averaged as PM baseline.    
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a  70% reduction in fasting s -BA 
concentration  from baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 µ mol/L

9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids 
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during

 the treatment period and follow -up will be blin ded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching, Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients  and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session dur ing 
Visit 1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients <8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 18 year s of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years of age, the  caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case the 
patient is confused or requires clarification a bout the meaning of a question.  The Albireo 
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratchi ng and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code ( Appendix 2).  To meet eligibility criteria, a  scratch score will be calculat ed from  daily 
diary entries (ObsRO items) the 14 consecutive days prior to randomization.  
A daily AM & PM score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be averaged  from the 2 
ratings for each day.  A daily score will be consider ed missing if both of the daily 
assessments are missing.  A weekly  score will be calculated by averaging the daily scratching 
scores.  A weekly  score will be considered missing if ≥4 out of 7 days a week of data are 
missing.  For AM & PM baseline, a 14-day daily score of AM & PM prior to the first dose of 
study medications will be averaged as the baseline score.  
For AM baseline, a 14-day AM score prior to the first dose of study medications  will be 
averaged as the baseline AM score.  The same approach will be used for PM baseline  and to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.   The handling of missing data is described in 
Section 11.2.2.2. 
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)
2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to a standard growth curve  (Z-score, SD 
from P50).

Final Amendment 0 3, 22November  2018 
 9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be asked to complete a QoL  questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4. 
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and PK Samples  
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  >10 kg.  Blood for A4250 PK assessment will only be drawn at Visits 4 
and 9 (only for children with body weight  >10 kg), and as close to the onset of an SAE as 
possible , should  an SAE occur .  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory 
per instructions in the laboratory manual. 9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomiz ation and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years of age.  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin) + 4.36 ( if 
patient < 1 year : scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the patient's first 
birthday continue to include the value assigned for age (< 1 year ) until the patient reaches the 
age of 24 months) + 6.67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 SD ]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin) + 11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine valu es greater than 
4.0 mg/dL (equivalent to  353.6 µmol/L)will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score. 
9.2.7 Fibroscan
® 
Where available, Fibroscan® will be performed as per institution standard practice at Visits 3 
and 9. 
9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and Fib-4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST in U/L) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Impr ession of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age), caregivers, and clinicians will complete the P GIC and the PGIS 
measures ( Appendix 3) at randomization (Visit 3; PGIS only ), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9). The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug .  The PGIS items assess itch

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table  1 
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo. 
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
vitamins  A and E, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and INR) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefore be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled 
(ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not 
related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exam ination findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not limited to, events causi ng withdrawal from the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
 
 A4250 – IND 130591  
EudraCT 2017-002338-21 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 49 
Final Amendment 0 3, 22November  2018 
 is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, no n-serious AE . 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE: 
• The outcome of the AE is death 
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires m edical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in 
Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example , nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet 
serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE . 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study d rug using medical judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, 
temporal relationship to the study drug, and d e-challenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows.

Final Amendment 0 3, 22November  2018 
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused t he event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environment al or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient 
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It 
should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrel ated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1  will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10)  or 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs o r SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information  for any 
patient with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on  
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as 
an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has 
signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit  10), and 2 8 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.     
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date 
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious  
• The rel ationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared  and the information collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain furth er 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any

 10.2 Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Physical Examinations and Other Safety 
Assessments 
10.2.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Samples will be collected for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing at the 
time points specified in  Table  1. The parameters assessed are presented in Table 3. 
Blood for AFP will be drawn at Visits  3 and 9.  F at-soluble vitamin  level s including vitamins 
A and E, and 25- hydroxy vitamin D will be drawn at Visit 2  (vitamins A & E  only) , 
Visit 3 (25- hydroxy vitamin D  only), Visit 6, and Visit 9.  Blood for INR (surrogate for 
vitamin K) will be draw n at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  Patients will fast (water intake only is 
permissible) for at least 4  hours prior to the collection of samples for vitamin A.  Exceptions 
can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 4 hours.  If a patient 
has any vitamin level(s) that are outside of the reference range, vitamin supplementation adjustments may be required.  Target ranges and supplementation strategy guidelines can be 
found in Appendix 5.  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit  1 and Visit 9 if the patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study. A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the confi rmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see 
Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be p rocessed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the 
laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples  may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

10.2.2.1 Liver Monitoring  
Strategies to monitor markers of liver dise ase throughout the study are outlined below where 
the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and gender.  
If isolated transaminase elevations are observed, defined as:  
1. Normal bilirubin AND absence of clinical hepatitis symptoms AND • ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 
800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR) within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met:  
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations

 2. Transaminase elevations alone (ALT or AST >10  × ULN or 5  × baseline or absolute 
threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first) in presence of normal LDH and CPK 
3. Total bilirubin increased, unrelated to hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count) or 
established genetic diseases, such as Gilbert’s syndrome  
a. Doubling if total bilirubin was <3 mg/dL (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline  
b. OR Increase by > 3 mg/d L (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) if total bilirubin was ≥3 mg/d L 
(equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline 
4. INR increase refractory to vitamin K administration  
a. INR >1.5 if INR was normal at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >0.4 if INR was abnormal at baseline  
5. Any increase in total bilirubin and transaminases if accompanied by EITHER a symptom 
of clinical hepatitis (e.g., vomiting, nausea, right upper quadrant pain) OR immunological 
reaction (rash or >5% eosinophilia) 
Then: 
a) Interrupt study medication 
b) Initiate drug- induced liver injury  work -up for alte rnative etiologies  
c) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin) and PT  or INR within 
48 to 72 hours 
d) Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
e) If a patient lives in a remote area, they may be tested locally and the results 
communicated to the investigator site promptly  
10.2.2.2 Close Observation 
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  Frequency of re -testing can decrease to once a week or l ess if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases  
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medicat ions and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets   
• Consider ruling out  alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, 
and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non- alcoholic s teatohepatitis ; 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.

 • Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin)  
• Consider gastroenterolog y or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re- challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal he morrhage, ascites, hepatic 
encephalopathy, etc.). 
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration 
requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances, fever (≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days. 
If there
 is gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrh ea re- occurs within 1 week after the re- challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5. 
10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug, the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized. 
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical and Surgical History

 Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
For previous confirmatory clinical genetic testing  results for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 performed 
prior to Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be 
verified  to determine eligibility.  
If the historical clinical genetic result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable, clinical 
genetic analysis to confirm pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes 
will be performed and verified to determine eligibility.   No other diagnostic genetic testing 
will be offered.  
10.2.5 Physical Examination  
A physician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography  of skin lesions due to scratching, at  Visits  1, 3, 
6, and 9.  A skin exam ination  will be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table  1).  
A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of >3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 2 4 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-advers e-effect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 mo nth toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in

 a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immediately and not later than within 2 4 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 
10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient.  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled  
in the study after the end of dosing, the patient will continue in the study per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE .  However, if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Safety Manager  (please refer to Section 
10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as possible, details of the period of gestation at the time 
of exposure must be given. 
The pregnancy should be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous termination, 
details of birth, and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or newborn or 
maternal complication.  The infant who was exposed in- utero will be followed for up to 
2 years after delivery.   Individual cases with an abnormal outcome in association with the 
study drug should be reported on an expedited basis, i.e., reported rapidly to a competent authority.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified. 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW, the primary analysis will relate to the serum bile acid responder 
endpoint.  For the US, t he primary analysis will relate to the pruritus endpoint. For each 
primary endpoint, a pooled analysis for the closed testing procedure will be applied to control 
the 1- sided overall type I error rate for two treatment comparisons vs. the placebo at the 0. 025 
level (Kane et al, 2015, Lehmacher et al, 1991, and Marcus et al, 1976). The study will enroll 
60 to 70 patients in order to obtain at least  least 20 evaluable patients in each arm. For each 
primary endpoint, simulations with 5000 iterations using 20 patients per arm were conducted to estimate the power after multiplicity adjustment, resulting in a standard error of <0.7% for 
each estimated power.   
Based on the Phase 2 A4250- 003 study data both dose groups are predicted to have similar 
treatment effect s for both serum bile acids and pruritus. For serum bile acids , simulated 
proportions were analyz ed using the CMH test to generate the following 1- sided p-values: 
both A4250 arms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. placebo. 
Assuming  60% responders in the A4250 arms and 10% responders in the placebo arm, the 
power to claim significance for a particular A4250 arm after multiplicity adjustment is approximately 94%. The power to claim significance for at least one arm or both arms are 
approximately 99% and 91%, respectively.  
For the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the subject level in pruritus scores, 
simulated proportions were analyz ed using AN COVA to generate the following 1- sided p-
values: both A4250 arms pooled vs. placebo, low dose vs. placebo, and high dose vs. placebo. With an effect size of 1.0526, the simulated power to claim significance for a 
particular arm after multiplicity adjustment is approximately 89%. The probability to claim significance for at least one arm  or both arms are approximately 95% and 83%, respectively.   
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.

 The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set i s a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no major  protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study. 
11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses  
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of 
A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/da y) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 
and 2. In the EU and RoW, for the primary efficacy variable of fasting bile acid responder endpoint 
(at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration or reaching a level ≤70 µmol/L at the 
end of tr eatment), the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by PFIC class and age 
class will be performed to compare the proportion in fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose groups to placebo group. To 
ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring strata will be pooled if all 
subjects in a stratum have the same response. Dropouts will be treated as non -responders. The 
proportion together with corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented.   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at subject level over the 24 -week treatment period, an analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) will 
be used. The model will include treatment arm, AM and PM baseli ne pruritus scores, and 
randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS mean(SE) by treatment 
arm and LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and p- values (where applicable) 
between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. normality and homogeneity of variances, a non -parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores will be used as a sensitivity 
analysis. LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean difference/SE between active dose and placebo will be provided.  
The procedure for multiplicity adjustment is specified as follows:

Final Amendment 0 3, 22November  2018 
 In th e closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups will be pooled to compare with 
the placebo group first. If the 1- sided p -value is ≤0.025, the 1- sided p- values for low dose vs. 
placebo and high dose vs. placebo  will be calculated,  respectively. If both individual p -values 
are ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on both dose groups. If only one of 
them is ≤0.025, a significant treatment effect will be declared on the corresponding dose 
group.  
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables will provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups. No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple comparisons when testing secondary and exploratory efficacy 
variables.  
If not otherwi se specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter prior to the first intake of study treatment.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data  
In the primary analysis of the pruritus endpoint, all intermittently missing assessments will be classified as negative pruritus assessments. Similarly, all planned assessments after the 
intercurrent events (premature treatment discontinuation, death or initiation of rescue treatments such as biliary diversion surgery or liver transplantation) will be  counted as 
negative pruritus assessments. However, as described above, all 336 assessments planned over the 24 -week  treatment period will be included in the denominator of the endpoint 
definition.  
In the primary analysis of fasting bile acid responder endpoint, dropouts and patients with a 
missing average at the end of the treatment will be treated as non -responders. Patients in need 
of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant will be classified as 
non-responders. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made as far as possible.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior and concomitant medication  use during the study will be summarized by treatment 
group and overall using the safety analysis set.  
11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable): 
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated

 • Patients completing the study  
• Patients withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)  
Additionally, patients enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region. 
 
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables  
For EU and RoW, t he primary responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will 
be analy zed in terms of the proportion of patients achieving the event of interest. Patients in 
need of surgical rescue, i.e. biliary diversion and listing for liver transplant , will be classified 
as non-responders. Dropouts will be treated as non-responders.  
CMH stratified by PFIC class and age class will be performed to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose 
groups to the placebo group. To ascertain that all data are used in the CMH analysis, neighboring s trata will be pooled if all subjects in a stratum have the same response. The 
proportion together with corresponding 95% CI, odds ratio and corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact CI and p -value for the CMH test will be presented  
Logistic regression wi ll be performed as a supportive  analysis to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responders at the end of treatment (Week 22 and 24) in the two A4250 dose groups to the placebo group. The model will include treatment arm, baseline value, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. Baseline value will be 
calculated as the average of serum  bile acid values at randomization and the previous visit 
(Clinic Visit 2).   
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments 
at the subject level over the 24- week treatment period, ANCOVA will be used to analyz e the 
pruritus endpoint. The model will include treatment arm, the averaged AM and PM baseli ne 
pruritus scores, and randomiz ation stratification factors, i.e. PFIC class and age class. LS 
mean(SE) by treatment arm and LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and p-values (where applicable) between treatments (120 µg/kg/day and 40 µg/kg/day, respectively) vs. placebo will be provided. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e. normality and 
homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used. 
LS mean/SE on the outcome by treatment arm and LS mean difference/SE between active 
dose and placebo will be provided.  
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of intermittently missing data as 
well as intercurrent events and will be specified in the SAP. Subgroup analyses will also be 
performed for each of the 3 age groups (6 months to  5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 
years) and for patients who were not included in the previous Study A4250-003.

 11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
The change in the secondary endpoints such as serum bile acids, total bilirubin, ALT, growth, 
Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters, and patient -reported itch severity will be 
summariz ed by visit using descriptive statistics. Change in growth (weight for age and BMI 
for age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations.  
Proportion of responders at Weeks 12 and 24 based on the PRO/ObsRO instruments 
estimated from both distribution and anchor -based approaches will be analyz ed using the 
same model as specified for the primary analysis for EU and RoW.  
Proportion of individual as sessments meeting the definition of a positive pruritus assessment 
at the subject level from Weeks 0 -4, Weeks 0- 8, Weeks 0- 12, Weeks 0- 18, Weeks 0-24, 
respectively, or the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at each 4- week interval over 
the 24- week  treatment period for AM or PM, respectively will be analy zed using the same 
model as specified for the primary analysis for US.   
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or listed for liver transplant, all- cause mortality, 
and liver decompensation events  will mainly be analy zed by using descriptive statistics. 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data.  
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week 24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using ANCOVA. T he model will include terms for baseline, PFIC 
class, age class, and treatment.  
Other exploratory variables (Global Symptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of bile acid synthesis, additional Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters, PELD/MELD 
score,  APRI score, and Fib -4 score) will be analy zed descriptively for categorical and 
continuous data, as applicable. For continuous data, the change from baseline will be 
analy zed in addition to the actual visit values. For categorical data, shift tables or fr equency 
and percentages of patients will be presented as appropriate. Additional details on secondary 
and exploratory efficacy variables and subgroup analyses by age class (6 months to 5 years, 6 
to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years)  will be specified in the SAP.  
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class [SOC] and MedDRA preferred term) will include  the 
following:

Summaries of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.   For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS 
values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analyz ed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatment group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.  
11.2.3 Blinded A nalyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this analysis; data will be collapsed across treatment groups. 
The analyses will include distribution - and anchor-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distributio n-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of measurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will involve examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experien ce change in pruritus according to PGIC and symptom items.  Details of this analysis

11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically  (approximately  on a quarterly basis)  meet for the 
review of accumulating study data, i ncluding safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver 
values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The DSMB may recommend  continuing with the study as planned or stopping the study early for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo Medical  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical/  
if the study requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own written standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the trial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its me etings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate 
unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the 
study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB statistician will have access to these data.

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance procedures 
with writte n standard operating procedures to ensure that the study is conducted and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations , Sections 312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IEC/IRB, 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient or when the change(s) 
involve(s) only logistical or administra tive aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in 
the patient having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albir eo 
representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative s taff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) 
will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patie nt records, the accuracy of 
entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements,  and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of 
primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study- specific monit oring plan.  The 
design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination visit, which will incl ude collection of any outstanding 
documentation.

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers, IB, available safety information, information about payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents and Assents  
The investigator (physician) or investigative s taff, in accordance with local regulation s, will 
explain to each patient ( or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur.  Each caregiver /patient will 
be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she or their child may 
withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her 
subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. 
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their children may experie nce sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  Care givers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that 
some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authorities .  The caregiver (s)/patient should read and consider the statements before signing 
and dating them and should be given a copy of each signed docum ent.  If written consent is 
not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to 
sign the form.  No patient can enter the stu dy before his/her or care giver (s) informed consent 
has been obtained, as required by country regulations. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/i nvestigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply  an ICF which complies with

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed e CRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient visits are pro mptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start .  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the 
eCRF will be the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of E ssential Documents  
Essential documents, as defined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact discs of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approvals and all related correspondence including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/i nvestigative staff must retain c opies of these essential documents for the 
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo fo r approval before disposing of any essential 
documents .  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

Appendix  5: Guideline for Fat -Soluble Vitamin Supplementation  
Cholestasis predisposes to fat -soluble vitamin deficiencies.  Fat-soluble vitamin levels, 
i.e., vitamins A and E, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and INR (surrogate for vitamin K) are
measured routinely during the study.  If a patient has any fat -soluble vitamin level(s) that 
are out of range, vitamin supplementation adjustments may be required.  Below are 
suggested guidelines for fat -soluble vitamin deficiency treatment  [Venkat  2014; 
Shneider  2012 ].  Additional patient monitoring and/or treatment strategies may be 
warranted at the discretion of the investigator.  
Target Fat-soluble Vitamin  Levels and Replacement Regimens  
Vitamin  Target Range  
(Serum Level)  Supplementation Strategy  
A (retinol)  19 to 77 µg/dL * 
retinol: retinol -binding 
protein  molar ratio >  0.8 Increments of 5000 IU (up to 25 ,000 
to 50,000 IU/day) orally or monthly 
intramuscular administration of 
50,000 IU ** 
D (25-hydroxy 
vitamin D)  15 to 45 ng/mL * Increments of 1200 to 8000 IU 
orally daily of cholecalciferol or 
ergocalciferol; alternatively 
calcitriol at 0.05 to 0.2  µg/kg/day * 
E (α tocopherol)  3.8 to 20.3 µg/mL  
vitam in E:total serum 
lipids ratio > 0.6 mg/g  Increments of 25 IU/kg of 
d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 
–1000 succinate (TPGS) orally
daily (to 100 IU/kg/day)  
K (phytonadione)  INR ≤1.2 •1.2 <INR ≤1.5: 2.5 mg
vitamin  K orally daily
•1.5 <INR ≤1.8: 2 .0 to 5.0 mg
vitamin K intramuscular and
2.5 mg vitamin K orally daily
•INR >1.8: 2 .0 to 5.0 mg vitamin
K intramuscular and 5 .0 mg
vitamin K orally daily
*Clinical practice may vary.  This is meant as a guidance only and does not override local standard of care. Investigators
should provide best case pr actices for management and treatment

Appendix  6: Contraceptive Requirements  
A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following 
menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile.  Permanent 
sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral 
oophorecto my. 
Contraceptive methods, or combinations of contraceptive methods, for males and females 
that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and 
correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods and must be us ed at 
least to up to 90 days following the last day of treatment.  
Such methods include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal c ontraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
o oral 
o injectable  
o implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomised partner  
• Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire study period up to at least 90 days after 
the last day of treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be ev aluated in 
relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraceptio n.

Planned Study Period:  
Q2 2018 to Q4 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 120 µg /kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following : 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA) 
concentration from baseline to  end of treatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• Change in pruritus compared to placebo  over 24 weeks of treatment  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration  
• To e valuate the effect of A4250 on growth  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated dai ly doses of A4250 for 24 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µ g/kg/day and 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in children with PFIC  (deficiencies of familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per t reatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 4 0 µg/kg/day or 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day 168)  in this study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72 -week open -label extension  study (A4250-0 08) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

• The incidence of treatmen t-emergent serious adverse events ( SAEs ), based upon information from 
patient reports, including the description, incidence, and severity of an SAE  
• Trends evaluated for  the following assessments: physical examinations, concomitant medications, vital 
signs, laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hematology , urinalysis, alfa -fetoprotein, 
vitamins A and E, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D and INR), and abdominal ultraso und 
Statistical Methods: 
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of A4250 ( 120 µg/kg/day and 
40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2 . 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting  bile acid responder endpoint (at least a 70% 
reduction in fasting s -BA concentration or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end of treatment), the null 
hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α =0.0125, 1-sided).  Generalized linear mi xed 
modelling will be used with a logistic link, to allow for repeated assessments over time.  The model will include 
baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit and visit*treatment group interaction.  The 
contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the difference at Week  4, 
Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and analyzed.  
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline over the treatment 
period in observer -reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis 
(α=0.0 125, 1 -sided).  The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score (indexed by 
observe r-reported scratching) will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis.  The 
comparison  of primary interest will be the treatment difference s over the last 5 months of the treatment 
period estimated by averaging the worst daily itch score means from five 14 day post -treatment intervals (Week 
7 to 8, Week 11  to 12, Week 15  to 16, Week 19  to 20, and Week  23 to 24).  The treatment difference at each of 
these post -treatment time intervals will also be estimated and analyzed.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the  dose groups and also across the primary and the main 
secondary endpoint to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel gate- keeping procedure will be used.  
Other s econdary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and safet y information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments will be performed for multipl e-dose 
comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product 
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the api cal sodiu m-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  Thi s transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids since it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals w ere found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.  In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the  
only findings were gastrointestinal (GI)  related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses . 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks .  A4250 reduced mean level s of serum bile acids  
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug , and most  adverse events  (AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Backgro und 
5.2.1 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10% to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in childre n and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the li ver [Jacquemin 2000].   The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also re ferred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis -1 (FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular 
membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer

 to inner leaflet of the plasma  membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also referred to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency.”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes, and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variatio ns in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by  a deficiency of the multidrug -resistance protein 3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid t ranslocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus  is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver  biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibro sis.  Serum biochemistry indicate s cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile 
acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase  (GGT ) activity 
(exception being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of 
portal hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -
Spraul 2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of  symptoms  is 
2 months, and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The 
life-threatening and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those 
not resorting  to surgery is 50% at 10 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  
Approximately half of PFIC patients undergo liver transplantation [ Davit -Spraul 2009]  and 
treatment -resistant pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external 
biliary diversion, mostly in PFIC Type 1 an d 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.  Currently, the treatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and  signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.   A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only viewed  as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have liver failure or per sistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Cl inical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail i s provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ( [IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals  seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition, no safety signals were seen in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies in  rats with up to 2 6 weeks  of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days  to 63 days . 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic  exposure in both humans and other 
species .  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome 
P450 ( CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µmol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies : a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a singl e-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  In total, 98 subjects  have been exposed to 
A4250. 
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg , the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (se rum fibroblast growth factor 1 9 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo.  A4250 was generally well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study  (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg  [14C]-A4250 ca psule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not related to A4250. T he 3 AEs experienced by 2 subjects  reported as related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea  (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg/day for 4 weeks .  Twenty 
patients  (8 females  and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 1 7 years  were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a second dose level.  N o

 treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs, including some increased 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment with A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s -BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients  (ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11 non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patient -reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during t reatment.  
The dose with the greatest improvement showed a mean decrease (±  standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results from this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study,  A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used  to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988].  Liver 
transplantation is typically used  as an option when patients have failed medical treatment 
and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus. By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achieves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity  of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transplantation. 
The doses selected, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re- entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in the PFIC subgroup was at 
30 µg/kg/day for both s-BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg /day; however, a clear dose relationship could not be 
established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3 study.  As efficacy was observed at both low and high doses, 40 µg/kg  and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the Int ernational 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

 Patients completing 2 4 weeks  of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-label treatment with A4250. 
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit  
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo -sponsored clinical studies: a double -blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. 
A total of 98 subjects/patients have been exposed to A4250.  Healthy subjects have been 
exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as part of a multiple -dose 
evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver d isease have been treated with up to 
0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4  weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; both were 
judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. 
Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile aci ds in the liver resulting in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby int errupting the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study 
showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diar rhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing.

A4250 in children with PFIC Types 1 and 2, as determined by the following : 
• The p roportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
concentration from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L 
compared to placebo after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• Change in pruritus compared to placebo over 24 weeks of treatment  
6.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum ALT  concentration  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical t reatment (biliary diversion or 
liver transplantation)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated daily doses of A4250 for 24 weeks

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomi zed, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg /kg/day  and 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically reviewed by an unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring B oard 
(DSMB).  
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow -Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µ g/kg/day  or 120 µ g/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
Patients who complete the Treatment Period and  Visit 9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72-week open- label extension  study (A4250-008; EudraCT Number 
2017-002325- 38, subject to a separate study approval ) in which all patients will receive  
active treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no improvement/intolerable 
symptoms , and has completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment  Period and End of 
Treatment (EOT) Visit, will also be offered the opportunity to enter Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study ( Figure  1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact , as follows: 
• Visit 1: Screening Period start . Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -35) 
• Visit 2: second Screening Visit ( Days -28 to -7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone Contact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit ( Day 28) 
• Visit 5: Clinic Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit 6: Clinic  Visit ( Day 84) 
• Visit 7: Clinic Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit 8: Clinic Visit (Day 154) 
• Visit 9: Clinic  Visit, EOT  (Day 168)

Final Amendment 0 2, 10 May 2018  
 • Visit 10: Follow-Up V isit, 28 days  after last dose of study drug  (Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow-up Visit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance, e.g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil screening requirements , and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  Aft er 
signing the ICF, patients will be considered enrolled and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily recording of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms befor e the study .  After 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re- screened 
after 2 months.  Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not 
allowed to re- screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observe r-reported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screen ing Period ( study Days  -56 to 0) , throughout the 24-w eek Treatment Period 
(study Days  0 to 168), and Follow-up (Day 196). 
The 14 consecutive days  prior to randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of the 
diary entrie s.  If a patient does not meet the minimum number of observations (see 
Section  9.2.2 for scoring and missing data definitions) to determine eligibility, the patient 
may be re -screened.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients  of all ages  will be recorded by a 
caregiver .  If possible, the same caregiver  will complete the Albireo ObsRO items throughout 
the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit 2) additional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit 3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports fr om the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, clinical genetic 
confirmation of diagnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  
visits.  Two weeks after Visit 3, there will be a telephone contact with the caregiver/patient  to 
evaluate any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new car egiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers will be requested to use the diary to report the time e ach 
dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period.

 The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A425 0-008) should they 
meet the required entry criteria .  If the patient is continuing into Study A4250-008 this will be 
the last visit in this study and the first visit in Study A425 0-008.  Visit 9/EOT  should also be 
performed at the time  patients are prematurely withdrawn from the study. 
Clinic Visit 10 will take place 2 8 days  after Visit 9 for all patients not continuing into S tudy 
A4250-008.

7.2.3 Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients /caregivers  will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their 
reasons.  
Any withdrawal , and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the  electronic case 
report form  (eCRF ) and source documents and the patient followed by the 
investigator/investigative s taff.  Even after the study is completed at the Follow-up Visit, the 
investigator /investigative staff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal , record any patient 
data they receive concerning SAEs, and all dru g-related no n-serious AEs, and subsequently 
report these to Albireo.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances: • A patient’s /caregiver’s  desire for withdrawal for any reason  
• Lost to follo w-up (every effort must be made to contact the patient /caregiver ; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• A worsening of the symp toms related to diarrhea occurs  
• Death  
• Patient /caregiver  estimation of lack of improvement/intolerable symptoms  
• A patient’s /caregiver’s substa ntial noncompliance (eDiary  and study drug compliance) or 
protoc ol violation  
• An i nvestigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the study is not appropriate.  The 
investigator may withdraw a patient at any time, if it is considered to be in the patient’s 
best interest  
A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no improvement/intolerable symptoms , and has 
completed at least 1 2 weeks  treatment in the double-blind study, will be offered th e 
opportunity to enter open- label Study A4250- 008.  A patient who withdraws from treatment 
prematurely and does  not enter Study A4250-008 will have  EOT  (Visit 9) assessments at the 
time of withdrawal and a follow-up assessment ( Visit 10) 2 8 days  following the last dose of 
study drug , and the patient will be re corded  as withdrawn.

 7.2.4 Study Termination by Sponsor  
This study may be termina ted at any time by Albireo if serious side effects should occur, if 
the investigator does not adhere to the protocol; or if, in the sponsor's judgment, there are no 
further benefits to be achieved from the study.  In this event, Albireo/designee will infor m the 
study investigators, institutions, and all regulatory authorities.  
Albireo may temporarily or permanently discontinue the study at an investigative site at any time for safety, ethical, compliance, or other reasons.  If this is necessary, Albireo wil l 
endeavor to provide advance notification to the site.  If a site or the study is suspended or discontinued, the investigator/investigative staff will be responsible for promptly informing the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  If required by local regu lations, Albireo/designee 
will be responsible for informing the IEC and the regulatory authority of study or site discontinuation.  In such an event, all study data and unused study drug must be returned to Albireo.

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different 
capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be ope ned 
• Capsule size 3 that should be swallowed intact .  These size 3 capsules may be opened 
only under exceptional circumstances, e.g., patient cannot swallow capsule intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsu le 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.  Bottles with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.   Refer to the investigat ional product manual. 
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µ g/kg/day , 120 µ g/kg/day , or placebo for 
24 weeks .  Study drug  will be dispensed to the patient  at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug .  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug , whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses,  and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed whole 
will be documented through the eDiary and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after  
laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowing the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water. 
For a patient unable to swallow capsule  intact , the capsule can be opened and the cont ents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce, or fruit 
purée.  The amount of food should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and 
should be followed by water.  
1. Hold the capsule over the prepared  food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée, or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of ca psules provided to the patient will  be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category  (identified in Table 2 ), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Label ing 
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in hig h-density polyethylene containers, with child-proof 
polypropylene caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength specified in 
Table 2 above will be manufactured. 
Packaging and labeling  will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers .  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15 °C and 25°C. 
Patients /caregivers  should be informed of appropriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature, between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo. 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by 
a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and 
allocated b y the  Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at Screening .  The randomization codes will be compute r-generated by

Final Amendment 02, 10 May 2018  
 Biostatistics, and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The 
randomization will be done in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) 
and age class ( 6 months to 5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ) to ensure approximate 
balance between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prepared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization. 
Patients who are eligible for randomi zation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization 
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who withdra w from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  
Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 acco rding to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once  a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the study 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized to.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured  by the study drug number. 
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study drug number corresponding to the randomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will 
not be displayed to end-u sers in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently r equired , i.e., only where knowledge of 
the study drug is required to adequately manage a life- threatening situation , the investigator 
at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS .  The responsibility to 
break the treatment code in emerg ency situations resides solely with the investigator.   The 
investigator should make every effort to discuss the rationale (status and outcome) for 
emergency unblinding with the sponsor Medical Monitor or the  Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible to revi ew the individual patient details . 
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS.  Emergency unblinding takes place in the IWRS via a dedicated emer gency unblinding module.  The system will 
require the user to enter their emergency unblinding, which is typically provided at the same time login credentials are distributed.   The exact description of the treatment assigned to the 
individual patient then will be accessible to the user.  Once the randomization code is broken 
for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures at EOT  should be performed.  As a follow -up, Visit  10 will be performed according to the time 
schedule.  Once a randomization code has been broken, the investigator must inform the 
 and sponsor Medical Monitor in writing within 24  hours.  In case of technical issues

contact telephone numbers for the  HelpDesk 24/7 system support. 
8.5 Patient  Compliance  
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance by routine review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both diary entr ies on a day  are missing , the study n urse will call the 
patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entries .  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents. 
Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, p atients 
will return a ll unused study drug  at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug , assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient , and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug  and to the s tudy patients . 
The investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were provided the quantities  specified in the protocol and that all study drug  
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy  and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator  will note a ll ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or chan ges in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medications (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sleep will be 
recorded.  
All medications taken by a patient within 3 months prior to the first intake of study drug  are 
regarded as prior medicatio n. 
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the study, are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendi x 1.

Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for a t least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during 
the treatment period and follow -up will be blinded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching , Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just befor e the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session during 
Visit 1. The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients < 8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 18 years  of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severi ty of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years  of age, the caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregiver s that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case the 
patient is confused or requires clarification about the meaning of a question.  The Albireo 
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep distur bance 
(morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratching and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each

 response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color 
code ( Appendix 2).  
A daily score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be calculated by selecting the 
maximum scratching severity score from the 2 ratings for each day.  A daily score will be considered missing if both of the daily assessments are missing.  A weekly  score will be 
calculated by averaging the daily scratching scores.  A weekly  score will be considered 
missing if ≥4 out of 7 days  a week of data are missing.  For baseline , a 14-day score will be 
calculated by averaging the 2 weekly scores prior to randomization and will be considered 
missing if one or both weekly scores for that 14- day period are missing.  For each treatment 
month, a 14- day score will be calculated by averaging the 2 last weekly scores and will be 
considered missing if both weekly scores for that 14- day period are missing.  The same 
approach will be used to calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.   The handling of 
missing data is described in  Section 11.2.2.2. 
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as height ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight ( kg) / height (m)
2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to a standard  growth curve  (Z-score, SD 
from P50). 
9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be asked to complete  a QoL  questionnaire  (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4.  
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and PK Samples  
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  >10 kg.  Blood for A4250 PK assessment will only be drawn at Visits 4 
and 9 (only for children with body weight  >10  kg), and as close to the onset of an SAE as 
possible , should an SAE occur .  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory 
per instructions in the l aboratory manual.  
9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomization and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years  of age .  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin) + 4.36 ( if 
patient < 1 year: scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the patient's first 
birthday continue to include the value assigned for age ( <1 year) until the patient reaches the 
age of 2 4 months) + 6.67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 SD ]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin) + 11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43

 Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine values greater than 
4.0 mg /dL (equivalent to 353.6 µmol/L)will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score. 
9.2.7 Fibroscan® 
Where available, Fibroscan® will be performed as per institution standard practice at Visits 3 and 9. 
9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and Fib -4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 10
9/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST  in U/L ) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Impression of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age) , caregivers, and clinicians will complete  the P GIC and the P GIS 
measures  (Appendix 3) at randomization  (Visit 3 ; PGIS only), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9) . 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug .  The PGIS items assess itch 
(patient  version), scratching (caregiver and clinician versions), and sleep (all versions) in the 
past week.  Caregivers and clinicians will complete the PGIC and PGIS for all patients; those  
patients ≥8 years  of age will complete the patient version .

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table 1  
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo.  
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
vitamins  A and E, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and INR ) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefore be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled (ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exam ination  findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not 
limited to, events causing withdrawal from the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
Page 47
 A4250 – IND 130591

Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential    
Final Amendment 02, 10 May 2018  
 development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, non-serious AE. 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE:  
• The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results  in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator  will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in 
Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet 
serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE. 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medical judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, 
temporal relationship to the study drug , and de-c hallenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows .

Final Amendment 02, 10 May 2018  
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused t he event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient  
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrel ated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug  
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whethe r each untoward event is a clinically 
significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10) or 28 days  after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs o r SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information  for any 
patient with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

Final Amendment 02, 10 May 2018  
 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on  
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as 
an AE and the ass ociated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if 
an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has 
signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit 10), and 28 days  after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.     
Report of a SAE must include at least the following  information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date  
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset 
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious 
• The rel ationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared  and the information collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain furth er 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any 
request for follo w-up information or answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same 
timelines as for initial reports.

 The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE and follow-up to the Albireo medical monitor 
for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 28 days  after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE form should be completed including the main and 
contributory causes of death. 
All SAE reports must be e-mailed to the following e-mail address within 24 hours : 
 
 
If email is unavailable,  SAEs may be transmitted via fax to the following number: 
 
In a stud y-related medical emergency situation, when the assigned medical monitors for the 
study cannot be reached by a caller, an on call physician can be reached 2 4 hours per day, 
7 days  per week, via the  call center.  The following number is a chargeable telephone 
number allowing a global reach from both landlines and mobile phones and the internet page 
indicated below contains  a list of countr y-specific toll-fr ee telephone numbers that is 
provided.  It should be noted that not all countries globally have access to tol l-free numbers 
as indicated o n the “24/7 Medical Help desk” index.  Countries without tol l-free numbers 
need to dial the chargeable number as indic ated below .  Furthermore, tol l-free numbers might 
not be available from mobile phones. 
 
 
10.1.4 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that occurs in a patient , 
the nature or severity of which is not expected per  the applicable product information (e.g., 
the IB for an unauthorized investigational product or summary of product characteristics for 
an authorized product).   
Reporting and tracking of SUSARs will be in accordance to all applicable competent 
authority regulations.  The Ethics Committee and all investigators involved in this study will 
be informed according to national and international requirements. 
10.2 Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Physical Examinations and Other Safety 
Assessments  
10.2.1 Laboratory Assessments 
Samples will be collected for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing at the

 Blood for AFP will be drawn at Visits  3 and 9.  F at-soluble vitamin  level s including vitamins 
A and E, and 25- hydroxy vitamin D will be drawn at Visit 2  (vitamins A & E  only) , 
Visit 3 (25- hydroxy vitamin D  only), Visit 6, and Visit 9.  Blood for INR (surrogate for 
vitamin K) will be draw n at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  Patients will fast (water intake only is 
permissible) for at least 4  hours prior to the collection of samples for vitamin A.  Exceptions 
can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 4 hours.  If a patient 
has any vitamin level(s) that are outside of the reference range, vitamin supplementation 
adjustments may be required.  Target ranges and supplementation strategy guidelines can be 
found in Appendix 5. 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit 1 and Visit 9 if the patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study . A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the confi rmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see 
Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be p rocessed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the 
laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples  may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

 10.2.2 Individual Patient Safety Monitoring  
10.2.2.1 Liver Monitoring  
Strategies to monitor markers of liver dise ase throughout the study are outlined below where 
the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and gender.  
If isolated transaminase elevations are observed, defined as:  
1. Normal bilirubin AND absence of clinical hepatitis symptoms AND  
• ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 
800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR) within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met:  
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations  
2. Transaminase elevations alone (ALT or AST >10  × ULN or 5  × baseline or absolute 
threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first) in presence of normal LDH and CPK 
3. Total bilirubin increased, unrelated to hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count) or established genetic diseases, such as Gilbert’s syndrome 
a. Doubling if total bilirubin was <3 mg/d L (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >3 mg/d L (equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) if total bilirubin was ≥3 mg/d L 
(equivalent to 51.3 µmol/L) at baseline  
4. INR increase refractory to vitamin K administration  
a. INR >1.5 if INR was normal at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >0.4 if INR was abnormal at baseline 
5. Any increase in total bilirubin and transaminases if accompanied by EITHER a symptom 
of clinical hepatitis (e.g., vomiting, nausea, right upper quadrant pain) OR immunological 
reaction (rash or >5% eosinophilia)

 Then: 
a) Interrupt study medication  
b) Initiate drug -induced liver injury work -up for alte rnative etiologies  
c) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin) and PT  or INR within 
48 to 72 hours 
d) Monitor the patient using close observation f ound in Section  10.2.2.2 
e) If a patient lives in a remote area, they may be tested locally and the results 
communicated to the investigator site promptly  
10.2.2.2 Close Observation 
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  Frequency of re -testing can decrease to once a week or l ess if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases 
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medicat ions and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets   
• Consider ruling out  alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, 
and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non- alcoholic s teatohepatitis ; 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct bilirubin) 
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re -challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, etc.).  
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged .

 If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration 
requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances, fever (≥38
C) and/o
r the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days.  
If there is
 gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrh ea re -occurs within 1 week after the re- challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outl ined in Section 10.2.2.5. 
10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuati on of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug , the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized. 
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF 
at Visit 1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit 1.  This includes date of 
diagnosis of PFIC, prior investigational medications for PFIC, historical (3  months prior to 
Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surg ery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
For previous confirmatory clinical genetic testing  results  for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 performed 
prior to Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be 
verified  to determine eligibility.  
If the historical clinical genetic result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable, clinical 
genetic analysis to confirm pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes 
will be performed and verified to determine eligibility.   No other diagnostic genetic testing 
will be offered.

 10.2.5 Physical Examination 
A phy sician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography  of skin lesions due to scratching , at Visits  1, 3, 
6, and 9.  A skin exam ination  will be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table 1).  
A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound  
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will 
be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of >3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 24 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-adverse-e ffect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 mo nth toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in 
a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immed iately and not later than within 2 4 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study  and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient.  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled  
in the study after the end of dosing , the patient will continue in the study per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE .  However , if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug , the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form

 immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Albireo /Safety Manager  (please refer to 
Section 10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as possible, details of the period of gestation at 
the time of exposure must be given. 
The pregnancy should be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous termination, 
details of birth, and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or newborn or 
maternal complication.  The infant who was exposed in- utero will be followed for up to 
2 years after delivery.   Individual cases with an abnormal outcome in association with the 
study drug should be reported on an expedited basis, i.e., reported rapidly to a competent 
authority.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period an d until major protocol violations have been 
identified.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW , the primary analysis will relate to the bile acid responder endpoint (at 
the 1-sided 1.25% level) .  For the US , the primary analysis will relate to the pruritus endpoint 
(at the 1-sided 1.25% level).   The aim is to enroll 60 to 70 patients in order to get at least 
60 evaluable patients.  
Assuming 60% responders (patients experiencing at least 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
concentration  or reaching ≤ 70 µ mol/L) in the A4250 dose group and 10% responders in the 
placebo group, approximately 20 patients per group are required to achieve a power of 84% 
with a 1.25% 1-sided Type-1 error. 
For pruritus, w ith approximately 20 patients  per treatment gr oup, the power is 83% given an 
assumed t reatment effect difference of -1.0 in change from baseline (-1.6 for A4250 
and -0.6 for placebo) on the Albireo ObsRO scratching score with a SD of 0.95 and a  Type I 
error of 1.25% (1-sided). 
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received  at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no majo r protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patient s to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study.

 11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses 
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of 
A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 
and 2. 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at 
least a 70% reduction in fasting s- BA concentration  or reaching a level ≤70 µ mol/L at the end 
of treatment), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α = 0.0125, 
1-sided). 
The test will be performed at a T ype I error rate of ≤0.0125 1-s ided, as described above, 
based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean probability scale. To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint to a 1 -sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate-keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the total significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between th e dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% (1- sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (here the pruritus endpoint).  If the previous step was not successful, the  analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the procedure 
reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using the 
Bonferroni Holm procedure.  The multiple comparison procedure is presented in  Figure 2. 
Figure 2 Bonferroni Holm Multiple Comparison Procedure 
 
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline 
over the Treatment Period  in observe r-reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested 
against the alternative hypo thesis (α=0.0125, 1-s ided).

based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean change from week 7 to 
week 24 (i.e., the average of five 14 day post- treatment intervals ). 
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint to a one -sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate-keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the total significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between the dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% (1 -sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (here the bile acid responder endpoint).  If the previous step 
was not successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the 
procedure reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using 
the Bonferroni Holm procedure. 
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple dose comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.  
A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before study data are locked and unblinded.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter prior to the first intake of study treatment.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data 
For efficacy variables, with repeated measures, a mixed  model will be employed with no 
additional imputation for missing values, i.e., based on “ observed cases”, except where 
otherwise specified.   All patients with at least one measurement of change from baseline will 
be included and contribute to the analysis .  The mixed model will handle the missing data, 
but assumes Missing At Random. 
Analyses to investigate the influence of missing values, for example, by using pattern mixture 
models using multiple imputations and tipping point analysis will be made and det ailed in the 
SAP. The sensitivity analyses addressing the robustness of results to missing data, will consider different approaches imputing data based on Missing Not At Random. Any additional sensitivity analysis that may be done using other data imputation will also be 
described in the SAP. 
Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment will be made as 
far as possible.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteri stics (including medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.

 Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the safety analysis 
set. 
11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable):  
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study/withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)  
Additionally, patients enrolled , included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region.  
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables 
The responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will be analy zed in terms of the 
proportion of patients achieving the event of interest.  Patients in need of rescue therapy, i .e., 
biliary diversion will be classified as no n-responders after the biliary diversion.  
Generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) will be used with a logistic link, to allow for 
repeated  assessments over time.  The model will include baseline value, treatment group, 
PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group  interaction.  The treatment by 
visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included in the model as a random effect.  The contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment 
differences at Week  24; also, the difference at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will 
be estimated and analyzed.  An unstructured covariance matri x will be used to model the 
within-s ubject error.  Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure 
fails to converge.   Model diagnostics checks will be made to ensure appropriate fit.  
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score  (indexed by 
observer- reported scratching)  will be analyzed  using a mixed model repeated m easures 
(MMRM) analysis.  The comparison of primary interest will be treatment difference s over the 
last 5 months of the Treatment Period 
estimated by averaging the worst daily itch score 
means from five 14 day post -treatment intervals (Week s 7 to 8, Week s 11 to 12, Weeks 15 to 
16, Weeks 19 to 20, and Weeks 23 to 24).   The treatment difference at each of these 
post- treatment time intervals will also  be analyzed.  Baseline pruritus score  will be included 
as covariate.  The model will include  baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, 
region, time, and time*treatment group interaction.  The treatment by time interaction will 
remain in the mo del regardless of significance.  There will be six time  points defined by the 
last 14 days interval each month (i.e., Week s 3 to 4, Week s 7 to 8, Week s 11 to 12, Weeks 15 
to 16, Weeks 19 to 20, and Weeks 23 to 24), but the first of the six time  points (W eeks 3 to 4) 
will not be part of the primary efficacy analysis.   Region will be included in the model as a 
random effect and will be defined on country level.  An unstructured covariance matrix will

 be used to model the withi n-subject error.   Another covaria nce structure may be chosen if the 
fit of this structure fails to converge. 
Non-parametric approach may be considered if more appropriate.  
The primary analyses will be based on the FAS.  
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis, the followi ng analyses will be 
performed:  
• Primary efficacy analysis using the PP set  
• Analyses to investigate the influence of missing values, for example , by using pattern 
mixture models and tipping point analysis 
Subgroup analyses will also be performed for each of  the 3 age groups ( 6 months to 5 years , 
6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ) and for patients who were not included in the previous 
Study A4250-003. Several sensitivity analyses will be performed, such as  the following: 
• The change from baseline in pruritus morning diary scores and evening diary scores, 
respectively, will also be analyzed using the MMRM approach.  
• Cochran Mantel Haenzsel test stratified on PFIC class to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment  in the two A4250 dose groups 
to placebo group.  Dropouts will be treated as non-responders 
• Based on the primary analysis including the interaction age class*treatment  
• Same as primary analysis in which the random factor region is considered as fixed factor.  
The region*treatment in teraction will also be explored  
• Same as primary analysis including  the interaction PFIC*treatment  
Other s ensitivity analyses may  be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
The change in the secondary and explorative endpoints such as s- BA, total bilirubin, ALT, 
growth and patient -reported itch severity  will also be analy zed using the MMRM model as 
specified for the primary analysis .  Nonparametric methods may be applied as an alternative 
approach for some endpoints , if appropriate. Change in growth (weight for age and BMI for 
age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations. 
Proportions of responders (e.g., meaningful reduction in itch severity and scratching at 
Week  24) will be analy zed using the GLMM model as specified for the primary analysis. 
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week  24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using analysis of covariance.  The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC class, age class, region, and treatment.

Kaplan -Meier curv es will be used when appropriate for time to event data. 
Other exploratory variables ( Global S ymptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters , PELD/MELD score, APRI 
score, and Fib-4 score) will  be analyzed descriptively for categorical and continuous data, as 
applicable.  For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analyzed in addition to the 
actual visit values.  For categorical data, shift tables or frequency and percentages of patients 
will be presented as appropriate.  
In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed for each of the 3 age classes  (6 months to 
5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ). 
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medi cation.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class  [SOC]  and MedDRA preferred term) will include  the 
following :  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs)  
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Drug-related TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation by SOC and preferred term 
• Treatmen t-emergent  SAEs by SOC and preferred term  
Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) class and World Health Organization ( WHO) preferred name.  
Summaries of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed post-baseline will be p resented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.   For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.

Exposure will be analy zed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The per centage compliance will be described by treatment group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.  
11.2.3 Blinded Analyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analy sis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder 
defin ition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this 
analysis; data will be collapsed across treatment groups . 
The analyses will in clude distribution- and ancho r-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distribution-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of measurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and Ob sRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will involve examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and symptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will b e included in a stand-a lone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items . 
11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent cli nical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically meet for the review of accumulating study data, 
including safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The 
DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping the study early  for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo 
Medical/  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical/  
if the study  requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own written standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be stored in the t rial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall imp lement and maintain quality control and quality assurance procedures 
with writte n standard operating procedures to ensure that the study is conducted and data are 
generated, documented , and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable r egulatory requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki ( October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulations (Code of Fe deral Regulations , Sections  312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IEC/IRB, 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient  or when the change(s) 
involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in the patient  having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patie nt non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative staff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) 
will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period  of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements, and must allow the CRA and A lbireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No 
information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  
Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the 
eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study -specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine 
the frequency  of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to 
conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding documentation. 
It is recommended that the investigator/investigative s taff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide a prompt response to queries .

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent E thics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall 
be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient  recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers , IB, available safety information, information about payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents request ed by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consent s and Assents 
The investigator  (physician) or investigative staff, in accordance with local regulation s, will 
explain to each patient  (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential 
risks and benefits involved, and any di scomfort that may occur .  Each care giver /patient will 
be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she or their child may 
withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her 
subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their children may experience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis .  Care givers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and tha t 
some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authorities .  The care giver (s)/patient should read and consider the statements before signing 
and dating them and should be given a copy of each signed document.  If written consent is 
not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement 
from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to sign the form .  No patient can enter the study before his/her or care giver (s) informed consent 
has been obtained, as required by country regulations. 
The ICF is part of the  protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/i nvestigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with 
regulatory requirements and country laws, and is considered appropriate for the study .  Any

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Dat a Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed eCRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient  visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify  the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start.  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is es sential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the 
eCRF will be the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as defined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact discs of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approvals and all related correspondence including approved documents;  
drug accountabilit y records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/investigative s taff must retain copies of these essential documents for the 
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements .  The 
investiga tor/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essential 
documents .  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

in Children with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  Types 1 and 2 (PEDFIC 1)  
Principal  Investigator: 
 
Study Centers:  
Up to 50 sites will be initiated for this study in the United States (US), C anada, Europe an Union  (EU) , Middle 
East,  and Australia.  
Publication(s): None.  
Planned Study Period:  
Q1 2018 to Q2 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 120 µ g/kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following : 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA ) 
concentration  from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• Change from baseline to Week  24 in pruritus compared to placebo  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated da ily doses of A4250 for 24 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µg/kg/day and 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in children with PFIC  (deficiencies of f amilial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 2 4-week Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per tr eatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit  3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µ g/kg/day or 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit  9 (Day 168) in this study will be 
invited  to participate  in a 72 -week open -label extension  study (A4250-008) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

and ≤18 years  at Visit  1 with a body weight above 5 kg 
2. Patient must have genetic confirmation of PFIC -1 or PFIC -2 through identification of biallelic 
pathogenic variants in either the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes  
3. Patient must h ave elevated s-BA con centration , specifically measured to be  ≥100 µmol/L, taken as the 
average of 2 samples 7 to 2 8 days apart (Visit s 1 and 2) prior to randomization  
4. Patient must have history of significant pruritus and a  caregiver-r eported observed scra tching in the 
electronic diary ( eDiary ) average  of ≥2 (on 0 to 4 scale) in the 2 week s prior to randomization  
5. Patient and/or legal guardian must sign informed consent (and assent) as appropriate.  Patients who 
turn 1 8 years  of age (or legal age per country) during the study will be required to r e-consent in order 
to remain in the study  
6. Patients are expected to have a consistent caregiver(s) for the duration of the study

24 weeks  
Variables  
Efficacy:   
Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoints are:  
• EU and rest of world ( RoW ): Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting 
s-BA concentration  from baseline to the end of t reatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µ mol/L compared to 
placebo  after 24 weeks of treatment . 
Fasting s-BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization and the previous 
visit (Clinic Visit 2) .  The end value is the average of the valu es at Weeks  22 and 24 after the start of 
doubl e-blind treatment.  
• US: Change in pruritus , as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, from baseline to 
Week  24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo observer -reported outcome ( ObsRO ) 
instru ment.  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment intervals will be calculated by 
averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in the interval . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Chan ge in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, from baseline 
to Week 24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo ObsRO instrument.  Scores for the 14 days  
baseline and post -treatment intervals will be calculated by averaging t he worst scratching scores from 
each day in the interval.  
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration  from 
baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to placebo  after 24 weeks of 
treatment .

Statistical Methods: 
The primary objective of this study is to  show superiority in efficacy of A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 
40 µg/kg/day) compared to placebo  in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2 . 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at least a 70% 
reduction in fasting s-BA concentration  or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end of treatment), the null 
hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α=0 .0125, 1-sided).  Generalized linear mixed 
modelling will be used with a logistic link, to allow for repeated assessments over time.  The model will include 
baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit and visit*treatment group interaction.  The 
contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the diff erence at Week  4, 
Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and analyzed. 
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to Week  24 in 
observer -reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested agains t the alternative hypothesis (α=0.0 125, 
1-sided).  The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score (indexed by observer-r eported 
scratching) will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis.  The contrasts of primary inter est 
will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the difference at the other weeks will be estimated and 
analyzed.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary and the main secondary endpoint to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel gate-keeping procedure will be used.  
Other s econdary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No ad justments will be performed for multiple-dose 
comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodiu m-dependent bi le acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This transporter, expresse d in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids since  it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke  2016] .  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in  preclinical safety and toxicity studies.   In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg or daily oral doses up to 3 mg/day for 7 days.  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gas trointestinal  (GI) related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses . 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral doses of 1 0 to 200 µg/kg/d ay for 4 weeks .  A4250 reduced mean levels of serum bile acids  
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was w ell tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug, and most  adverse events  (AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature . 
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Progressive Familia l Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10% to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children and 10 % to 15% of liv er transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected.  
The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].   The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used su b-classification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the  associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also referred to as “Byler dis ease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis -1 (FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular 
membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer

 to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also referred to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export p ump (BSEP) 
deficiency. ”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes, and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is caused by  a deficiency of the multidrug -resistan ce protein 3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion.  
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver  biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosis.  Serum biochemistr y indicate s cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile 
acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase activity (exception 
being MDR3 v ariants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of portal 
hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -Spraul 
2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 2 months , 
and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice  [Pawlikowska 2010] .  The life -threatening 
and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those not resorting  to 
surgery is 50% at 10 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  Appro ximately half of 
PFIC patients undergo liver transplantation  [Davit -Spraul 2009] and treatment -resistant 
pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external biliary diversion, 
mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.   Currently, the treatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as  nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.   A minority of patients respond nominally and  transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only 
viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have liver failure or per sistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Cl inical and Nonclinical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigato r’s Brochure ( [IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals  seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition , no safety signals were seen in repeat-d ose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 26 weeks  of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure  in both humans and other 
species .  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans  and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibiti on of cytochrome 
P450 ( CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D 6 (IC50: 16 µ mol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C 9 (IC50:1.2 µmol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored  clinical studies: a study in healthy 
voluntee rs evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a single-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigato r-sponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  In total, 98 subjects have been exposed to 
A4250. 
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to  healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 10 mg or daily oral doses up to 3 mg/day for 7 days.  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg, the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 19 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo.  A4250 was generally well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI -related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study  (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most wer e mild and not 
related to A4250.  The 3 AEs experienced by 2 subjects  reported as related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea  (2 AEs; 2 subjects ) and abdominal pain  (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus  (A4250-003) , A4250 was 
administered  as ora l daily doses of 0.01 to 0. 2 mg/kg for 4 weeks .  Twenty 
patients  (8 females  and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 1 7 years  were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re- enrolled into a s econd dose level.  No

 treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs, including some increased 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, once-daily treatment with A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s -BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients  (ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11  non-PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patient -reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during treatment.  
The dose with the gr eatest improvement showed a mean decrease (±  standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9  ±1.1 from baseline .  The results from this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250- 005) study design.  
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for  treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other orphan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acid s through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988] .  Liver 
transplantation is typically used as an option when patients have failed medical treatment 
and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or pe rsistent uncontrolled pruritus . 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achi eves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the hea lth and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transpla ntation.  
The doses selected, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re- entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in t he PFIC subgroup was at 
30 µg/kg/day for both s-BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30  µg/kg to 200 µg/kg; however, a clear dose relationship could not be 
established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3  study.  As efficacy was observed 
at both low and high doses, 40  µg/kg and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study .  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Council for  Harmonisatio n (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

 Patients completing 2 4 weeks  of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive ope n-label treatment with A4250.  
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit  
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo -sponsore d clinical studies: a double -blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC.  
A total of 98 subjects/patients have been exposed to A4250.  Healthy subjects have been 
exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3  mg daily as part of a multiple -dose 
evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated with up to  
0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; both were 
judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug.  
Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acids in the liver resulting in 
tissue  damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepatic 
circula tion of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be 
of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study 
showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s-BA concentrations  and pruritus in  such patients.  
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4  weeks daily treatment, only one patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did n ot recur on multiple dosing.

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomiz ed, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically reviewed by an unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB).  
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow -Up Period.  
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit  3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matching placebo.  
Patients who complete the Treatment Period and  Visit  9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72-week open -label extension  study (A4250-008) in which all 
patients will receive  active treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no 
improvement/intolerable symptoms , and has completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment 
Period and End of Treatment (EOT)  Visit , will also be offered the opportunity to enter 
Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments ( Table  1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  (Figure  1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact , as follows : 
• Visit  1: Screening Period start. Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to -35) 
• Visit  2: second Screening Visit  (Days -28 to -7) 
• Visit  3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone Contact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit  4: Clinic Visit ( Day 28) 
• Visit  5: Clinic Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit  6: Clinic  Visit  (Day 84) 
• Visit  7: Clinic Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit  8: Clinic Visit (Day 154)

Final Amendment 1.3 Canada 15 March 2018 
 • Visit  10: Follow -Up V isit, 28 days after last dose of study drug ( Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow -up V isit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance, e.g.,  due 
to AE monitoring , to fulfil  screening r equirements , and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After 
signing the ICF, patients will be considered enrolled and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily reco rding of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study .  After 
consultation with the Medical Monitor , patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re-screened 
after 2 months.   Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not 
allowed to re -screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observe r-reported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching  (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period (study Days  -56 to 0) and throughout the 24-w eek Treatment 
Period ( study Days  0 to 168). 
Only the 14 most recent days before randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of 
the diary entrie s.  Observe r-reported outcomes in patients  of all ages  will be recorded by a 
caregiver  (or caregiver’s designee) .  If possible, the same  caregiver  will complete the Albireo 
ObsRO items throughout  the study.  
At a second Screening Visit (Visit  2) additional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit  3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports f rom the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit  3, genetic confirmation of 
diagnosis,  and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  visits.  Two 
weeks after Visit  3, there will be a telephone contact with the caregiver/patient  to evaluate 
any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit  4, Visit  5, Visit  6, Visit  7, Visit  8, and Visit  9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during  the course 
of the trial , they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers/patients will be requested to use the diary to report the 
date and time each dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period.  
The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit  9.  At study Visit  9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A4250-008) should they 
meet the required entry criteria.  If the patient is continuin g into Study A4250-008 this will be

 7.2.3 Withdrawal of Patie nts 
Patients /caregivers  will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their 
reasons.  
Any withdrawal , and reasons for withdrawal,  must be ful ly documented in the  electronic case 
report form  (eCRF ) and source documents and the patient followed by the 
investigator/i nvestigative staff.  Even after the study is completed at the Follow -up V isit, the 
investigator/i nvestigative staff will , regardless of reason for withdrawal, record any patient 
data they receive concerning SAEs, and all dru g-related no n-serious AEs, and subsequently 
report these to Albireo .  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.  
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances:  
• A patient’s /caregiver’s  desir e for withdrawal for any reason  
• Lost to follow-up (every effort must be made to contact the patient /caregiver ; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• A wors ening of the symptoms related to diarrhea occurs  
• Death  
• Patient /caregiver  estimation of lack of improvement/intolerable symptoms  
• A patient’s /caregiver’s substa ntial non compliance (eDiary  and study drug compliance) or 
protocol violation  
• An investigator’s opi nion that continuing the patient in the study is not appropriate .  The 
investigator may withdraw a patient at any time, if it is considered to be in the pat ient’s 
best interest  
A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no improvement/intolerable symptoms , and has 
completed at least 1 2 weeks  treatment in the double-blind study, will be offered th e 
opportunity to enter open -label Study A4250- 008.  A patient who withdraws from treatment 
prematurely and will not enter Study A4250-008 will be requested to compl ete all visits and 
safety assessments per the current protocol (A425 0-005).  As a minimum, patients  will have  
EOT  (Visit  9) assessments at the time of withdrawal and a follow-up assessment ( Visit  10) 
28 days following the last dose of study drug, and the p atient will be re corded  as withdrawn.  
7.2.4 Study Termination by Sponsor  
This study may be terminated at any time by Albireo if serious side effects should occur, if the investigator does not adhere to the protocol; or if, in the sponsor's judgment, there are no  
further benefits to be achieved from the study.  In this event, Albireo/designee will inform the study investigators, institutions, and all regulatory authorities.

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different 
capsule sizes will be available, as follows : 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that can be opened or  swallowed intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight wil l also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.   Bottles with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.   Refer to the investigational product manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks .  Study drug will be dispensed to the patient  at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and t ake the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses,  doses, and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed 
whole will be documented thr ough the eDiary and transferred to the study database.  
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after 
laboratory samples are t aken.  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowing the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water.  
For a patient unable to swallow capsule intact , the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled  and mixed  in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce, or fruit 
purée.  The amount of food should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and should be followed by water.  
1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food  
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée, or yogurt)  
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to t he patient will  be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category  (identified in Table  2), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Label ing 
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in hig h-density polyethylene containers, with child -proof 
polypropylene caps .  Study drug capsu les containing A4250 i n the strength specified in 
Table  2 above will be manufactured.  
Packaging and labeling  will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.  
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers .  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15 °C and 25 °C. 
Patients /caregivers  should  be informed of ap propriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature, between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to Albireo and the study drug should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo.  
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and 
allocated by the Interact ive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at Screening .  The randomization codes will be computer-generated by

Final Amendment 1.3 Canada , 15 March  2018 
 Biostatistics, and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The 
randomization will be done in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) and age class ( 6 months  to 5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ) to ensure approximate 
balance between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prepared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patie nts become eligible for randomization.  
Patients who are eligible for randomiz ation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization 
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who wi thdra w from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 acco rding to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the study 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized to.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured  by the study drug number.  
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study drug number corresponding to the ra ndomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will not be displayed to en d-users in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code  
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently r equired , i.e., only where knowledge of 
the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situation, the investigator 
at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS .  The investigator should 
make every effort to discuss the rationale for emergency unblinding with the sponsor Medical Monitor or the  Medical Monitor prior to unblinding the individual patient.  
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency u nblinding functionality within the IWRS.  Emergency unblinding 
takes place in the IWRS via a dedicated emergency unblinding module.   The system will 
require the user to enter their emergency unblinding, which is typically provided at the same time login cr edentials are distributed.   The exact description of the treatment assigned to the 
individual patient then will be accessible to the user .  Once the randomization code is broken 
for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and  procedures at 
EOT  should be performed.  As a follow -up, Visit  10 will be performed according to the time 
schedule.  Once a randomization code has been broken, the investigator must inform the 
 and sponsor Medical Monitor in writing within 24  hours.

 8.5 Patient  Compliance 
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance by routine review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both  diary entr ies on a day  are missing  during, the study n urse will call the 
patient/ caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entrie s.  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, patients 
will return all unused study drug at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug, assess compliance , and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compli ance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient , and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients . 
The investigator will be responsible for  ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were provided the quantities  specified in the protocol and that all study drug 
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator will note all ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month  prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or changes in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medicat ions (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sleep will be 
recorded.  
All medications taken by a patient within 3 month s prior to the first intake of study drug are 
regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the f irst intake of study drug,  and which 
continue to be taken during the study, are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1 .

 9 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
9.1 Efficacy Endpoint s 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint s are as follows : 
• Europe an Union  (EU) and rest of the world  (RoW ): Proportion of patients 
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration  from baseline to 
the end of treatment or reaching  a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to pla cebo  after 24 
weeks of treatment.  
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization 
and the previous visit (Clinic Visit 2) .  The end value is the average of the values at 
Weeks 22 and 24 after the start of doubl e-blind treatment.  
• United States ( US): Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed 
scratching, from baseline to Week  24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument  (Appendix 2).  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment 
intervals will be calculated by averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in 
the interval . 
9.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include  the foll owing :  
• EU and RoW : Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed 
scratching, from baseline to Week 24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument  (Appendix 2).  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment 
intervals will be calculated by averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in the interval . 
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA 
concentration from baseline to the end  of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L 
compared to placebo  after 24 weeks of treatment.  
• All Regions:  
• All secondary en dpoints are compared to placebo . 
o Change from baseline to Week  24 in fasting s -BA 
o Change from baseline to Week  24 in serum ALT  concent ration  
o Change in growth from  baseline to Week 24, defined as the linear deficit 
(weight for age, and body mass index [BMI ]) compared to the national growth 
curves  (Z-score, standard deviation [SD] from P50)   
o Proportion of patients achieving meaningful reduction in caregiver-r eported 
observed scratching at Week  24

9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids  
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours  prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions ca n be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an additional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during 
the t reatment period and follow -up will be blinded.   Samples will be processed and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual . 
9.2.2 Itching , Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session during 
Visit  1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients < 8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in thi s age group.  Older patients , 8 to 17 years  of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tirednes s.  For patients 8 to 12 years  of age, the caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case  the 
patient is confused or requires clarification a bout the meaning of a question .  The Albireo 
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratching and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code ( Appendix  2).

Final Amendment 1.3 Canada , 15 March  2018 
 A daily score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be calculated by selecting the 
maximum scratching severity score from the 2 ratings for each day.  A daily score will be 
considered missing if both of the daily assessments are missing.  A 14-days score will be 
calculated by averaging the daily scratching scores.  A 14-days score will be considered 
missing if >4 out of 7 days a week of data are missing.  The same approach will be used to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.  
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale .  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to national growth curve s (Z-score, SD 
from P50) . 
9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be asked to complete  a QoL questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit  3 
and Visit  9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4. 
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and Other Laboratory Samples  
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  ≥10 kg.  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per 
instructions in the laboratory manual.  
9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomization and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years  of age .  For children 1 3 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin  in mg/dL ) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin in 
g/dL ) + 4.3 6 (if patient < 1 year: scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the 
patient's first birthday continue to include the value assigned for age (< 1 year) until the 
patient reaches the age of 2 4 months ) + 6.6 7 (if the patient has growth failure [≤ 2 SD]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score.  
MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine  in mg/dL ) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin  in mg/dL ) + 
11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43  
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine values greater than 
4.0 mg/dL will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score.  
9.2.7 Fibroscan® 
Where available, Fibroscan® will be performed as per institution  standard practice at Visits 3 
and 9.

 9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and Fib -4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST  in U/L ) / (Platele ts in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Impression of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age), caregivers, and clinicians will complete the P GIC and the PGIS 
measures  (Appendix 3) at randomization (Visit 3 ; PGIS only ), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9) . 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug.  The PGIS items assess itch 
(patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician versions), and sleep (all versions) in the 
past week.  Caregivers and clinicians will complete the PGIC and PGIS for all patients; those patients ≥8 years  of age will complete the patient version .

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table  1 
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo.  
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments:  
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
fat-soluble  vitamins A, D, a nd E) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs  
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1  Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefor e be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled 
(ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Sign ificance 
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patien t-reported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physica l exam ination  findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not 
limited to, events causing withdrawal f rom the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator .   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifica lly defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
 A4250 – IND 130591  
EudraCT 2017-002338-21 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 48 
Final Amendment 1.3 Canada , 15 March  2018 
 development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, no n-serious AE . 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE:  
• The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions  
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenita l anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires medical/surgical  intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but 
are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsi ons even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse.  
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess th e intensity of AEs based on the following definitions:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activiti es) 
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in Section 10.1.1.2 .  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE . 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assess ment 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medic al judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to the study drug, and d e-challenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows .

Final Amendment 1.3 Canada , 15 March  2018 
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related)  
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug  
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient  
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It 
should be noted that in some situations an A E will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness)  
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is r e-administered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrelated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient  
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug  
• The event d oes not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study 
drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is r e-administered  
10.1.2  Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward  event is a clinically 
significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and no n-serious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit  10) or 28 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Any AEs or SAEs that are  unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and 
recorded in the eCRF.  Albireo retains the right to request additional information for any patien t with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization , will be collected on 
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if 
an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be conside red the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3  Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit  10), and 28 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours  of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report form.     
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information:  
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth 
[as per local country requirements for data protection] ) 
• The last study drug administration date  
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief descripti on of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation)  
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious  
• The relationship of th e event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared and the information collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event.  
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain further 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any 
request for follo w-up information or answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same 
timelines as for initial reports.

for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 28 days after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE form should be completed including the main and 
contributor y causes of death . 
All SAE reports must be e-mailed to the following e-mail address within 24 hours : 
 
 
If email is unavailable, SAEs may be tr ansmitted via fax to the following number:

A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit  1 and Visit 9 if the  patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study . A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the 
confirmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional  safety blood samples may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

special diets   
• Rule out alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; 
autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non-alcoholic s teatohepatitis ; hypoxic/is chemic 
hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin) 
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultat ions.  
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re- challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug -induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepati c 
encephalopathy, etc.).  
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is 
identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor . 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re- challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5 .  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the 
following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration

 requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances,  fever 
(≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days.  
If there 
is gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrhea re- occurs within 1 week after the re- challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5 . 
10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug, the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized.  
10.2.3  Demographics/Medical a nd Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF 
at Visit  1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit  1.  This includes date of 
diagnosis of PFIC, prior investigational medications for PFIC, historical (3  months prior to 
Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4  Clinical Genetic Testing  
If confirmatory clinical genetic testing for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 has been performed prior to 
Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be verified 
by a central reader to determine eligibility.  
Regardless of previous genetic testing, a blood sample will be drawn at Visit  1 for all patients 
for DNA extract ion.  Genetic testing will only be performed on a patient’s extracted DNA if 
the previous clinical genetic  result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable.  In such cases, 
screening for pathologic biallelic variations in t he ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes will be 
performed if patient meets remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria and only after sponsor case review.  No other diagnostic genetic testing will be offered.  
10.2.5  Physical Examination  
A physician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation , including voluntary photography, at  Visits  1, 3, and 9.  A  skin exam ination  will 
be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table  1).

 A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.   
Skin will be examined  thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6  Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7  Abdominal Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence o f masses/nodules as well as spleen size will 
be recorded.  
10.2.8  Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology 
data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of > 3 mg/kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 2 4 hours  is defined as an overdose.   
The no-a dvers e-effect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg/kg/day) in 
the rat 1 month  toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg/day in 
a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (2 0 mg).  
The investigator/investigati ve staff  should immediately and not later than within 2 4 hours  of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely.  
10.2.9  Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing , 
the p atient will be immediately discontinued from the study  and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient .  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled 
in the study after the end of dosing , the patient will continue in the s tudy per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed.  
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE .  However , if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours  after recognition to Albireo /Safety Manager  (please refer to 
Section 10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as poss ible, details of the period of gestation at 
the time of exposure must be given.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified.  
All statistical a nalyses will be performed using SAS version  9.3 or higher.  
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW , the primary analysis will relate to the bile acid responder endpoint (at 
the 1-sided 1.25% level) .  For the US , the primary analysis will relate to the pru ritus endpoint 
(at the 1-sided 1.25% level).   The aim is to enroll 60 to 70 patients in order to get at least 
60 evaluable patients.  
Assuming 60% responders (patients experiencing at least 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
concentration or reaching ≤ 70 µmol/L) in the A4250 dose group and 10% responders in the 
placebo group, approximately 20  patients per group are requir ed to achieve a power of 84% 
with a 1.25% 1 -sided Type -1 error . 
For pruritus, w ith approximately 20 patients  per treatme nt gr oup, the power is 83% given an 
assumed t reatment effect difference of -1.0 in change from baseline (-1.6 for A4250 
and -0.6 for placebo) on the  Albireo ObsRO scratching score with a SD of 0.95 and a  Type I 
error of 1.25% (1-sided). 
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1  Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety analysis set will be t he primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received  at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized t o even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no majo r protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patient s to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of  the study.

 11.2.2  Methods of Statistical Analyses  
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of 
A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo  in patients with PFIC Types 1 
and 2 . 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at 
least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration  or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end 
of treatment), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α = 0.0 125, 
1-sided). 
The test will be performed at a T y p e  I  e r r o r  r a t e  o f  ≤ 0 . 0 125 1-s ided, as described above, 
based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean probability scale.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint  to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate- keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the total significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between th e dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (here the pruritus endpoint).  If the previous step was not 
successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the procedure 
reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using the 
Bonferroni Holm procedure.  The multiple comparison procedure is presented in Figure 2. 
Figure 2 Bonferroni Holm Multiple Comparison P rocedure  
 
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to 
Week  24 in observe r-reported scratch ing), the null hypothesis will be tested against the 
alternative hypo thesis (α =0.0125, 1-sided).

based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean change.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint to a one -sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate- keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the tota l significance level of 2.5%

for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (her e the bile acid responder endpoint) .  If the previous step 
was not successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the 
procedure reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using 
the Bonfe rroni Holm procedure.  
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple dose comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.  
A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before study data are locked and unblinded.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defin ed as the last assessment 
of that parameter on or prior to the first intake of study treatment date.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data  
For efficacy variables, with repeated measures, a mixed model will be employed with no 
additional imputation for missing values, i .e., based o n “observed cases”, except where 
otherwise specified.  
Follo w-up and continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made.  These data will be included in the sensitivity analysis  for primary endpoints  
estimating a treatment effect taking loss of effect after discontinuation into account.  Because  
complete follo w-up of all patients discontinuing treatment may not be possible, a method to 
replace missing data for patients who di scontinue the study will be pre specified (in the SAP) 
taking into account loss of effect after discontinuation (for example multiple imputation).  
No other replacement of missing values will be planned.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline c haracteristics (including medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the safety analysis 
set.

 11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following wil l be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable):  
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent)  
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study/withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)  
Additionally, patients  enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region.  
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables  
The responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will be analy zed in terms of the 
proportion of pat ients achieving the event of interest.  Patients in need of rescue therapy, i .e., 
biliary diversion will be classified as no n-responders after the biliary diversion.  
Generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) will be used with a logistic link, to allow for  
repeated assessments over time.  The model will include baseline value, treatment group, 
PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group interaction.  The treatment by 
visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included 
in the model as a random effect.  The contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24; also, the difference at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will 
be estimated and analyzed.  An unstructured covarian ce matrix will be used to model the 
withi n-subject error.  Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure 
fails to converge.   Model diagnostics checks will be made to ensure appropriate fit . 
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score  (indexed by 
observer -reported scratching)  will be analyzed  using a mixed model repeated m easures 
(MMRM) analysis.  The contrast of primary interest will be treatment difference at Week  24 
but also the difference s at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and 
analyzed.  Baseline pruritus score  will be included as covariate.  The model will include  
baseline value,  treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group 
interaction.  The treat ment by visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of 
significance.  Region will be included in the model as a random effect and will be defined on country level.   An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the withi n-subject 
error.   Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure fails to 
converge.  
Non-parametric approach may be considered if more appropriate.  
The primary analyses will be based on the FAS.  
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy anal ysis, the following analyses will be 
performed:

 • Primary efficacy analysis using the PP set  
• Analyses to investigate the influence of missing values, for example , by using pattern 
mixture models and tipping point analysis  
Subgroup analyses will also be perf ormed for each of the 3 age groups ( 6 months  to 5 years , 
6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ) and for patients who were not included in the previous 
Study A4250-003. 
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed, such as  the following : 
• Cochran Mantel Haenzsel test stratified on PFIC class to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid r esponder endpoint at the end of treatment  in the two A4250 dose groups 
to placebo group .  Dropouts will be treated as non- responders  
• Based on the primary analysis including the interaction age class*treatment  
• Same as primary analysis in which the random fa ctor region is considered as fixed factor.  
The region*treatment interaction will also be explored  
• Same as primary analysis including  the interaction PFIC*treatment   
Other s ensitivity analyses may be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of  Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
The change in the secondary and explorative endpoints such as s-BA, total bilirubin, ALT,  
growth and patient -reported itch severity  will also be analy zed using the MMRM model as 
specified for the primary analys is.  Nonparametric methods may be applied as an alternative 
approach for some endpoints , if appropriate.  Change in growth (weight for age and BMI for 
age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations.  
Proportions of responders (e.g., meaningful red uction in itch severity and scratching at 
Week  24) will be analy zed using the GLMM model as specified for the primary analysis.  
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week  24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using analysis of co variance.  The model will include terms for 
baseline, PFIC class, age class, region, and treatment.  
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or listed for  liver transplant,  all-cause mortality,  
and liver decompensation events will mainly be analyzed by us ing descriptive statistics.  
Kaplan -Meier curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data.  
Other exploratory variables ( Global Symptom R elief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters , PELD /MELD score, APRI 
score, and Fib -4 score) will be analyzed descriptively for categorical and continuous data, as 
applicable.  For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analyzed in addition to the 
actual visit values.  For categorical data, shift tables or frequency and percentages of patients 
will be presented as appropriate.

 In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed for each of the 3 age classes  (6 months  to 
5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ). 
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables  
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests (h ematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis) , and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class  [SOC]  and MedDRA preferred term) will include  the 
following :  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TE AEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs)  
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Drug-related TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation by SOC and preferred term 
• Treatmen t-emergent  SAEs by SOC and preferred term  
Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) class and World Health Organi zation ( WHO ) preferred name.  
Summaries of vital signs wi ll be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed pos t-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laborat ory data will be presented.   For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS 
values observed pos t-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analyz ed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatm ent group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120% , and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.

 11.2.3  Blinded Analyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus score s.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this analysis; data will be collapsed across treatment groups . 
The analyses will include distribution - and ancho r-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distributio n-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of measurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Ancho r-based analyses will involv e examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and symptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will be included in a stan d-alone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items . 
11.2.4  Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A DSMB consisting of sponso r-independent clinical and statistical experts will be 
establis hed.  The DSMB will periodically meet for the review of accumulating study data, 
including safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver values .  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the stu dy (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The 
DSMB may recommend continuing  with the study as planned or stopping the study early  for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo Medical/  who are res ponsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and 
taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical/  
if the study  requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional eva luations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own written standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the t rial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the 
study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB 
statistician will have access to these data.

representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative s taff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) 
will v isit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of 
entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period  of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements,  and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No 
information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  
Albireo monitoring standa rds require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of 
primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the 
eCRFs and wil l verify source data according to the study -specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine 
the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to 
conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding 
documentation.  
It is recommended that the investigator/i nvestigative staff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide  a prompt response to queries .

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board 
Prior to the start of the s tudy, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall 
be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient  recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written informa tion to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers , IB, available safety information, information about payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requ ested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent authority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consent s and Assents 
The investigator/ investigative staff will explain to each patient  (or legally authorized 
representative) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur .  Each caregiver /patient will be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary and that he/s he or their child may withdraw from the study at any time and that 
withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their children may exp erience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo .  As 
with other medications, people treated with A425 0 may be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis .  Care givers /patients will  be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, wri tten in no n-technical 
language in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authorities .  The caregiver /patient should read and consider the statements before signing and 
dating them and should be given a copy of each signed docu ment .  If written consent is not 
possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from 
one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to sign 
the form .  No patient can enter the study before his/her or caregiver  informed consent has 
been obtained.  
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/i nvestigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval .  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with 
regulatory  requirements and is considered appropriate for the study .  Any changes to the ICF

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed eCRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient  visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the spec ific 
instructions given .  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start .  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports.  
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France , the 
eCRF will be  the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as defined by IC H GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact disc s of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approvals and all  related corresponden ce including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/i nvestigative staff must retain copies of these essential documents for the 
period specif ied by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements .  The 
investigator/i nvestigative staff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essential 
documents .  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

Planned Study Period:  
Q1 2018 to Q2 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following: 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA) 
concentration  from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• Change from baseline to Week  24 in pruritus compared to placebo  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration  
• To ev aluate the effect of A4250 on growth 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated dail y doses of A4250 for 2 4 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a double-b lind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in children with PFIC  (deficiencies of f amilial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 2 4-week Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per tr eatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit  3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 4 0 µg/kg/day or 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit  9 (Day 168)  in this study will be 
invited  to participate  in a 72 -week open -label extension  study (A425 0-008) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

pathogenic variants in either the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes  
3. Patient must h ave elevated s-BA concentration , specifically measured to be ≥100 µ mol/L, taken as the 
average of 2 samples 7 to 28 days apart ( Visit s 1 and 2) prior to randomization  
4. Patient must have history of significant pruritus and a  caregiver-r eported observed scratching in the 
electronic diary ( eDiary ) average of ≥2 ( on 0 to 4 scale) in the 2 week s prior to randomization  
5. Patient and/or legal guardian must sign informed consent (and assent) as appropriate.  Patients who 
turn 1 8 years  of age (or legal age per country ) during the study will be required to r e-consent in order 
to remain in the study  
6. Patients are expected to have a consistent caregiver(s) for the duration of the study

Variables  
Efficacy:   
Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoints are:  
• EU and rest of world ( RoW ): Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting 
s-BA concentration  from b aseline to the end of t reatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µ mol/L compared to 
placebo  after 24 weeks of treatment . 
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization and the previous 
visit (Clinic Visit 2) .  The end value is the average of the values at Weeks  22 and 24 after the start of 
double-b lind treatment.  
• US: Change in pruritus , as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, from baseline to 
Week  24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo observer -reported outcome ( ObsRO ) 
instru ment.  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment intervals will be calculated by 
averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in the interval . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Chan ge in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, from baseline 
to Week 24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo ObsRO instrument.  Scores for the 14 days  
baseline and post -treatment intervals will be calculated by averaging t he worst scratching scores from 
each day in the interval.  
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration  from 
baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to placebo  after 24 weeks of 
treatment .

Statistical Methods:  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of A425 0 (120 µg/kg/day and 
40 µg/kg/day) compared to placebo  in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2 . 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at least a 70% 
reduction in fasting s-BA concentration  or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end of treatment), the null 
hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α =0.0125, 1-sided).  Generalized linear mixed 
modelling will be used with a logistic link, to allow for repea ted assessments over time.  The model will include 
baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit and visit*treatment group interaction.  The 
contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the diff erence at Week  4, 
Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and analyzed.  
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to Week  24 in 
observer -reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested agains t the alternative hypothesis (α=0.0 125, 
1-sided).  The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score (indexed by observe r-reported 
scratching) will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis.  The contrasts of primary inter est 
will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the difference at the other weeks will be estimated and 
analyzed.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary and the main 
secondary endpoint to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel gate- keeping procedure will be used.  
Other s econdary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments will be performed for multipl e-dose 
comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bi le acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids since  it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.   In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg/day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gas trointestinal (GI)  related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks.  A4250 reduced mean levels of serum bile acids 
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug, and most  adverse events ( AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Progressive Familia l Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10 % to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. 
The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].  The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also refe rred to as “Byler dis ease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis-1 ( FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular 
membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer

 to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also refer red to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency. ”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes, and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene a re associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by a deficiency of the multidrug- resistance protein  3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase critical for  
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosis.  Serum biochemistry indicate s cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile 
acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase  activity (exception 
being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of portal 
hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit-Spraul 
2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 2 months, 
and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The life -threatening 
and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those not resorting  to 
surgery is 50% at 1 0 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  Approximately half of 
PFIC patients undergo liver transplantation  [Davit -Spraul 2009] and treatment -resistant 
pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external biliary diversion, 
mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.  Currently, the treatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.  A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only 
viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Clinical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ([ IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition , no safety signals were seen in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 2 6 weeks of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure in both humans and other 
species.  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µ mol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: a study in healthy 
voluntee rs evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a singl e-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  In total, 98 subjects have been exposed to 
A4250. 
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 1 0 mg or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg, the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 19 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to pla cebo. A4250 was generally well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not 
related to A4250. T he 3 AEs  experienced by 2 subjects reported a s related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 0.01 to 0.2 mg /kg for 4 weeks.  Twenty 
patients  (8 females and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 17 years were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a second dose level.  No

 treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs, including some increased 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment with A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s- BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients ( ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11  non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patient- reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during treatment.  
The dose with the gr eatest improvement showed a mean decrease (± standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results from this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for  treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acid s through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988].  Liver 
transplantation is typically used as an option when patients have failed medical treatment 
and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus . 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achi eves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transpla ntation. 
The doses selected, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re -entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in the PFIC subgroup was at 
30 µg/kg/day for both s-BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg; however, a clear dose relationship could not be 
established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3  study.  As efficacy was observed 
at both low and high doses, 40 µg/kg  and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

 Patients completing 2 4 weeks of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-label treatment with A4250. 
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit 
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo -sponsore d clinical studies: a double -blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. 
A total of 98  subjects/patients have been exposed to A4250.  Healthy subjects have been 
exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as part of a multiple -dose 
evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated with up to  
0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; both were 
judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acids in the liver resulting in 
tissue  damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepatic 
circula tion of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be 
of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing.

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomi zed, placebo-c ontrolled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically reviewed by an unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB).  
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow-Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited to participate in a 72-week open- label extension  study (A4250-008) in which all 
patients will receive  active treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no 
improvement/intolerable symptoms , and has completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment 
Period and End of Treatment (EOT) Visit, will also be offered the opportunity to enter 
Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments ( Table  1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study ( Figure  1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact, as follows: • Visit 1: Screening Period start. Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -35) 
• Visit 2: second Screening Visit ( Days -28 to - 7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone C ontact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit (Day  28) 
• Visit 5: Clinic Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit 6: Clinic  Visit  (Day 84) 
• Visit 7: Clinic Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit 8: Clinic Visit (Day 154) 
• Visit 9: Clinic  Visit, EOT  (Day 168)

 • Visit 10: Follow -Up V isit, 28 days a fter last dose of study drug ( Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow-up V isit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance, e.g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil screening r equirements, and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After signing the ICF , patients will be considered enrolled and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily reco rding of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study.  After 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re-screened 
after 2 months.  Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not 
allowed to re -screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observer-r eported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period (study Days  -56 to 0) and throughout the 24-w eek Treatment 
Period (study Days  0 to 168). 
Only the 14 most recent days before randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of 
the diary entrie s.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients  of all ages will be recorded by a 
caregiver  (or caregiver’s designee) .  If possible, the same caregiver  will complete the Albireo 
ObsRO items throughout the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit  2) additional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit  3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports f rom the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, genetic confirmation of 
diagnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  visits.  Two 
weeks after Visit 3, there will be a telephone contac t with the caregiver/patient to evaluate 
any AEs. 
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit  4, Visit 5, Visit  6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers/patients will be requested to use the diary to report the 
date and time each dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period. 
The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A4250-008) should they 
meet the required entry criteria.  If the patient is continuin g into Study A4250-008 this will be

 7.2.3 Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients/caregivers  will be informed that they have the right to withdraw fro m the study at 
any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their 
reasons.  
Any withdrawal, and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the  electronic case 
report form  (eCRF ) and source documents and the patient followed by the 
investigator/investigative s taff.  Even after the study is completed at the Follow-up V isit, the 
investigator/investigative s taff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal , record any patient 
data they receive concerning SAEs, and all drug-r elated no n-serious AEs, and subsequently 
report these to Albireo .  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.  
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances: 
• A patient’s /caregiver’s desir e for withdrawal for any reason 
• Lost to follo w-up (every effort must be made to contact the patient /caregiver ; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• A worsening of the symptoms related to diarrhea occurs  
• Death  
• Patient /caregiver  estimation of lack of improvement/intolerable symptoms 
• A patient’s /caregiver’s substa ntial noncompliance (eDiary  and study drug compliance) or 
protocol violation  
• An investigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the study is not appropriate.  The 
investigat or may withdraw a patient at any time, if it is considered to be in the pat ient’s 
best interest  
A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no improvement/intolerable symptoms, and has 
completed at least 1 2 weeks treatment in the double-blind study, will be  offered th e 
opportunity to enter open- label Study A4250- 008.  A patient who withdraws from treatment 
prematurely and will not enter Study A4250-008 will be requested to complete all visits and safety assessments per the current protocol (A425 0-005).  As a minimum, patients  will have  
EOT  (Visit 9) assessments at the time of withdrawal and a follow-up assessment ( Visit 10) 
28 days following the last dose of study drug, and the patient will be re corded  as withdrawn.  
7.2.4 Study Termination by Sponsor  
This study may be terminated at any time by Albireo if serious side effects should occur, if 
the investigator does not adhere to the protocol; or if, in the sponsor's judgment, there are no further benefits to be achieved from the study.  In this event, Albireo/designee  will inform the 
study investigators, institutions, and all regulatory authorities.

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identit y of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different 
capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that  can be opened 
• Capsule size 3 that can be opened or swallowed intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.  Bottles with 
34 capsul es will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.  Refer to the investigational product manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks.  Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses,  doses, and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed 
whole will be documented through the eDiary and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in t he morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after 
laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowing the cap sule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water.  
For a patient unable to swallow capsule intact, the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce , or fru it 
purée.  The amount of food should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and 
should be followed by water.  
1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content  with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée , or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to the patient will  be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s w eight has shifted to another weight category (identified in Table  2), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Trea tment Packaging and Labeling  
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in hig h-density polyethylene containers, with child- proof 
polypropylene caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength specified in 
Table  2 above will be manufactured. 
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in thei r original containers .  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C and 25°C. 
Patients/caregivers  should be informed of appropriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature , between 1 5°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo. 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by 
a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and 
allocated by the  Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at Screening.  The randomization codes will be compute r-generated by  

 A4250 – IND 130591

Confidential   Page 40 
Final Amendment 1.2 Fr, UK 15 March 2018 
 Biostatistics, and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The 
randomization will be done in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) and age class ( 6 months to 5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years) to ensure approximate 
balance between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prepared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization.  
Patients who are eligible for randomiz ation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization 
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who wi thdraw from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  
Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 according to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once  a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the study 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized t o.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured by the study drug number. 
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign  a study drug number corresponding to the randomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will 
not be displayed to end-u sers in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently required, i.e., only where knowledge of 
the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situation, the investigator 
at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS . The responsi bility to 
break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator . The 
investigator should make every effort to discuss the rationale (status and outcome) for 
emergency unblinding with the sponsor Medical Monitor or the  M edical Monitor as 
soon as possible to review the individual patient details. 
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS.  Emergency unblinding 
takes place in the IWRS via a dedicated emergency unblinding module.  The system will 
require the user to enter their emergency unblinding, which is typically provided at the same time login credentials are distributed.   The exact description of the treatmen t assigned to the 
individual patient then will be accessible  to the user.  Once the randomization code is broken 
for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures at EOT  should be performed.  As a follow -up, Visit  10 will be performed according to the time 
schedule.  Once a randomization code has been broken, the investigator must inform the 
 and sponsor Medical Monitor in writing within 24  hours.

 8.5 Patient  Compliance  
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance b y routine review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both  diary entr ies on a day  are missing  during, the study nurse will call the 
patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entries.  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, patients 
will return all unused study drug at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug, assess complian ce, and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accounta bility  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient, and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These r ecords shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients. 
The investigator  will be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were provided the quantities specified in the protocol and that all study drug 
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy  and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator will note a ll ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or changes in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medications (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sleep will be 
recorded.  
All medications taken by a patient within 3 month s prior to the first intake of study drug are 
regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the study , are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1.

 9 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
9.1 Efficacy Endpoint s 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint s are as follows: 
• Europe an Union ( EU) and rest of the world  (RoW ): Proportion of patients 
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration from baseline to 
the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to pla cebo  after 24 
weeks of treatment. 
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization 
and the previous visit (Clinic Visit 2).  The end value is the average of the values at 
Weeks 22 and 24 after the start of double-b lind treatment.  
• United States (US ): Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed 
scratching, from baseline to Week  24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument  (Appendix 2).  Scores for the 14 days  baseline an d post -treatment 
intervals will be calculated by averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in 
the interval. 
9.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed 
scratching, from baseline to Week 24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument  (Appendix 2).  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment 
intervals will be calculated by averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in 
the interval. 
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA 
concentration  from baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 µ mol/L 
compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment.  
• All Regions: 
• All secondary endpoints are compared to placebo. 
o Change from baseline to Week  24 in fasting s- BA 
o Change from baseline to Week  24 in serum ALT  concentration 
o Change in growth from  baseline to Week 24, defined as the linear deficit 
(weight for age, and body mass index [BMI ]) compared to the national growth 
curves (Z -score, standard deviation [SD] from P50)  
o Proportion of patients achieving meaningful reduction in caregive r-reported 
observed scratching at Week  24

9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids 
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will  be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during 
the treatment period and follow -up will be blinded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a c entral laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching, Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session during 
Visit 1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO  items.  Patients <8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 17 years of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years of age, the caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case the 
patient is confused or requires clarification a bout the meaning of a question.  The Albireo  
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance 
(morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratching and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales,  where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code ( Appendix 2).

 A daily score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be calculated by selecting the 
maxi mum scratching severity score from the 2 ratings for each day.  A daily score will be 
considered missing if both of the daily assessments are missing.  A 14-days score will be 
calculated by averaging the daily scratching scores.  A 14-days score will be co nsidered 
missing if >4 out of 7 days a week of data are missing.  The same approach will be used to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.  
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to national growth curves  (Z-score, SD 
from P50). 
9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be  asked to complete a QoL questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4. 9.2.5 Biomarkers  and Other Laboratory Samples 
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  ≥10 kg.  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per 
instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomization and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years of age.  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin  in mg/dL) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin in 
g/dL ) + 4.36 ( if patient < 1 year : scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the 
patient's first birthday continue to include the value assigned for age (< 1 year ) until the 
patient reaches the age of 2 4 months) + 6.67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 SD ]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. 
MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine  in mg/dL) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin in mg/dL ) + 
11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43 
Laboratory values less t han 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine values greater than 
4.0 mg/dL will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score. 
9.2.7 Fibroscan

APRI score and Fib -4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST in U/L) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Impression of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age), caregivers, and clinicians will complete the P GIC and the PGIS 
measures ( Appendix 3) at randomization (Visit 3; PGIS only ), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9). 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug.  The PGIS items assess itch 
(patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician versions), and sleep (all versions) in the 
past week.  Caregivers and clinicians will complete the PGIC and PGIS for all patients; those  
patients ≥8 years of age will complete the patient version .

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table  1 
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo. 
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
fat-soluble vitamins  A, D, a nd E) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefor e be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled 
(ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physica l exam ination findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not 
limited to, events causing withdrawal f rom the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
 A4250 – IND 130591  
EudraCT 2017-002338-21 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 48 
Final Amendment 1.2 Fr, UK 15 March 2018 
 development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, no n-serious AE . 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE: 
• The outcome of the AE is death 
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenita l anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires medical/surgical  intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but 
are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess th e intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activiti es) 
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE . 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medic al judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to the study drug, and d e-challenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows.

Final Amendment 1.2 Fr, UK 15 March 2018 
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the event; one o r more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It 
should be noted that in some situations an A E will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrelated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward  event is a clinically 
significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1  will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10)  or 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs or SAEs that are  unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information for any 
patien t with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

Final Amendment 1.2 Fr, UK 15 March 2018 
 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on 
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if 
an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion 
of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit  10), and 2 8 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.    
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date 
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief descripti on of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious  
• The relationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared and the inform ation collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain further 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any 
request for follo w-up information or answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same 
timelines as for initial reports.

A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit  1 and Visit 9 if the  patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study. A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the 
confirmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

 • ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR)  within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinas e (CPK ) and lac tate dehydrogenase ( LDH) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met:  
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations  
2. Transaminase elevations alone (ALT or AST >10  × ULN or 5  × baseline or absolute 
threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first) in presence of normal LDH and CPK 
3. Cholestatic marker elevations ( alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] or ga mma -glutamyl 
transferase >2 × baseline) without alternative explanation  
4. Total bilirubin increased, unrelated to hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count) or established genetic diseases, such as Gilbert’s syndrome  
a. Doubling if total bilirubin was <3 mg/dL at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >3 mg/dL if total bilirubin was ≥3 mg/dL at baseline  
5. INR increase refractory to vitamin K administration  
a. Increase by >1. 5 if INR was normal at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >0.4 if INR was abnormal at baseline  
6. Any increase in total bilirubin and transaminases if accomp anied by EITHER a symptom 
of clinical hepatitis (e.g., vomiting, nausea, right upper quadrant pain) OR immunological reaction (rash or >5% eosinophilia) 
Then: 
a) Interrupt study medication 
b) Initiate drug- induced liver injury  work -up for alternative etiologies 
c) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP) and PT  or INR

 d) Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
e) If a patient lives in a remote area, they may be tested locally and the results 
communicated to the investigator site promptly  
10.2.2.2 Close Observation 
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  Frequency of re -testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases  
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medications and 
herba l and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets   
• Rule out alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; 
autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ; hypoxic/is chemic 
hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease 
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin)  
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re- challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepati c 
encephalopathy, etc.). 
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is 
identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the 
following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration

 requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances,  fever 
(≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days. 
If there
 is gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrhea re- occurs within 1 wee k after the re -challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5. 10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug, the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized.  
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical a nd Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF 
at Visit  1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit  1.  This includes date of 
diagnosis of PFIC, prior investigational medications for PFIC, historical (3  months prior to 
Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
If confirmatory clinical genetic testing for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 has been performed prior to 
Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be verified 
by a central reader to determine eligibility.  
Regardless of previous genetic testing, a blood sample will be drawn at Visit  1 for all patients 
for DNA extract ion.  Genetic testing will only be performed on a patient’s extracted DNA if 
the previous clinical genetic  result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable.  In such cases, 
screening for pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes will be 
performed if patient meets remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria and only after sponsor 
case review.  No other diagnostic genetic testing will be offered.  
10.2.5 Physical Examination  
A physician or suitably trained qualified  assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography, at  Visits  1, 3, and 9.  A  skin exam ination will 
be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table  1).

 A complete phys ical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will 
be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of > 3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 2 4 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-advers e-effect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 month toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in 
a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 
10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study  and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient.  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled 
in the study after the end of dosing, the patient will continue in the s tudy per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE.  However, if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Albireo /Safety Manager  (please refer to 
Section 10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as possible, details of the period of gestation at 
the time of exposure must be given.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified. 
All statistical a nalyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW , the primary analysis will relate to the bile acid responder endpoint (at 
the 1-s ided 1.25% level) .  For the US , the primary analysis will relate to the pru ritus endpoint 
(at the 1-sided 1.25% level).   The aim is to enroll 60 to 70 patients in order to get at least 
60 evaluable patients.  
Assuming 60% responders (patients experiencing at least 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
concentration  or reaching ≤70 µ mol/L) in the A4250 dose group and 10% responders in the 
placebo group, approximately 20 patients per group are required to achieve a power of 84% 
with a 1.25% 1-sided Type-1 error. 
For pruritus, w ith approximately 20 patients  per treatme nt gr oup, the power is 83% given an 
assumed treatment effect difference of -1.0 in change from baseline (-1.6 for A4250 
and -0.6 for placebo) on the Albireo ObsRO scratching score with a SD of 0.95 and a  Type I 
error of 1.25% (1-sided). 
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no majo r protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study.

 11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses  
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of 
A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 
and 2. 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at 
least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end 
of treatment), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α = 0.0125, 
1-sided) . 
The test will be performed at a T ype I error rate of ≤0.0 125 1-sided, as described above, 
based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean probability scale.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose  groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint  to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate- keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the total significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between th e dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (here the pruritus endpoint).  If the previous step was not 
successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the procedure 
reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using the 
Bonferroni Holm procedure.  The multiple comparison procedure is presented in Figure 2. 
Figure 2 Bonferroni Holm Multiple Comparison P rocedure 
 
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to Week  24 in observe r-reported scratch ing), the null hypothesis will be tested against the 
alternative hypothesis (α =0.0125, 1-sided).

 The test will be performed at a Type I error rate of ≤0.0 125 1-s ided, as described above, 
based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean change. 
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint to a one -sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate- keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the tota l significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between the dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (her e the bile acid responder endpoint) .  If the previous step 
was not successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the 
procedure reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using 
the Bonfe rroni Holm procedure.  
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple dose comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.  
A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before study data are locked and unblinded.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter on or prior to the first intake of study treatment date.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data  
For efficacy variables, with repeated measures, a mixed model will be employed with no 
additional imputation for missing values, i .e., based o n “observed cases”, except where 
otherwise specified.  
Follo w-up and continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made.  These data will be included in the sensitivity analysis for primary endpoints  
estimating a treat ment effect taking loss of effect after discontinuation into account.  Because  
complete follo w-up of all patients discontinuing treatment may not be possible, a method to 
replace missing data for patients who di scontinue the study will be prespecified (in the SAP) 
taking into account loss of effect after discontinuation (for example multiple imputation).  
No other replacement of missing values will be planned.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the safety analysis 
set.

Final Amendment 1.2 Fr, UK 15 March 2018 
 11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable): 
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study/withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)  
Additionally, patients  enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region. 11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables  
The responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will be analy zed in terms of the 
proportion of patients achieving the event of interest.  Patients in need of rescue therapy, i .e., 
biliary diversion will be classified as no n-responders after the biliary diversion.  
Generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) will be used with a logistic link, to allow for 
repeated assessments over time.  The model will include baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group  interaction.  The treatment by 
visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included 
in the model as a random effect.  The contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24; also, the difference at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will 
be estimated and analyzed.  An unstructured covarian ce matrix will be used to model the 
within-s ubject error.  Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure 
fails to converge.   Model diagnostics checks will be made to ensure appropriate fit.  
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score  (indexed by 
observer- reported scratching) will be analyzed  using a mixed model repeated m easures 
(MMRM) analysis.  The contrast of primary interest will be treatment difference at Week  24 
but also the difference s at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and 
analyzed.  Baseline pruritus score  will be included as covariate.  The model will include  
baseline value,  treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group 
interaction.  The treatment by visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included in the model as a random effect and will be defined on country level.  An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within-subject 
error.   Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure fails to 
converge. 
Non-parametric approach may be considered if more appropriate. 
The primary analyses will be based on the FAS.  
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy anal ysis, the following analyses will be 
performed:

Final Amendment 1.2 Fr, UK 15 March 2018 
 • Primary efficacy analysis using the PP set  
• Analyses to investigate the influence of missing values, for example , by using pattern 
mixture models and tipping point analysis  
Subgroup analyses will also be performed for each of the 3 age groups ( 6 months to 5 years, 
6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years) and for patients who were not included in the previous 
Study A4250-003. 
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed, such as the following: 
• Cochran Mantel Haenzsel test stratified on PFIC class to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment  in the two A4250 dose groups 
to placebo group.  Dropouts will be treated as non -responders  
• Based on the primary analysis including the interaction age class*treatment  
• Same as primary analysis in which the random factor region is considered as fixed factor.  The region*treatment in teraction will also be explored  
• Same as primary analysis including the interaction PFIC*treatment  
Other s ensitivity analyses may  be performed and will be detailed in the SAP. 
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
The change in the secondary and explorative endpoints such as s- BA, total bilirubin, ALT, 
growth and patient -reported itch severity  will also be analy zed using the MMRM model as 
specified for the primary analys is.  Nonparametric methods may be applied as an alternative 
approach for some endpoints, if appropriate.  Change in growth (weight for age and BMI for 
age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations. 
Proportions of responders (e.g., meaningful reduction in itch severity and scratching at 
Week  24) will be analy zed using the GLMM model as specified for the primary analysis.  
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week  24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using analysis of covariance.  The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC class, age class, region, and treatment.  
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or listed for liver transplant,  all-cause mortality,  
and liver decompensation events will mainly be analyzed by us ing descriptive statistics.  
Kaplan -Meier curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data.  
Other exploratory variables (Global S ymptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters, PELD /MELD score, APRI 
score, and Fib-4 score) will be analyzed descriptively for categorical and continuous data, as applicable.  For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analyzed in addition to the 
actual visit values.  For categorical data, shif t tables or frequency and percentages of patients 
will be presented as appropriate.

 In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed for each of the 3 age classes (6 months to 
5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years).  
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests (h ematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class [SOC] and MedDRA preferred term) will include  the 
following:  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TE AEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs)  
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term 
• Drug-related TEAEs by SOC and preferred term 
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation by SOC and preferred term  
• Treatmen t-emergent SAEs by SOC and preferred term 
Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC) class and World Health Organization ( WHO ) preferred name.  
Summaries of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.  For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analyz ed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatm ent group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the safety analysis set.

 11.2.3 Blinded A nalyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this analysis; data will be collapsed across treatment groups. 
The analyses will include distribution - and anchor-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distributio n-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of measurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will involv e examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and symptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will be included in a stan d-alone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items . 
11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically meet for the review of accumulating study data, 
including safety (AE and laboratory data) and liver values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The 
DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping the study early for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo 
Medical/  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and 
taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical/  if the study requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional eva luations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own written standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the trial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the 
study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB 
statistician will have access to these data.

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall implement and maintain quality control and qualit y assurance procedures 
with writte n standard operating procedures to ensure that the study is conducted and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be co nducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations , Sections 312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP  135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment having been established and approved by an appropriate IEC/IRB, except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate hazards to the patient  or when the change(s) involve(s) only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in the patient  having to be 
withdrawn from the study and render that patient non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative s taff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) 
will v isit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of 
entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements,  and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study- related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No 
information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  
Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of 
primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the 
eCRFs and wil l verify source data according to the study- specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine 
the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to 
conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding 
documentation. 
It is recommended that the investigator/investigative s taff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide  a prompt response to queries .

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the s tudy, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall 
be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers, IB, available safety information, information about payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requ ested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents and Assents  
The investigator/investigative s taff will explain to each patient  (or legally authorized 
representative) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur.  Each caregiver /patient will be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary and that he/she or their child may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. 
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their children may exp erience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  Care givers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that 
some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authorities .  The caregiver /patient should read and consider the statements before signing and 
dating them and should be given a copy of each signed docu ment .  If written consent is not 
possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to sign 
the form.  No patient can enter the st udy before his/her or care giver  informed consent has 
been obtained. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/i nvestigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with 
regulatory  requirements and is considered appropriate for the study.  Any changes to the ICF

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed e CRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start .  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the 
eCRF will be  the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as defined by IC H GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact discs of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approvals and all  related corresponden ce including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/i nvestigative staff must retain copies of these essential documents for the 
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essential 
documents.  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

Planned Study Period:  
Q1 2018 to Q2 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following: 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA) 
concentration  from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• Change from baseline to Week  24 in pruritus compared to placebo  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration  
• To ev aluate the effect of A4250 on growth 
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated dail y doses of A4250 for 2 4 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a double-b lind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in children with PFIC  (deficiencies of f amilial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 2 4-week Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per tr eatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit  3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 4 0 µg/kg/day or 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit  9 (Day 168)  in this study will be 
invited  to participate  in a 72 -week open -label extension  study (A425 0-008) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

pathogenic variants in either the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes  
3. Patient must h ave elevated s-BA concentration , specifically measured to be ≥100 µ mol/L, taken as the 
average of 2 samples 7 to 28 days apart ( Visit s 1 and 2) prior to randomization  
4. Patient must have history of significant pruritus and a  caregiver-r eported observed scratching in the 
electronic diary ( eDiary ) average of ≥2 ( on 0 to 4 scale) in the 2 week s prior to randomization  
5. Patient and/or legal guardian must sign informed consent (and assent) as appropriate.  Patients who 
turn 1 8 years  of age (or legal age per country ) during the study will be required to r e-consent in order 
to remain in the study  
6. Patients are expected to have a consistent caregiver(s) for the duration of the study

Variables  
Efficacy:   
Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoints are:  
• EU and rest of world ( RoW ): Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting 
s-BA concentration  from b aseline to the end of t reatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µ mol/L compared to 
placebo  after 24 weeks of treatment . 
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization and the previous 
visit (Clinic Visit 2) .  The end value is the average of the values at Weeks  22 and 24 after the start of 
double-b lind treatment.  
• US: Change in pruritus , as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, from baseline to 
Week  24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo observer -reported outcome ( ObsRO ) 
instru ment.  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment intervals will be calculated by 
averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in the interval . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Chan ge in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, from baseline 
to Week 24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo ObsRO instrument.  Scores for the 14 days  
baseline and post -treatment intervals will be calculated by averaging t he worst scratching scores from 
each day in the interval.  
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration  from 
baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to placebo  after 24 weeks of 
treatment .

reduction in fasting s-BA concentration  or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end of treatment), the null 
hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α =0.0125, 1-sided).  Generalized linear mixed 
modelling will be used with a logistic link, to allow for repea ted assessments over time.  The model will include 
baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit and visit*treatment group interaction.  The 
contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the diff erence at Week  4, 
Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and analyzed.  
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to Week  24 in 
observer -reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested agains t the alternative hypothesis (α=0.0 125, 
1-sided).  The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score (indexed by observe r-reported 
scratching) will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis.  The contrasts of primary inter est 
will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the difference at the other weeks will be estimated and 
analyzed.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary and the main 
secondary endpoint to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel gate- keeping procedure will be used.  
Other s econdary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments will be performed for multipl e-dose 
comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transpor ter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids since  it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is ora lly administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.   In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg/day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gastrointestinal (G I) related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks.  A4250 reduced mean levels of serum bile acids 
(s-BA) in all coh orts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug, and most  adverse events ( AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10 % to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. 
The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].  The classificati on of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also refe rred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis-1 ( FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular 
membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer

 to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1 gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also refer red to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
defic iency.”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes, and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene are associated wi th 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by a deficiency of the multidrug- resistance protein  3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase critical for 
phospholipid se cretion.  
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients wi th other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosis.  Serum biochemistry indicate s chol estasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile 
acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase  activity (exception 
being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal [ Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of portal 
hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit-Spraul 
2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 2 months, 
and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The life -threatening 
and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those not resorting  to 
surgery is 50% at 1 0 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  Approximately half of  
PFIC patients undergo liver transplantation  [Davit -Spraul 2009] and treatment -resistant 
pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external biliary diversion, 
mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and de bilitating.   Currently, the treatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.  A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only 
viewed as an option when patients have failed medic al treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Clinical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ([IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition , no safety signals were seen in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 2 6 weeks of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure in both humans and other 
species.  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome  
P450 (CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µ mol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a singl e-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patien ts with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  In total, 98 subjects have been exposed to 
A4250. 
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 1 0 mg or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg, the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 19 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo. A4250 was general ly well 
tolerated.  The only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were no quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not 
related to A4250. T he 3 AEs  experienced by 2 subjects reported a s related to study drug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 0.01 to 0.2 mg /kg for 4 weeks.  Twenty 
patients  (8 females and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 17 years were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a second dose level.  No

transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment with A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s- BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients ( ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s- BA in the 11  non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patient- reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during treatment.  
The dose with the greatest improvement show ed a mean decrease (± standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results from this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988].  Liver 
transplantation is typically used as an option when patients have failed medical treatment 
and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus . 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achieves a substantial redu ction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of pa tients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transplantation. 
The doses selected, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re -entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements i n s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in the PFIC subgroup was at  
30 µg/kg/day for both s-BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg; however, a clear dose relationship could not be 
established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3 study.  As efficacy was observed 
at both low and high doses, 40 µg/kg  and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on G ood Clinical Practice (GCP).

 Patients completing 2 4 weeks of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-label treatment with A4250. 
5.3.1 Risk/Benefit 
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo -sponsored clinical studies: a d ouble- blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. 
A total of 98  subjects/p atients have been exposed to A4250.  Healthy subjects have been 
exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as part of a multiple -dose 
evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated with up to 
0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/ kg/day) for 4 weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; both were 
judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. 
Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acids in the liver resulting in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be 
of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based o n the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  
However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple do sing.

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomi zed, placebo-c ontrolled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically reviewed by an unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB).  
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow-Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited to participate in a 72-week open- label extension  study (A4250-008, EudraCT Number 
017-002325- 38, subject to a separate study approval ) in which all patients will receive  active 
treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no improvement/intolerable 
symptoms , and has completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment Period and End of 
Treatment (EOT)  Visit, will also be offe red the opportunity to enter Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments ( Table  1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study ( Figure  1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact, as follows: 
• Visit 1: Screening Period start. Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -35) 
• Visit 2: second Screening Visit ( Days -28 to - 7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone C ontact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit (Day  28) 
• Visit 5: Clinic Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit 6: Clinic  Visit  (Day 84) 
• Visit 7: Clinic Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit 8: Clinic Visit (Day 154)

Final Amendment 1.1 Swe , 01 March 2018 
 • Visit 10: Follow -Up V isit, 28 days after last dose of study drug ( Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow-up V isit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance, e.g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil screening requirements, and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After signing the ICF , patients will be considered enrolled an d evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily recording of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study.  After 
consultation with the Medical Monitor , patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re -screened 
after 2 months.  Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not 
allowed to re -screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observer-r eported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period (study Days  -56 to 0) and throughout the 24-w eek Treatment 
Period (study Days  0 to 168). 
Only the 14 most recent days before randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of 
the diary entrie s.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients  of all ages will be recorded by a 
caregiver  (or caregiver’s de signee).  If possible, the same caregiver  will complete the Albireo 
ObsRO items throughout the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit  2) additional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit  3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports f rom the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, genetic confirmation of 
diagnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  visits.  Two 
weeks af ter Visit 3, there will be a telephone contact with the caregiver/patient to evaluate 
any AEs. 
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit  4, Visit 5, Visit  6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use 
the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers/patients will be requested to use the diary to report the 
date and time each dose of stu dy drug is administered during the Treatment Period. 
The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A4250-008) should they 
meet the required  entry criteria .  If the patient is continuing into Study A4250-008 this will be

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 7.2.3 Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients/caregivers  will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state t heir 
reasons.  
Any withdrawal, and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the  electronic case 
report form  (eCRF ) and source documents and the patient followed by the 
investigator/investigative s taff.  Even after the study is completed at the Follow -up V isit, the 
investigator/investigative s taff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal , record any patient 
data they receive concerning SAEs, and all dru g-related no n-serious AEs, and subsequently 
report these to Albireo .  Withdrawn patients will no t be replaced.  
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances: 
• A patient’s /caregiver’s desir e for withdrawal for any reason 
• Lost to follo w-up (every effort must be made to contact the patient /caregiver ; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• A worsening of the symptoms related to diarrhea occurs  
• Death  
• Patient /caregiver  estimation of lack of improvement/intolerable symptoms 
• A patient’s /caregiver’s substa ntial noncompliance (eDiary  and study drug compliance) or 
protocol violation  
• An investigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the study is not appropriate.  The 
investigator may withdraw a patient at any time, if it is considered to be in the pat ient’s 
best interest  
A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no improvement/intolerable symptoms, and has 
completed at least 1 2 weeks treatment in the double-blind study, will be offered th e 
opportunity to enter open- label Study A4250- 008.  A patient who withdraws from treatment 
prem aturely and will not enter Study A4250-008 will be requested to complete all visits and 
safety assessments per the current protocol (A425 0-005).  As a minimum, patients  will have  
EOT  (Visit 9) assessments at the time of withdrawal and a follow-up assessmen t (Visit 10) 
28 days following the last dose of study drug, and the patient will be re corded  as withdrawn.  
7.2.4 Study Termination by Sponsor  
This study may be terminated at any time by Albireo if serious side effects should occur, if 
the investigator does not adhere to the protocol; or if, in the sponsor's judgment, there are no 
further benefits to be achieved from the study.  In this event, Albireo/designee will inform the 
study investigators, institutions, and all regulatory authorities.

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different 
capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that can be opened or swallowed intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.  Bottles with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.  Refer to the investigational product manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks.  Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses,  doses, and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed 
whole will be documented through the eDiary and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after 
laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowing the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water.  
For a patient unable to swallow  capsule intact, the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce , or fruit 
purée.  The amount of food should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and 
should be followed by water.  
1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée , or yogurt) 
3. Administer the m ixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to the patient will  be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category  (identified in Table  2), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Label ing 
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in hig h-density polyethyle ne containers, with child -proof 
polypropylene caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength specified in 
Table  2 above will be manufactured. 
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.  
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers .  The storage facility at the investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C and 25°C. 
Patients/caregivers  should be informed of appropriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature , between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo. 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignmen t during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequen ce number.  This number will be created and 
allocated by the  Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at Screening .  The randomization codes will be compute r-generated by  

 A4250 – IND 130591

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 , and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The 
randomizati
on will be done in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) 
and age class ( 6 months to 5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years) to ensure approximate 
balance between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prepared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization.  
Patients who are eligible for randomiz ation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization 
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who wi thdra w from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  
Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 acco rding to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once  a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the study 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized to.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured  by the study drug number. 
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study drug number corresponding to the randomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will 
not be displayed to end-u sers in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently r equired , i.e., only where knowledge of 
the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situation, the investigator 
at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS .  The investigator should 
make every effort to discuss th e rationale for emergency unblinding with the sponsor Medical 
Monitor or the  Medical Monitor prior to unblinding the individual patient.  
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency u nblinding functionality within the IWRS.  Emergency unblinding 
takes place in the IWRS via a dedicated emergency unblinding module.  The system will 
require the user to enter their emergency unblinding, which is typically provided at the same time login credentials are distributed.   The exact description of the treatment assigned to the 
individual patient then will be accessible  to the user.  Once the randomization code is broken 
for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and  procedures at 
EOT  should be performed.  As a follow -up, Visit  10 will be performed according to the time 
schedule.  Once a randomization code has been broken, the investigator must inform the 
 and sponsor Medical Monitor in writing within 24 hours. In case of technical issues 
accessing the system online, please see the IWRS  site user manual for country specific 
contact telephone numbers to the  HelpDesk 24/7 system support.

 8.5 Patient  Compliance  
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance by routin e review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both  diary entr ies on a day  are missing  during, the study nurse will call the 
patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entries.  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, patients 
will return all unused study drug at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug, assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient, and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients. 
The investigator  will be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were pro vided the quantities specified in the protocol and that all study drug 
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy  and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator will note a ll ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or changes in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medications (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sleep will be 
recorded. 
All medications taken by a patient within 3 month s prior to the first intake of study drug are 
regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the stud y, are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1.

 9 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
9.1 Efficacy Endpoint s 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint s are as follows: 
• Europe an Union ( EU) and rest of the world  (RoW ): Proportion of patients 
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration from baseline to 
the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to pla cebo  after 24 
weeks of treatment.  
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization 
and the previous visit (Clinic Visit 2).  The end value is the average of the values at 
Weeks 22 and 24 after the start of double-b lind treatment.  
• United States (US ): Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed 
scratching, from baseline to Week  24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument  (Appendix 2).  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment 
intervals will be calculated by averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in 
the interval. 
9.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed 
scratching, from baseline to Week 24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo 
ObsRO instrument  (Appendix 2).  Scores for the 14 days  baseline and post -treatment 
intervals will be calculated by avera ging the worst scratching scores from each day in 
the interval. 
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA 
concentration  from baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 µ mol/L 
compared to placebo after 24  weeks of treatment.  
• All Regions: 
• All secondary endpoints are compared to placebo. 
o Change from baseline to Week  24 in fasting s- BA 
o Change from baseline to Week  24 in serum ALT  concentration 
o Change in growth from  baseline to Week 24, defined as the linear d eficit

9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids 
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will  be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during 
the treatment period and follow -up will be blinded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a c entral laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching, Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session during 
Visit 1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO  items.  Patients <8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 17 years of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years of age, the caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case the 
patient is confused or requires clarification a bout the meaning of a question.  The Albireo  
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance 
(morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratching and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales,  where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code ( Appendix 2).

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 A daily score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be calculated by selecting the 
maxi mum scratching severity score from the 2 ratings for each day.  A daily score will be 
considered missing if both of the daily assessments are missing.  A 14-days score will be 
calculated by averaging the daily scratching scores.  A 14-days score will be co nsidered 
missing if >4 out of 7 days a week of data are missing.  The same approach will be used to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.  
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to national growth curves  (Z-score, SD 
from P50). 
9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be  asked to complete a QoL questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4. 9.2.5 Biomarkers  and Other Laboratory Samples 
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  ≥10 kg.  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per 
instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomization and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years of age.  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin  in mg/dL) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin in 
g/dL ) + 4.36 ( if patient < 1 year : scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the 
patient's first birthday continue to include the value assigned for age (< 1 year ) until the 
patient reaches the age of 2 4 months) + 6.67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 SD ]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. 
MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine  in mg/dL) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin in mg/dL ) + 
11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43 
Laboratory values less t han 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine values greater than 
4.0 mg/dL will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score. 
9.2.7 Fibroscan
® 
Where available, Fibroscan® will be performed as per institution standard practice at Visits 3 
and 9.

 9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and Fib -4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST in U/L) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Impression of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age), caregivers, and clinicians will complete the P GIC and the PGIS 
measures ( Appendix 3) at randomization (Visit 3; PGIS only ), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9). 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug.  The PGIS items assess itch 
(patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician versions), and sleep (all versions) in the 
past week.  Caregivers and clinicians will complete the PGIC and PGIS for all patients; those  
patients ≥8 years of age will complete the patient version .

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table  1 
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo. 
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
fat-soluble vitamins  A, D, a nd E) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefor e be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled 
(ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physica l exam ination findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not 
limited to, events causing withdrawal f rom the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
 A4250 – IND 130591  
EudraCT 2017-002338-21 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 48 
Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, no n-serious AE . 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE: 
• The outcome of the AE is death 
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenita l anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires medical/surgical  intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but 
are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess th e intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activiti es) 
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE . 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medic al judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to the study drug, and d e-challenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows.

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the event; one o r more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It 
should be noted that in some situations an A E will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrelated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward  event is a clinically 
significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1  will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10)  or 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs or SAEs that are  unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information for any 
patien t with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on 
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information 
unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if 
an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion 
of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit  10), and 2 8 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.    
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date 
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief descripti on of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious  
• The relationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared and the inform ation collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain further 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any 
request for follo w-up information or answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same 
timelines as for initial reports.

 Blood for AFP will be drawn at Visits  3 and 9  and for fat -soluble vitamins at Visits 2, 3, 
and 9. 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit  1 and Visit 9 if the  patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study. A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the 
confirmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

 • ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR)  within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinas e (CPK ) and lac tate dehydrogenase ( LDH) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met:  
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations  
2. Transaminase elevations alone (ALT or AST >10  × ULN or 5  × baseline or absolute 
threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first) in presence of normal LDH and CPK 
3. Cholestatic marker elevations ( alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] or ga mma -glutamyl 
transferase >2 × baseline) without alternative explanation  
4. Total bilirubin increased, unrelated to hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count) or established genetic diseases, such as Gilbert’s syndrome  
a. Doubling if total bilirubin was <3 mg/dL at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >3 mg/dL if total bilirubin was ≥3 mg/dL at baseline  
5. INR increase refractory to vitamin K administration  
a. Increase by >1. 5 if INR was normal at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >0.4 if INR was abnormal at baseline  
6. Any increase in total bilirubin and transaminases if accomp anied by EITHER a symptom 
of clinical hepatitis (e.g., vomiting, nausea, right upper quadrant pain) OR immunological reaction (rash or >5% eosinophilia) 
Then: 
a) Interrupt study medication 
b) Initiate drug- induced liver injury  work -up for alternative etiologies

 d) Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
e) If a patient lives in a remote area, they may be tested locally and the results 
communicated to the investigator site promptly  
10.2.2.2 Close Observation 
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  Frequency of re -testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases  
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medications and 
herba l and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets   
• Rule out alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; 
autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ; hypoxic/is chemic 
hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease 
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin)  
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re- challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepati c 
encephalopathy, etc.). 
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is 
identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in 
Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the 
following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration

 requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances,  fever 
(≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea persists for 7 or more days. 
If there i
s gross blood in stool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrhea re- occurs within 1 wee k after the re -challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5. 10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug, the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized.  
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical a nd Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF 
at Visit  1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit  1.  This includes date of 
diagnosis of PFIC, prior investigational medications for PFIC, historical (3  months prior to 
Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   
If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
If confirmatory clinical genetic testing for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 has been performed prior to 
Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be verified 
by a central reader to determine eligibility.  
Regardless of previous genetic testing, a blood sample will be drawn at Visit  1 for all patients 
for DNA extract ion.  Genetic testing will only be performed on a patient’s extracted DNA if 
the previous clinical genetic  result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable.  In such cases, 
screening for pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes will be 
performed if patient meets remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria and only after sponsor 
case review.  No other diagnostic genetic testing will be offered.  
10.2.5 Physical Examination  
A physician or suitably trained qualified  assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography, at  Visits  1, 3, and 9.  A  skin exam ination will 
be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 (see Table  1).

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 A complete phys ical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will 
be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of > 3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 2 4 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-advers e-effect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 month toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in 
a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 
10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study  and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient.  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled 
in the study after the end of dosing, the patient will continue in the s tudy per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE.  However, if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Albireo /Safety Manager  (please refer to 
Section 10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as possible, details of the period of gestation at 
the time of exposure must be given.

 The pregnancy should be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous termination, 
details of birth, and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or newborn or maternal complication.  The infant who was exposed in- utero will be followed for up to 
2 years after delivery.   Individual cases with an abnormal outcome in association with the 
study drug should be reported on an expedited basis, i.e., reported rapidly to a competent 
authority.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified. 
All statistical a nalyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW , the primary analysis will relate to the bile acid responder endpoint (at 
the 1-s ided 1.25% level) .  For the US , the primary analysis will relate to the pru ritus endpoint 
(at the 1-sided 1.25% level).   The aim is to enroll 60 to 70 patients in order to get at least 
60 evaluable patients.  
Assuming 60% responders (patients experiencing at least 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
concentration  or reaching ≤70 µ mol/L) in the A4250 dose group and 10% responders in the 
placebo group, approximately 20 patients per group are required to achieve a power of 84% 
with a 1.25% 1-sided Type-1 error. 
For pruritus, w ith approximately 20 patients  per treatme nt gr oup, the power is 83% given an 
assumed treatment effect difference of -1.0 in change from baseline (-1.6 for A4250 
and -0.6 for placebo) on the Albireo ObsRO scratching score with a SD of 0.95 and a  Type I 
error of 1.25% (1-sided). 
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no majo r protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study.

 11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses  
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of 
A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 
and 2. 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at 
least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA concentration or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end 
of treatment), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α = 0.0125, 
1-sided) . 
The test will be performed at a T ype I error rate of ≤0.0 125 1-sided, as described above, 
based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean probability scale.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose  groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint  to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate- keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the total significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between th e dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (here the pruritus endpoint).  If the previous step was not 
successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the procedure 
reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using the 
Bonferroni Holm procedure.  The multiple comparison procedure is presented in Figure 2. 
Figure 2 Bonferroni Holm Multiple Comparison P rocedure 
 
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to Week  24 in observe r-reported scratch ing), the null hypothesis will be tested against the 
alternative hypothesis (α =0.0125, 1-sided).

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 The test will be performed at a Type I error rate of ≤0.0 125 1-s ided, as described above, 
based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean change. 
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint to a one -sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate- keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the tota l significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between the dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (her e the bile acid responder endpoint) .  If the previous step 
was not successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the 
procedure reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using 
the Bonfe rroni Holm procedure.  
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple dose comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.  
A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before study data are locked and unblinded.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter on or prior to the first intake of study treatment date.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data  
For efficacy variables, with repeated measures, a mixed model will be employed with no 
additional imputation for missing values, i .e., based o n “observed cases”, except where 
otherwise specified.  
Follo w-up and continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made.  These data will be included in the sensitivity analysis for primary endpoints  
estimating a treat ment effect taking loss of effect after discontinuation into account.  Because  
complete follo w-up of all patients discontinuing treatment may not be possible, a method to 
replace missing data for patients who di scontinue the study will be prespecified (in the SAP) 
taking into account loss of effect after discontinuation (for example multiple imputation).  
No other replacement of missing values will be planned.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the safety analysis 
set.

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable): 
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study/withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)  
Additionally, patients  enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region. 11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables  
The responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will be analy zed in terms of the 
proportion of patients achieving the event of interest.  Patients in need of rescue therapy, i .e., 
biliary diversion will be classified as no n-responders after the biliary diversion.  
Generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) will be used with a logistic link, to allow for 
repeated assessments over time.  The model will include baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group  interaction.  The treatment by 
visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included 
in the model as a random effect.  The contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24; also, the difference at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will 
be estimated and analyzed.  An unstructured covarian ce matrix will be used to model the 
within-s ubject error.  Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure 
fails to converge.   Model diagnostics checks will be made to ensure appropriate fit.  
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score  (indexed by 
observer- reported scratching) will be analyzed  using a mixed model repeated m easures 
(MMRM) analysis.  The contrast of primary interest will be treatment difference at Week  24 
but also the difference s at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and 
analyzed.  Baseline pruritus score  will be included as covariate.  The model will include  
baseline value,  treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group 
interaction.  The treatment by visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included in the model as a random effect and will be defined on country level.  An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within-subject 
error.   Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure fails to 
converge. 
Non-parametric approach may be considered if more appropriate. 
The primary analyses will be based on the FAS.  
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy anal ysis, the following analyses will be 
performed:

Final Amendment 1 .1, 01 March 2018 
 • Primary efficacy analysis using the PP set  
• Analyses to investigate the influence of missing values, for example , by using pattern 
mixture models and tipping point analysis  
Subgroup analyses will also be performed for each of the 3 age groups ( 6 months to 5 years, 
6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years) and for patients who were not included in the previous 
Study A4250-003. 
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed, such as the following: 
• Cochran Mantel Haenzsel test stratified on PFIC class to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment  in the two A4250 dose groups 
to placebo group.  Dropouts will be treated as non -responders  
• Based on the primary analysis including the interaction age class*treatment  
• Same as primary analysis in which the random factor region is considered as fixed factor.  The region*treatment in teraction will also be explored  
• Same as primary analysis including the interaction PFIC*treatment  
Other s ensitivity analyses may  be performed and will be detailed in the SAP. 
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
The change in the secondary and explorative endpoints such as s- BA, total bilirubin, ALT, 
growth and patient -reported itch severity  will also be analy zed using the MMRM model as 
specified for the primary analys is.  Nonparametric methods may be applied as an alternative 
approach for some endpoints, if appropriate.  Change in growth (weight for age and BMI for 
age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations. 
Proportions of responders (e.g., meaningful reduction in itch severity and scratching at 
Week  24) will be analy zed using the GLMM model as specified for the primary analysis.  
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week  24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using analysis of covariance.  The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC class, age class, region, and treatment.  
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or listed for liver transplant,  all-cause mortality,  
and liver decompensation events will mainly be analyzed by us ing descriptive statistics.  
Kaplan -Meier curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data.  
Other exploratory variables (Global S ymptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters, PELD /MELD score, APRI 
score, and Fib-4 score) will be analyzed descriptively for categorical and continuous data, as applicable.  For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analyzed in addition to the 
actual visit values.  For categorical data, shif t tables or frequency and percentages of patients 
will be presented as appropriate.

 In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed for each of the 3 age classes (6 months to 
5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years).  
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests (h ematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class [SOC] and MedDRA preferred term) will include  the 
following:  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TE AEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs)  
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term 
• Drug-related TEAEs by SOC and preferred term 
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation by SOC and preferred term  
• Treatmen t-emergent SAEs by SOC and preferred term 
Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC) class and World Health Organization ( WHO ) preferred name.  
Summaries of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.  For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analyz ed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatm ent group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the safety analysis set.

 11.2.3 Blinded A nalyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this analysis; data will be collapsed across treatment groups. 
The analyses will include distribution - and anchor-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distributio n-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of measurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will involv e examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and symptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will be included in a stan d-alone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items . 
11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically meet for the review of accumulating study data, 
including safety (AE and laboratory data) and liver values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The 
DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping the study early for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo 
Medical/  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and 
taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical/  if the study requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional eva luations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own written standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the trial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the 
study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB 
statistician will have access to these data.

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall implement and maintain quality control and qualit y assurance procedures 
with writte n standard operating procedures to ensure that the study is conducted and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be co nducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations , Sections 312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP  135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IEC/IRB, 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient or when the change(s) 
involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in the patient having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before stud y initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative s taff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research  associate [CRA]) 
will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements,  and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No 
information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  
Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of 
primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the 
eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study- specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine 
the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to 
conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding 
documentation. 
It is recommended that the investigator/investigative s taff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide a prompt response to queries .

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall 
be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance wit h FDA ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers, IB, available safety information, information about payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents and Assents  
The investigator (physician) or investigative s taff, in accordance with local regulation, will 
explain to each patient ( or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur.  Each caregiver /patien t will 
be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she or their child may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their children may experience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at ri sk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  Care givers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authorities .  The caregiver(s) /patient should read and consider the statements before signing 
and dating them and should be given a copy of each signed document.  If written consent is 
not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from one or more persons not involved in the study, indi cating why the patient was unable to 
sign the form.  No patient can enter the study before his/her or care giver (s), as required by 
country regulation, informed consent has been obtained. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/ investigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with 
regulatory requirements and country laws and is considered appropriate for the study.  Any

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed e CRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start .  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that lab oratory. 
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the 
eCRF will be  the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as defined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact disc s of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC approvals and all related correspondence including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/i nvestigative staff must retain copies of these essential documents for the 
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essential 
documents .  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these docum ents.

Planned Study Period:  
Q1 2018 to Q2 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 120 µ g/kg/day A4250 in children with 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) Types 1 and 2, as determined by  the following : 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid ( s-BA) 
concentration  from baseline to end of treatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  
after 2 4 weeks  of treatment  
• Change from baseline to Week  24 in pruritus compared to placebo  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on growth  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on sleep disturbance  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated dail y doses of A4250 for 24 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µ g/kg/day and 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in children with PFIC (deficiencies of f amilial 
intrahepatic cholestasis -1 or bile salt export pump).   
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per tr eatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 4 0 µg/kg/day or 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matching placebo.  Patients who complete the Treatment Period and Visit 9 (Day 168)  in this study will be 
invited  to participate  in a 72 -week open -label extension  study (A4250-0 08) in which all patients will receive 
active treatment.  
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study  and one scheduled telephone contact.

averaging the worst scratching scores from each day in the interval . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, from baseline 
to Week 24 as measured by the worst scratch  of the Albireo ObsRO instrument.  Scores for the 14 days  
baseline and post -treatment intervals will be calculated by averaging the worst scratching scores from 
each day in the interval.  
• US: Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA concentration  from 
baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L compared to placebo  after 24 weeks of

studies  
Statistical Methods: 
The primary objective of this study is to  show superiority in efficacy of A4250 ( 120 µg/kg/day and 
40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2 . 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at least a 70% 
reduction in fasting s-BA concentration  or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end of treatment), the null 
hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α =0.0125, 1-sided).  Generalized linear mixed 
modelling will be used with a logistic link, to allow for repea ted assessments over time.  The model will include 
baseline value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit and visit*treatment group interaction.  The 
contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the diff erence at Week  4, 
Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and analyzed.  
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to Week  24 in 
observer -reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested agains t the alternative hypothesis (α=0.0 125, 
1-sided).  The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score (indexed by observer-r eported 
scratching) will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis.  The contrasts of primary inter est 
will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the difference at the other weeks will be estimated and 
analyzed.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary and the main 
secondary endpoint to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel gate- keeping procedure will be used.  
Other s econdary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and safety information 
regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No ad justments will be performed for multiple-d ose 
comparisons when testing the other secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product 
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids since it facilitates the hig h-affinity, hig h-capacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.  In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gastrointestinal (GI)  related effects, such as d iarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral doses of 10 to 200 µg/kg /day for 4 weeks .  A4250 reduced mean levels of serum bile acids  
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC ) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  
Patient -reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 
was well tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study 
drug , and most  adverse events  (AEs), including some increased transaminases, were 
considered unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis  
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10% to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].   The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1 , 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also refe rred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis -1 (FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular 
membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer

 to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 2:  also referred to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency.”  BSEP is a transporte r protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes, and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and class ified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease.  
• PFIC, Type 3:  is cause d by  a deficiency of the multidrug -resistance protein 3 (MDR3) 
due to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver  biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosis.  Serum biochemistry indicates cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile acids in serum are very high, while serum gamma -glutamyl transferase activity (exception 
being MDR3 variants) and cholesterol are normal  [Hori 2010 ].  Symptoms of portal 
hypertension and liver failure will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -Spraul 
2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 2 months, 
and 78% of PFIC patients present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010 ].  The life -threatening 
and debilitating nature of PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those not resorting  to 
surgery is 50% at 10 years  of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  Approximately half of 
PFIC patients undergo liver transplantation  [Davit -Spraul 2009] and treatment -resistant 
pruritus is the leading indication for the surgical procedure partial external biliary diversion, mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.  Currently, the t reatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin defi ciencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical 
treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.   A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary  diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the 
enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and 
have liver failure or per sistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Cl inical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ( [IB] see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a  potent, selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals  seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.   In addition, no safety signals were seen in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 2 6 weeks  of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days  to 63 days . 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure  in both humans and other 
species .  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome 
P450 ( CYP) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 ( IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 ( IC50:1.2 µmol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a singl e-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  In total, 98 subjects  have been exposed to 
A4250. 
In the first clinical study  (A4250-001), A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose up to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose 
of 10 mg , the median maximum drug concentration was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the 
curve was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 1 9 [s- FGF19] and plasma  
7α Hydroxy 4- cholesten-3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an 
increase in p -C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids 
increased in A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo.  A4250 was generally well 
tolerated.  Th e only findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study  (A4250-007), healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 
3 mg  [14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There 
were n o quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or 
whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not related to A4250.  The 3 AEs experienced by 2 subjects  reported as related to study dr ug were 
GI in nature, including diarrhea  (2 AEs; 2 subjects) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus (A4250-003), A4250 was administered  as oral daily doses of 0.01 to 0.2 mg /kg for 4 week s.  Twenty 
patients  (8 females  and 12 m ales) aged 1 to 1 7 years  were enrolled in this ope n-label 
dose-e scalation study.  Four patients were re -enrolled into a second dose level.  No

 treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most AEs, including some increas ed 
transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily treatment with A4250 reduced mean 
levels of s -BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients  (ranging 
from 43 % to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also reduced s -BA in the 11 non- PFIC patients, 
but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  Patient -reported diar ies documented 
improvement of the visual analogue scale itch score in 17 of 2 4 patients  during treatment.  
The dose with the greatest improvement showed a mean decrease (±  standard error of the 
mean ) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results from this study form the basis of the current 
(A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and is also 
being consider ed for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulation  and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988].  Liver 
transplantation is typically used  as an option when patients have failed medical treatment 
and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus. By inhibiting  IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achieves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with P FIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver 
transplantation. 
The doses selected, 40 and 120 µg/kg /day, were based on the efficacy and safety data 
generated from patients with PFIC (n=10 + 3 re- entered) and supporting data from all 
patients (n=20 + 4 re -entered) in the five dose groups dosed in the A4250-003 study.  
Improvements in s-BA and pruritus were observed with doses from 30 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg, 
with a dose -related trend.  The best dose response in all patients was at the 60  µg/kg/day for 
s-BA and 100 µg/kg/day for pruritus.  The best dose response in the PFIC subgroup was at 
30 µg/kg/day for both s- BA and pruritus.  Patients with PFIC responded well to the doses 
given from 30 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg; however, a clear dose relationship could not be 
established in order to select a single dose for this Phase 3 study.  As efficacy was observed 
at both low  and high doses, 40 µg/kg  and 120 µg/kg/day are considered to be the most 
optimal for th is study.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

5.3.1 Risk/Benefit  
A4250 has been evaluated in three Albireo- sponsored clinical studies: a double -blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers, a single -dose ADME study, and a Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator -sponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. 
A total of 98 subjects/patients have been exposed to A4250.  Healthy subjects have been 
exposed to up to 10 mg as a single dose and up to 3 mg daily as part of a multiple -dose 
evaluation.  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated with up to 
0.2 mg/kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4  weeks.  In total, 2 SAEs have been reported; both were 
judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. 
Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess bile acids in the liver resulting in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids, is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery which could be 
of benefit to these patients if shown to be effective and safe.  Data from the Phase 2 study 
showed efficacy of A4250 in reducing s- BA concentrations and pruritus in such patients. 
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  
However, in the pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks daily treatment, only one  patient had 
mild transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing.

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomi zed, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg /kg/day  and 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically reviewed by an unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB).  
The study includes a 35- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow -Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µ g/kg/day  or 120 µ g/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
Patients who complete the Treatment Per iod and Visit 9 (Day  168) in this study will be 
invited  to participate in a 72-week open- label extension  study (A4250-008) in which all 
patients will receive  active treatment.   A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no 
improvement/intolerable symptoms , and has completed at least 12  weeks of the Treatment 
Period and End of Treatment (EOT)  Visit, will also be offered the opportunity to enter 
Study A4250-008. 
Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1). 
There will be up to 10 clinic visits during the study ( Figure  1) and one scheduled telephone 
contact , as follows: 
• Visit 1: Screening Period start . Patient is considered enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -35) 
• Visit 2: second Screening Visit ( Days -28 to -7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone Contact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit ( Day 28) 
• Visit 5: Clinic Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit 6: Clinic Visit ( Day 84) 
• Visit 7: Clinic Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit 8: Clinic Visit (Day 154) 
• Visit 9: Clinic  Visit, EOT  (Day 168)

 • Visit 10: Follow-Up V isit, 28 days  after last dose of study drug  (Day 196).  All patients 
continuing in Study A4250-008 will not have this Follow-up V isit. 
Additional clinic visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance, e .g., due 
to AE monitoring, to fulfil screening requirements , and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
Informed consent must be obtained at Visit 1 prior to performing any study procedures.  After 
signing the ICF, patients will be considered enrolled and evaluated for study eligibility . 
Daily recording of pruritus using an electronic diary (eDiary ) will be started to determine 
confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline pruritus symptoms before the study.  After 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients failing eligibility criteria may  be re- screened 
after 2 months.  Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 3 attempts are not 
allowed to re- screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary .  The eDiary  will include 
patient -reported outcome (PRO)  and observe r-reported outcome (ObsRO) items for 
evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and ObsRO)  
during the Screening  Period ( study Days  -56 to 0) and throughout the 24-w eek Treatment 
Period ( study Days  0 to 168). 
Only the 14 most recent days  before randomization will be used for eligibility calculation  of 
the diary  entrie s.  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients  of all ages  will be recorded by a 
caregiver  (or caregiver’s designee).  If possible, the same caregiver  will complete the Albireo 
ObsRO items throughout the study. 
At a second Screening Visit (Visit 2) addi tional laboratory samples will be taken for 
eligibility assessments.  
Treatment Period  
Eligibility for randomization will be determined at Visit 3 using the pruritus (scratching 
reports f rom the Albireo ObsRO)  data in the 2 week s before Visit 3, genetic con firmation of 
diagnosis, and the liver biochemistry evaluations from the previous screening  visits.  Two 
weeks after Visit 3, there will be a telephone contact with the caregiver/patient  to evaluate 
any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  If a new caregiver will begin to complete the Albireo ObsRO during the course 
of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they begin to use the eDiary .  Additionally, caregivers/patients will be requested to use the diary to report the 
date and time each dose of study drug is administered during the Treatment Period. 
The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A425 0-008) should they 
meet the required entry criteria .  If the patient is continuing into Study A4250-008 this will be

 7.2.3 Withdrawal of Patie nts 
Patients /caregivers  will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their 
reasons.  
Any withdrawal , and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the  electronic case 
report form  (eCRF ) and source documents and the patient followed by the 
investigator/investigative s taff.  Even after the study is completed at the Follow-up V isit, the 
investigator /investigative s taff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal , record any patient 
data they receive concerning SAEs, and all dru g-related no n-serious AEs, and subsequently 
report these to Albireo.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstan ces: 
• A patient’s /caregiver’s  desire for withdrawal for any reason  
• Lost to follo w-up (every effort must be made to contact the patient /caregiver ; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• A wors ening of the symp toms related to diarrhea occurs  
• Death  
• Patient /caregiver  estimation of lack of improvement/intolerable symptoms  
• A patient’s /caregiver’s substa ntial noncompliance (eDiary  and study drug compliance) or 
protocol violation 
• An i nvestigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the study is not appropriate.  The 
investigator may withdraw a patient at any time, if it is considered to be in the patient’s 
best interest  
A patient who prematurely withdraws due to no improvement/intolerable symptoms , and has 
completed at least 1 2 weeks  treatment in the double-blind study, will be offered th e 
opportunity to enter open- label Study A4250- 008.  A patient who withdraws from treatment 
prematurely and will not enter Study A4250-008 will be requested to compl ete all visits and 
safety assessments per the current protocol (A425 0-005).  As a minimum, patients  will have  
EOT  (Visit 9) assessments at the time of withdrawal and a follow-up assessment ( Visit 10) 
28 days  following the last dose of study drug , and the patient will be re corded  as withdrawn. 
7.2.4 Study Termination by Sponsor  
This study may be terminated at any time by Albireo if serious side effects should occur, if 
the investigator does not adhere to the protocol; or if, in the sponsor's judgment, there are no  
further benefits to be achieved from the study.  In this event, Albireo/designee will inform the 
study investigators, institutions, and all regulatory authorities.

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with pellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different 
capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that can  be opened or swallowed intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose, and placebo.  Bottles with 
34 capsules will be given to the patient at each visit.  A patient who requires 2 or more capsules per day will be given multiple bottles.   Refer to the investigational product manual. 
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µ g/kg/day , 120 µ g/kg/day , or placebo for 
24 weeks .  Study drug  will be dispensed to the patient  at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and t ake the drug .  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug , whether there 
were any delayed or missed doses, doses, and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed 
whole will be documented thr ough the eDiary and transferred to the study database.  
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when laboratory assessments are conducted , study drug should be taken after the visit  and after  
laboratory samples are t aken .  Patients should not crush or chew the capsule (s).  When 
swallowing the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water. 
For a patient unable to swallow capsule  intact , the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed  in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce, or fruit 
purée.  The amount of food should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and 
should be followed by water.  
1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (apple  
sauce, fruit purée, or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to t he patient will be based on body weight  at Visit 3.   At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category  (identified in Table 2 ), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

 8.5 Patient  Compliance  
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance by routine review of the CRF health 
webs ite.  If both diary entr ies on a day  are missing  during, the study nurse will call the 
patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entrie s.  Any noncompliance will 
be documented and explained in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, p atients 
will return all unused study drug  at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug , assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable. 
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
inventory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient , and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug  and to the study patients . 
The investigator will be responsible for  ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were provided the quantities  specified in the protocol and that all study drug  
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy  and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator  will note all ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 1 month prior to Visit 1 ) in the eCRF .  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or changes in dose) will be recorded in the 
eCRF .  All medicat ions (prescribed or over the counter)  for pruritus and sleep will be 
recorded.  
All medications taken by a patient within 3 months prior to the first intake of study drug  are 
regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the f irst intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the study, are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1.

(where available)  
• Live r-related mortality and liver decompensation events 
• All-cause mortality  
9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids  
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits.  Patients will fast 
(water intake only is permissible) for at least 4 hours prior to the collection of samples for 
s-BA.  Exceptions can be made for infants, <12 months of age, if unable to fast for the full 
4 hours.  Any visit at which a bile acid sample result is unreportable, an a dditional 
unscheduled visit for a repeat sample collection may be scheduled.  All s -BA results during 
the t reatment period and follow -up will be blinded.  Samples will be processed and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching , Scratching  and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be recorded twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients and/or caregivers will be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep 
throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session during 
Visit 1. 
The eDiary  includes Albireo ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients < 8 years  of age will not be 
asked to complete the Albireo PRO items; only the Albireo ObsRO will be completed by 
caregivers of patients in this age group.  Older patients , 8 to 17 years  of age, will complete 
the Albireo PRO items and the caregiver will complete the Albireo ObsRO items.  The 
Albireo PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of sleep disturbance (morning diary only), 
and tirednes s.  For patients 8 to 12 years  of age, the caregiver will read the Albireo PRO 
items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the 
caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the Albireo PRO items, in case  the 
patient is confused or requires clarification about the meaning of a question.  The Albireo 
ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The Albireo 
ObsRO and PRO scratching and itch severity items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code ( Appendix 2).

Final Amendment 01 , 06 December 2017  
 A daily score for the Albireo ObsRO scratching item will be calculated by selecting the 
maximum scratching severity score from the 2 ratings for each day.  A daily score will be 
considered missing if both of the daily assessments are missing.  A 14-days score will be 
calculated by averaging the daily scratching scores.  A 14-days  score will be considered 
missing if >4 out of 7 days  a week of data are missing.  The same approach will be used to 
calculate a patien t-reported itch severity score.  
9.2.3 Growth  
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( Z-score) using a certified weight 
scale.  BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height (m)2.  Change will be defined as linear 
growth deficit (weight and BMI for age) compared to national growth curve s (Z-score, SD 
from P50). 
9.2.4 Quality of Life Questionnaire  (PedsQL)  
Patients and caregivers will be asked to complete  a QoL  questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 
and Visit 9.  Details of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in 
Appendix 4.  
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and Other Laboratory Samples 
Blood samples for autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 only for children 
with body weight  ≥10 kg .  Samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per 
instructions in the l aboratory manual.  
9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomization and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years  of age .  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated. 
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln( total bilirubin  in mg/dL ) + 18.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin in 
g/dL ) + 4.36 ( if patient < 1 year: scores for patients listed for liver transplantation before the 
patient's first birthday continue to include the value assigned for age (< 1 year) until the 
patient reaches the age of 2 4 months) + 6.67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 SD ]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. MELD Score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine  in mg/dL ) + 3.78 * ln( total bilirubin  in mg/dL ) + 
11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43 Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine values greater than 
4.0 mg /dL will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score. 
9.2.7 Fibroscan

 9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and Fib -4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST  in U/L ) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L )). 
9.2.9 Global Impression of Change and Global Impression of Symptom Measures  
Patients  (≥8 years of age) , caregivers, and clinicians will complete  the P GIC and the P GIS 
measures  (Appendix 3) at randomization (Visit 3 ; PGIS only), Visits 4 and 6, and at EOT  
(Visit 9) . 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study drug .  The PGIS items assess  itch 
(patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician versions), and sleep (all versions) in the 
past week.  Caregivers and clinicians will complete the PGIC and PGIS for all patients; those  
patients ≥8 years  of age will complete the patient version .

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 7.1.3 and in Table 1  
above.  
The primary safety analysis for this study  will include the incidence of total 
treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, 
and seriousness assessments made by the investigator by comparing study drug exposure t o 
placebo.  
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments: 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry , hematology, urinalysis, AFP, and 
fat-soluble vitamins  A, D, and E) 
• Abdominal ultrasound 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefor e be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled (ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Sign ificance 
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-r eported events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physica l exam ination  findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not 
limited to, events causing withdrawal f rom the study and events requiring medical 
intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant 
by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the

Final Amendment 01 , 06 December 2017  
 development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, non-serious AE. 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE:  
• The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires medical/surgical  intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation.  The investigator will assess th e intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in 
Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet 
serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE. 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medic al judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, 
temporal relationship to the study drug , and de-c hallenge or r e-challenge.  The causality 
assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows .

Final Amendment 01 , 06 December 2017  
 Related to study drug (possibly, probably, or definitely related) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the event; one o r more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, environmental or toxic fac tors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient  
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity 
upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (unlikely  or unrelated)  
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event d oes not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study 
drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically 
significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the ICF 
and until the post-t reatment follo w-up ( Visit 10) or 28 days  after the last dose of study drug. 
Any AEs or SAEs that are  unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in the eCRF .  Albireo retains the right to request additional information for any 
patien t with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

Final Amendment 01 , 06 December 2017  
 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be collected on 
the eCRF as no n-treatment -emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as 
an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if 
an investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion 
of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has 
signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit 10), and 28 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the SAE report f orm.     
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth  
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date  
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset 
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious 
• The relationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the 
investigator's assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared and the inform ation collected in the SAE submitted to  
 (Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services Department)  by e-mail within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  may contact the investigator to obtain further 
information on a reported SAE.  The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any 
request for follo w-up information or answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same 
timelines as for initial reports.

for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 28 days  after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE form should be completed including the main and 
contributor y causes of death . 
All SAE reports must be e-mailed to the following e-mail address within 24 hours : 
 
 
If email is unavailable, SAEs may be transmitted via fax to the following number: 
 
In a stud y-related medical emergency situation, when the assigned medical monitors for the 
study cannot be reached by a caller, an on call physician can be reached 2 4 hours per day, 
7 days  per week, via the  call center.  The following number is a chargeable telephone

10.1.4 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that occurs in a patient , 
the nature or severity of which is not expected per  the applicable product information (e.g., 
the IB for an unauthorized investigational product or summary of product characteristics for 
an authorized product).  
Reporting and tracking of SUSARs will be in accordance to all applicable competent 
authority regulations.  The Ethics Committee and all investigators involved in this study will 
be informed according to national and international requirements. 10.2 Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Physical Examinations and Other Safety 
Assessments  
10.2.1 Laboratory Assessments 
Samples will be collected for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing at the 
time points specified in Table 1. The parameters assessed are presented in Table 3.

 Blood for AFP will be drawn at Visits  3 and 9  and for fat -soluble vitamins at Visits 2, 3 , 
and 9. 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit 1 and Visit 9 if the  patient is entering the 
A4250- 008 study . A urine pregnancy test will be collected at all other visits for girls who 
have reached menarche.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed to confirm the pregnancy.  Study drug administration will be held pending the 
confirmatory results.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient can resume dosing.  
If the serum pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be discontinued (see 
Section  10.2.9).  
All samples will be processed and transported to a laboratory per instructions in the 
laboratory manual.  
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal clinic ally significant”.  
Additional safety blood samples may be needed due to follow -up of an abnormal value or 
analysis failure.  The blood samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

 • ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN (if normal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 800 U/L, 
whichever comes first  
• OR ALT or AST ≥3 × baseline (if abnormal at baseline) or an absolute threshold of 
800 U/L, whichever comes first 
Then: 
a) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin , and prothrombin time [ PT] or INR)  within 
2 to 3 days 
b) Evaluate creatine phosphokinas e (CPK ) and lac tate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) 
c) As needed (for example, persistent ALT/ total bilirubin  elevation or worsening of liver 
function), consider evaluation for a lternative etiologies  
Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
If any ONE of the following criteria are met:  
1. Transaminases (ALT or AST ≥3  × baseline or 800 U/L, whichever comes first) AND 
bilirubin (total bilirubin > 2  × ULN) elevations  
2. Transaminase elevations alone (ALT or AST >10  × ULN or 5  × baseline or absolute 
threshold of 800 U/L, whichever comes first) in presence of normal LDH and CPK 
3. Cholestatic marker elevations ( alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] or gamma -glutamyl 
transferase >2 × baseline) without alternative explanation  
4. Total bilirubin increased, unrelated to hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count) or 
establi shed genetic diseases, such as Gilbert’s syndrome 
a. Doubling if total bilirubin was <3 mg/d L at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >3 mg/d L if total bilirubin was ≥3 mg/dL at baseline  
5. INR increase refractory to vitamin K administration  
a. Increase by >1.5 if INR was normal at baseline  
b. OR Increase by >0.4 if INR was abnormal at baseline 
6. Any increase in total bilirubin and transaminases if accomp anied by EITHER a symptom 
of clinical hepatitis (e.g., vomiting, nausea, right upper quadrant pain) OR immunological 
reaction (rash or >5% eosinophilia) 
Then: 
a) Interrupt study medication  
b) Initiate drug -induced liver injury work -up for alternative etiologies  
c) Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP) and PT  or INR 
within 48 to 72 hours

 d) Monitor the patient using close observation found in Section  10.2.2.2 
e) If a patient lives in a remote area, they may be tested locally and the results 
communicated to the investigator site promptly  
10.2.2.2 Close Observation 
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  Frequency of re -testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases 
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medications and 
herba l and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets   
• Rule out alternate etiology including acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non- alcoholic s teatohepatitis; hypoxic/is chemic 
hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin) 
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
10.2.2.3 De-challenge/Re -challenge for Liver and Clinical Hepatitis Monitoring  
1. Re-challenge is not recommended:  
a. If a patient has had possible/probable drug-induced liver injury 
b. If a decompensation event has occurred (i.e., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepati c 
encephalopathy, etc.).  
2. If due to underlying cholestatic liver disease variability or another alternative etiology is 
identified AND liver tests returned to baseline, re -challenge may be considered after 
consultation with the sponsor Medical Monitor. 
3. If the ALT/total bilirubin elevations are observed after re -challenge, then repeat 
re-challenge is discouraged . 
If patient is permanently discontinued, monitoring should be continued as outlined in Section  10.2.2.5.  
10.2.2.4 Diarrhea  
Study drug should be discontinued if a patient develops diarrhea with at least 1 of the 
following concomitant signs or symptoms: grossly bloody stools, vomiting, dehydration

 requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances, fever 
(≥38 C) and/or the diarrhea p
ersists for 7 or more days.  
If there is gross blood in st
ool, INR and platelets should be measured.  
Study drug will be reintroduced (re -challenge) when the symptoms have resolved.  If the 
diarrhea re -occurs within 1 wee k after the re -challenge with no alternate etiology, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued and monitored as outlined in Section 10.2.2.5. 
10.2.2.5 Monitoring after Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Safety  
Once study drug is permanently discontinued for liver, hepatitis, diarrhea, or other severe AE  
related to study drug , the patient will be monitored weekly until the laboratory and clinical 
parameters have normalized/stabilized.  
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical a nd Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity),  along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF 
at Visit 1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit 1.  This includes date of 
diagnosis of PFIC, prior investigational medications for PFIC, historical (3  months prior to 
Screening ) LFT values (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery 
performed, any other diagnosis, and historical biopsy data.   If a liver biopsy has been  performed within 1 year prior to Screening , or during the study, the 
results will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
If confirmatory clinical genetic testing for PFIC  Type 1 or 2 has been performed prior to 
Screening Visit 1 , the confirmatory clinical genetic testing  laboratory report will be verified 
by a central reader to determine eligibility.  
Regardless of previous genetic testing, a blood sample will be drawn at Visit 1 for all patients 
for DNA extract ion.  Genetic testing will only be performed on a patient’s extracted DNA if 
the previous clinical genetic  result is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable.  In such cases, 
screening for pathologic biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes will be 
performed if patient meets remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria and only after sponsor 
case review.  No other diagnostic genetic testing will be offered.  
10.2.5 Physical Examination 
A physician or suitably trained qualified  assistant will perform a complete physical 
exami nation, including voluntary photography, at  Visits  1, 3, and 9.  A  skin exam ination  will 
be conducted at Visits 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 ( see Table  1).

 A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examined  thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height (or length depending on age) , and 
body weight (using a certified weight scale) at clinic visits.  BMI will be calculated.  
10.2.7 Abdominal Ultrasound  
Ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at EOT  
(Visit 9).  Liver size, echogenicity, and presence of masses/nodules as well as spleen size will be recorded.  
10.2.8 Overdose  
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of > 3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a si ngle dose or as a cumulative dose within 24 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-adverse-e ffect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 month toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in 
a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immediately and not later than within 2 4 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate on the SAE report 
form.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient should be monitored closely. 
10.2.9 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study before the end of dosing, 
the p atient will be immediately discontinued from the study  and will attend the same visits as 
a prematurely withdrawn patient.  If the pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled 
in the study after the end of dosing , the patient will continue in the s tudy per protocol.  If a 
pregnancy occurs in a male patient ’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy 
should also be reported and followed. Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE.  However , if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug , the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Albireo /Safety Manager  (please refer to 
Section 10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as poss ible, details of the period of gestation at 
the time of exposure must be given.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified.  
All statistical a nalyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power  
For the EU and RoW , the primary analysis will relate to the bile acid responder endpoint (at 
the 1-sided 1.25% level) .  For the US , the primary analysis will relate to the pru ritus endpoint 
(at the 1-sided 1.25% level).   The aim is to enroll 60 to 70 patients in order to get at least 
60 evaluable patients.  
Assuming 60% responders (patients experiencing at least 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
concentration  or reaching ≤ 70 µ mol/L) in the A4250 dose group and 10% responders in the 
placebo group, approximately 20 patients per group are requir ed to achieve a power of 84% 
with a 1.25% 1-sided Type-1 error. 
For pruritus, w ith approximately 20 patients  per treatment gr oup, the power is 83% given an 
assumed t reatment effect difference of -1.0 in change from baseline (-1.6 for A4250 
and -0.6 for placebo) on the Albireo ObsRO scratching score with a SD of 0.95 and a  Type I 
error of 1.25% (1-sided). 
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received  at least 
1 dose of assigned treatment .  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group they were 
randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no majo r protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patient s to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study.

A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 
and 2. 
In the EU and RoW, f or the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at 
least a 70% reduction in fasting s- BA concentration  or reaching a level ≤70 µ mol/L at the end 
of treatment), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α = 0.0125, 
1-sided). 
The test will be performed at a T ype I error rate of ≤0.0125 1-s ided, as described above, 
based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean probability scale. To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint  to a 1-sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate-keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the total significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between th e dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (here the pruritus endpoint).  If the previous step was not 
successful, the  analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the procedure 
reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using the 
Bonferroni Holm procedure.  The multiple comparison procedure is presented in  Figure 2. 
Figure 2 Bonferroni Holm Multiple Comparison P rocedure 
 
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to 
Week  24 in observe r-reported scratch ing), the null hypothesis will be tested against the 
alternative hypo thesis (α=0.0125, 1-sided).

based on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean change.  
To strictly control overall Type I error rate across the dose groups and also across the primary 
and the main secondary endpoint to a one -sided 2.5% level, a Bonferroni -based parallel 
gate-keeping procedure will be used.  In this procedure the total significance level of 2.5% 
(1-sided) will be split equally between the dose groups.  Only a dose group that is significant 
for the primary endpoint will be tested, at the nominal significance level of 1.25% ( 1-sided), 
for the main secondary endpoint (her e the bile acid responder endpoint) .  If the previous step 
was not successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive.  If the 
procedure reaches the secondary endpoint for both dose groups, these will be evaluated using 
the Bonferroni Holm procedure. 
Other secondary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and 
safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  No adjustments 
will be performed for multiple dose comparisons when testing the other secondary and 
exploratory efficacy variables.  
A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before study 
data are locked and unblinded.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter on or prior to the first intake of study treatment date.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data 
For efficacy variables, with repeated measures, a mixed model will be employed with no additional imputation for missing values, i.e., based o n “observed cases”, except where 
otherwise specified.  
Follo w-up and continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made.  These data will be included in the sensitivity analysis  for primary endpoints  
estimating a treatment effect taking loss of effect after discontinuation into account.  Because 
complete follo w-up of all patients discontinuing treatment may not be possible, a method to 
replace missing data for patients who discontinue the study will be prespecified (in the SAP) 
taking into account loss of effect after discontinuation (for example multiple imputation). 
No other replacement of missing values will be planned. 11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the safety analysis 
set.

 11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following wil l be summarized (by treatment group and overall where applicable):  
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study/withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)  
Additionally, patients  enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region.  
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables 
The responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will be analy zed in terms of the 
proportion of patients achieving the event of interest.  Patients in need of rescue therapy, i .e., 
biliary diversion will be classified as no n-responders after the biliary diversion.  
Generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) will be used with a logistic link, to allow for  
repeated assessments over time.  The model will include baseline value, treatment group, 
PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group  interaction.  The treatment by 
visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included 
in the model as a random effect.  The contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24; also, the difference at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will 
be estimated and analyzed.  An unstructured covarian ce matrix will be used to model the 
within-s ubject error.  Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure 
fails to converge.   Model diagnostics checks will be made to ensure appropriate fit . 
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score  (indexed by 
observer- reported scratching)  will be analyzed  using a mixed model repeated m easures 
(MMRM) analysis.  The contrast of primary interest will be treatment difference at Week  24 
but also the difference s at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and 
analyzed.  Baseline pruritus score  will be included as covariate.  The model will include  
baseline value,  treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group 
interaction.  The treat ment by visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of 
significance.  Region will be included in the model as a random effect and will be defined on country level.   An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the withi n-subject 
error.   Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure fails to 
converge.  
Non-parametric approach may be considered if more appropriate.  
The primary analyses will be based on the FAS.  
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy anal ysis, the following analyses will be 
performed:

 • Primary efficacy analysis using the PP set  
• Analyses to investigate the influence of missing values, for example , by using pattern 
mixture models and tipping point analysis 
Subgroup analyses will also be performed for each of the 3 age groups ( 6 months to 5 years , 
6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ) and for patients who were not included in the previous 
Study A4250-003. 
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed, such as  the following: 
• Cochran Mantel Haenzsel test stratified on PFIC class to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid r esponder endpoint at the end of treatment  in the two A4250 dose groups 
to placebo group.  Dropouts will be treated as non-responders 
• Based on the primary analysis including the interaction age class*treatment  
• Same as primary analysis in which the random fa ctor region is considered as fixed factor.  
The region*treatment in teraction will also be explored  
• Same as primary analysis including  the interaction PFIC*treatment  
Other s ensitivity analyses may  be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
The change in the secondary and explorative endpoints such as s- BA, total bilirubin, ALT, 
growth and patient -reported itch severity  will also be analy zed using the MMRM model as 
specified for the primary analys is.  Nonparametric methods may be applied as an alternative 
approach for some endpoints , if appropriate. Change in growth (weight for age and BMI for 
age) will also be displayed using graphical presentations. 
Proportions of responders (e.g., meaningful reduction in itch severity and scratching at 
Week  24) will be analy zed using the GLMM model as specified for the primary analysis. 
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week  24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using analysis of covariance.  The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC class, age class, region, and treatment.  
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or listed for liver transplant,  all-cause mortality,  
and liver decompensation events will mainly be analyzed by us ing descriptive statistics.  
Kaplan -Meier curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data. 
Other exploratory variables ( Global S ymptom Relief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters , PELD /MELD score, APRI 
score, and Fib-4 score) will be analyzed descriptively for categorical and continuous data, as 
applicable.  For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analyzed in addition to the actual visit values.  For categorical data, shif t tables or frequency and percentages of patients 
will be presented as appropriate.

 In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed for each of the 3 age classes  (6 months to 
5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ). 
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class  [SOC]  and MedDRA preferred term) will include  the 
following :  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (TEAEs, drug-related TE AEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs)  
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Drug-related TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation by SOC and preferred term  
• Treatmen t-emergent  SAEs by SOC and preferred term  
Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) class and World Health Organization ( WHO) preferred name.  
Summaries of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laborat ory data will be presented.  For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each patient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analy zed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will be described by treatm ent group and the number of patients 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.

 11.2.3 Blinded Analyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of Albireo ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or 
more of the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded 
analysis will be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder 
definition) in Albireo ObsRO and PRO pruritus score s.  The analysis will be performed by a 
group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this 
analysis; data will be collapsed across treatment groups . 
The analyses will include distribution - and ancho r-based analyses to examine a responder 
definition for the Albireo PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distribution-based analyses will 
include calculation of the SD and standard error of measurement for the baseline Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analys es will involve examining the degree of 
change on the Albireo PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who 
experience change in pruritus according to PGIC and symptom items.  Details of this analysis 
will be included in a stan d-alone SAP for assessing the measurement characteristics 
(reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the Albireo PRO and 
ObsRO items . 
11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts wi ll be 
established.  The DSMB will periodically meet for the review of accumulating study data, 
including safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining p art of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The 
DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping the study early  for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo Medical/  who are responsible for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and 
taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical  if the study  requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own written standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charte r of the DSMB will be 
stored in the t rial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB 
statistician will have access to these data.

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall implement and maintain quality cont rol and quality assurance procedures 
with writte n standard operating procedures to ensure that the study is conducted and data are 
generated, documented , and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This stu dy shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki ( October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with United States Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations , Sections  312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate IEC/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to th e patient  or when the change(s) involve(s) only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in the patient having to be 
withdrawn from the study and render that patient  non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the 
investigative staff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate  [CRA]) 
will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrol lment, 
and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period  of patient 
visits , as per individual site agreements, and must allow the CRA and Albireo representative 
or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related materials, including 
relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries.  No 
information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center.  
Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of the signed ICF, 
adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA will review source data compared with the  
eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study -specific monitoring plan.  The 
design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine the frequency of monitoring visits.  Upon study completion, the CRA w ill visit the site to 
conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding documentation. 
It is recommended that the investigator/investigative s taff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide a prompt response to queries .

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board 
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall 
be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient  recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients  and 
caregivers , IB, available safety information, information about payment and compensation 
available to patients , the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents request ed by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory authority 
(competent a uthority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consent s and Assents 
The investigator/i nvestigative staff will explain to each patient  (or legally authorized 
representative) the nature of th e study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected 
duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort 
that may occur .  Each care giver /patient will be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary and that he/she or their child may withdraw from the study at any time and that 
withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
Care givers /patients will be informed that they/their ch ildren may experience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people treated with A4250 m ay be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis .  Care givers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that some minor risks are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authorities .  The care giver /patient should read and consider the statements before signing and 
dating them and should be given a copy of each signed document.  If written consent is not 
possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from 
one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to sign 
the form .  No patient ca n enter the study before his/her or care giver  informed consent has 
been obtained. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/i nvestigative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies w ith 
regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for the study.  Any changes to the ICF

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed eCRFs and shall ensure that all data 
from patient  visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given.  The investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study s tart.  As a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. 
As no ethnicity data can be collected in the source document for study sites in France, the 
eCRF will be  the Source Document for “origines ethniques”,  
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as  defined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed eCRFs (for site archiving, compact discs of eCRF 
data for specific patients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source 
documents; IEC app rovals and all related correspondence including approved documents;  
drug accountability records ; study correspondence ; and a list of patients’ names and 
addresses.  
The investigator/investigative s taff must retain copies of these essential documents for the  
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements .  The 
investigator/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essenti al 
documents .  The investigator/i nvestigative staff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

Australia.  
Publication(s): None.  
Planned Study Period:  
Q4 2017 to Q2 2019 Development Phase:  
Phase  3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 4 0 µg/kg/day and 12 0 µg/kg/day A4250 in children with 
PFIC Types 1 and 2, as determined by the following : 
• Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting s -BA levels or reaching a 
level  ≤70 µmol/L compared to placebo  after 2 4 weeks  of treatment 
• Change from baseline to Week  24 in pruritus compared to placebo  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 based on alanine aminotransferase ( ALT)  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on insuli n-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on pruritus-r elated sleep disturbance  
• To evaluate the effect of A4250 on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion and liver 
transplantation)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated daily doses of A4250 for 2 4 weeks  
Methodology:  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
40 µg/kg/day and 120 µ g/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in children with progressive familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis (deficiencies of familial intrahepatic cholestasis -1 (FIC1) or bile salt export pump 
(BSEP).   
The study includes a 14- to 56-day Screening  Period followed by a 24-w eek Treatment Period and a 4-week 
Follo w-up Period.  After completion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients ( 20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3 ) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µ g/kg/day or 12 0 µg/kg/day of A4250, or a 
matchin g placebo.  All patients completing Day 168 (Visit 9) in this study will be invited  to participate in a 
72-week open -label extension  study (A4250-0 08) in which all patients will receive active treatment.  
There will be 10 visits during the study; 4 of them can be performed, where permitted by local regulations, by a 
study nurse visiting the patient at home, and 1 scheduled telephone contact .

Efficacy:   
Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoints are:  
• EU and rest of world ( RoW ): Proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in fasting 
serum bile acid ( s-BA) levels from b aseline to the end of t reatment or reaching a level  ≤70 µ mol/L 
compared to placebo.  
Fasting s -BA baseline will be calculated as the average of the value at randomization and the previous 
screening ( Visit 1 ).  The end value is the average of the values at Weeks  22 and 24 after the start of 
doubl e-blind trea tment.  
• US: Change in pruritus , indexed as caregiver -reported observed scratching  score from baseline to 
Week  24 as measured by the average daily score of the ObsRO instrument.  The average daily score 
will be calculated using the 7 days pre-treatment  for b aseline, and the last 7 days of treatment for 
Week  24 for the end value.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• EU and RoW : Change in pruritus, as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching score as 
measured  by the average daily score of the Albireo ObsRO instrument compared to placebo.  The 
average daily score will be calculated using the 7 days pretreatment for baseline, and the last 7 days of

data collected at the study visits  
• Occurrence of treatmen t-emergent AEs (TEAE) including severity and relatedness to study drug at all 
visits  
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications at all visits  
• Vital signs at all clinic visits

Statistical Methods:  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in efficacy of A425 0 (120 µg/kg/day and 
40 µg/kg/day) compar ed to placebo  in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2. 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at least a 70% 
reduction in fasting s -BA l evels or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end of treatment), the null hypothesis will 
be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α =0.025, 1-sided).  Generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) 
will be used with a logistic link, to allow for repeated assessments over time.  The model will include baseline 
value, treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit and visit*treatment group interaction.  The contrasts 
of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the difference at Week  4, Week  8, 
Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and analyzed.  
A fixe d-sequence multiple testing approach will be used.  In the first step, the high dose (120 µ g/kg/day) versus 
placebo will be tested at 2.5% 1-sided significance level.  If signifi cant, the low dose (40 µ g/kg/day) versus 
placebo will also be tested, in a second step, at 2.5% 1-sided significance level.  The second step will only be 
considered confirmatory providing the previous step was successful.  
In the US, for the primary efficac y variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to Week  24 in 
observer -reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α=0.025, 
1-sided).  The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score (indexed by observe r-reported 
scratching) will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.  The contrasts of 
primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24 but also the difference at the other weeks will be 
estimated and analyzed.   
In the first step, the high dose (12 0 µg/kg/day) versus placebo will be tested at 2.5% 1-sided significance level.   
If significant, the low dose (4 0 µg/kg/day) versus placebo will also be tested, in a second step, at 2.5% 1-sided 
significance level.  The second step will only be considered confirmatory providing the previous step was 
successful.  
Secondary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and safety information regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  For secondary efficacy variables, supportive statistical tests will  
be made and P-values will be reported in an exploratory way (if not otherwise specified).  No adjustments will 
be performed for multipl e-dose comparisons when testing the secondary and exploratory efficacy variables.

 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product 
A4250 is a small molecule and a potent selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT), also known as the apical sodium-dependent bil e acid transporter (ASBT).  IBAT is 
an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that c o-transports sodium and bile acids and 
appears to be a critical component in the regulation of the bile acid pool size in animals and 
man.  This transporter, expressed in the distal ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic 
circulation of bile acids since it facilitates the hig h-affinity, high-c apacity reabsorption of bile 
acids.   Indeed, 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed via IBAT  [Hofmann 2009; 
Miethke 2016].  A4250 is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds 
reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids.  A4250 has minimal systemic 
exposure at the predicted  therapeutic dose ranges.  
No safety signals were found with A4250 in preclinical safety and toxicity studies.   In the 
first clinical study of A4250 in healthy volunteers, A4250 was given as a single oral dose up 
to 10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  A4250 was well tolerated and the 
only findings were gast rointestinal (GI) related effects, such as diarrhea, at higher doses. 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was given as oral 
doses of 0.01 to 0.2 mg /kg/d ay for 4 weeks .  A4250 reduced mean levels of serum bile acids  
(s-BA) in all cohorts.  In 11 of 13 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC) patient s, substantial reductions (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  Patient 
reported diary data documented improvement of pruritus during treatment.  A4250 was well 
tolerated.  No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were deemed to be  related  to study drug, and 
most adverse events  (AEs), including some increased transaminases, were considered 
unrelated to study drug and transient in nature. 
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Progressive Famili al Intrahepatic Cholestasis 
PFIC is a rare autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease estimated to affect between 1 in 
every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.  PFIC represents 10% to 15% of causes of 
cholestasis in children and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children.  All 
types of PFIC exist worldwide and both sexes appear to be equally affected. The common underlying pathogenesis  of PFIC is  disruption of bile formation and bile 
transport through the liver  [Jacquemin 2000].  The classification of PFIC has evolved over 
the years.  The most commonly used sub-c lassification s are PFIC Types 1, 2, and 3, which 
are based on the associated affected gene and described in more detail below.  
• PFIC, Type 1:  also refe rred to as “Byler disease” or “familial i ntrahepatic 
cholestasis -1 (FIC1) protein deficiency .” FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular 
membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates movement of aminophospholipids from the outer 
to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the hepat ocyte.  The ATP8B1  gene encodes 
 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 18 
 FIC1 protein.  Biallelic pathologic variants in the ATP8B1  gene are associated with FIC1 
dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 1 disease. 
• PFIC, Type 2:  also refer red to as “Byler syndrome” or “b ile salt export pump (BSEP) 
deficiency.”  BSEP is a transporter protein that is expressed at the canalicular membrane 
of hepatocytes, and is the primary exporter of bile acids.  The ABCB11  gene encodes the 
BSEP protein.  Biallelic pathologic variations in the ABCB11  gene are associated with 
BSEP dysfunction and classified clinically as PFIC Type 2 disease. 
• PFIC, Type 3:  is caused by a deficiency of the multidrug- resistant 3 protein (MDR3) due 
to mutations in the ABCB4  gene.  MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase critical for 
phospholipid secretion. 
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC.  Itching (and subsequent 
scratching) is a significant morbidity for these patients and their families  [Suchy 2007] .  A 
more severe degree of pruritus is experienced compared to patients with other forms of liver 
disease and to other pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis  [Murray 2011] .  In patients 
with PFIC, liver  biopsy reveals canalicular cholestasis and, later, the appearance of portal 
fibrosis.  Serum biochemistr y indicates cholestasis with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  The concentrations of bile 
acids in serum are very high, while serum γ- GT activity (exception being MDR3 variants) 
and cholester ol are normal  [Hori 2010] .  Symptoms of portal hypertension and liver failure 
will develop during the course of the disease  [Davit -Spraul 2009; Alissa 2008] .  Symptoms 
develop early; median age at onset of symptoms  is 2 months, and 78% of PFIC patients 
present with  jaundice [ Pawlikowska 2010] .  The life -threatening and debilitating nature of 
PFIC  is reflected by the fact that survival in those not resorting to surgery is 50% at 10 years  
of age and almost zero at 20 years  of age.  Approximately half of PFIC patients undergo liver 
transplantation  [Davit -Spraul 2009] and treatment -resistant pruritus is the leading indication 
for the surgical procedure partial external biliary diversion (PEBD), mostly in PFIC Type 1 and 2 patients . 
PFIC is lif e-threatening and debilitating.   Currently, the treatment for PFIC is palliative  and 
there is  no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC.  The therapeutic choices are 
restricted to no n-specific therapy of the symptoms and signs of the disease such as nutritional 
support, preventing vitamin deficiencies, and treatment of extrahepatic features.  Medical 
treatment options include of f-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampin, antihistamines , and 
naltrexone.  A minority of patients respond nominally and transiently to these interventions.  
Biliary diversion is used to decrease systemic bile acids through interruption of the 
enterohepatic circulation and so avoid transplantation.  Liver transplantation is typically only 
viewed as an option when patients have failed medical treatment and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or per sistent uncontrolled pruritus.

 5.2.2 Summary of Clinical and Nonc linical Studies  
This is a summary of nonclinical and clinical studies.  More detail is provided in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ( IB; see A4250 IB ).  
A4250 is a potent , selective IBAT inhibitor with no safety signals  seen in the safety 
pharmacological studies.  In addition, no safety signals were seen in repea t-dose oral toxicity 
studies in rats with up to 2 6 weeks  of daily dosing and in dogs with up to 39 weeks  of daily 
dosing.  No safety signals were identified when  A4250 was administered daily to  juvenile 
rats from age 14 days to 63 days. 
A4250 is minimally absorbed with  very low systemic exposure  in both humans and other 
species .  In blood, protein binding is high (>99.7%).  Systemically absorbed A4250 is slowly 
metaboliz ed in humans and in preclinical studies  by hydroxylation only, a metabolite  that 
retains IBAT activity .  A4250 did not show any significant i nhibition of cytochrome  
P450 ( CYP 450) enzymes in the rat.  A4250 inhibited human CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 (IC50: 16 µmol/L for both enzymes), and CYP2C9 (IC50:1.2 µ mol/L).  
To date , A4250 has been studied in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: a study in healthy 
volunteers evaluating single and multiple administration of A4250; a singl e-dose absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study;  and a Phase 2 study in children with 
cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has been conducted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  In total, 98 subjects  have been exposed to 
A4250. 
In the first clinical study , A4250 was given to healthy volunteers as a single oral dose up to 
10 mg  or daily oral doses up to 3 mg /day for 7 days .  Following a single oral dose of 10 mg , 
the median maximum drug concentration (C max) was 0.2 nmol/L and the area under the curve 
(AUC) was 0.8 nmol × h/L (n=6).  Pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation of bile acid synthesis 
biomarkers (serum  fibroblast growth factor 1 9 [s-F GF19] and plasma  7α Hydroxy 
4-cholesten -3-one [ p-C4]) identified the expected  decrease in s-FGF19 and an increase in p -
C4.  In addition, total plasma bile acids decreased and total fecal bile acids increased in 
A4250-t reated patients compared to placebo. A 4250 was generally well tolerated.  The only 
findings were GI- related effects, such as diarrhea at higher doses.  
In the ADME study, healthy  subjects were administered  a single oral dose of 3 mg  
[14C]-A4250 capsule.  The main excretion route was determined to be fecal.  There were no 
quantifiable concentrations of A4250 in plasma or total radioactivity in plasma or whole blood.  A4250 was well tolerated.  AEs were reported and most were mild and not related to A4250. T he 3 AEs experienced by 2 subjects repor ted as related to study drug were GI  in 
nature, including diarrhea  (2 AEs; 2 subjects ) and abdominal pain (1 AE; 1 subject ). 
In an exploratory Phase 2 study in children with cholestatic pruritus, A4250 was administered  
as oral daily doses of 0.01 to 0.2 mg /kg for 4 weeks .  Twenty patients  (8 females, 1 2 males) 
aged 1 to 17 years  were enrolled in this ope n-label dos e-escalation study.  Four patients were 
re-enrolled into a s econd dose level.  No treatmen t-related SAEs were reported, and most

 AEs, including s ome increased transaminases, were transient.  Fou r-week, onc e-daily 
treatment with A4250 reduced mean levels of s -BA in all cohorts.  Substantial s -BA 
reductions in 11 of 13 PFIC patients  (ranging from 43% to 98%) were observed.  A4250 also 
reduced s -BA in  the 11  non- PFIC patients, but to a lesser extent than in PFIC patients.  
Patient -reported diar ies documented improvement of the visual analogue scale (VAS) -itch 
score in 17 of 24 patients  during treatment.  The dose with the greatest improvement showed 
a mean decrease (±SEM) of 2.9 ±1.1 from baseline.  The results from this trial form the basis 
of the current (A4250-005) study design. 
5.3 Rationale 
In this investigational study, A4250 is under  development for treatment of PFIC and is also 
being considered for other or phan cholestatic liver diseases.  
There is currently no medical treatment approved for PFIC.  In PFIC patients with severe 
pruritus, biliary diversion surgery is  used to decrease systemic bile acids  through interruption 
of the  enterohepatic circulat ion and thereby reducing pruritus  [Whitington 1988].  Liver 
transplantation is typically used as an option when patients have failed medical treatment 
and/or biliary diversion and have liver failure or persistent uncontrolled pruritus. 
By inhibiting IBAT with high selectivity and potency, A4250 has the potential to relieve 
cholestasis and improve liver function without surgical intervention in patients with PFIC.  
Since A4250 is minimally absorbed and achieves a substantial reduction of s-BA, it has the 
potential  to be a safer an d less invasive alternative to surgical biliary drainage .  The rationale 
for using A4250 is to decrease s-BA levels,  and to reduce the major morbidity of pruritus, 
improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected with PFIC.  Ultimately, this 
noninvasive therapeutic approach has the potential to not only improve quality of life (QoL), 
but also reduce the need for biliary diversion and subsequent liver failure and liver transplantation. 
The doses selected for this study, 40 and 120 µg/kg/day, were chosen  based on the efficacy 
(reduction of  s-BA and pruritus ) and safety data generated from patients with PFIC and other 
types of cholestasis dosed in the exploratory Phase 2 study (A4250-003).  This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Patients completing 2 4 weeks  of doubl e-blind treatment will be offered to enter Study 
A4250-008 and receive open-l abel treatment wi th A4250.

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
7.1.1 Description  
This is a doubl e-blind, randomi zed, placeb o-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day of A4250 compared to placebo in 
children with PFIC  (deficiencies of FIC1 or BSEP).  
Study data will be periodically reviewed by an unblinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB).  
The study includes a 14- to 56-day Screening Period followed by a 24-we ek Treatment 
Period  and a 4-week Follow -Up Period. 
After complet ion of  the Screening Period, eligible patients  (20 per treatment group) will be 
randomized on Day 0 (Visit 3) in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of 
A4250, or a matchi ng placebo. 
All patients completing Day 168 (Visit 9) in this study will be invited  to participate in a 
72-week  open- label extension study (A4250-008) in which all patients will receive  active 
treatment.  
There will be 10 visits during the study ( Figure  1); 4 of them can be performed, where 
permitted by local regulations, by a study nurse visiting the patient at home, and 1 scheduled 
telephone contact, as follows: 
• Visit 1: Screening Period start. Patient is considered  enrolled after signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) (D ays -56 to  -14) 
• Visit 2: Screening Visit 2 ( Days -28 to - 7) 
• Visit 3: Randomization Visit (Day 0) 
• Telephone Contact 1: ( Day 14) 
• Visit 4: Clinic Visit ( Day 28) 
• Visit 5: Clinic or Home Visit (Day 56) 
• Visit 6: Clinic  Visit ( Day 84) 
• Visit 7: Clinic or Home Visit (Day 126) 
• Visit 8: Clinic or Home Visit (Day 154) 
• Visit 9: Clinic  Visit, End of Treatment ( Day 168) 
• Visit 10: Follow-Up V isit, 28 days after last dose of study drug, or  if a patient 
discontinues prematurely ( Day 196).  Patients continuing in Study A425 0-008 will not 
have this follow-up visit.  
 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 23 
 Additional clinical visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance, e .g., 
due to AE monitoring, to fulfil  screening requirements , and/or for safety maintenance.  
Screening Period  
As soon as a patient is considered for this study and prior to any other study procedures being 
conducted by the investigator/investigative s taff, the caregiver/patient will have the nature of 
the study explained to him/her and be asked to sign an ICF.  After signing the form, patients 
will be evaluated for study eligibility .  Informed consent must be obtained prior to any study 
procedures that do not form a part of the patient’s normal care.  
Prior to entering the S creening P eriod, patients who complete the consenting process  and 
require medication washout  will have the appropriate washout period for prohibited 
medications ( see Appendix 1) before the screening  visit (Clinic Visit 1) is performed.  This 
visit can be conducted immediately for patients who have signed the ICF and do not requir e 
drug washout. 
If the patients have had a liver biopsy performed the results from the biopsy should be 
recorded in the electronic case repo rt form (eCRF ).  Daily recording of pruritus using an 
electronic diary (eDiary ) to determine confirmation of the magnitude and the baseline 
pruritus symptoms before the study will be started.  Patients  failing inclusion due to 
laboratory values or pruritus  scores , as indexed by caregiver -reported observed scratching, 
can be rescreened after 2 months .  Patients not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria after 
3 attempts are not allowed to re screen.  
Caregivers/patients will be instructed on the daily use of the eDiary  (see Appendix 2).  The 
eDiary  will include patient-reported outcome (PRO) and observer-reported outcome (ObsRO) 
items for evaluation of itching (PRO), scratching (ObsRO),  and sleep disturbance  (PRO and 
ObsRO)  during the Screening  Period (Study Days  -56 to 0) and throughout the 24-w eek 
Treatment Period (Study Days  0 to 168) .  Additionally, care giver s/patients will be requested 
to use the diary to report the date and time each dose of study drug is administ ered during the 
Treatment Period.  
There will be a ±42 day  window for the Screening Period; therefore, up to 56 days of diary 
entries are possible.  However, only the most recent 7 days before randomization will be used 
for eligibility and baseline calculations .  Observer-r eported outcomes in patients  of all ages  
will be recorded by a caregiver (or caregiver’s designee) .  If possible, the same caregiver  will 
complete the ObsRO items throughout the study.  If there is more than one primary caregiver 
(e.g., if  parents are divorced and share custody), multiple caregivers will be included in the 
initial training.  
At a second screening visit ( Visit 2) that can be performed at the clinic or in the patient’s 
home, additional laboratory samples will be taken for eligibility assessments.

Confidential   Page 24 
 Treatment Period  
Eligibility for enroll ment will be determined at Visit 3 using the pruritus (scratching reports 
from the ObsRO)  data in the week before Visit 3 and the liver biochemistry evaluations from 
the 2 previous screening visits.  Two weeks after Visit 3, there will be a telephone contact 
with the clinic to evaluate any AEs.  
The patient will return to the clinic at Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, and Visit 9 for 
assessments.  Visit 5, Visit 7, and Visit 8 m ay, alter natively, be performed in the patient’s 
home by a study nurse, if permitted by local regulations.  If a new caregiver will begin to 
complete the ObsRO during the course of the trial, they will be provided with training during a clinic visit before they beg in to use the eDiary . 
The last dose of study drug will be administered the day before Visit 9.  At Study Visit 9, the 
patient has the option to enroll in an ope n-label extension study (A4250-008).  If the patient 
is continuing into Study A4250-008 this wil l be the last visit in this study and the first visit in 
Study A4250-008.  This visit should also be performed if the patient is prematurely withdrawn from the study. 
Clinic Visit 10 will take place 2 8 days after Visit 9 for patients not continuing into S tudy 
A4250-008.  All patients prematurely withdrawn will have this visit 2 8 days after the last 
dose of study drug.

 7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The results from Study A4250-003 have in formed the current (A4250-005) study design. 
7.2.1 Risk/Benefit and Ethical Assessment  
A4250 has been evaluated in 3 Albire o-sponsored clinical  studies: 1 double-blind 
placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers , 1 single-dose ADME study, and 1 Phase 2 
study in children with cholestatic pruritus.  In addition, an investigator-s ponsored study has 
been conducted in patients with PBC. 
A total of 98 subjects /patients  have been exposed to A4250.  Healthy subjects have been 
exposed to up to 10 mg  as a single dose and up to 3 mg  daily as part of a multiple -dose 
evaluation .  Children with cholestatic liver disease have been treated with up to 
0.2 mg /kg/day (200 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks .  In total, 2 SAEs  have been reported ; both were 
judged by the physician to be not related to the study drug. 
Patients with cholestatic liver diseases suffer from excess  bile acids in the liver resulting in 
tissue damage.  A commonly used treatment in these patients is bile diversion surgery, 
whereby approximately 50% to 100% of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids  is 
interrupted.  Inhibition of IBAT with A4250, thereby interrupting the enterohepatic 
circulation of bi le acids,  is therefore a potential medical alternative to surgery  which c ould be 
of benefit to these patients  if shown to be effective and safe.  
Based on the mode of action of an IBAT inhibitor, loose stools or diarrhea could be expected.  However, in the  pediatric Phase 2 study with 4 weeks  daily treatment, only 1 patient  had mild 
transient diarrhea after a single dose that did not recur on multiple dosing. 
7.2.2 Early Termination 
This study may be terminated at any time by Albireo if serious side effects should occur, if 
the investigator does not adhere to the protocol ; or if, in the sponsor's judg ment, there are no 
further benefits t o be achieved from the study.  In this event, Albireo /designee will inform the 
study investigators, institutions, and all regulat ory authorities. 
Albireo may temporarily or permanently discontinue the study at an investigative site at any 
time for safety, ethical, compliance , or other reasons.  If this is necessary, Albireo will 
endeavo r to provide advance notification to the site .  If a site or the study is suspended or 
discontinued, the investigator/investigative s taff will be responsible for promptly informing 
the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) .  If required by local regulations, Albireo/designee 
will be responsible  for inform ing the IEC and the r egulatory a uthority of study or site 
discontinuation.  In such an event, all study data and unused study drug must be returned to Albireo. 
7.3 Selection of Study Population 
A total of 6 0 patients  with clinical diagnosis of PFIC 1 or 2 that  has been genetically 
confirmed  will be randomized .

7.3.3 Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients /caregivers  will be infor med that they have the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their

regardless of reason for withdrawal, record any patient data they receive concerning SAEs, 
and all drug-r elated no n-serious AEs, and subsequently report these to Albireo.  Withdrawn 
patients will not be replaced.  
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances:

 8 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
A4250 and plac ebo will be  supplied as capsules for oral administration.  White opaque 
capsules filled with p ellets containing A4250 or placebo will be provided.  Two different 
capsule sizes will be available, as follows: 
• Capsule size 0 that can be opened  
• Capsule size 3 that can be opened or swallowed intact  
The content of the A4250 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance.  Capsule 
filling weight will also be identical for high dose, low dose , and placebo.  Bottles with 
34 capsules will be given  to the patien t at each visit.  A patient  who requires  2 or more 
capsules per day will be given multiple bottles . 
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with  A4250 at a dose of  40 µg/kg/day, 120 µg/kg/day, or placebo for 
24 weeks .  Study drug will be dispen sed to the patient  at Visits  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, together 
with instructions on how to store and take the drug.  Study drug administration data, 
including whether each patient took each dose or partial doses of study drug, whether there 
were any delayed o r missed doses,  and whether the capsule was opened or swallowed whole  
will be documented through the eDiary  and transferred to the study database. 
A4250 should be taken in the morning, together with food.  On clinic visits days when 
laboratory assessments are conducted ( Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) study drug should be taken 
after the visit and after laboratory samples are taken .  Patients should not crush or chew the 
capsule(s).  When swallowing the capsule intact, the patient should administer the dose with a glass of water.  
For a patient unable to swallow capsule  intact , the capsule can be opened and the contents 
sprinkled and mixed in a small amount of soft roo m-temperature yogurt, apple sauce , or fruit 
purée.  The amount of food should be less than what the patient/infant is expected to eat and 
should be followed by water.  
1. Hold the capsule over the prepared food, gently twist open and allow the content to fall 
into food 
2. Mix the entire capsule content with 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL ) of soft food (appl e 
sauce, fruit purée, or yogurt) 
3. Administer the mixture immediately after mixing.  
The number of capsules provided to the patient will  be based on body weight  at Visit 3.  At 
Visit 6, if a patient’s weight has shifted to another weight category (identified i n Table 3 ), the 
number of capsules per day may be adjusted.

8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Label ing 
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling  
The capsules will be packed in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers, with 
child -proof polypropylene caps.  Study drug capsules containing A4250 in the strength 
specified in Table 3  above will be manufactured. 
Packaging and labeling  will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment packs containing A4250 capsules should be stored and dispensed in accordance 
with regulations in their original containers.  The storage facility at the  investigative site 
should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15 °C and 25°C. 
Patients /caregivers  should be informed of appropriate storage conditions (i .e., room 
temperature, between 15°C and 25°C ). 
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to 
Albireo and the study drug  should not be used until authorization has been given by Albireo. 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Drug  
A doubl e-blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, an 8-digit patient 
identification number will be assigned.  The first 2 digits will denote the country, followed by 
a 3-digit site number and a 3-digit patient sequence number.  This number will be created and 
allocated by the  Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ), when the patient first enters the 
system at screening .  The randomization codes will be compute r-generated by  
Biostatistics , and kept by a statistician independent from the project team.  The 

 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 41 
 randomization will be done in blocks and stratified according to PFIC class (Type 1 and 2) 
and age class ( 6 months to 5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ) to ensure approximate 
balance between dose schemes (1:1:1).  A separate randomi zation list will be prepared for the 
maximum 5 patients  from S tudy A4250- 003 regardless of stratification.  Randomization 
codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization. 
Patients who are eligible for randomi zation will be assigned a unique 4-digit randomization 
number by IWRS .  This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to 
the patient.  Patients who withdra w from the study after randomization visit are not to be 
replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size.  
Patients will receive capsule(s) of A4250 acco rding to their dose group or capsule(s) of 
matching placebo once  a day during the doubl e-blind T reatment Period.  Labels on the study 
drug containers will not identify the treatment that a patient is randomized to.  Traceability of 
the treatment is ensured  by the study drug number. 
The 5-digit study drug number will identify study drug packs and will be detailed on the 
study drug label.  Dispensing of study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study drug number corresponding to the randomization arm.  The 
randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure no unblinding and will not be displayed to end-u sers in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently r equired (i .e., knowledge of treatment 
codes is required to adequately manage a lif e-threatening situation), the investigator at that 
study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS without the need for communication with the  Medical Monitor. 
The study site investigator and appropriate  project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS.  The system will require the  
user to enter an authori zation key number to complete the emergency unbl inding transaction.  
The exact description of the treatment assigned to the individual patient then will be 
accessible.  Emergency unblinding can thus be made for any patient without affecting the 
double-blind nature of the study.  Patient treatment information may only be accessed in the event of an emergency and out of necessity to know the identity of the allocated study drug in 
order to institute appropriate therapeutic management.  The investigator should make every 
effort to discuss the rationale for emergency unblinding with the  Medical Monitor 
prior to unblinding the individual patient.  Once the randomization code is broken for a 
patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures at 
Visit 9 should be performed.  As a follo w-up, Visit 10 will be performed according to the 
time schedule.  In the event that emergency unblinding is performed, the investigator can 
view and must print the unblinding confirmation document from IWRS.  The investigator 
must record on the confirmation document printout the reason for the emergency unblinding, 

 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 42 
 and sign the document.  The confirmation document must then be kept in a safe place until 
the end of the study.  Once a randomization code has been broken, the investigator must 
inform  the  Medical Monitor in writing within 2 4 hours. 
8.5 Patient  Compliance 
The study nurse  will monitor eDiary  compliance by daily review of the CRF health webs ite.  
If both  diary entries on a day  are missing  during the baseline week or Week  24, the study 
nurse will call the patient/caregiver to remind them to complete all scheduled entries .  Any 
noncompliance will be documented and explained in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
Study drug compliance will also be checked through diary responses.  Additionally, patients 
will return all unused study drug at Visits  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The study site staff  will count 
all returned drug, assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF . 
Treatment Compliance = 100 × ((Number of study drug dispensed – number of study drug 
returned )/number of study drug that should be taken ). 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% will be acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the 
invent ory at the study site(s), of each  use of the study treatment(s) for each patient , and of the 
return of unused study treatment(s) to Albireo . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients . 
The investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the patients  were provided the quantities  specified in the protocol and that all study drug 
received from Albireo  is reconciled .  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy and Prohibited Medications  
The investigator will note a ll ongoing medication and any medication recently (within 
1 month) stopped in the eCRF at Visit 1.  At Visits  2 through 10, all changes in medication 
(stopping or starting new medication and changes in dose) will be recorded in the eCRF.  All 
treatment for pruritus (prescribed or not) and changes in the treatment will also be recorded. 
All medications taken by a patient within 1 month  prior to the first intake of study drug are 
regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which 
continue to be taken during the study, are regarded as concomitant medication.   
Prohibited medications are listed in  Appendix 1.

 9.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1 Serum Bile Acids  
Blood samples for analysis of fasting total s -BA will be drawn at all visits (in clinic  and at 
patient’s home).  Patients will fast for at least 4 hours prior to the taking of samples for s -BA, 
except for water intake.  However, less than a 4-hour fast prior to the blood draw will be 
accepted in infants who are unable to fast for 4 hours .  S amples will be treated and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.2 Itching and Sleep Score  
Itching, observed scratching, and sleep disturbance will be assessed twice each day via 
eDiary .  Patients and/or caregivers wi ll be instructed to complete the eDiary  every day in the 
morning after the patient wakes and in the evening just before the patient goes to sleep throughout the study.  Patients and caregivers will receive a formal training session during 
Visit 1.  Trainin g materials describing the ObsRO and PRO items are included in  
Appendix 2. 
The eDiary  includes ObsRO and PRO items.  Patients < 8 years  of age will not be asked to 
complete the PRO items; only the ObsRO will be completed by caregivers of patients in this 
age group.  Older patients , 8 to 17 years  of age, will complete the PRO items and the 
caregiver will complete the ObsRO items.  The PRO items assess severity of itch, aspects of 
sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and tiredness.  For patients 8 to 12 years  of age, the 
caregiver will read the PRO items along with the child and record the child’s response.  A guide will be provided to the caregivers that provides standardized explanations of the PRO items, in case the patient is confused or requires clarifi cation about the meaning of a question.  
The ObsRO items assess severity of observed scratching, aspects of observed sleep disturbance (morning diary only), and observed signs of tiredness (evening diary only).  The ObsRO and PRO scratching and itch severi ty items use 0 to 4 response scales, where each 
response is distinguished by a unique facial expression, verbal anchor, number, and color code ( Appendix 2).  
A daily score for the ObsRO scratching item will be calculated by selecting the maximum 
scratching  severity score from the 2 ratings for each day.  A daily score will be considered 
missing if both of the daily assessments are missing.  A weekly score will be calculated by 
averaging the daily scratching scores.  A weekly score will be considered missing if >4 out of 
7 days of data are missing.  The same approach will be used to calculate a patien t-reported 
itch severity score.  
Additionally, patients/caregivers will be requested to report in the diary the date and time that 
each dose of study drug was adm inistered during the Treatment Period.  Details of the 
questions included in the diary, including the PRO/ObsRO tool used in the study, are located 
in Appendix 2.

 9.2.3 Growth and IGF -1 
Growth will be measured as h eight ( velocity) and weight ( z-score) using a certified weight 
scale (i .e., stadiometer ). 
Blood samples for IGF -1 will be drawn at randomization ( Visit 3), and at end of treatment 
(Visit 9) .  Samples will be handled and transported to a central laboratory according to 
instructions in the laboratory manual.  
9.2.4 Quality of Life (PedsQL) Questionnaire  
Patients will be asked to fill out a QoL questionnaire (PedsQL) at Visit 3 and Visit 9.  Details 
of the questions included on the questionnaire are provided in Appendix 4.  
9.2.5 Biomarkers  and Other Laboratory Samples 
Blood samples for AFP and LDL -C will be drawn at Visits  2, 4,  and 9.  Blood samples for 
autotaxin and p-C4 will be drawn at Visits  3, 4, and 9 (only for children with body 
weight ≥10 kg) .  Samples will be handled and transported to a central laboratory per 
instructions in the laboratory manual. 
9.2.6 PELD/MELD Score  
At randomization and end of treatment, PELD score will be calculated for children up to 
12 years  of age .  For children 13 years  or older, the MELD score will be calculated.  
PELD Score = 4.80 * ln(bilirubin in mg/dL ) + 1 8.57 * ln(INR) - 6.87 * ln(albumin in g/dL ) + 
4.36 ( if patient < 1 year : scores for patients listed for liver transplantation  before the patient's 
first birthday continue to include the value assign ed for age (< 1 year ) until the patient reaches 
the age of 2 4 months ) + 6 .67 (i f the patient has growth failure [≤2 standard deviation]) 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 for the calculation of the PELD score. 
MELD Score = 9.57 * ln( creatin ine in mg/dL ) + 3 .78 * ln( bilirubin  in mg/dL ) + 
11.2 * ln(INR) + 6.43 
Laboratory values less than 1.0 will be set to 1.0 and serum creatinine values greater than 
4.0 mg /dL will be set to 4.0 for calculation of the MELD score. 
9.2.7 Liver Ultrasonography 
Ultrason ography of liver and spleen will be performed at randomization (Visit 3) and at end 
of treatment  (Visit 9) .  Liver and spleen size, masses, and nodules should be recorded. 
9.2.8 Markers of Fibrosis  
APRI score and Fib -4 score will be calculated at r andomization and at end of treatment.  
APRI = [(AST in U/L) / (AST ULN in U/L)] / (Platelets in 109/L) 
Fibrosis 4 Score = (Age*AST in U/L) / (Platelets  in 109/L * √(ALT  in U/L ).

Patients, caregivers, and clinicians will complete  the patient global impression of change 
(PGIC) and the patient global impression of symptom ( PGIS) measures  (Appendix 3) at 
randomization (Visit 3), Visits 4 and 6, and at end of treatment (Visit 9) . 
The PGIC items assess change in itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician 
versions), and sleep (all versions) since starting the study medication.  The PGIS items assess 
itch (patient version), scratching (caregiver and clinician versions), and sleep (all versions) in 
the past week .  Caregivers and clinicians will complete the PGIC and PGIS  for all  patients; 
those patients ≥8 years  of age will complete the patient version .

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safet y assessments are described in Section 7.1.4 and in Table 1 
above. 
The primary safety analysis for this study will include the incidence of treatmen t-emergent 
adverse ev ents (TEAE) , study drug exposure compared to placebo, all safety assessments 
including AEs from  patient reports , and the patient diaries.  The analysis includes causality, 
severity, and seriousness assessments made by the investigator. 
Trends in safety wil l also be assessed for the following assessments:  
• Physical examinations 
• Concomitant medications at all visits  
• Vital signs at all clinic visits  
• Laboratory test results (including hematology, clinical chemistry , liver monitoring, and 
urinalysis) 
• SAEs including the description, incidence, severity, and causality from signing the ICF to 
completion of the study 
• Discontinuations due to AEs 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions  and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of 
causal relationship with study drug.  An AE can therefore be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled (ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not 
related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of new condition.  Patient-repor ted events and 
protocol-m andated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exam ination findings can be 
considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to baseline.  Examples of clinically significant worsening from baseline could include, but is not 
limited to, events causing withdrawal from the study and events requiring medical intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant 
by the investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below.  
These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or no n-serious.  The assessment 
 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 49 
 is made independently of severity assessment ( Section 10.1.1.3).  For example, the 
development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of informed consent may not meet 
serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, non-serious AE. 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered an SAE: 
• The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening .  Lif e-threatening means that the patient is, in the 
opinion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have caused death 
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event .  Important medical events may meet serious 
criteria should  the investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, 
represent a significant hazard, or requires medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of potential SAEs based on this criteria include, but 
are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring inte nsive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse. 
10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intens ity of the event in relation to expectation.  The 
investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild ( awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in 
Section 10.1.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet 
serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE. 
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessm ent 
The i nvestigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medical judgment 
and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to the study medication, and de-c hallenge or r e-challenge.  The 
causality assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows .

 Based on medical judgmen t, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient  
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug.  (It 
should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness) 
• The event reappears or worsens when th e study drug is re-a dministered  
Unrelated to study drug (i.e., unlikely, probably not, or definitely not related) 
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the 
event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient's clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-a dministered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically significant worsening from baseline, thereby considered an AE.  For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section 10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non-s erious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the I CF 
and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit 10), 28 days after the final dose of study drug or 
up until premature discontinuation. 
Any AEs or SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by the investigator  for as long as medically indicated, but without further 
recording in the CRF.  Albireo retains the right to request additional information for any 
patient with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study. 
 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 51 
 Investigators must follow patients with AEs an d SAEs until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilized.  If the patient dies, this should be captured as the outcome of the AE 
unless no link can be established, in which case death will be reported as a separate event.  
If a patient is lost to follo w-up, this should be captured accordingly within the AE eCRF and 
on a follow-up SAE report for tracking purposes. TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization ( Day 0).  All AEs that occur in 
the Screening Period, i.e., after enrollmen t and prior to randomization, will be collected on 
the eCRF as no n-treatment emergent AEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine 
study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinic al diagnosis will be reported as 
an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis.  For example, if an investigator diagnoses a study patient  with hepatitis during the study period, hepatitis 
would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and 
therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the caregiver/patient has 
signed the ICF and until the pos t-treatment follo w-up ( Visit 10), and 28 days after the final 
dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the eCRF SAE Report Form.  The 
clinical research organization (CRO) pharmacovigilance manager (PVM) should at the same 
time be notified of the event by e-mail.  A confirmation of receipt must be sent to the 
investigator within 1 working day.   
Report of a SAE must include at least  the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, initials, and date of birth) 
• The last study drug administration date 
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinic al course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset 
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious 
• The relationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (e.g., the investigator's assessment of causality) 
• A brief narrative of the SAE  
 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 52 
 Follo w-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared and the information collected in the SAE eCRF submitted to the CRO 
PVM by e-m ail within 2 4 hours of knowledge of the event. 
The PVM may contact the investigator to obtain further information on a reported SAE.  The 
investigator/investigative staff must respond to any request for follow-up information or 
answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same timelines as for initial reports.  
The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE and follo w-up to the Albireo medical monitor 
for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 60 days after the last 
administration of study drug, an AE form and an SAE form should be completed, detailing 
the AE that resulted in the death.   (Note: death is an outcome, not an event.) 
The report should contain a comment  regarding the c o-involvement of progression of disease, 
if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death. 
All SAE reports must be e-mailed to the following number within 24 hours : 
 
 
If email is unavailable, SAEs may be transmitted via fax to the following number: 
 
In a study-r elated medical emergency situation, when the assigned medical monit ors for the 
study cannot be reached by a caller, an on call physician can be reached 2 4 hours per day, 
7 days per week, via the  call center .  The following number is a chargeable telephone 
number allowing a global reach from both landlines and mobile phones and the internet page 
is a list of countr y-specific tol l-free telephone numbers that is provided.  It should be noted 
that not all countries globally have access to tol l-free numbers as indicated o n the 
“24/7 Medical Help desk” index.  Countries without tol l-free numbers need to dial the 
chargeable number as indicated above.  Furthermore, toll-free numbers might not be available 
from mobile phones. 
 
 
The  representative will work with the investigator to compile all the necessary 
information and ensure that the appropriate sponsor representative receives a report within 
1 day  (24 hours ) for all fatal and lif e-threatening cases and within 5 days for all other SAEs. 
10.1.4 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that occurs in a patient due to exposure to an investigational product that may or may not be dos e-related and is 
unexpected per sponsor assessment. 

 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 53 
 For this clinical study there is an established reporting system for SUSARs (definitions 
cf. Directive 2001/20/EC), which shall ensure that all relevant information about SUSARs is 
recorded and reported to the competent authority and the Ethics Committee according to the 
requirements of Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (d) of Directive 2001/20/EC, i.e., in the case of fatal 
or lif e-threatening SUSARs as soon as possible, and in any case no later than 7 days with 
relevant follo w-up information within an additional 8 days , and all other SUSARs to be 
reported as soon as possible but within a maximum of 15 days of first knowledge by the 
sponsor.  The investigator will be kept informed by Albireo without undue delay.  The setup 
of the SUSAR reporting system is described in written standard operating procedures to 
ensure compliance with the necessary quality standards at every stage of reporting and 
follo w-up, which is in line with the communication from the commission: detailed guidance 
on the collection, verification, and presentation of AE/reaction reports arising from clinical 
trials on medicinal products for human use (CT-3: O.J. 2011/C 172/01 of 11.6.2011). 
It is the sponsor’s responsibility to report SUSARs to appropriate regulatory authorities and 
ethics committees , which cumulatively have a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
to the investigational product, are serious, and are unexpected.  The minimum information 
will include the valid European Union drug regulatory agency clinical trial (EUDRACT) 
number, study number, the identifiable coded patient, the identifiable reporter, the SUSAR, the investigational product (including active substance name and code), and the causality 
assessment.  
Reporting of SUSARs as individual case safety reports (ICSR), including the required 
administrative information, will be performed through the Eudravigilance Clinical Trial 
Module (EVCTM) to the competent authorities in Europe and through the FDA Adverse 
Event Reporting System and ICH E2B(R3) message standard.  The Ethic s Committee and all 
investigators involved in this study will be informed according to national and international 
requirements.  Albireo may delegate the SUSAR reporting to  
10.2 Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Physical Examinations and Other Safety 
Assessme nts 
10.2.1 Laboratory Assessments 
Blood samples will be drawn for clinical chemistry, high sensitivity c -reactive protein 
(hsCRP), international normalized ratio ( INR), and hematology analyses  as shown in Table 1.  
Blood will be drawn with patient in a fasting state for ≥ 4 hours.  Samples will be handled and 
transported to a central laboratory per instructions in the laboratory manual. 
Routine laboratory parameters are listed in Tab le 4. 
The observed values will be recorded and assessed as “normal” or “abnormal not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal clinically significant”.  
The total amount of blood drawn during the whole study period is estimated to be 
approximately 59 mL  (11 mL for children with body weight <10 kg over a 4 -week period;  
Table 2 above).  Additional blood may also be drawn at unscheduled visits for bile acids if

 needed due to analysis failure; if other safety blood samples a re needed due to follow -up of 
an abnormal value or analysis failure, the blood volume will increase accordingly.  The blood 
samples collected for safety laboratory analysis will be destroyed after the analyses have been completed.

10.2.2 Liver Monitoring  
Strategies to monitor markers of liver disease throughout the study are outlined below where 
the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and sex .  
If ALT >3 × individual baseline or ALT >15 × ULN during treatment 
AND  
bilirubin >2 × individual baseline or bilirubin >2 × ULN (if baseline <ULN) 
Weekly monitoring should be initiated 
If ALT continues to increase AND ALT >5 × individual baseline 
AND  
bilirubin >3 × individual baseline OR bilirubin >3 × UL N (if baseline <ULN)  
OR 
ALT >20 × ULN irrespective of bilirubin 
Study medication should be stopped and weekly monitoring continued. 
If ALT and bilirubin returns to 1.5 × individual baseline or <2 × ULN study medication could 
be restarted.  
ULN will be base d on central laboratory reference values for age and sex.

 10.2.3 Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information (age, birth year, gender, race, and ethnicity), along with medical 
and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF at Visit 1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the CRF at Visit 1.  This includes date of 
diagnosis of PFIC, historical (3 months prior to screening) LFT values (AST, ALT, 
bilirubin), ongoing medication, any surgery performed, any other diagnos is, and historical 
biopsy data.  If a biopsy is performed during the study, this will be recorded in the eCRF at 
the visit closest after the biopsy.  Patients with biopsy data not older than 2 years at study 
start will be given the opportunity to participat e in a sub -study to evaluate the effect of A4250 
on liver histology. 
10.2.4 Clinical Genetic Testing  
If clinical genetic testing for verification of PFIC diagnosis has been performed prior to 
enrollment  of patients in the study, the results will be entered in the eCRF.  Verification of 
the clinical lab oratory report will be performed by a central reader to determine eligibility.  
Eligibility confirmation will be returned to the site within 7 days after receipt of the clinical 
genetic test result lab oratory form . 
Regardless of previous testing, a blood sample will be drawn at Visit 1 on all patients for 
DNA extract and freeze.  Genetic testing will only be performed on this sample if clinical 
testing is equivocal, unavailable, or unobtainable.  In such cases, scree ning for pathologic 
biallelic variations in the ATP8B1  or ABCB11  genes will be performed if patient meets 
remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria and only after sponsor case review.  No other diagnostic genetic testing will be offered . 
10.2.5 Physical Examination 
A physician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical exami nation at Visits  1, 3, and 9.  A  skin exam  (only) will be conducted at Visits 4, 6, and 10  
(see Table 1).  
A complete p hysical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, 
genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
Skin will be examin ed thoroughly and excori ations/scratch marks recorded.  
10.2.6 Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits.  This includes blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic, measured after the patient has been in a seated position for  ≥3 minutes  of rest), 
pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, height and body weight  (using a certified weight scale  
and consistent site -specific guidelines; e.g., removal of outer coat, shoes) at clinic visits .  
Body mass index (B MI) will be calculated .

 10.2.7 Overdose 
A4250 is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability.  Based on toxicology 
data, for study purposes any dose exceeding a total of > 3 mg /kg body weight of A4250 taken 
as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 24 hours is defined as an overdose.   
The n o-adverse-e ffect dose level in the most sensitive species (defined as 2 0 mg /kg/day) in 
the rat 1 month toxicity study gives a human equivalent dose of approximately 194 mg /day in 
a 60 kg person.  This dose is approximately 10-f old higher than the maximum possible dose 
predicted in human studies (20 mg ).  
The investigator /investigative staff  should immediately and not later than within 2 4 hours of 
knowledge of the overdose, be reported by the investigator or delegate in the eCRF SAE 
report form.  Any overdose, according to the definition above, must also be recorded in the 
study drug section of the patient’s eCRF.  In the event of an A4250 overdose, the patient 
should be monitored closely.  Hospitalization should be considered as an alternative for 
observation and for appropriate supportive treatment. 
If the investigator and/or Albireo consider the overdose event to be a medically important 
condition, then it should be reported as an SAE in the same expedited manner as an SAE 
(please refer to Section 10.1.3).  
10.2.8 Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered before the end of dosing the patient  will be immediately 
discontinued from further dosing in the study.  If the pregnancy is discovered after the end of 
dosing the patient  will continue in the study per protocol. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE.  However , if the patient  has been dosed with the 
study drug, the pregnancy must be reported on the Paper Pregnancy Notification Form 
immediately within 2 4 hours after recognition to Albireo /Safety Manager  (please refer to 
Section 10.1.3) .  Date of exposure and as far as possible, details of the period of gestation at 
the time of exposure must be given. 
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous 
termination, details of birth , and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or 
newborn or maternal complication .  Individual cases with an abnormal outcome in 
association with  the study drug should be reported on an expedited basis, i.e., reported rapidly 
to a competent authority.

 11 STATISTICAL EVALUATION 
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
for the doubl e-blind T reatment Period and until major protocol violations have been 
identified.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
11.1 Sample Size and Power 
For the EU and RoW , the primary analysis will relate to the bile acid responder endpoint (at 
the 1-sided 2.5% level) .  For the US , the primary analysis will relate to the pruritus endpoint 
(at the 1-sided 2.5% level).  
Assuming 60% responders (patients experiencing at least 70% reduction in fasting s-BA 
levels or reaching ≤70 µ mol/L) in the A4250 dose group and 10% responders in the placebo 
group, 20 patients  per group are needed to achieve a power of 90% with a  2.5% 1-sided 
Type- 1 error.  
For pruritus, w ith 20 patients  per treatment gr oup, the power is approximately 90% given an 
assumed t reatment effect difference of -1.0 in change from baseline (-1.6 for A4250 
and -0.6 for placebo) on the ObsRO scratching score with a standard deviation of 0.95 and a  
Type I error of 2.5% (1-sided). 
This gives an overall power of approximately 80% for both endpoints. 
11.2 Statistical Methods  
11.2.1 Statistical Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  The safety 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for safety analyses.  
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all patients randomized with a valid baseline and at 
least 1 valid pos t-baseline m easurement  for at least 1 efficacy variable, such as fasting s -BA, 
pruritus score, ALT, IGF -1, sleep disturbance (PRO/ObsRO), and PedsQL .  Patients will be 
analyzed in the treatment group they were randomized to even if they received incorrect study drug.  The FAS will be the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Modified Full Analysis Set  
The modified full analysis set (mFAS) is a subset of the FAS and will consist of all randomized patients who were not included in Study A4250-003. 
 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 58 
 Per Protocol Anal ysis Set  
The per protocol ( PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS, and will consist of all randomized 
patients for whom no major  protocol violation  (no violation which may affect the study 
efficacy outcome)  is documented.  The PP analysis set will provide  supportive data for the 
efficacy analyses.  
Allocation of patient s to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study. 
11.2.2 Methods of Statistical Analyses 
11.2.2.1 General Principles  
The primary objective of this study is to show superiority in eff icacy of 
A4250 (120 µ g/kg/day and 40 µ g/kg/day) compared to placebo in patients with PFIC Types 1 
and 2. 
In the EU and RoW , for the primary efficacy variable fasting bile acid responder endpoint (at 
least a 70% reduction in fasting s-BA levels or reaching a level ≤7 0 µmol/L at the end of 
treatment), the null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative hypothesis (α = 0.025, 
1-sided). The test will be performed at a T ype I error rate of ≤0.025 1-s ided, as described above, based 
on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean probability scale with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
The Type I error will be protected by performing a hierarchical structure of analysis with 
closed tests of hypotheses. 
A fixe d-sequence multiple testing a pproach will be used.  In the first step, the high dose 
(120 µg/kg/day) versus placebo will be tested at 2.5% 1-sided significance level.  If 
significant, the low dose (40 µ g/kg/day) versus placebo will also be tested, in a second step, 
at 2.5 % 1-sided si gnificance level.  The second step will only be considered confirmatory 
providing the previous step was successful.  If the previous step was not successful, the 
analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive. 
In the US, for the primary efficacy variable pruritus score endpoint (change from baseline to 
Week  24 in observe r-reported scratching), the null hypothesis will be tested against the 
alternative hypothesis (α=0.025, 1-sided). 
The test will be performed at a Type I error rate of ≤0.025 1-s ided, as described above, based 
on the least squares means of the treatment difference in mean change with corresponding 
95% confidence intervals.  
The Type I error will be protected by performing a hierarchical structure of analysis with 
closed tests of hypotheses using a fixe d-sequence multiple testing approach.  In the first step, 
the high dose (120 µ g/kg/day) versus placebo will be tested at 2.5% 1-sided significance 
level .  If significant, also the low dose (40 µ g/kg/day) versus placebo will be tested, in a 
second step, at 2.5 % 1-sided significance level.  The second step will only be considered 
 A4250 – IND 130591 
Module 5:  Clinical Study Reports 
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol A4250 -005 
 
Confidential   Page 59 
 confirmatory providing the previous step was successful.  If the previous step was not 
successful, the analysis of the following step will be considered descriptive. 
Secondary and exploratory outcome variables shall provide supportive efficacy and safety 
information regarding the differences between the treatment groups.  For secondary efficacy 
variables, supportive statistical tests will be made and P -values will be reported in 
exploratory way (if not otherwise specified).  No adjustments will be performed for multiple 
dose comparisons when testing the secondary and exploratory eff icacy variables.  
A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before study data are locked and unblinded.  
If not otherwise specified, the baseline value of a parameter is defined as the last assessment 
of that parameter o n or prior to the first intake of study treatment date. 
11.2.2.2 Missing Data 
For efficacy variables, with repeated measures, a mixed model will be employed with no additional imputation for missing values, i .e., based on “ observed cases”, except where 
otherwise specified.  
Follo w-up and continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment 
will be made.   These data will be included in the sensitivity analysis  for primary endpoints  
estimating a treatment effect taking loss of effect after disco ntinuation into account.  Because 
complete follo w-up of all patients discontinuing treatment may not be possible, a method to 
replace missing data for patients who discontinue the study will be prespecified (in the SAP) 
taking into account loss of effect a fter discontinuation (for example multiple imputation).  
No other replacement of missing values will be planned. 
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including medical 
and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the FAS.  
Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the safety analysis 
set. 
11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The following will be summarized (by treatment group and overa ll where applicable):  
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent) 
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study/withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason) 
Additionally, patients enrolled, included in the safety , in the FAS, and in the PP analysis set 
will be summarized by region.

 11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Variables 
The responder endpoint based on change in fasting bile acids will be analy zed in terms of the 
proportion of patients achieving the event of interest.  Patients in need of rescue therapy, i .e., 
biliary diversion will be classified as no n-responders after the biliary diversion.  
Generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM ) will be used with a logistic link, to allow for 
repeated assessments over time.  The model w ill include baseline value, treatment group, 
PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group  interaction.  The treatment by 
visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of significance.  Region will be included 
in the model as a random effect.  The contrasts of primary interest will be the treatment difference at Week  24; also, the difference at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will 
be estimated and analyzed .  An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the 
within-subject error.  Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure fails to converge. 
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in pruritus score  (indexed by 
observer- reported scratching)  will be analyzed  using a mixed model repea ted m easures 
(MMRM) analysis.  The contrast of primary interest will be treatment difference at Week  24 
but also the difference s at Week  4, Week  8, Week  12, and Week  18 will be estimated and 
analyzed .  Baseline pruritus score  will be included as covariate.   The model will include  
baseline value,  treatment group, PFIC class, age class, region, visit , and visit*treatment group 
interaction.  The treatment by visit interaction will remain in the model regardless of 
significance.  Region will be included in the model as a random effect and will be defined on 
country level .  An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the withi n-subject 
error.   Another covariance structure may be chosen if the fit of this structure fails to 
converge. 
Non-parametric app roach may be considered if more appropriate. 
The primary analyses will be based on the FAS. To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis, the following analyses will be 
performed:  
• Primary efficacy analysis using the PP set  
• Primary efficacy an alysis using the mFAS 
• Analyses to investigate the influence of missing values, for example , by multiple 
imputation technique 
Subgroup analyses will also be performed for each of the 3 age groups ( 6 months to 5 years , 
6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ). 
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed, such as the following:

 • Cochran Mantel Haenzsel test stratified on PFIC class to compare the proportion in 
fasting bile acid responder endpoint at the end of treatment  in the 2 A4250 dose groups to 
placebo group 
• Based on the primary analysis including the interaction age class*treatment  
• Same as primary analysis in which the random factor region is considered as fixed factor.  
The region*treatment interaction will also be explored  
• Same as primary analysis includin g the interaction PFIC*treatment  
Other s ensitivity analyses may be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.

The change in the secondary and explorative endpoints such as s- BA, total bilirubin, A LT, 
IGF-1, and patient -reported itch severity  will also be analy zed using the MMRM model as 
specified for the primary analysis .  Nonparametric methods may be applied as an alternative 
approach for some endpoints , if appropriate. 
Proportions of responders (e.g., meaningful reduction in itch severity and scratching at Week  24) will be analysed using the GLMM model as specified for the primary analysis. 
Comparisons of the change from baseline at Week  24 in PedsQL between the treatment 
groups will be conducted using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  The model will include terms for baseline, PFIC class, age class , region, and treatment .  
Undergoing biliary diversion surgery and/or listed for liver transplant,  all-cause mortality,  
and liver decompensation events will mainly be analyzed  by using descriptive statistics.  
Kaplan -Meier curves will be used when appropriate for time to event data. 
Other exploratory variables (global symptom r elief, biochemical markers and measures of 
bile acid synthesis, PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters , PELD/MELD score, APRI score, and 
Fib-4 score) will be analyzed  descriptively for categorical and continuous data, as applicable.  
For continuous data, the change from baseline will be analyzed  in addition to the actual visit 
values.  For c ategorical data, shift tables or frequency and percentages of patients will be 
presented as appropriate.  
In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed for each of the 3 age classes  (6 months to 
5 years , 6 to 12 years , and 13 to ≤18 years ). 
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Variables 
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of 
SAEs, AEs, vital sign s, clinical laboratory tests ( hematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis), and concomitant medication.  Analyses will be  performed using the safety 
analysis set.  
 A4250 – IND 130591

Confidential   Page 62 
 Summaries of AEs (coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA ] system organ class  [SOC] and MedDRA preferred term) will include  the 
following:  
• Overview of the incidence of TEAEs (T EAEs, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation, and treatmen t-emergent SAEs) 
• TEAEs by SOC and preferred term  
• Intensity of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term 
• Drug-related TEAEs by SOC and preferred term 
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation by SOC and preferred term 
• Treatmen t-emergent  SAEs by SOC and preferred term  
Concomitant medication use during the Treatment P eriod will be summarized by Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) class and World Health Organization ( WHO) preferred name.  
Summar ies of vital signs will be presented.   For each visit, the actual results and the change 
from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Summaries of clinical safety laboratory data will be presented.   For each visit, the actual 
result and the change from baseline, and the number and percentage of patients with PCS 
values observed post-baseline will be presented.  
Data listings will be provided for each pa tient for all safety parameters.  
11.2.2.8 Compliance and Exposure  
Exposure will be analy zed by calculating the number of days with exposure to study drug.  
Results will be presented by treatment group using the safety analysis set.  
The percentage compliance will b e described by treatment group and the number of subjects 
with a compliance <80%, between 80% and 120%, and >120% will be presented based on the 
safety analysis set.  
11.2.3 Blinded Analyses to Confirm Responder Definitions  
A blinded analysis of ObsRO and PRO eDiary  data will be performed after 50% or more of 
the planned sample has completed the Week  24 Follow -Up Period.  The blinded analysis will 
be used to estimate a threshold of clinically meaningful change (i.e., responder definition) in ObsRO and PRO pruritus scores.  The analysis will be performed by a group independent from both the study team and Albireo.  Blinded data will be used for this analysis; data will 
be collapsed across treatment groups. 
The analyses will include distribution - and ancho r-based anal yses to examine a responder 
definition for the PRO/ObsRO pruritus scores.  Distribution-based analyses will include 
calculation of the standard deviation and standard error of measurement for the baseline PRO 
and ObsRO scores.  Anchor-based analyses will i nvolve examining the degree of change on 
 A4250 – IND 130591

 the PRO and ObsRO scores from baseline to Week  24 for patients who experience change in 
pruritus according to PGIC and symptom items.  Details of this analysis will be included in a 
stand-alone SAP for assessing the  measurement characteristics (reliability, validity, 
sensitivity to change, responder definition) of the PRO and ObsRO items. 
11.2.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB consisting of sponsor-i ndependent clinical and statistical experts will be 
established.  The D SMB will periodically meet for the review of accumulating study data, 
including safety (AE and laboratory data)  and liver values.  
The DSMB will have access to unblinded data.  The DSMB will make recommendations for 
the remaining part of the study (further details will be provided in the DSMB charter).  The 
DSMB may recommend continuing with the study as planned or stopping the study early for 
safety reasons.  The DSMB will submit its recommendations in writing to Albireo 
Medical/  who are responsible  for responding to the recommendations of the DSMB and 
taking appropriate action.  The investigators will only be informed by Albireo Medical/  
if the study requires a protocol amendment or  is stopped.  The DSMB may choose to make 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from a safety point of view.  
The DSMB will act according to its own written standard operating procedure described in a 
charter and will prepare written minutes of its meetings.  The charter of the DSMB will be 
stored in the t rial master file.  The DSMB will maintain records of its meetings and these will 
become part of the study file when the study is complete.  In order not to disseminate unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and final analysis of the study remain blind to the data, only the members of the DSMB and the unblinded DSMB 
statistician will have access to these data.

 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Conduct of the Study  
Albireo/  shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance procedures 
with writte n SOPs to ensure that the study is conducted and data are generated, documented, 
and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki ( October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with FDA regulations 
(CFR, Sections  312.50 and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment having been  established and approved by an appropriate IEC/IRB, except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate hazards to the patient  or when the change(s) involve(s) only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in the patient havi ng to be 
withdrawn from the study and render that patient  non-e valuable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator ’s meeting, an Albireo 
representative will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigator s and the investigative 
staff.  During the study, the clinical monitor (clinical research associate [CRA]) will visit the 
site regularly to  check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the 
CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enroll ment , and to ensure 
that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. 
The investigator must ensure that CRFs are completed within 5 days of patient visits and 
must allow the Albireo medic al monitor or CRA  periodic access to patient records and all 
study-r elated materials, including relevant hospital or clinical records , to confirm their 
consistency with the CRF entries .  No information in these records about the identity of the 
patients will leave the study center .  Albireo monitoring standards require full verification for 
the presence of the signed ICF, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation 
of SAEs, and recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.  The CRA  will review 
source data compared with the CRFs and will verify source data according to the study-s pecific monitoring plan .  The design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and 
the site enrollment rate will determine the frequency of monitoring vis its.  Upon study 
completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding documentation. 
It is recommended that the investigator/investigative s taff log into the system every working 
day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide a prompt response to queries.  The 
investigator/investigative s taff should log into the system the day after submitting an SA E 
report to answer any queries.  This practice should continue until all questions regarding the 
SAE have been answered .  The investigator/investigative s taff should respond to queries and 

 A4250 – IND 130591

 14 ETHICS  
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IE C/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall 
be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA ICH GCP and local requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes), writt en informed consent documents and document updates, patient  recruitment 
procedures (e .g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients , IB, 
available safety information, information about payment and compensation available to patient s, the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of qualifications and any 
other documents requested by the IEC/IRB and r egulatory a uthority ( competent a uthority) as 
applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consent s and Assents 
The investigator/investigati ve staff will explain to each patient  (or legally authorized 
representative) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort 
that may occur .  Each caregiver /patient will be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary and that he/she or their child may withdraw from the study at any time and that 
withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or rela tionship 
with the treating physician. 
Caregivers /patients will be informed that they/their children may experience sid e-effects or 
be at risk for symptoms, illnesses, or complications that cannot be foreseen by Albireo.  As 
with other medications, people t reated with A425 0 may be at risk of developing allergic 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  Caregivers /patients will be advised that study procedures include 
regular blood sampling for measurement of safety parameters and biological markers and that 
some minor risk s are associated with these procedures.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a signed ICF, written in non-t echnical 
language in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authorities .  The caregiver /patient should read and consider the statements before signing and 
dating them and should be given a copy of each signed document.  If written consent is not 
possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from 
one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to sign the form .  No patient can enter the study before his/her or care giver informed consent has 
been obtained. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the investigator/investi gative staff 
with the protocol for IEC approval.  Albireo will supply an ICF which complies with 
regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for the study.  Any changes to the ICF

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed CRFs and shal l ensure that all data from 
patient  visits are promptly entered into the CRFs in accordance with the specific instructions 
given.  The investigator must sign each CRF to verify the integrity of the data recorded. 
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be  collated prior to study start.  If a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory. 
The investigator must maintain source documents such as laboratory reports, consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. 
Data to be recorded directly on the CRFs (i .e., no prior written or electronic record of data) 
and considered to be source data must be identified in the protocol. 
15.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
Essential documents, as defined by ICH GCP, include : the signed protocol and any 
amendment(s) ; copies of the completed CRFs (for site archiving, CDs of CRF data for 
specific pat ients will be provided) ; signed ICFs ; hospital records and other source documents ; 
IEC approvals and all related correspondence including approved documents;  drug 
accountability records; study correspondence; and a list of patients’ names and addresses.  
The investigator/i nvestigative staff must retain copies of these essential documents for the 
period specified by ICH GCP and by applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator/investigative s taff will inform Albireo of the location where the essential 
documents are stored and must contact Albireo for approval before disposing of any essential 
documents .  The investigator/investigative s taff should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents.

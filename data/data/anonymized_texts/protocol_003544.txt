Participant  Information  
 
PRINCIPLES CONCERNIN G RESEARCH :  You are being asked to take part in a research 
project.  It is important that you read and understand the principles that  apply to all individuals 
who agree to participate in the research project described below:  
 
1. Taking part in the research is entirely voluntary.  
 
2. We do not know if you will benefit from taking part in the research but the knowledge 
obtained may help others . 
 
3. You may withdraw from the study at any time without anyone objecting and without 
penalty or loss of any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  
 
4. If during your partic ipation in the research project  new information becomes available 
which would a ffect your being in the research project (such as better treatments or the 
side effects of the treatments), your doctor will discuss this new information with you and 
will help you make a decision about your continuing in the research.  
 
The purpose of the  research , how it is to be done , and what your part in the research will be is 
described below.  Also described are the risks, inconveniences, discomforts and other important 
information which you need to make a decision about whether or not you wish to pa rticipate.  
You are urged to discuss any questions you have about this research with the staff members.  
 
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH :  You are being asked to participate in this study because   
you have been diagnosed with urge ncy incontinence or overactive bladde r (OAB).

Docume nt ID#: 207102 ar3.011718  
Version Date:  01/17/2018  This purpose of this study is to see why so many patients with OAB symptoms have persistent 
symptoms while taking medications for OAB. We believe that bladder bacteria play s a role in 
women not responding to OAB treatment.  Although it is not well known, most women have 
bacteria in their bladders. These bacteria live in the bladder without causing symptoms. When 
women get symptoms of overactive bladder, they only improve with medications about 50% of 
the time  
 
Mirabegron is an FDA -approved medicatio n for urgency incontinence. Mirabegron is a 
medication that works on receptors in the bladder wall muscle. When these receptors are filled 
and activated, the bladder actively relaxes and is less likely to develop overactive bladder 
contractions that result  in urgency incontinence.  
 
The purpose of this study is to see if women who respond to mirabegron have  different bladder 
bacteria  than women who do not respond . Our hope is that by studying the interaction between 
mirabegron and bladder bacteria we will b etter understand the cause of urgency incontinence.  
 
This research is sponsored by  Astellas Pharma US  
 
Approximately  120 women with OAB  people will participate in this research.   
 
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION OF PROCEDURES:   If you agree to  participate in 
this study , you will be asked to sign this consent document.  
 
If you are currently are taking an anticholinergic medication for overactive bladder symptoms 
you will need to stop taking the medication for 2 weeks before you can start the s tudy.  Stopping 
the medication may temporarily worsen your  overactive bladder symptoms.    
 
Mirabegron is used for the treatment of overactive bladder.   Stopping your current medication  
allows us to better understand how mir abegron (once you start taking i t) is helping your 
symptoms.  
 
You will be required to come to the clinic for 4 visits: baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks & 12 weeks 
total participation time will be 12 to 14 weeks.  
 
At each visit y our urine will be tested to see if you have a urinary tract infect ion. The urine 
sample will be collected by passing a catheter  (a small rubber  tube) through your urethra and into 
your bladder . This is called a catheterized urine samples. You will also need to complete 5 
questionnaires ( USIQ, PFDI, OABq and UDI -6, PGI -S, and PPBC) .  You will then be given  
mirabegron (Myrbetriq)  to start  treatment. This visit should take about 45 -60 minutes.  
 
We will collect urine at each visit and the urine will be sent to the research laboratory for special 
tests done on the bacteria in the urine.  Since these are research tests and the meaning of the 
results not known, you and your doctor will not be notified of the results of any research tests 
done on your bacteria and your urine.

Docume nt ID#: 207102 ar3.011718  
Version Date:  01/17/2018  If you have an active urinary tract infection at 4 or 8 weeks or 12 weeks, we will collect a 
catheterized sample and then treat appropriately with antibiotics. This visit would be part of your 
usual care. One week after completion of antibiotic therapy, we will obtain another catheterized 
sample and complete the questionnaires.  
 
You will take a daily 25 mg dose by mouth of Mir abegron .   You will take this medication by 
mouth once a day for twelve wee ks.   If after 4 weeks you  do not feel that your symptoms are 
adequately  improved  you will have the option of in creasing the Mirabegron  dose to 50 mg per 
day for the remaining 8 weeks  of the study.  
 
The data collected is being used solely for research purposes and will be given a study 
identification number i n order to insure your privacy.  
 
We will also review your  medical record to collect additional information that is normally 
collected as part of your routine care. Again, no personal identifiers will be used i n collecting 
this information. As above , your study identification number will be used.  
 
A description o f this clinical trial will be available at http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,  as required 
by U.S. Law. This website will not include information that can identify you. At most, the 
website will include a summary of the results. You can search this website at a ny time.  
 
RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:   It is possible that the study treatment  you receive may not be 
effective in treating your overactive bladder symptoms.    
 
If you are currently taking an anticholinergic medication for overactive bladder symptoms and 
stop taki ng it for the washout period of 2 weeks, there is the chance that your symptoms may 
temporarily  worsen  until you start taking mirabe gron. 
 
You may experience slight discomfort when the catheter (rubber tube) is placed into the opening 
of the bladder (ureth ra). There is a small risk (less than a 1% chance) of a urinary tract infection 
with the placement of the catheter (rubber tube) into the opening of the bladder (urethra).  
 
The medication used for this study is Mybetriq  (mirabegron) . It is approved for the  treatment of 
urge incontinence.  
 
Uncommon side effects of mir abegron (1-5%) reported  include :  
• high blood pressure,  
• difficulty emptying the bla dder,  
• fatigue  
 
Rare events have been reported . These include:   
• swelling,  
• skin rash,  
• allergic reactions (incl uding very severe reactions that require hospitalization),  
• headache,  
4 
 
Docume nt ID#: 207102 ar3.011718  
Version Date:  01/17/2018  • confusion,  
• hallucinations,  
• heart palpitations,  
• changes in the electrical pattern of the heart  
 
As mentioned above you will not be identified by name or by any other identifying info rmation 
on the questionnaires. A study identification number will be listed on each questionnaire and 
data collection sheets.  
 
REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL ACTIVITY INFORMATION:  The intervention in this 
study could affect a developing baby. Therefore, you cann ot participate in this research project if 
you are pregnant or breast feeding.  
 
If you are a woman of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test will be done to make certain that 
you are not pregnant before beginning the study.   Women who are able to have c hildren must use 
an effective method of preventing pregnancy while participating in this study.  
 
In addition, as study medications may remain in the body for a period beyond their 
administration, you will be asked to continue to employ an effective metho d of preventing 
pregnancy for 4 weeks  after you have finished taking the study medication .   You are encouraged 
to discuss your preferred method with the study physician Dr. Mueller .  She will answer any 
questions you have regarding effective  methods of preventing pregnancy. It is important that you 
consult with your physician because some study medications may affect the effectiveness of 
various methods of preventing pregnancy.  
 
If you become pregnant, suspect that you have become pregnant, n otify Dr.  Mueller  
immediately.  
 
BENEFITS:    We do not know if you will benefit from participating in this study.   The 
information learned may help others in the future.   
 
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS:   You do not have to participate in this rese arch project to 
receive care and treatment at Loyola University Medical Center .  
 
You can choose the treatment , mirabegron in this project without participating in the project.    
 
Your doctor has discussed other options with you along with their risks an d benefits.  
 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION:   Some health plans will not pay the costs for people taking 
part in studies. Check with your health plan or insurance company to find out what they will pay 
for. Taking part in this study may or may not cost your insura nce company more than the cost of 
getting treatment  without being in this study.   Depending on your health insurance, there may be 
a co-payment for the standard visits.  You will be responsible for any usual out -of-pocket 
expenses such as co pays, coinsura nce or deductibles.   
 
As part of your normal clinical care, a catheterized urine culture will be obtained. The clinic will 
5 
 
Docume nt ID#: 207102 ar3.011718  
Version Date:  01/17/2018  also obtain a catheterized specimen for any urinary symptoms that suggest a urinary tract 
infection. This is part of the clinic rout ine of care and as such will be charged to your health 
insurance plan just as they would if you were not participating in a research study.  
 
Costs for procedures not included in the standard care will be covered by the research study.  
 
The medication use d in this study will be provided at no cost to you. There will be no costs to 
you for participating in this research.  You will be responsible for all other costs associated with 
your care.  
 
Neither you nor your insurance provider will be billed for any pro cedures that are performed 
exclusively for this research study. Those procedures that are being performed for research 
purposes only include 4, 8, and 12 week catheterized urine culture, research tests done on the 
urine and expanded quantitative urine cult ure. The study will pay for the 4, 8, and 12 week office 
visits.  
 
You will be given  a parking sticker for the day of your visit.  
 
RESEARCH RELATED INJURY:  In the event that you are injured or have side effects as a 
result of participating in this research  project, your doctor will take the necessary steps to treat 
the problem.  There are no funds available from Loyola University Medical Center,  Loyola 
University Health System or Loyola University Chicago  to pay for the cost of care of the 
problem. You will  be financially responsible for the cost of care of any problems.   By signing 
this form, you are not giving up any legal rights to seek to obtain compensation  of injury.  
 
INFORMATION COLLECTE D AND WHAT WILL HAPP EN TO IT:   In order to meet the

 Protocol Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  
A Phase 1b /2 Trial of the IRX -2 regimen and Pembrolizumab  in Patients with Advanced Gastric 
and Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma  
Brief Protocol Title for the Lay Public (if applicable):  
IRX-2 and Pembrolizumab  Treatment in Gastric Cancer 
Study Phase:  
Phase 1b/2 
Participating Sites:  
City of Hope  (Duarte, CA)

Texas Oncology -Baylor Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center  (Dallas, TX)  
Rationale for this Study:  
Advanced gastric cancer continues to account for a large proportion of  worldwide cause s of 
cancer-related mortality . Systemic and targeted therapies remain limited, though the immune 
checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab became FDA -approved in September of 2017 as third -line 
and beyon d therapy based on results of the KEYNOTE -059 trial.1 However, durable objective 
responses remains limited to a small proportion of patients . The IRX-2 Regimen is an 
immunomodulatory regimen in development by Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics  that includes a 
novel primary cell -derived biologic (IRX -2) that contains several active cytokines and 
cyclophosphamide. This treatment regimen has been demonstrated to bolster several facets of 
immune response, including tumor infilt ration by lymphocytes.2-7 Therefore, it is possible that 
the combination of the IRX -2 regimen wi th pembrolizumab  will improve treatment outcomes.  
This phase 1b /2 study will seek to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of 
the IRX-2 regimen with pembrolizumab .   It will be used to d escribe the safety profile of 
combination  IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab  and determine the  maximum tolerable dose of 
combination I RX-2 regimen with pembrolizumab  in patients with gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  
who have progressed on or are intolerant to two lines of systemic therapy . Clinical efficacy will 
also be evaluated with assessment of t he objective clinical response rate of IRX -2 regimen 
combined with pembrolizumab  using RECIST 1.1 and immune modified RECIST criteria , and 
resultant median progression -free and overall survival. Explorato ry analyses will seek to 
evaluate the following: circulating T cell profile in patients before and after treatment with the 
IRX-2 regimen ; the baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue for Nanostring gene expression 
profiling and correlation of these profil es to putative response ; multiplex assays (MHC-PepSeq) 
in combination with genomic and transcriptomic sequencing to identify mutations associated 
with tumor neo -antigens; and other circulating biomarkers (other immune cell populations and 
circulating tumor  DNA) in peripheral blood to develop hypotheses for response to these 
therapies.  
Objectives: 
Primary Objectives  
 
 
4 
 
 •  To determine the safety profile of the combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab  
Secondary Objectives  
•  To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX -2 regimen combined with pembrolizumab  
using RECIST 1.1 and  immune modified RECIST criteria . 
•  To evaluate initial m edian progression -free and overall survival in these patients treated 
with combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab.  
Exploratory Objectives  
•  To evaluate the circulating T cell  profiles in patients before and after therapy with the 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab  
•  To evaluate the baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue immune gene expression 
profiling using the Nanostring platform  
•  To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic 
assay (MHC -PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing  
•  To explore  putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor DNA and immune cell 
profiles) in peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to treatment with 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizum ab.  
Study Design:  
The study will consis t of two phases – a safety phase and a dose expansion phase:  
 
•  Safety phase (phase 1b) : A standard 3+3 dose finding rule will be employed  with two dose 
levels.  Patients will start at dose level 1  [IRX-2 regimen at dose of 2 mL (230 units/day)] . 
Patients will be enrolled in cohort s of 3, separated by at least  1 week.  Initially, 3 patients 
will be treated with expansion to 3 more patients in the event of 1/3 dose limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) as observ ed during the first 3  weeks of treatment, escalation if 0/3 or 1/6 
DLTs, and termination of escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs.  Once ≥ 2 patients experience a DLT at a 
dose level, the next lower dose level will be expanded to 6 evaluable patients, if fewer 
than 6 evaluable patients have been treated at the dose level. The maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose tested in which only 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable 
patients experience a DLT.  The Recommended Phase 2 Dosing (RP2D)  will not exceed the 
MTD but may be lower based o n cumulative toxicities and dose modification patterns.  If 
the rules suggest escalation at the highest proposed dose, that dose will accrue to 6 
patients where <2 DLTs will determine that as the MTD, and 2 or more DLTs will require 
de-escalation. These ru les will be used to determine the IRX -2 regimen dosing for the 
expansion phase .  
•  Dose expansion phase  (phase 2): 8-14 patients will be enrolled at the recommended dos e 
level from the safety  phase, for a t otal enrollment of 20 patients.  The 6-12 patients 
treated in the safety lead -in portion of the study will be counted as part of the dose 
expansion patient population.  
Endpoints: 
Primary Endpoint  
•  Occurrence and severity of adverse events including dose limiting toxicities, with severity 
determined according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. 
Secondary Endpoints  
 
 
5 
 
 •  Progression Free Survival (PF S), Overall Survival (OS) , and Overall Response Rate (ORR) as  
assessed using RECIST version 1.1  and irRECIST . 
Exploratory Endpoints  
•  Description of circulating T cell  profiles in patients b efore and after therapy with 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab .  
•  Correlation between baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue  Nanostring gene expression 
profiling and clinical  response.  
•  Identification of tumor neoantigens using the MHC -PepSeq assay.  
•  Development of hypotheses for response based on circulating immune cel l profiles 
circulating tumor DNA from  peripheral blood.  
Sample Size:  
Phase I:  6-12 patients 
Phase II: 20 patients (1 1 + 9 or 8 + 12)* 
* Patients treated at all dose levels in the phase I portion of the study will be counted as a part 
of the phase II patient population.  
Estimated Duration of the Study:  
42 Months

 screening to one year after last dose of cyclophosphamide or 180 days after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab  therapy, whichever is longer.   
Investigational Product  and Reference Therapy:  
IRX-2 is supplied as a pale yellow, sterile liquid for subcutaneous injection in a 2.0 ml single dose 
vial.  
Pembrolizumab  as a 200 mg IV Q3weeks as a 3 0 minute infusion  
 
Cycle 1 through 35 
Pembrolizumab  as a 200 mg IV Q3weeks as a 30 minute infusion (every Cycle)  
IRX-2 regimen every 12 wee ks as below starting on Cycle 1:  
Agent Dose Route of Administration  
Cyclophosphamide (Day 1)  300 mg/m2 IV 
IRX-2: For 10 days starting on 
Day 4; the 10 days are not 
required to be consecutive 
(e.g. dosing not mandatory on 
weekends/holidays) provided 
dosing is completed by Day 15  Dose Level 1:  
230 units total daily 
(2 injections daily 
comprised of 115 units  in 
each injection ) 
 
Dose Level 2: 
460 units total daily 
(4 injections daily 
comprised of 115 units in 
each injection ) Dose Level 1:  Subcutaneous at or 
near the supraclavicular lymph 
node regions bilaterally  
(substitute axillary if 
supraclavicular nodes have been 
removed). 
 
Dose level 2: Subcutaneous  at or 
near the supraclavicular and 
axillary node regions bilaterally  
(if any of these nodes have been 
removed, can inject at or near 
mastoid insertion of both 
sternocleidomastoid muscles ). 
 
 
 Statistical Considerations:  
The safety phase of the study will enroll 3 to 6 patients per dose level. The dose expansion phase 
will enroll 8 to 12 patients at the recommended dose level from the safety phase for a total 
enrollment of 20 patients. The 6  to 12 patients treated in the safety phas e of the study will be 
counted as a part of the dose expansion patient population.  
 
Historical data with single agent PD -1 inhibitors in gastroesophageal cancer indicate median PFS 
at 1.5 months. With an alpha of .05, hypothesized median PFS improved to 3.0 months with the 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab, study accrual of 30 m onths, and 12 -month 
follow-up evaluation timeframe, a sample size of 20 patients will have 80% power to detect 
median differences in PFS.  Assuming that dose level 1 will be used for the dose expansion phase, 
these individuals will be included in phase II to reach the needed sample of 20 patients evaluable 
for immune activity.

2.0  Background  
Gastric Cancer  
2.1.1  Epidemiology  
In 2012 nearly 1 million new cases of gastric cancer were diagnosed globally with an estimated 723,100 
deaths, reflective of the high mortality rate associated with this disease .9  
2.1.2  Current Treatment Options   
A number of chemotherapy agents have demonstrated activity  in advanced gastric and 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer . These include pl atinum drugs, such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin, 
and fluoropyrimidines, such as intraven ous 5-fluorouracil  and oral capecitabine. Multi-agent 
chemotherapy  regimens are able to  improve by nearly 7 months the approximately 4 months median 
survival seen with best supportive care alone.10 In terms of predictive biomarkers to date t hat guide 
treatment decisions in front -line therapy , evidence of  HER2 overexpression and/or gene amplification 
supports addition of HER2 blockade with trastuzumab to combination platinum and fluoropyrimidine 
chemotherapy based on the phase III ToGA trial .11 Despite initial activity seen with multi -agent 
chemotherap y, development of drug resistance and invariable disease progression still accounts for high 
mortality rates associated with advanced disease.  
Second-line chemotherapy with taxanes or irinotecan after platinum and fluoropyrimidine 
chemotherapy have demonst rated modest activity in randomized trials .12-14 More recently , evidence 
that angiogenesis inhibition can induce tumor responses and/or delay disease progression was 
demonstrated with delivery of the VEGFR2 -inhibitory antibody ramucirumab in the phase II I REGARD 
and RAINBOW trials, when utilized as a  single agent or added to paclitaxel, respectively .15, 16 Median 
overall survival improved from 7.4 to 9.6 months (p=0.017)  when ramucirumab was added to paclitaxel, 
 
 
14 
 
 representing a stepwise improvement for this patient po pulation, but still indicating more options are 
needed for this di agnosis. 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become an option for treatment -refractory advanced 
gastric cancer.  KEYNOTE 059 was a multi -cohort phase 2 trial, i n which in its largest cohort, C ohort 1, 
examined pembrolizumab  in 259 gastric and GEJ  adenocarcin oma patients who had failed at least 2 
prior systemic regimens.1 Pembrolizumab was continued until completion of 35 cycles (approximately 2 
years) in patients wi thout demonstration of progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, or investigator decision to stop therapy. Fuchs et al.  reported those with tumor  PD-L1 
expression had  an overall RR of 15.5% with 2.0% complete responses , and 13.5% partial responses by 
RECIST1.1 .  Evidence of PD -L1 expression by a combined positive score (CPS) was defined as a cutoff ≥ 1 
tumor cells and/or immune cells out of 100 viable tumor cells with PD -L1 expression by 
immunohistochemistry using the 22C3 pharmD x assay. Microsatellite instability was also tested as a 
biomarker, and 4% of the study population harbored tumors with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H).  
ORR was more encouraging  at 57.1% in the MSI -H subset vs. 9.0% in tumors defined to be non -MSI-H. 
Ultimately 13 .3% of patients with non -MSI-H or undetermined MSI, PD-L1 CPS positive tumors 
demonstrated objective tumor responses which were durable with median duration s of response 
between 2.3+ to 19.4 + months. While the durability of responses are very encouraging for a disease 
historically with dismal prognosis, the low proportion of patients having such clinical benefit speaks to 
the need to augment immunotherapy responses.   This was further highligh ted by recent reporting of the 
phase III KEYNOTE -061 trial, in which 395 metastatic gastric or GEJ cancer patients with PD -L1 CPS 
positive tumors were randomized to single agent pembrolizumab or paclitaxel.17  In this trial, a median 
PFS of 1.5 months was observed with pembrolizumab  versus 4.1 months with paclitaxel, indicating the 
vast majority of patients demonstrate disease progression early despite pembrolizumab therapy.  
Immunotherapy  
2.1.3  PD-1 and Cancer  
Developing immunity to a particular cancer can be viewed as a cyclic process in  which immune-
stimulatory and inhibitory factors compete against each other to modulate the immune response .18 This 
relationship is further co mplicated by the ability of the tumor to down -regulate stimulatory signals and 
up-regulate inhibitory signals . Some tumors express Programmed death receptor liga nd 1 (PD-L1) the 
ligand for programmed death -1 (PD-1), a cell surface molec ule that regulates the adaptive immune 
response.19 PD-1 is found on the surface of T cells and sends inhibitory signals that inactivate T cell 
receptor (TCR) signaling up on the binding of PD -L1.20 The interaction of PD -L1 with PD -1 has been shown 
to inhibit the killing activity of cytotoxic T cells as well as interfere with  the role of regulatory T cells .21 
Tumors take advantage of immune checkpoints such as the PD -1/PD-L1 pathway to evade immune 
destruction, resu lting in disease progression. It is necessary to overcome multiple immunosuppressive 
mechanisms  in order to establish an effective antitumor immune response. 22  Anti-PD1 and Anti-PD-L1 
are designed to block immune checkpoints thereby decreasing immune inhibitory pathways and 
increasing the antitumor effect.  23, 24 In targeting tumors that express PD -L1, immunoth erapy has been 
used to produce an antibody blockade to the PD -1 receptor on T cells.25 
Pembrolizumab  is a fully human, Ig G4 (kappa) monoclonal antibody  that binds PD-1, which is primarily 
expressed on activated T cells, B cells and myeloid cells.26-29  The PD-1 receptor -ligand interaction is a 
major pathway utilized by tumors to evade the surveillance and clearance by  the immune system. 
Atezolizumab works in similar fashion, except it is an IgG1 isotype antibody which blocks the interaction 
of PD-L1 with PD -1 and CD80.30, 31  A variety of cancers have demonstrated the ability to express PD -L1 
 
 
15 
 
 and binding of PD -1 to PD-L1 or PD-L2 has been shown to down -regulate T -cell activation.32-35 
Interactions between PD -1/PD-L1 may also indirectly modulate the response to tumor antigens throu gh 
T-cell/APC interactions. PD -1 blockade by nivolumab, pembrolizumab and PD -L1 blockade by 
atezolizumab has been shown to reverse immune tolerance and enhance T cell effector function in 
several tumor types including melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC), renal cell carcinom a (RCC), 
urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), microsatellite instability -high (MSI-H) colorectal 
cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).28, 36-42 As discussed earlier, f or the FDA 
approval of pembrolizumab  in the third-line treatment of advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma , the 
observed response rate was 15 .5%, indicating the possibility for improvement of this therapy through 
combination with an additional immunomodulatory regimen.   
2.1.4  The IRX-2 Regimen  
The IRX-2 Regimen is an immunomodulatory regimen in development by Brooklyn ImmunoTh erapeutics  
that includes a novel primar y cell-derived biologic (IRX -2) and cyclophosphamide. Preclinical studies 
showed that the IRX -2 biologic promotes upregulation of antigen presenting machinery, improved 
antigen presentation, dendritic cell (DC) matura tion, improved T cell activation, and T cell protection 
from extrinsic and intrinsic forms of tumor -induced apoptosis.2-7 Clinical studies evaluating a 3 -week 
cycle of the IRX -2 Regimen in therapy -naïve subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
(HNSCC) intended for curative surgery demonstrated  modest tumor regression with increased 
lymphocyte infiltration into tumors when surgical specimens were compared to pre -treatment biopsies. 
Increase in tumor lymphocyte infiltration  appeared to be associated with better overall survival.43-46 
These findings suggest that the IRX 2 Regimen may mobilize tumor -infiltrating effector lymphocytes 
resulting in a clinically significant anti-tumor immune response.  
2.1.5  Manufacture and Composition of the IRX -2 Biologic 
IRX-2 is a primary cell -derived biologic with multiple active cytokine components, produced under 
pharmaceutical standards from phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and ciprofloxacin sti mulated donor 
mononuclear cells. Multiple healthy donor leukocytes (“buffy coats”) are pooled and then stimulated 
with PHA (to mimic a cellular immune challenge), and then locked in pre -s phase by ciprofloxacin. 
Subsequently, the PHA, ciprofloxacin and all cellular elements are removed and the cell-free 
supernatant is filter -sterilized, nanofiltered t o clear viral particles, v ialed and frozen as IRX -2. IRX-2 
contains nanogram quantities (physiologic) of IL -1β, IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNFα, and also includes IL -6, IL-8, 
GM-CSF, and G-CSF. Each of these human cytokines when studied individually enhances cell -mediated 
immunity via differ ent mechanisms.  
2.1.6  Modifying the Lymph Node Microenvironment (IRX -2 Biologic)  
The IRX-2 biologic is administered by subcutaneous injection in the peri -lymphatic area adjacent to 
lymph nodes draining the tumor bed to take advantage of the normal afferent and efferent pathways of 
lymph node activation. The immunosuppressive microenvironment contributes to incomplete or 
ineffective tumor antigen processing in regional lymph nodes. Administering IRX -2 near lymphatic 
capillaries and vessels enables the immunostimu latory cytokines to be drawn up into and potentially 
restore the lymph node microenvironment to facilitate DC maturation, antigen processing, and effector 
T cell activation.  
 
 
16 
 
 2.1.7  Tumor-Induced Immune Suppression  
Tumor-induced immune suppression ranges from tumo rs utilizing immune ch eckpoints (CTLA -4, PD-
1/PD-L1) to production of soluble factors such as IL-10, TGF-β, prostaglandins, vascular endothelia l 
growth factor, and Fas ligand which contribute to depression of cellular immunity by suppressing 
lymphocyte and  monocyte function.47-49 The production of these factors by the tumor results in the 
induction of host suppressor cells of both lymphoid  and myeloid origin including regulatory T cells, 
myeloid suppressor cells, suppressor macrophages and DCs.50-52 
Rationale for Combining the IRX -2 Regimen and Pembrolizumab  in Gastric/GEJ Adenocarcinoma   
Recently it has been shown that the degree of lymphocyte infiltration is an important prognostic factor 
for treatment with anti -PD-1 monoclon al antibodies in melanoma .53 Additionally, it has been well 
established that t he level of T cell infiltration in primary tumor biopsies is a strong predictive factor of 
improved outcome in multivariate analyses for many cancers .54-56 This provides a compelling  basis for 
incorporating tr eatment with the IRX -2 Regimen to increase the level of lympho cyte infiltration in 
tumors with  anti-PD-1 treatments. In a Phase 2  trial, IRX-2 was shown to increase T cell infiltration into 
the tumor and this correlated with overall survival in HNS CC.44, 45 In the Phase 2a study in patients with 
HNSCC, IRX-2 facilitated reductions in circulating B and NKT cell numbers, suggesti ng redistribution of 
these cells to tissues.44 
In pre-clinical models, the IRX -2 Regimen was shown to be superior to recombinant IL -7 and IL-15 in 
protecting T cells from tumor - induced apoptosis  and to be involved in IFN-γ+-driven T cell polarization 
towards Teff and suppression of Treg differentiation  in the tumor microenvironment .4 IRX-2 was 
subsequently shown to restore the fu nction of dendritic cells from head and n eck cancer patients.5 A 
decrease in naïve T cells and unchanged numbers of Tregs (suppressor T cells) after IRX -2 therapy 
indicated that IRX -2 does not expand suppressor T cells thus potentially benefiting anti -tumor immu ne 
responses.44  
As the IRX -2 regimen has been shown to work in an upstream immune -activating manner and PD-1 
inhibitors work downstream by reducing tumor -induced immune suppression , a combination of such 
therapies would likely be synergistic . Pembrolizumab , a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 
antibody that binds to the PD -1 cell surface membrane receptor has been approv ed by FDA for the 
third-line treatment of gastroesophageal cancer  although o nly a 13% objective response rate was 
observed in non-MSI-H tumors with positive PD -L1 expression by the CPS score (Fuchs ref) . Therefore, it 
is likely that patients with evidence of immune checkpoint expression in the tumor and tumor 
microenvironment woul d benefit from additional  immune system activation in conjunction with 
immune checkpoint inhibition.  With employment of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, indomethacin and 
the need for omeprazole prophylaxis against NSAID -induced gastritis has been deemed un necessary and 
will not be utilized in the trial.  Zinc deficiency and supplementation in the HNSCC trials were unique to 
that patient population, and will also not be utilized in this trial for patients with metastatic 
gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas. 
Overview of Study  
The IRX-2 Regimen is an immunomodulatory regimen in development by Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics  
that includes a novel primary cell -derived biologic (IRX -2) that contains several active cytokines and 
cyclophosphamide. This treatment regimen h as been demonstrated to bolster several facets of immune 
 
 
17 
 
 response, including tumor infiltration by lymphocytes.2-7 Therefore, it is possible that the combination of 
the IRX-2 regimen with pembrolizumab  will improve treatment outcomes  in advanced, treatment -
refractory gastric and GEJ adenocarc inoma.  
This phase 1b /2 study will seek to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of the IRX -2 
regimen with pembrolizumab in this patient population .   It will be used to describe the safety profile of 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab  and determine the maximum tolerable dose of 
combination IRX -2 regimen with pembrolizumab  in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction  
adenocarcinoma who have progressed on or are intolerant to ≥ 2lines of prior systemic therapy . The 
objective clinical response rate of IRX -2 regimen combined with pembrolizumab  using RECIST 1.1 and 
immune modified RECIST criteria and progression free survival will also be evaluated. Exploratory 
analyses will seek to evaluate the following: circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after 
treatment with the IRX -2 regimen, the baseline  and post-treatment  tumor tissue for Nanostring gene 
expression profiling and correlation  of these profiles to clinical response and evaluate additional 
biomarkers  to develop hypotheses for response to these therapies.

 4.0  Screening and Registration Procedures  
Screening Procedures  
Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this trial will be done 
only after obtaining written informed consent. Studies or procedures that were for clinical indications 
(not exclusively to determine study eligibil ity) may be used for baseline values, even if the studies were 
done before informed consent was obtained.  All screening procedures and their respective windows 
are detailed in the Study Calendar.  
Informed Consent  
The investigational nature and objectives of the trial, the procedures and treatments involved and their 
attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the 
subject and a signed informed consent will be obtained.  Documentation of info rmed consent for 
screening will be maintained in the subject’s research chart and medical record  and the patient will 
receive a copy of the signed inform consent document. All institutional, Federal, and State regulations 
concerning Informed Consent will b e fulfilled.   
COH Data Coordinating Center  
Eligible participants  will be registered on the study centrally by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at 
City of Hope.   
DCC staff are available between the hours of 8.00 am and 5.00 pm PST, Monday through Friday  (except 
holidays).  
o  E-mail: DCC@coh.org  
Registration Requirements/Process  
4.1.1  Confirming, reserving  a slot and dose level assignment  
Staff (including physicia ns, protocol nurses and/or CRCs ) should contact the DCC to verify the current 
dose level and slot availability, and to reserve a slot for a specific prospective subject. Slots can only be 
held for a limited time.  
Eligible subjects must be registered prior to the start of protocol therapy. Issues that w ould cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a subject does not receive 
protocol therapy following registration, the subject’s registration on the study may be canceled after 
discussion with the PI. The Data Coordinat ing Center should be notified of cancellations as soon as 
possible.  
4.1.2  Registration Process  
Once a slot at a dos e level has been reserved, the signed informed consent has been obtained, all 
pretreatment evaluations have been performed, and subject’s eligibil ity has been confirmed by the Data 
Coordinating Center  (DCC), a subject will be registered on study.  
To register a subject, the treating physician should contact the protocol  nurse or the responsible clinical 
Research Coordinator (CRC) in the Clinical Tri al Office (CTO) to complete the eligibility checklist.  
Allow up to 24 hours for the DCC to review eligibility. To register a participant the subsequent procedure 
is to be followed:  
 
 
21 
 
 1.  The study team  should contact the DCC via email to provide notification re garding the pending 
registration and communicate desired timeline of the registration, especially if it must be 
completed promptly to meet the registration window .  
2.  The study team  will email a Complete Eligibility Packet  to the DCC, which consists a copy of the 
following documents:  
o  Registration Cover Sheet ( Appendix II)

5.0  Treatment Program  
Treatment Overview  
For a detailed tabular view of the treatment, monitoring, and follow -up schedule, se e the Study 
Calendar (Section 10 ) 
Treatment cycle definition  
Each cycle will consist of 3 weeks coinciding with timing of pembrolizumab infusions.  Cycle 1, Day 1  will 
start with the 1st day of IRX -2 regimen and a dose of pembrolizumab . 
 
 
22 
 
 Treatment Plan 
Treatment on study will continue up to 24  months or until confirmed disease progression, patient 
refusal, patient lost to follow up, unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first, or the study is 
terminated by the S ponsor. 
The study will consis t of two phases – a safety phase and a dose expansion phase:  
 
Safety phase: A standard 3+3 dose finding rule will be employed  with two dose levels .  Patients will start 
at dose level 1  [IRX-2 regimen at dose of 2 mL (230 units/day)] . Patients wi ll be enrolled in cohort s of 3, 
separated by at least  1 week.  Initially, 3 patients will be treated with expansion to 3 more patients in 
the event of 1/3 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) as observ ed during the first 3  weeks of treatment, 
escalation if 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs, and termination of escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs.  Once ≥ 2 patients experience a 
DLT at a dose level, the next lower dose level will be expanded to 6 evaluable patients, if fewer than 6 
evaluable patients have been treated at the dose level. The max imum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined 
as the highest dose tested in which only 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable patients experience a DLT.  The 
Recommended Phase 2 Dosing (RP2D)  will not exceed the MTD but may be lower based on cumulative 
toxicities and dose modification patterns.  If the rules suggest escalation at the highest proposed dose, 
that dose will accrue to 6 patients where <2 DLTs will determine that as the MTD, and 2 or more DLTs 
will require de -escalation. These rules will be used to determine the IRX -2 regimen dosing for the 
expansion phase .   
 
Dose expansion phase: 8-14 patients will be enrolled at the recommended dos e level from the safety  
phase, for a t otal enroll ment of 20 patients. The 6-12 patients treated in the dose escalation portion of 
the study will be counted as part of the dose expansion patient population.  Two doses of IRX -2 will be 
considered (Table 5 -1). There will be no intra -patient dose escalation; participants will undergo dose 
modification due to toxicity ( Section 6).  
Table 5-1: Dose Levels of IRX-2 
Dose Level  IRX-2 Dose  
Starting 
Dose Level: 
1 230 units (2 mL) total daily  for 10 days : 2 injections daily comprised of 115 units in each 
1 mL injection ; 1 injection  administered into  the left and 1 injection into the right 
supraclavicular  lymph node region s (substitute axillary regions if supraclavicular  nodes 
have been removed )  
2 460 units (4 mL) total daily for 10 days: 4 injections daily comprised of 115 units in each 
1 mL injection; 1 injection each  into both supraclavicular and 1 injection each into both 
axillary lymph node region s (substitute mastoid insertio n if supraclavicular or axillary 
nodes have been removed )  
 
Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity  
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that occurs during the DLT evaluation period of 3 
weeks (between  Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 21) and are considered related to study treatment . Toxicity 
that is clearly and directly related to the p rimary disease or to another etiology is excluded from this 
definition. A patient is evaluable for DLT if he/she receives the cycle 1 dose of pembrolizumab (100%) and 
 
 
23 
 
 80% of the planned doses of IRX -2 during cycle 1 OR he/she experiences a DLT.  If this minimum amount 
of treatment is not reached due to treatment related AEs, this is considered a DLT.  However, patients 
who fail to achieve this minimum amount of treatment due to reasons that are clearly unrelated to 
treatment (e.g. error on part of patient o r healthcare provider ) will be replaced.   The following will be 
DLTs: 
•  Any Grade 4  adverse event deemed to be immune -related 
•  Any ≥Grade 3 colitis  
•  Any Grade 3 or 4 non -infectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration  
•  Any Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not reso lve to ≤Grade 1 within 3 days of the initiation of 
maximal supportive care  
•  Any Grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to Grade 2 within 3 
days after onset of the event despite optimal medical management including systemic 
corticosteroids or does not downgrade to ≤Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days  
•  Liver transaminase elevation > 8 × ULN or total bilirubin >  5 × ULN 
•  Any unresolved toxicity necessitating  a delay in the delivery of cycle 2, day 1 of pembrolizumab 
by > 3 weeks 
•  Any ≥Grade 3 non -irAE, except for the exclusions listed below  
 
The definition excludes the following conditions:  
•  Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤7 days  
•  Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pituitary, and/or adrenal insufficiency) that is managed with 
or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement therapy and the patient 
is asymptomatic  
•  Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (e.g., inflammatory 
reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc. ) 
•  Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade  
•  Grade 3 infusion -related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of steroid prophylaxis) that 
resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management  
•  Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that is not associat ed with fever or systemic infection that improves by 
at least 1 grade within 3 days. Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia will be a DLT regardless of 
duration or reversibility  
•  Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia  
•  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that is not associated with clinically significant bleeding that requires 
medical intervention, and improves by at least 1 grade within 3 days  
 
 
24 
 
 •  Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
and are reversed with appropriate maximal medical intervention within 3 days  
Agents Administration  
5.1.1  IRX-2 Regimen  
The IRX-2 regimen will be given every 12 weeks starting with Cycle 1.  Cyclophosphamide will be 
administered as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each IRX-2 regimen  at a dose of 300 mg/m2.  
IRX-2 will be administered subcutaneously into  a maximum of  4 lymph node -bearing regions , i.e. the 
bilateral supraclavicular  and axillary regions.  For dose level 1, 1  ml (115 units/ml) will be injected into 
each of the 2 lymph node regions (total 2 ml (230 units/day))  corresponding to the bilateral supraclavicular 
areas only .  If dose level 2 is reached, 1 ml (115 units/ml) will be injected into each of the 4 lymph node 
regions (total 4 ml (460 units/day)).  
IRX-2 Regimen  includes one dose of cyclophosphamide on Day 1  of each designated  cycle, and 
subcutaneous IRX -2 injections in bilateral supraclavicular (and axillary regions  if applicable)  for 10 days 
between Days 4 and 15.  The 10 days are not required to be consecutive  (e.g. dosing not mandatory on 
weekends/holidays) provided dosing is completed by day 15.  
 
5.1.2  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab  will be given at the approved dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks beginning with Day 1 of  
Cycle 1.  
Pembrolizumab  will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 21 days (+/- 3 days). 
Study Procedures  
For a detailed list of all study procedures including timing and windows, s ee the Study Calendar .  
Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Study Treatment  
Patients will receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria 
for removal from study treatment are satisfied. Participants may be removed from treatm ent for any of 
the following reasons:  
•  Evidence of disease progression  
•  Patient is deemed intolerant to study treatment because of toxicity, despite dose 
modification/delay.  
•  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
•  Participant  withdraws from the treatment phase of the study  
•  General or specific changes in the participant’s condition, including non -compliance, which 
renders the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating 
investigator.  
Documentat ion of the reason for discontinuing therapy and the date effective should be made in the 
medical record and appropriate eCRF. The participant should then proceed to off -treatment procedures 
for safety monitoring, and follow -up procedures. The participant’s  status is to be modified in the MIDAS 
system once the off -treatment period is completed. Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 
 
25 
 
 End of Study  Follow Up 
In End of Study  Follow-Up participants will be followed for survival informat ion which may be obtain ed 
by reviewing the  medical record, contacting the participant and/or a review of outside medical records 
(note: this is not an all -inclusive list).  
The schedule and windows for assessments and data collection points are further det ailed in the Study 
Calendar.  
Criteria for Completion of Study Participation  
Participants may be removed from the study as a whole at  any time at their own request, or they may 
be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The 
reasons for discontinuing study participation should be documented and may include:  
•  Participant completes a ll study procedures including all study follow -up procedures.  
•  Participant withdraws consent for follow -up. 
•  Participant is determined to be lost to follow -up. All attempts to contact the subject must be 
documented.  
The reason for study removal and the date  the participant was removed must be documented in the 
source documentation and the study -specific case report form (CRF). The participant’s status is to be 
modified in the MIDAS system once the participant completes the study.  
Supportive Care and Other C oncomitant Therapy  
All concomitant medications taken during the study treatment will be recorded in the Case Report Form. 
The minimum requirements are that drug name and the dates of administration are to be recorded. All 
prescription and over-the-counter medications that have been taken within 1 month prior to the first 
dose of investigational treatment should also be reported in the Case Report Form.  
Patients should receive full supportive care during the study, including treatment with a ntibiotics, 
antiemetics, blood transfusions, antidiarrheals, and analgesics as appropriate . 
5.1.3  Included concomitant medications  
Supportive medications:  
Supportive medication/class of drug:  Usage: 
Concomitant medications or treatments 
(e.g., acetaminophen or  diphenhydramine) 
deemed necessary to provide adequate 
prophylactic or supportive care, except for 
those medications identified as “prohibited ”. To be administered as prescribed by the Investigator  
Best supportive care (including antibiotics, 
nutritional support, correction of metabolic 
disorders, optimal symptom control, and pain 
management [including palliative radiotherapy 
to non-target lesions, etc.])  Should be used, when necessary, for all patients  
 
 
 
26 
 
 5.1.4  Excluded concomitant medications  
 Prohibited concomitant medications  
Prohibited medication/class of drug:  Usage: 
Any investigational anticancer therapy other 
than those under investigation in this study  Should not be given concomitantly whilst the patient 
is on study treatment  
mAbs against CTLA -4, PD-1, or PD-L1 other 
than pembrolizumab  Should not be given concomitantly whilst the patient 
is on study treatment  
Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
immunotherapy, or biologic or hormonal 
therapy for cancer treatment other than t hose 
under investigation in this study  Should not be given concomitantly whilst the patient 
is on study treatment. (Concurrent use of hormones 
for non-cancer-related conditions [e.g.,  insulin for 
diabetes and hormone replacement therapy] is 
acceptable. Local treatment of isolated lesions, 
excluding target lesions, for palliative intent is 
acceptable [e.g., by local surgery or radiotherapy] ) 
Immunosuppressive medications including, but 
not limited to, systemic corticosteroids at 
doses exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, and 
tumor necrosis factor -α blockers  Should not be given concomitantly, or used for 
premedication prior to the immunotherapy infusions. 
The following are allowed exceptions:  
•  Use of immunosuppr essive medications for 
the management of immune -related AEs,  
•  Short-term premedication for patients 
receiving combination agents where the 
prescribing information for the agent 
requires the use of steroids for documented 
hypersensitivity reactions,   
•  Use in patients with contrast allergies.  
•  In addition, use of inhaled, topical, and 
intranasal corticosteroids is permitted.  
  
A temporary period of steroids will be allowed if 
clinically indicated and considered to be essential for 
the management of non -immunotherapy related 
events experienced by the patient (e.g., chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, radiation, nausea, 
etc.).

 6.0  Anticipated Toxicities and Dose Delays/Modifications for Adverse Events  
 
Anticipated Toxicities  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are known to cause autoimmune toxicities including pneumonitis, colitis, 
hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, rash, encephalitis.  
In prior Phase 2 studies the IRX -2 Regimen was toler ated with acceptable toxicity.  The most common 
adverse even ts (AEs) were headache (30%), injection site pain (22%), nausea (22%), constipation (15%), 
dizziness (15%), fatigue (11%), aspiration pneumonia (11%), anemia (11%) and myalgia (7%). All were 
grade 1-2 except for the aspiration pneumonias (one Grade 3, one Grade 4) and all resolved without 
sequelae. There were only minor (grade 1) alterations in post -treatment laboratory values. Eight serious 
adverse events (SAEs) in 7 subjects were reported during treatment and the 30 -day post-operative 
period: aspiration p neumonia (n = 3), respiratory tract infection, asthma exacerbation, wound infection, 
neck abscess and alcohol withdrawal (n = 1 each); only the postoperative wound infection was 
considered related to the study treatment  (42). During treatment, several subj ects noted decreased pain 
or improved swallowing and no significant progressive symptoms were noted.  
6.1.1  Potential Overlapping Toxicities  
BOTH: diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, fever, headache, infusion related 
reaction (injection site reaction), arthralgia, shortness of breath, asthenia  
Pembrolizumab  only: fatigue, itching rash, increased creatinine, increased blood sugar changes, 
low sodium, increased lipase, alterations in thyroid hormones, increased alkaline phosphata se, 
ALT, amylase, and AST, chills, constipation, cough, dizziness, dry mouth, dry skin, inflammation 
of color, or mouth, loss of color pigmentation, lung inflammation, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, 
redness, swelling, vomiting  
IRX-2 only: lymphopenia, anemi a, difficult swallowing, myalgia, rhinorrhea, neutrophilia, 
hypoalbuminemia, dehydration, hypotension, pain With elimination of indomethacin, 
omeprazole, and zinc supplementation, we aim to see fewer toxicities that may be associated 
with indomethacin -induced gastritis.  To still carefully assess overlapping toxicities, dose 
escalation will start with dose level 1 as per Section 5.0.  
 
 
6.1.2  General Information  
The study will use the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 to grade 
toxicities.  
Intra-patient dose escalation is never permitted in this study. Rules for dose m odification are found in 
Appendix I.   
Baseline values are from the last values obtained prior to treatment.  
For holds due to toxicities related to study agent, if the parti cipant does not meet the criteria to resume 
treatment within 14 days, the participant must permanently discontinue study treatment.  
 
 
28 
 
 6.1.3  Dose Modifications  
Guidelines for the management of immune -mediated reactions for pembrolizumab  are provided in the 
Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines in Appendix I. Patients should be thoroughly 
evaluated and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or 
other etiologic causes of the immune related AE. Serolog ic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as 
appropriate, should be used to support an immune related AE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear 
alternative etiology, events should be considered potentially immune related.  
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which pembrolizumab  should be permanently 
discontinued (see the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines in Appendix I).  
Dose reductions for pembrolizumab  are not permitted . In case of doubt, the local investig ator should 
consult with the study principal inves tigator and Sponsor.  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the immune related AE. Serologic, immunologic, 
and histologic (biopsy) da ta, as appropriate, should be used to support an immune related AE diagnosis. 
In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, events should be considered potentially immune related.  
All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 5. 
Dose reductions for IRX -2 injections are not permitted . In case of doubt, the local investigator should 
consult with the study principal investigator.  
7.0  Data and Safety Monitoring and Adverse Event Reporting  
7.1.0  Adverse  Events and Unanticipated Problems  
7.1.1  Definitions  
7.1.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing condition that occurs 
during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related t o the protocol intervention.  
 
 7.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any expected or unexpected adverse event s that result in any of the following 
outcomes:  
•  Death 
•  Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred) 
•  Unplanned hospitalization (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  
•  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
•  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
•  Secondary m alignancy*  
 
 
29 
 
 •  Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bro nchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias of convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
*Modified from 21 CFR 312.32  
 
7.1.1.3 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  
An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three  of the following 
criteria: 
1.  Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied; AND 
2.  Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by the 
drugs, devices or procedures involved in the research); AND 
3.  Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.  
 
7.1.1.4 Adverse Even ts of Special Interest (AESI)  
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of standard safety 
monitoring activities. These events, regardless of seriousness, will be reported.  
   
 
7.1.2  Assessment of Adverse Events  
The site Investigator will be responsible for determining the event name, assessing the severity (i.e. 
grade), expectedness, and attribution of all adverse events.  
 
7.1.2.1 Assessment of Adverse Event Name and Grade  
Adverse events will be characterized using the descriptions and grading scales found in the most recent 
CTCAE v 5.0.  A copy of the scale can be found at NCI/ CTEP w eb site. The determination of severity for 
all other events not listed in the CTCAE v 5.0 should be made by the investigator based on medical 
judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as defined below:  
•  Grade 1 (mild) – An event that is usually t ransient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living. 
•  Grade 2 (moderate) – An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
 
 
30 
 
 •  Grade 3 (severe) – An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usua l activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.  
•  Grade 4 (life threatening) – An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an 
imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the 
subject to perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).  
•  Grade 5 (fatal) – Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
 
7.1.2.2 Assessment of Attribution  
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study 
agent or study procedure.  
•  Unrelated – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the participant.  
•  Unlikely – The event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concom itant drugs.  
•  Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.   
•  Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, the rapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
•  Definite – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably 
explained by other factors such as the  participant’s condition, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant drugs, AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, improves 
upon stopping the drug, or reappears on re -exposure.  
 
7.1.2.3 Assessment of Expectedness  
The following definiti ons will be used to determine the expectedness of the event:   
•  Unexpected – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure 
and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk 
factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event. *Mod ified from 21 CFR 
312.32 (a)  
•  Expected – An adverse event is expected if it does not meet the criteria for an unexpected 
event, OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or 
predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event.   
 
 
 
31 
 
 7.1.3   Reporting of Adverse Events  
 7.1.3.1 Routine Reporting of Non -Serious Adverse Events by Site Invest igators  
Routine AE recording will occur via data entry into the study eCRF. Recording of adverse events will 
begin once the patient is consented and will continue until 30 days after the last dose of treatment.  
Adverse events will be monitored by the Protocol Mana gement Team (PMT). Adverse events that do not 
meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems do not require expedited reporting.  AEs 
reported through expedited processes (i.e. reported to the IRB, DSMC, FDA, etc.) must also be reported 
in routine study data submissions.  
 
7.1.3.2  Expediting Reporting Requirements of SAEs and UPs by Site Investigators  
7.1.3.2.1 Criteria for Reporting SAEs/UPs to the Coordinating Center  
Serious Adverse Events meeting the criteria specified below will be repo rted to the Coordinating Center 
within 24 hours of notification that the event occurred.  
 
Adverse events that require expedited reporting include:  
•  AEs or SAEs that meet the definition of an unanticipated problem  
•  All deaths that occur within 30 days of act ive treatment  
•  All deaths that occur after 30 days of active treatment that are unexpected and possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to the study agent or procedure  
•  All serious adverse events, regardless of relationship to study agent or study procedure , that 
occur within 30 days of the last day of treatment  
•  All serious adverse events that occurred after 30 days of active treatment/therapy that are 
considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study agent or procedure  
 
Note: Follow -up reports must be submitted for all events that require expedited reporting when the 
status of the event changes and until the resolution or stabilization of the event.  
 
Reportable serious adverse events must be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, or 
determined to be irreversible by the participating investigator; for ongoing reportable adverse events 
that are unrelated to study agent, the follow -up period may end at the 30 -days post study -drug 
assessment. The Coordinating Center should be consulted  prior to ending the follow -up of events that 
have stabilized.

 Serious Adverse Events meeting the requ irements for expedited reporting to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 , will be reported as an IND safety report using the 
MedWatch Form FDA 3500A for Mandatory Reporting . 
 
The criteria that require reporting using the Medwatch 3500A are:  
•  Any unexpected fatal or life threatening adverse experi ence associated with use of the drug 
must be reported to the FDA no later than 7 calendar days after initial receipt of the 
information [ 21 CFR 312.32(c)(2) ] 
•  Any adverse experience associated with use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected 
must be submitted no later than 15 calendar days after initial receipt of the information [ 21 
CFR 312.32(c)(1) ] 
•  Any follow -up information to a study report shall be reported as soon as the relevant 
information becomes available. [ 21 CFR 312.32(d)(3) ] 
 
In addition, the study PI will s ubmit annually within 60 days (via COH OIDRA) of the anniversary date of 
when the IND went into effect, an annual report to the FDA which is to include a narrative summary and 
analysis of the information of all FDA reports within the reporting interval, a summary report of adverse 
drug experiences, and history of actions taken since the last report because of adverse drug experiences.  
 
7.1.3.3.3 Reporting to Participating Investigators  
The study PI (or designee) will report all reportable serious adverse events to participating investigators 
as an IND Safety Report occurring within 30 calendar days of receipt of sponsor (lead site) notification, 
and indicate whether or not a protocol and/or consent form change is required.  A cover letter will 
indicate the protocol title, the IND#, whether the FDA was informed, and, for non -COH sites, a 
statement that the report should be submitted to their local IRB for review as an IND saf ety report if 
applicable per local IRB policy.  
 
The study PI will also forward to participating sites all IND safety reports received from Brooklyn 
ImmunoTherapeutics  (formerly IRX Therapeutics) , indicating whether a consent form or protocol change 
is required within 30 days of notification to study PI.  
 
7.1.3.3.4 Reporting to Brooklyn Immuno Therapeutics  
All serious adverse events and AESIs (initial and follow -up information) will be reported by the study PI 
to Brooklyn Immuno Therapeutics  (formerly IRX Ther apeutics) within the same timeframes as required 
by reporting to the FDA . A copy of Medwatch Form FDA 3500A submitted to the FDA will be submitted 
to Brooklyn Immuno Therapeutics.    
 
 
7.2.0  Protocol  Deviations and Single Subject Exceptions  
It is understood that deviations from the protocol should be avoided, except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to a research participant. Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally 
be required be cause of travel delays, airport closures, inclement weather, family responsibilities, 
security alerts, government holidays, and so forth. Delays can also extend to complications of disease or 
unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression. The PI has the discretion to deviate from 
 
 
34 
 
 the protocol when necessary so long as such a deviation does not threaten patient safety or protocol 
scientific integrity. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the study staff 
and implemented promptly.  
 
7.2.1  Definitions 
7.2.1.1 Deviation 
A deviation is a divergence from a specific element of a protocol that occurred without prior IRB 
approval.  Investigators may deviate from the protocol to eliminate immediate hazard(s) for the 
protection, safety, and well -being of the study subjects witho ut prior IRB approval.  
Examples include, but are not limited to: a) dose adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) 
alteration in treatment schedule due to non -availability of the research participant for treatment; and c) 
laboratory test results w hich are slightly outside the protocol requirements but at levels that do not 
affect participant safety.  
 
 7.2.1.2 Single Subject Exceptions (SSE)  
An SSE is a planned deviation, meaning that it involves circumstances in which the specific procedures 
called for in a protocol are not in the best interests of a specific patient.  It is a deviation that is 
anticipated and receives prior approval by the P I and the IRB.  
  
7.2.2  Reporting of Deviations and SSEs  
 7.2.2.1 Reporting Deviations  
For any deviation, the  Investigator  will notify the COH DSMC and IRB within 5 calendar days of its 
occurrence via iRIS in accordance with the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy . A list of deviations 
from all participating sites will be submitted along with the Protocol Managem ent Team (PMT) progress 
report to the COH DSMC.  
 
For non-COH sites:  
o  The local IRB and/or DSMC must be notified according to local institutional policies.  
o  The study Principal Investigator must be notified as soon as practical (within 24 hours of 
notification of the event) via email to jchao@coh.org  and dcc@coh.org .  This email 
should provide input on the following:  
▪  Description of the event  
▪  Impact on participant safety or the safety to others 
▪  Impact on the study design  
▪  A corrective and preventative action plan  
 
7.2.2.2 Reporting Single Subject Exceptions  
 
 
35 
 
 The SSE must be submitted as a “Single Subject Exception Amendment Request” via iRIS in accordance  
with IRB guidelines and the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy .  An IRB approved SSE does not 
need to be submitted as a deviation to the DSMC.  
 
All non-emergency planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by the Study 
Principal Investigator, the Site Principal Investigator, COH IRB, and when applicable, the local IRB.  In 
addition, if contractually obligated, the sponsor must al so approve the deviation.  
 
7.3.0  Study Oversight, Quality Assurance, and Data & Safety Monitoring  
7.3.1  All Investigator  Responsibilities  
 
An investigator is responsible for ensuring that an investigation is conducted according to the signed 
investigator statement, the investigational plan, and applicable regulations; for protecting the rights,

with §21 CFR 312.64.   
•  Ensure that all associates, colleagues and employees assisting in the conduct of the study are 
informed about their obligations in meeting the above commitments.  
•  Maintain adequate and accurate records in accordance with §21 CFR 312.62 and to make those 
records available for inspection with the Sponsor (or designee).  
•  Ensure that an IRB that complies with the requirements of §21 CFR part 56 will be responsible 
for initial and continuing review and approval of the clinical study.  
•  Promptly report to the IR B and the Sponsor all changes in the research activity and all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (to include amendments and IND 
safety reports).  
•  Seek IRB and Sponsor approval before any changes are made in the research study, ex cept when 
necessary to eliminate hazards to the patients/subjects.  
•  Comply with all other requirements regarding the obligations of clinical investigators and all 
other pertinent requirements listed in § 21 CFR part 312.

 7.3.2  Study Principal Investigator  Responsibilities  
The Study Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial, including overseeing 
that sponsor responsibilities as defined in § 21 CFR 312. Subpart D are executed in accordance with 
federal regulation s.  
 
7.3.3  Protocol Management Team (PMT)  
The Protocol Management Team (PMT) , minimally consisting of the study PI , site investigators, 
collaborating investigators, research nurse, clinical research associate/coordinator, and the study 
biostatistician , is responsible for ongoing monitoring of the data and safety of this study, including 
implementation of the stopping rules for safety/toxicity.  
 
The PMT is recommended to  meet (in person or via teleconference) at least monthly to review study 
status. This re view will include, but not be limited to, reportable AEs and UPs, and an update of the 
ongoing study summary that describes study progress in terms of the study schema. The meeting will be 
a forum to discuss study related issues including accrual, SAE/AEs experienced, study response, 
deviations/violations and study management issues. The appropriateness of further subject enrollment 
and the specific intervention for subsequent subject enrollment are addressed. It is recommended that 
minutes of these discuss ions be taken to document the date of these meetings, attendees and the 
issues that were discussed (in a general format).   
 
7.3.4  Monitoring  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights of human subjects are protected, that the 
study is implemented in accordance with the protocol and regulatory requirements, and that the quality 
and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  Monitoring for this study will 
be performed by the City of Hope Office of Clinical Tri als Auditing and Monitoring (OCTAM).  
 
The site Investigator/Institution will permit the study monitors and appropriate regulatory authorities 
direct access to the study data and to the corresponding source data and documents to verify the 
accuracy of this  data. The Investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The 
Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given 
access to all the above noted study -related documents and stu dy related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
 
Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in the OCTAM SOP that is provided as a supplement 
to this document. This documen t specifies the frequency of monitoring, monitoring procedures, the 
level of clinical site monitoring activities (e.g., the percentage of subject data to be reviewed), and the 
distribution of monitoring reports.  Staff from OCTAM will conduct monitoring ac tivities and provide 
reports of the findings and associated action items in accordance with the details described in the SOP.  
Documentation of monitoring activities and findings will be provided to the site study team, the site PI, 
study PI, and the COH D SMC.  
 
7.3.5  Quality Assurance  
The City of Hope Clinical Research Information Support will provide support for this multi -center trial as 
detailed in the COH DCC Operations Plan provided as a supplement to this document.   
 
 
 
37 
 
 7.3.6  City of Hope Data and Sa fety Monitoring Committee  
This is a risk level  4 study as defined in the City of Hope Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan . 
This determination was made because the study involves COH as the IND holder and escalates the study 
agent to a dose above that indicated by the FDA for the agent’s currently approved indication.  
 
The DSMC is a multidisciplinary committee charged with overseeing the monitoring of safety of 
participant s in clinical trials, and the conduct, progress, validity, and integrity of the data for all clinical 
trials that are sponsored by City of Hope. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with 
experience in oncology and who have no direct relationsh ip with the study. The committee reviews the 
progress and safety of all active research protocols that are not monitored by another safety and data 
monitoring committee or board.   
 
The Study Principal Investigator is required to submit pe riodic status reports (the PMT r eport) according 
to the guidelines outlined  in the City of Hope Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan .  The PMT 
report will be submitted to  the COH DSM C quarterly from the date of activation.   
 
The COH Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and accrual 
data from this trial.  The DSMC will review up -to-date participant accrual; summary of all adverse events 
captured v ia routine and expedited reporting; a summary of deviations; any response information; 
monitoring reports, and summary comments provided by the study team. Other information (e.g. scans, 
laboratory values) will be provided upon request.  For Phase I studies , a Phase I Tracking Log will be 
utilized and reviewed by the DSMC to monitor data and safety for dose escalation.  A review of outcome 
results (response, toxicity and adverse events) and factors external to the study (such as scientific or 
therapeutic dev elopments) is discussed, and the Committee votes on the status of each study. 
Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Principal 
Investigator, statistician and study team. The PMT report and DSMC recommendat ions will be circulated 
to all participating sites for submission to their IRBs, in accordance with NIH guidance.  
 
8.0  Agent Information  
Drug Information for IRX-2 
Mode of Action:   IRX-2 is a primary cell -derived biologic containing multiple active cytokine 
components produced under pharmaceutical standards from phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and 
ciprofloxacin stimulated donor mononuclear cells. Route of administration of IRX -2 takes advantage 
of the normal afferent and efferent pathways of lymph node acti vation. By presenting the cytokine -
containing biologic in the area of lymph nodes rather than systemically, there is an opportunity to 
facilitate the mobilization of antigen presenting cells and enhance dendritic cell function as well as 
directly activate T cells to proliferate and become cytotoxic lymphocytes. T cells may become 
activated to common tumor antigens or mutated autologous neoantigens that are found in the local 
tumor microenvironment. Additionally, subcutaneous administration may be less toxic  since the 
systemic cytokine drug concentration is much lower.  
8.1.1  Risks and Contraindications  
Ciprofloxacin and PHA are used in the manufacture of IRX -2. Ciprofloxacin and PHA concentrations are 
significantly reduced by centrifugation and dilution during manu facture and only very small amounts 
 
 
38 
 
 remain in the final product. Nevertheless, individuals who are allergic to ciprofloxacin or PHA should not 
be treated with IRX -2. 
Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in individuals with evidence of pre -existing myelosupp ression, 
myelodysplasia or hemorrhagic cystitis.  
 
8.1.2  Supplier  
Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics   
8.1.3  Dose and Administration  
IRX-2 will be administered subcutaneously into a maximum of 4 lymph node -bearing regions : bilateral 
supraclavicular  and bilateral axillary regions  are preferred. IRX -2 can be administered in the bilateral 
mastoid lymph node -bearing region if supraclavicular or axillary nodes have been removed . Two dose 
levels will be considered. For dose level 1, o ne ml (115 units/ml) will be injected into 2 lymph node regions 
(total 2 ml (230 units/day))  preferentially into the supraclavicular node regions with substitution of axillary 
node regions if the supraclavicular lymph nodes have been removed . For dose leve l 2, one ml (115 
units/ml) will be injected into 4 lymph node regions  (total 4 ml (460 units/day)).  
Other IRX-2 Regimen Medications :    
Cyclophosphamide will generally be purchased by the pharmacy of the study site and will be supplied to 
study personnel by the study si te investigational pharmacist.

completed by Day 15   Dose Level 1:  
230 units total daily 
(2 injections daily 
comprised of 115 units  in 
each injection ) 
 
Dose Level 2:  
460 units total daily 
(4 injections daily 
comprised of 115 units in 
each injection ) Dose Level 1:  Subcutaneous at or near the 
supraclavicular lymph node regions bilaterally  
(substitute axillary if supraclavicular nodes have 
been removed). 
 
Dose level 2: Subcutaneous  at or near the 
supraclavicular and axillary node regions 
bilaterally  (if any of these nodes have been 
removed, can inject at or near mastoid 
insertion of both sternocleidomastoid muscles ). 
 
The study personnel or other trained individuals will administer IRX -2 injections to ensure treatment 
compliance. IRX -2 can be given as a subcutaneous injection through a 25 -guage needle.  
Any non-compliance with the study treatment needs to be documented in the clinical record.  
 
 
39 
 
 8.1.4  Formulation/Agent Preparation  
IRX-2 is supplied as a pale yellow, sterile liqui d for subcutaneous injection in 2.0 mL single -dose 
vials. All immediate study supply containers will be appropriately labeled to identify study 
number, lot number, and product identity. Study syringes for subcutaneous IRX -2 administration 
will be disposed of in accordance with biosafety procedures.  Prepared drug must be used within 
24 hours of removing the vial from frozen storage.  
  
8.1.5  Storage 
IRX-2 must be stored in a secure area and maintained under labeled storage conditions at a range 
of −15oC to –50o C.   
Drug Information for Pembrolizumab  (Keytruda®) 
Other Names:  Keytruda® 
Mode of Action:   Pembrolizumab  is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody 
which binds to and blocks the activation of PD -1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein.  This 
prevents the interaction between PD -1 with its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1), 
overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2), which is primary 
expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs).  This results in the activation of T -cells and cell -
mediated immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens.  
8.1.6  Risks and Contraindications  
No contraindications or drug interactions  
Warnings and Precautions  include development of:  
•  Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis  
•  Immune-Mediated Colitis  
•  Immune-Mediated Hepatitis  
•  Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies  
•  Immune-Mediated Nephritis a nd Renal Dysfunction  
•  Immune-Mediated Skin Adverse Reactions  
•  Immune-Mediated Encephalitis  
•  Other Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions

Store the diluted solution from the pembrolizumab 100 mg/4 mL vial either:  
•  At room temperature for no more than 6 hours from the time of dilution.  This includes 
room temperature storage of the infusion in the IV bag, and the duration of the infusion.  
•  Under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  for no more than 24 hours from the time of 
dilution. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution to come to room temperature prior to

•  Do not freeze.  
 
Use of IRX-2 and COVID -19 
As the extent of the exposure and infection with COVID -19 grows, Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics (BITX) 
has reviewed the available literature and is providing the following as guidance for use of IRX -2 in 
patients at this time.  
Published literature suggests that some of the deaths from COVID -19 have been linked to cytokin e 
release syndrome, or “Cytokine storm”. It is important to note that during the development of IRX -2, we 
have not had any reports of Cytokine Release Syndrome to date, but, given the components, and 
mechanism of action of the drug, BITX feels there could be a small, but theoretically possible risk in the 
administration of IRX -2 to a patient who may be co -infected with COVID -19, by creating an increased 
risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome.  
Given this, we recommend the following:  
•  All subjects should have a neg ative COVID -19 screening test within 5 days of 
 
 
41 
 
 administration of first dose of a cycle of IRX -2. 
•  Subjects should be instructed to take all precautions possible to limit their exposure to 
COVID-19 during their treatment with IRX -2. 
•  Any subjects that present  with symptoms of COVID -19 infection should immediately 
discontinue treatment with IRX -2. Once symptoms have fully resolved and the subject has 
demonstrated a negative COVID -19 test, resumption of IRX -2 dosing can occur at the 
Investigator’s discretion.

TGen Downstream Correlative Analyses  
An overall lo w abundance of somatic 
mutations with antigenic potential is a 
second feature of Gastroesophageal cancers 
that may limit its responsiveness to 
immunotherapy . T cell-mediated immunity 
to neo-antigens (novel peptide sequences 
created by tumor mutations) shapes the 
genomic lan dscape of emergent tumors and 
mediates the efficacy of successful 
immunotherapies57. However, p redicting 
which tumor mutations have immunogenic 
potential is a multi -factorial and highly -personalized inquiry, 
dependent upon: (i) the set of particular mutant sequences in the 
tumor, (ii) the expression of proteins cont aining those sequences, 
(iii) the ability of mutant sequences to be presented by autologous 
HLA proteins, and (iv) the activation and expansion of appropriate T 
cells that can eliminate the tumor. We estimate a median ~40 
somatic coding mutations per GE tu mor. Based on published 
estimates, 5 -20% of these might be expected to have antigenic 
potential. As a consequence, even if the tumor microenvironment is 
modulated to become more immunogenic, the potential for a 
clinical response to combination immunotherap y is likely to depend 
upon an intrinsic capacity for T cell recognition that varies from 
tumor to tumor58. 
Both MHC class I -restricted CD8+ and MHC class II -restricted CD4+ T 
cells have been implicated in successful anti -tumor immunity59, 60. 
Athough in silico methods for predicting class I binding sequenc es 
have shown some utility, models of HLA class II binding are generally of limited predictive value60. To 
address this gap, we developed a novel multiplexed  proteomics technology ‘MHC -PepSeq’ that enables 
large (10,000s), programmable sets of DNA -encoded peptides to be assayed for binding against a panel of 
human HLA class II proteins, using a digital sequencing readout. This technology will be deployed in 
association with comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic sequencing ( Figure 1). Importantly, our 
recent validation experiments, indicate this system has proven to be highly effective at predicting the 
Figure 1. An integrated approach to 
predict and monitor neo -antigen-specific 
immunity.  (A) Comprehensive genomic 
tumor analysis (exome, transcriptome 
sequencing, in silico neoantigen prediction) 
will be combined with the MHC -PepSeq 
assay to identify tumor mutations that 
result in variant pep tides capable of binding 
host HLA. The landscape of such mutations 
may be predictive of the response to 
immunotherapy. (B) Non-invasive (ctDNA) 
assays measuring the abundance of 
different classes of the mutations 
characterized in (A) will be developed for 
serial study of each individual and used to 
monitor the response over time. 
Disproportionate changes in the 
abundance of immunogenic v non -
immunogenic mutations may provide a 
sensitive measure of immune pressure in 
response to immunotherapy.

 epitope targets of naturally -arising T cell responses to  influenza virus, substantially outperforming in silico 
methods. 
To look for immunological predictors and correlates of therapeutic effect within the trial, we will assay 
tumor sections for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). While TIL density/localizat ion has previously been 
correlated with therapeutic anti -tumor immunity, it can be challenging to obtain serial samples of tumor 
tissue after treatment and, even when such biopsies are obtained, traditional tissue analysis affords only 
a fairly narrow view  of the response. Therefore, in parallel, we will develop a richer view using an 
integrated comprehensive genomics approach to predict and monitor neo -antigen-specific immunity 
(outlined in Figure 1 ). This approach combines 2 novel multiplexed assays (“MHC -PepSeq” and “TARDIS”) 
that both provide personalized information about the immunogenicity of mutations within individual 
tumors. 
(i) MHC-PepSeq – identifying mutations with 
immunogenic potential  
We will use a new multiplexed assay (MHC -
PepSeq), together with  in silico prediction, to assay 
all tumor mutations expressed in each individual 
(identified by both DNA and mRNA sequencing) 
against autologous HLA II proteins. Each mutation 
will be represented, alongside its wild -type 
counterpart, at each position of a 15mer pepti de - 
resulting in ~30 peptides per SNV/indel.  
 
For each patient, the assay will output a personalized 
immunogenicity landscape  that represents the predicted 
interaction between tumor and host. We expect ~5 -20% 
of the coding somatic mutations to have immun ogenic 
potential restricted by at least one of the patient’s HLAs, 
resulting in a fairly limited and variable set of potential 
neo-antigens in each patient. We will assess whether 
these neo -antigen sets are predictive of the clinical 
response to combinatio n therapy across the trial cohort.  
(ii) ctDNA-based monitoring tumor response to combination immunotherapy  
We have developed a targeted multiplexed digital sequencing assay for circulating tumor DNA (‘TARDIS’) 
that enables non -invasive high -dimensional tum or monitoring by quantifying a panel of personalized 
tumor variant sequences in circulating cell -free DNA. Changes in the allele fraction of these variants over 
time are indicative of changes in tumor activity, load and/or composition – and have been shown  to 
provide early indicators of the response to therapy61,62. Here, we propose to extend this concept to the 
detection of immune -mediated selection. Using the immunogenicity -predicting assay described above, 
we will identify 2 categories of mutations for each individual’s tumor  – putatively ‘ immunogenic’ and 
‘non-immunogenic’ . For each category/patient, a multiplexed panel of ~5 -10 TARDIS assays will be 
designed and used to monitor serial patient plasma samples. Tumor -specific immunity is expected to 
manifest as the disproportionate loss of immunogenic mutations v non -immunogenic mutations over 
Figure 2. Accurate T cell epitope prediction using the MHC-
PepSeq assay . A library comprising 3431 DNA -encoded 
peptides representing the proteome of H5N1 influenza was 
synthesized and tested for binding against 10 HLA -DR proteins, 
resulting in ~34000 multiplexed peptide -MHC measurements. 
The subset (~1%) o f data corresponding to HLA -DRB1*01:01 
binding of NP -derived peptides is shown  (upper panel ), and 
compared to in silico prediction data generated for the same 
peptides using the tool available at www.iedb.org ( lower panel ). 
Overlaid in vertical red / orange bars are the positions of all six 
previously identified DRB1*01:01 -restricted T cell NP epitopes 
identified in the literature . MHC-PepSeq identifies these known 
T cell epitopes with considerably higher accuracy than  state-of-
the-art in silico prediction.

 time (represented in Fig 1b), as has been observed in serial tissue b iopsies of melanomas treated with 
nivolumab63. Tracking multiple mutations in each category will afford statistical power and help to 
compensate for any limitations in the immun ogenicity prediction step. Overall, this strategy will offer a 
sensitive molecular correlate of anti -tumor immunity that will be viewed alongside – and used to enrich 
– the interpretation of  standard clinical monitoring (i.e. imaging).

every 9 weeks afterwards. For patients with the first documentation of progressive disease, treatment can be continued if no clinical deterioration and no grade 
3-4 toxicities. Confirmatory scan will be obtained in ≥ 4 weeks. If the disease progression is confirmed, the patient will be tak en off the study. If the disease 
progression is not confirmed and the patient does not have grade 3 -4 toxicities, the patient will continue the treatment on the study.  For patients who complete 
35 cycles of therapy, scans can be spaced out to every 12 -24 weeks at the discretion of the treating physician.

 11.0  Evaluation Criteria/Measurement of Effect  
Primary Endpoint: Toxicity   
The primary endpoint is toxicity. Toxicity will be captured in a standardized manner using the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (v 5). Dose limiting toxicity is defined in Section 5.4 of the 
protocol. The MTD will be based on the assessment of DLT . All patients who are not evaluable for dose 
limiting toxicity will be replaced.   A patient is evaluable for DLT if he/she receives the cycle 1 dose of 
pembrolizumab (100%) and 80% of the planned doses of IRX -2 during cycle 1 OR he/she experiences a 
DLT.  If this minimum amount of treatment is not reached due to treatment related AEs,  this is 
considered a DLT.  However, patients who fail to achieve this minimum amount of treatment due to 
reasons that are clearly unrelated to treatment (e.g. error on part of patient or healthcare provider ) will 
be replaced.  
Secondary Endpoint: Response  
Response is the secondary  endpoint. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the 
new updated international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) Committee version 1.1.  
Only those patients who h ave measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These 
patients will have their response classified according to the definitions sta ted below.  (Note:  Patients 
who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
11.1.1  Definitions  
•  Evaluable for toxicity :  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment 
with IRX-2 and/or pembrolizumab . 
•  Evaluable for objective response :  Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified according to 
the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the 
end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
11.1.2  Disease Param eters 
•  Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >10mm with conventional techniques (CT, 
MRI, or caliper measurement) and as >20mm by chest X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by 
aerated lung.) Lymph nodes greater than 10mm on short axis are considered measureable as well. 
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
•  Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <20 mm by chest X -ray or <10 mm using CT, MRI or caliper measurement), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Organomegaly, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericard ial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by CT or MRI are all non -measurable.  
•  Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Lymph nodes less than 15mm in the short axis cannot be used as target 
 
 
52 
 
 lesions.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesio ns with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or 
clinically).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum LD.  The bas eline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the 
objective tumor response.  
•  Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and 
above the 10 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded 
at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each 
should be noted throughout follow -up.  
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 30 days before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to assess th e 
antitumor effect of a treatment.  
•  Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., 
skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography, including a  ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
•  Chest x-ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
•  Conventional CT and MRI :  These techniques should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm.  This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors an d 
those of extremities usually require specific protocols.  
•  Ultrasound (US) :  When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, US 
should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical 
measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.  US 
might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed 
by clinical examination.  
•  Endoscopy, Laparoscopy :  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation has not 
yet been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated 
equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers.  Therefore, the 
utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation 
purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
•  Tumor markers :  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  
•  Cytology, Histology :  These techniques can be used to diffe rentiate between partial responses (PR) 
and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 
53 
 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any  effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect 
of the trea tment) and progressiv e disease. 
Response Criteria  
11.1.4  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Lymph node CR is when the 
lymph node has decreased to less than 10mm in the short axis.  
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started (including the baseline scan if that is the 
smallest), and at least a 5mm increase or the appearance of new 
lesions. 
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started  
11.1.5  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  
Incomplete 
Response/Stable Disease 
(SD): Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. However, unequi vocal 
progression should not normally trump target disease status.  It 
must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances.  
11.1.6  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response a ssignment will 
depend on the achievement of measurement criteria, but confirmation is not necessary.

* In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions 
may be accepted as disease progression.  
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression 
at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration” .  Every effort 
should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  
11.1.7  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the  first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement crite ria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started.  
11.1.8  Disease Control Rate (DCR)  
DCR is defined as the proportion of pa tients with the best overall response of CR, PR, or SD 
according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
 
 
55 
 
 11.1.9  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival is defined as the length of time between study enrollment and when 
objective evidence of disease progression is do cumented.  
11.1.10  Overall Survival  
Overall survival is defined as the length of time between study enrollment and death.  
11.1.11  Tumor Imaging on Study per Immune -related RECIST (irRECIST)  
RECIST 1.1 may not provide an accurate assessment of immunotherapeu tic agents such as 
pembrolizumab .  Immune -related RECIST (irRECIST) is RECIST 1.1 adapted as described below to 
account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutics.   
Patients with 1st radiologic assessment of PD by RECIST 1.1 may continue treatment if clin ically 
stable as per  Table 11.  If the repeat scan confirms PD, patients will be discontinued from 
treatment.  Exception can be made if the Investigator feels the patient is deriving benefit from 
treatment and after discussion with the study PI and Sponsor .  Subsequent imaging should be 
pursued every 6 weeks until demonstration of confirmed PR or CR in which event imaging will 
then be conducted every 9 weeks if a patients has  completed initial 18 weeks of protocol therapy .  
Imaging may be more frequent if c linically indicated.  
 
Clinically stable is defined by the following criteria:  
•  Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression  
•  No decline in ECOG performance status  
•  Absence of rapid progression of disease  
•  Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention

signed by an authorized investigator prior to registering the subject. See Section 4.3 for the registration 
procedure.  
Protocol Deviations  
12.1.4  Deviation Polic y 
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “Clinical Research Protocol Deviation Policy”  
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter the protocol integrity 
require prior IRB approval of a single subject ex ception (SSE) request. IRB pre -approved SSE protocol 
modifications are considered an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation. The submission of a 
deviation report is not required.  
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to tr avel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc. This can a lso 
extend to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression. The 
PI has the discreti on to deviate from the protocol when necessary so long as such deviation does not 
threaten patient safety or protocol scientific integrity. Example include, but are not limited to: dose 
adjustments  based on excessive patient weight, alteration in treatment  schedule due to non -availability 
of the research participant for treatment, laboratory test results which are slightly outside the protocol 
requirements but at levels that do not affect participant safety. These instances are considered 
deviations from th e protocol. A deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRM within five days.  
 
 
58 
 
 12.1.5  Reporting of Deviations  
All deviations will be reported to the COH DSMC within five days. The DSMC will forward the report to 
the IRM following review.  
12.1.6  Resolving Disputes  
The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research agent that would cause a protocol 
deviation without approval by the PI. Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key point, the IDS 
should rely on the PI to clarify the issue.  
In situations where there is misperception or dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the persons 
involved in implementing the protocol it is the responsibility of the PI to resolve the dispute and the PI 
may consult with the DSMC chair or des ignee to ar rive at resolution.  
13.0  Statistical Considerations  
Evaluable Participants and Participant Replacement  
All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with IRX -2 regimen 
and pembrolizumab . 
.  
13.1.1  Design  
Phase I of the invest igation will comprise a s afety lead-in phase: A standard 3+3 dose finding rule will be 
employed  with two dose levels .  Patients will start at dose level 1  [IRX-2 regimen at dose of 2 mL (230 
units/day)] . Patients will be enrolled in cohort s of 3, separated  by at least  1 week.  Initially, 3 patients 
will be treated with expansion to 3 more patients in the event of 1/3 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) as 
observed during the first 3  weeks of treatment, escalation if 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs, and termination of 
escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs.  Once ≥ 2 patients experience a DLT at a dose level, the next lower dose level will 
be expanded to 6 evaluable patients, if fewer than 6 evaluable patients have been treated at the dose 
level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose tested in which only 0 or 1 out 
of 6 evaluable patients experience a DLT.  The Recommended Phase 2 Dosing (RP2D)  will not exceed the 
MTD but may be lower based on cumulative toxicities and dose modification patterns.  If the rules 
suggest escalation at the highest proposed dose, that dose will accrue to 6 patients where <2 DLTs will 
determine that as the MTD, and 2 or more DLTs will require de -escalation. These rules will be used to 
determine the IRX -2 regimen dosing for the expan sion phase . Occurrence and severity of adverse events 
including dose limiting toxicities, with severity determined according to NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 5. Phase II is a single arm, non -randomized study to investigate 
secondary endpoints that include median progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) 
by RECIST version 1.1 criteria. Exploratory endpoints include descriptive statistics on circulating T cell 
profiles in patients pre and post therapeutic int ervention with the combination IRX -2 regimen and 
pembrolizumab.  
 
Sample Size and Accrual Rate  
The safety phase of the study will enroll 3 to 6 patients per dose level. The dose expansion phase will 
enroll 8 to 14 patients at the recommended dose level fro m the safety phase for a total enrollment of 20 
 
 
59 
 
 patients. The 6 to 12 patients treated at all dose levels in the safety phase of the study will be included as 
a part of the phase II dose expansion patient population.  
 
Historical data with single agent PD-1 inhibitors in gastroesophageal cancer  indicate median PFS at 1.5 
months. With an alpha of .05, hypothesized median PFS improved to  3.0 months  with the combination 
IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab , study accrual of 30 months, and 12 -month follow -up evaluation 
timeframe, a sample size of 20 patients will have 84% power to detect median differences in PFS.   
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
13.1.2  Primary Objective  
A standard 3+3 dose finding rule will be employed  with two dose levels .  Patients will start at dose leve l 1 
[IRX-2 regimen at dose of 2 mL (230 units/day)] . Patients will be enrolled in cohort s of 3, separated by at 
least 1 week.  Initially, 3 patients will be treated with expansion to 3 more patients in the event of 1/3 
dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) as ob served during the first 3  weeks of treatment, escalation if 0/3 or 1/6 
DLTs, and termination of escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs.  Once ≥ 2 patients experience a DLT at a dose level, the 
next lower dose level will be expanded to 6 evaluable patients, if fewer than 6 evaluable patients have 
been treated at the dose level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose tested 
in which only 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable patients experience a DLT.  The Recommended Phase 2 Dosing 
(RP2D) will not exceed t he MTD but may be lower based on cumulative toxicities and dose modification 
patterns.  If the rules suggest escalation at the highest proposed dose, that dose will accrue to 6 patients 
where <2 DLTs will determine that as the MTD, and 2 or more DLTs will require de -escalation. These rules 
will be used to determine the IRX -2 regimen dosing for the expansion phase .  
 
13.1.3   Secondary Objectives  
Progression free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study drug administration to disease 
progression o r death due to any cause. For PFS, the Kaplan -Meier estimates and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals for the median and quartiles will be provided.  
 
13.1.4  Correlative Exploratory Objectives  
Descriptive statistics will be compiled on circulating T cell profi les for each patient at pre - and post-
therapeutic intervention with the combination IRX -2 Regimen and Pembrolizumab. Repeated measures 
t-tests will be conducted to examine pre and post -intervention differences between baseline and post -
treatment tumor tiss ue Nanostring expression profiling. Data will be screened for parametric statistical 
assumption and the alpha level for all statistical tests will be set at .05. The Bonferroni correction will be 
applied to adjust for potentially inflated family wise error  rates for multiple comparisons with the same 
sample.

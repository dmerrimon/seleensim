Amendment 04  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The overall rationale for this amendment is to facilitate participant enrollment by allowing participants to  enter the study without having to discontinue concomitant antitremor medications , 
unless these medications (eg, primidone) are prohibited in accordance with other exclusion 
criteria .

9.4.2 Primary Estimand 
9.4.3.1 Secondary Estimand A new type of  intercurrent  event 
was added to account for  any 
changes in concomitant 
medications after initiation of study intervention . To align with the allowance of 
concomitant use of antitremor 
medication.

TETRAS- ADL subscale and the 
CGI-S scale are to be performed 
at Screening Visit 1 only for 
participants who do not need to 
washout from medications  that 
impact tremor; otherwise , these 
assessment s should be 
performed at Screening Visit 2. To align with the allowance of 
concomitant use of antitremor  
medication .

2.3.1 Risk Assessment 
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk 
Summary  Clarification was added that the potential risks associated with discontinuation of prior 
medication s are relative to 
protocol- prohibited medications
. To ensure potential risks regarding 
discontinuation of any prior 
medication s are clearly understood.  
The statement relative to the 
potential risk of untreated 
symptoms of ET for those who 
are randomized to placebo  was 
modified to specify the risk 
applies only to those who 
discontinue protocol -prohibited 
antitremor medication  (eg, 
primidone) in order to 
participate  in the study . To align with the allowance of 
concomitant use of anti -tremor 
medication.

Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
9.4.2 Primary Estimand 
9.4.3 Secondary Estimand  Stratification at randomization 
will include a stratum relative to 
whether the participant is taking 
antitremor  medication at the 
Baseline Visit.  Concomitant use of antitremor  
medication(s) may impact response 
to treatment with JZP385.  
5.1 Inclusion Criteria A note w as modified in 
Inclusion Criterion #3a relative to medication washout and screening for study entry. Clarification.  
Inclusion Criterion #4 was 
updated to clarify that male partners of WOCBP are 
required to use barrier 
protection from the first dose of 
study intervention until 30 days 
after the last dose of study 
intervention. Clarification

Amendment 04 
 Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale 
Inclus ion Criterion #7 was 
added to require that, for 
participants who are being 
treated with antitremor 
medication, the dosage of medication must be stable for at 
least 6 weeks prior to their Screening Visit, and they do not 
anticipate any changes during 
the study. For participants not 
taking antitremor medication 
upon entering the study, they 
must have refrained from taking 
any antitremor medication within 6 weeks prior to their 
Screening Visit and not 
anticipate taking concomitant 
antitremor medication during participation in the study. To clarify restrictions surrounding 
stability of d osage for concomitant 
antitremor medications (or lack of use of antitremor medications).  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria Exclus ion Criterion #6 was 
updated to indicate that participants  with a history of 
Gilbert’s syndrome may be 
eligible for the study . To allow inclusion of participants  
with Gilbert's syndrome as 
UGT1A1 is not involved in 
JZP385 metabolism.  
Exclusion C riterion #13 was 
modified to remove the 
exclusion of antitremor 
medications . To align with the allowance of 
concomitant use of antitremo r 
medication . 
Information on timing of 
discontinuation of primidone relative to study intervention 
was moved from Exclusion 
Criterion #13 to #14. Modification of an exclusion 
criterion resulted in moving information  as appropriate. 
Exclusion C riterion #17 was 
modified to clarify that  
participants should refrain from 
using medication(s)/substance(s)  that 
might produce tremor or interfere with the evaluation of 
tremor prior to discharge on  
study visit days.  Clarification

 Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale 
Exclusion Criterion #21 was 
updated to indicate that screening laboratory tests may 
be repeated as needed.  To allow repeat screening  
laboratory tests to be performed 
more than once in circumstances in 
which these additional tests are 
needed to confirm eligibility . 
Information about the exclusion 
of medical and recreational use 
of cannabinoids (including CBD) was moved from 
Exclusion Criter ion # 13a to #22. Modification of an exclusion 
criterion resulted in moving 
information  as appropriate .

5.4 Screen Failures 
8 Study Assessments and 
Procedures 
8.2.2 Tremor Research Group 
Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale – 
Performance Subscale 
(Table  5) Rescreened participants, who 
had previously met the inclusion 
criterion relative to ET diagnosis confirmed by EAC  
(Inclusion Criterion  #2), will not 
be assessed again for that criterion when rescreened and 
will not complete the 
TETRAS- PS at screening . This procedure lessens the burden 
on potential participants permitted 
to be rescreened for entry into the study without impacting the 
study’s integrity, as an ET 
diagnosis is not anticipated to change.  
8.1.1 Informed Consent Clarified th at no study 
procedures, including washout 
of prior medications, may be 
undertaken before signing the 
ICF. Clarification  
8.1.4. Medication Review 
(Prior or Concomitant Medications)  Medication(s) taken for ET 
should be reviewed within the 
prior 6 weeks (as opposed to prior 30 days) for all other 
medications.  To ensure complete information on 
ET medication history is collected 
to align and confirm with new 
eligibility criteri a specifications.  
Appendix 1: Abbreviations and Definitions The abbreviations CBD (for 
cannabidiol) and PRN w ere 
added. CBD and PRN are used  in the body 
of the protocol.

 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1. Synopsis
Protocol Title:  
A Phase 2b, 12- week , Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Randomized, Parallel-group, 
Multicenter Study of the Safety and Efficacy of JZP385 in the Treatment of Adults with 
Moderate to Severe Essential Tremor  
Brief Title:  A Study of JZP385 in Adults with Moderate to Severe Esse ntial Tremor (ET)  
Rationale: 
This is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter 
study of the safety and efficacy of JZP385 (also known as CX -8998, suvecaltamide, and 
MK-8998) in the treatment of adult participants with ET, as defined by the Movement Disorder 
Society (MDS) Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors from the Task Force on Tremor of the International Parkinson’s and MDS. This study was designed to be consistent with 
the United States (US) Foo d and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry on 
Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E1A and E8 Guidance, and with the ethical 
principles in these guidances that originate from the Declaration of Helsinki. A phase 2a study, CX‑8998- CLN2 -001 (T-CALM), provided proof-of-concept and informed the design of this 
study.  
The target patient population is participants with moderate to severe ET, which was se lected to 
reflect the patient population within clinical practice for whom a therapeutic intervention for ET 
would be considered. Patients with mild ET are typically not treated with medication, as the 
tremor is not usually associated with significant functional disability. Essential tremor severity level in this study will be defined by eligibility criteria on the patient -rated (Tremor Research 
Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale [TETRAS] – Activities of Daily Living [TETRAS -ADL])  and clinician -rated (Clinical Global Impression of Severity [CGI -S]) measures 
of disability. The inclusion of a placebo control group in this study is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of JZP385. 
The primary endpoint for the study is a composite of the sum of modified items 1  to 11 of the 
TETRAS -ADL subscale and modified  items 6 and 7 of the TETRAS- PS (ie, TETRAS composite 
outcome score) . The TETRAS -ADL subscale is  a patient -rated scale of the impact of tremor on 
day-to-day functioning administered by a trained interviewer. The TETRAS- ADL  subscale 
directly measures how a patient functions by assessing activities impacted by tremor, such as 
eating and drinking, dressing and personal hygiene, carrying items, and fine motor skills. The 
TETRAS -ADL demonstrated sensitivity to change with JZP385 in the T- CALM  study (see the 
JZP385 Investigator’s Brochure [IB] for full results). The TETRAS -PS is a valid and reliable 
clinical rating scale that has demonstrated sensitivity to change with treatment and is recommended by the MDS Task Force to assess tremor severity. Items 6 (drawing an Archimedes spiral) and 7 (handwriting) of the TETRAS-PS evaluate the impact of upper limb 
tremor on performance, and thus represent an objective measure of the impact of upper limb 
tremor on functional tasks. Together, the items from the TETRAS -ADL subscale and

Overall Design 
Study Phase  Phase 2b  
Clinical Indication  Essential Tremor  
Study Type  Interventional 
Type of Design Randomized, parallel-group, 4- arm, multicenter  
Randomization will be stratified by the following : 
•The select modified items from the TETRAS -ADL subscale
and TETRAS- PS (ie, TETRAS composite outcome  score )a
(≤ 17 or > 17 ), as assessed at the Baseline Visit
•The use of concomitan t antitremor medication (Yes or No)
Type of Control Placebo Control 
Study Blinding  Double-blind (Interactive response technology [IRT]) 
Population  Participants with moderate to severe ET  
Number of Participants Approximately 400 participants will be randomized, with 
approximately 100 participants randomized to each treatment arm 
and 80 evaluable participants in each treatment arm of the study. 
Duration of Participation The study starts from the time participants sign the informed consent 
form (ICF) through the end of the study procedures/contact. The 
study comprises 3 periods: up to 35  days  Screening Period (an 
additional 28 days are permitted for participants who require washout of primidone) including Baseline , followed by a 12-week Double-
blind Treatment Period, and a 2-week Safety Follow-up Period. Each 
participant will be enrolled for approximately 19 weeks.  
Number of Treatment Arms  4 
Treatment Groups  10, 20, or 30 mg/day JZP385 , or placebo 
Data Monitoring Committee Not applicable  
a The TETRAS composite outcome score is the sum of modified items 1 to 11 of the TETRAS -ADL subscale and 
modified items 6 and 7 of the TETRAS -PS. For TETRAS -ADL, each item is modified from 5 response items to 
4 response items by collapsing options 0 and 1 together and for TETRAS -PS, each item is modified from 9 response 
items (due to 0.5 scoring increments) to 4 response items.

2. INTRODUCTION
Essential tremor (ET)  is a serious, progressive, and chronically debilitating neurological disorder 
that can profoundly affect activities of daily living. Essential tremor is arguably the most 
common movement disorder among adults, but prevalence estimates vary. In a meta- analysis of 
28 population-based studies from 19 countries, the estimated pooled prevalence across all ages was 0.9%. Prevalence of ET increases markedly with age; across studies, the estimated pooled prevalence in adults ≥ 65 years of age was 4.6%, with preval ence estimates in individual studies 
ranging from 0.8 to 20.5% ( Louis and Ferreira, 2010). More recent meta- analyses have estimated 
the global prevalence of ET at 0.32% ( Song, 2021 ) and 1.33% ( Louis and McCreary , 2021 ). 
These meta-analyses similarly demons trated an increased prevalence of ET with age; Song and 
colleagues estimate the prevalence of ET in adults aged ≥ 80 years at 2.87% and Louis and McCreary estimate the prevalence of ET in adults ≥ 65 years of age at 5.79%. 
Essential tremor is characterized  by an action tremor in the hands and arms that is bilateral and 
often slightly asymmetric. The tremor presents during voluntary movement (kinetic tremor) or 
while maintaining a fixed position against gravity (postural and orthostatic tremor). In patients with ET, tremor may also be present in the head, voice, and jaw, and less commonly the face or 
trunk ( Louis, 2018). In the majority of individuals, tremor progresses slowly, starting on one side 
of the body and eventually affecting both sides, and further spreading to other regions of the 
body ( National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS] 2019; NINDS 2020 ). In 
addition to motor features, there is increasing recognition that patients with ET exhibit significant non-motor symptoms including cognitive deficits, anxiety, social phobia, depression, and sleep disturbances ( Louis, 2016; Musacchio , 2016; Sengul, 2015).  
Study CX -8998- CLN2 -001 was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-
controlled, dose- titration study that assesse d the efficacy and safety of immediate release (IR) 
JZP385 (also known as CX-8998, suvecaltamide, and MK-8998) in doses up to 20 mg/day 
(10 mg twice daily [BID]) for reducing the severity of tremor in participants with ET. This study 
demonstrated proof-of-concept, informed the design of the current phase 2b study, and provided 
preliminary evidence to support improvement in symptoms of ET with JZP385 treatment. Detailed results are available in the JZP385 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
2.1. Study Rationale  
Based on the proof-of-concept findings in the T-CALM study, in which adult participants with ET were treated with JZP385, as well as the high unmet need for therapies that better treat the significant impact of tremor on patients’ day -to-day functioning, Jazz Pharmaceuticals is 
conducting the present study with JZP385 to evaluate efficacy, safety, and PK information in this population. The dose-response at 3 doses of JZP385  will also be evaluated.

2.2. Background  
Essential tremor has no cure, but symptomatic  treatment of ET with drug therapies is considered 
when 
tremor interferes with a patient’s day-to-day functioning. No marketed pharmacological 
therapy has been developed specifically for t he treatment of ET. All currently  available 
pharmacotherapies have limitations with respect to efficacy, safety, or limited evidence from 
randomized, controlled trials to support their widespread use ( Haubenberger a nd Hallett , 2018). 
Propranolol (a β -blocker) is approved to treat patients with ET in the United States (US) and in 
the European Union (EU). Another option is primidone, an anticonvulsant used to treat ET 
(approved only in the United Kingdom and Hungary). However, up to half of patients with ET 
do not respond to either propranolol or primidone, and over 
50% of patients reportedly 
discontinue one or both medications 
due to lack of efficacy and/or side effects 
(Diaz an d Louis, 2010; Ferreira, 2019).  
Other prescription medications are used off-label to treat ET, including topiramate, gabapentin, 
alprazolam, clonazepam, and other β -blockers. Many of these second- and third-l ine tr
eatment 
options have limited data from randomized controlled  trials in ET to support efficacy and the 
data do not suggest an efficacy profile that is any better than propranolol (Ferreira 2019; Hedera, 
2013 ). Additionally, these medications are associated with dependency, abuse, withdrawal 
symptoms due to abrupt cessation, and oth er troublesome side effects (Hedera 2013). 
Neurosurgical procedures, such as deep brain stimulation targeting the central intermediate 
nucleus of the thalamus or magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound 
thalamotomy, offer treatment options for patients whose ET is severely disabling and who are 
refractory to drug therapy ( Zesiewicz, 2010 ). Thus, the challenges with current treatments for 
ET, coupled with the significant impact on patient quality of life, support the need for additional 
therapeu tic options for this patient population. 
Although the pathogenesis of 
ET has not been fully established, several studies have identified 
abnormal oscillations of neuronal activity in the cortico-bulbo-ce rebello-th alamic pathways 
(Haubenberger and Hallett, 
2018) . T-ty pe calcium channels (Ca V3) are mediators of subthreshold 
oscillations and excessive rhythmicity in pathophysiologic states found in tremor (Llinás, 2003 ; 
Handforth, 2005 ; 
Llinás, 2007; Park, 2013). Numerous lines of pharmacological and genetic 
evidence s
uggest that the increased activation of Ca V3 channels and excessive rhythmicity play a 
key role in neurological disorders such as ET (
Park, 2010; Shipe, 2008; Handforth, 2010). For 
example, several pharmacological studies have 
demonstrated that drugs with antagonist activity 
at Ca V3 reduce tremor in animal models (Shipe, 2008; Miwa, 2008; Handforth, 2010; Quesada, 
2011 ). In clinical studies, zonisamide and topiramate, which are both thought to act, in part, 
through suppression of CaV3 activity, have shown some efficacy in patients with ET. However, 
their usefulness has been limited by poor tolerability and/or excessive premature 
discontinuations of treatment, potentially due to pharmacological activity on other types of ion 
channels (Morita, 2005; Ondo, 2007; Bermejo, 2008; Chang, 2015 ). Selective targeting o f CaV3 
channels may offer a more efficacious and better -tolerated tr eatment option for patients with 
chronic neurological conditions. The high selectivity of JZP385 as  a Ca V3 modulator, along with 
its lack of effects on other types of channels, make it a promising candidate for the treatment of 
ET.  
JZP385 is  formulated as an extended-r elease  (ER) oral dosage form, containing 
immediate-r elease (I R) and del ayed  release (D R) pellets in a hard opaque capsule. The original

Amendment 04 
formul
ation of JZP385 was an IR formulation that required BID administration. To enable 
once- daily administration, a 2 -component multi- particulate (pellet) dosage form was developed 
that contains an IR pellet to deliver the required initial plasma concentration for rapid onset of 
effect and a DR pellet to maintain plasma concentrations above the target therapeutic threshold. 
The current study will use the ER JZP385 product that has the identifier of “DR2” (see Table 4 ). 
Preliminary evidence that JZP385 may provide a meaningful treatment option for ET was 
generated by Study CX-8998- CLN2 -001 (T-CALM), a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 
multicenter, placebo -controlled dose- titration study that assesse d the efficacy and safety of the 
IR formulation of JZP385 in doses up to 20 mg/day (10 mg BID) for reducing the severity of tremor in participants with ET. Despite not meeting statistical significance on the primary 
endpoint (Tremor Research Group Essentia l Tremor Assessment Rating Scale [TETRAS] 
performance subscale [TETRAS -PS] as rated by independent video raters), numerical 
improvements, favoring JZP385, were observed on TETRAS-PS as rated by the investigators and the TETRAS activities of daily living (T ETRAS -ADL) subscale. In addition, a numerically 
higher percentage of patients treated with JZP385 reported improvement in their overall 
condition as measured using the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI- C). JZP385, at 
doses up to 20 mg/day (10 mg BID) was well tolerated with the most commonly reported AEs in 
the System Organ Class (SOC) of Nervous System Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity.  
Four phase 1 studies in healthy male and female participants have been completed with the IR formulation of JZP385 (PN001, PN002, PN003, and PN005). Two phase 1 studies 
(CX-8998- CLN2 -005 and JZP385-101) evaluated the PK of JZP385 and its 2 active metabolites 
(M01 and M02) following single and multiple doses of various E R formulations administered 
once daily. Preliminary PK data from Study CX-8998- CLN2 -005 suggest that both ER 
formulations tested achieved reduced JZP385 maximum plasma concentration (C
max) relative to 
the IR formulation, with limited impact on overall JZP385 plasma exposure as measured by area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Furthermore, a high- fat meal substantially 
delayed DR2 JZP385 time to maximum concentration (T max) with minimal impact on C max or 
overall AUC, indicating an impact of food on early (IR component of formulation) but not late (DR component of formulation) absorption. Study JZP385-101 characterized the PK of JZP385, 
M01, and M02, dose proportionality, and safety and tolerability following multiple doses of E R 
formul ations (8, 16, 24, and 36 mg administered once daily). The study also explored the effect 
of food on both formulations. Preliminary data from this study suggest that both ER formulations had similar PK profiles and PK parameters following multiple daily do ses of 8, 16, 24, and 36 
mg. Both formulations result in approximately dose-proportional PK of JZP385 and its major 
metabolites (M01 and M02) in the dose range of 8 to 24 mg as assessed at steady state. This 
trend holds true through the 36 mg dose level considering that ~90% of JZP385 steady state is 
achieved following 4 days of 36 mg dosing. Doses up to 36 mg/day were well- tolerated and a 
similar safety profile was observed with the ER formulations compared to the IR formulation, 
with most commonly reported AEs in the SOCs of Nervous System Disorders and Psychiatric 
Disorders. Adverse events were primarily mild to moderate in severity, were reported during the first week of treatment (at the 8  mg/day dose) and were transient. The exploratory evaluation of 
the effect of a high -fat high- calorie meal on JZP385 ER formulations confirmed earlier findings 
of negligible impact of food on JZP385 C
max or AUC with a noteworthy delay in T max.

2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
A summary of the benefit-risk assessment for participation in Study JZP385-201 is provided in 
the subsections below.  
2.3.1. Risk Assessment  
Participants with ET who enroll in this study may encounter the following potential risks: 
• For participants randomized to study intervention with JZP385, the risks are expected 
to be similar to those seen in previously conducted clinical studies. In general, AE profiles have been  consistent across populations studied ( eg, ET, schizophrenia, 
healthy volunteers). Analysis of TEAEs showed that JZP385 in the dose ranges from 1 mg to 24 mg (IR) and from 8 mg QD to 36 mg QD (ER formulations ) was generally 
well tolerated by most participants. Generally, the most commonly reported AEs were 
in the SOC of Nervous System Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders ; the most 
common AEs ( ≥ 5%) in participants with ET have included dizziness, headache, 
euphoric mood, and insomnia. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity, were transient, and did not lead to study discontinuation. No clinically important trends in 
vital signs, safety laboratories, or ECG parameters have been observed in the completed clinical stud ies. The potential risks to participants will be managed and 
mitigated by the use of exclusion criteria which preclude subjects with an unstable or clinically significant medical condition, or who are at significant risk for cardiovascular complications, suicide or drug abuse from participating in the study. In 
addition, a titration schedule will be implemented such that subjects will start at a 
lower dose and titrate up to the final dose. Extensive monitoring of AEs, ECGs, orthostatic hypotension, and suicidal ideation and behavior will occur at frequent clinic visits throughout the study.  
• For participants who are randomized to the placebo treatment arm  and who 
discontinued antitremor  medication(s) during the screening period, there may be risks 
associated with untreated symptoms of ET.  
• Participants will be asked to discontinue protocol-prohibited medication (s) to enter 
the study. There may be risks associated with abrupt discontinuation of these 
medications , most notably, with prim idone. To mitigate this risk, an extended 
screening period is implemented  for participants who require washout of primidone to 
permit safe down -titration. Additionally, participants will not undergo discontinuation 
from prohibited antitremor  medications an d will be ineligible for the study if it is 
deemed unsafe by the investigator and medical monitor , as applicable.  
• Study procedure-related risks, including risks and/or discomfort associated with blood 
collection, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and completion of questionnaires and other assessments.

   2.3.2. Ben
efit Assessment  
Participants with ET who enroll in this study may experience the following benefits: 
• Receiving JZP385 for the study duration may alleviate the significant symptom 
burden associated with ET. 
• Irrespective of which study intervention a participant receives in the study, all participants will contribute to the process of developing new therapies in ET. 
• Participants will receive comprehensive clinical exams and clin ical monitoring 
associated with the study. 
2.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Summary  
Benefits to participants include the potential to receive a therapy  that may alleviate symptoms of 
ET and to contribute to the development of new therapeutics in ET, as well as receiving comprehensive physical examination and clinical monitoring. 
Risks to participants include those related to JZP385 treatment , the potential need to discontinue 
protocol-prohibited medication, the potential that participants who discontinued or plan to 
discontinue antitremor  medications to enter the study will be treated with placebo for the study 
duration, and risks related to the study procedures.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall Design
This is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, para llel-group, multicenter 
study of the safety and efficacy of JZP385 in the treatment of adult participants with moderate to 
severe ET.  
The total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 19 weeks. During the 
Screening Period, which will occur over a period of up to 35 days (an additional 28 days are 
permitted for participants who require washout of primidone), all participants will be evaluated for eligibility and will washout any prohibited medications. Participants may be allowed to rescreen once if the rescreening is approved by the medical monitor .  
Participants eligible for the study will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once daily doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg JZP385 or placebo during a 12- week  Double-blind Treatment Period. 
Randomization will be stratified by the TETRAS composite outcome score (≤ 17 or > 17) and 
the use of concomitant antitremor  medication (Yes or No ), as assessed at the Baseline Visit. 
JZP385 will be administered orally (PO) o nce daily in the morning on an empty stomach for 
12 weeks. Dosing will be titrated as follows:  
•Participants randomized to the 10 mg/day dose will initially receive 5 mg/day fromDay 1 through Day 7, and 10 mg/day starting on Day 8.
•Participants randomized  to the 20 mg/day dose will initially receive 5 mg/day from
Day 1 through Day 7, 10 mg/day from Day 8 through Day 14, and 20 mg/day starting
on Day 15.
•Participants randomized to the 30 mg/day dose will initially receive 5 mg/day from
Day 1 through Day 7, 10 mg/day from Day 8 through Day 14, 20 mg/day from
Day 15 through Day 21, and 30 mg/day starting on Day 22.
Once participants reach their assigned fixed dose, they will continue on that dose for the remainder of the planned 12-week treatment period. No dose adjustments will be allowed. 
Participants who cannot tolerate their assigned fixed dose of JZP385 will be withdrawn from the study. 
Assessments of efficacy, safety, and PK will be conducted as indicated in Section  8.2, 
Section  8.3, and Section  8.5, respectively, and as described in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) 
(Section  1.3) 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study was designed to be consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Guidance for Industry on Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and 
Biological Products, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E1A and E8 Guidance, and with the ethical principles in these guidances that originate in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The target patient population is participants with moderate to severe ET, which was selected to reflect the patient population within clinical practice for whom a therapeutic intervention for ET

Amendment 04 
 
    would be
 considered. Patients with mild ET are typically not treated with medication, as the 
tremor is not usually associa ted with significant functional disability 
(Gironell and  Kulisevsky, 2009; Louis, 2010; Rajput and Rajput, 2014). Essential tremor severity 
level in this study will be defined by eligibility criteria on patient- rated (TETRAS -ADL) and  
clinician -rated (CGI -S) measures of disability. The inclusion of a placebo control group in this 
study is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of JZP385. 
The 12-week duration (which includes up to 3 weeks of titration and a minimum of 9 weeks at 
the assigned fixed dose) is considered as adequate duration to detect efficacy and evaluate safety in this phase 2b study. Based on results from the T-CALM study, efficacy signals were observed 
at both time po ints tested: the end of Week 2 (at 16 mg/day [8 mg BID]) and the end of Week 4 
(at 20 mg/day [10 mg BID]). Adverse events were primarily reported during the first week of 
treatment and the majority of the commonly reported AEs resolved within a week of ons et. A 
longer treatment duration of 12 weeks with clinic visits to assess safety at multiple time points (Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12), combined with weekly phone calls for AE reporting, will allow for an adequate assessment of safety and durability of the treatment effect.  
The primary endpoint for the study is a composite of the sum of modified items 1  to 11 of the 
TETRAS -ADL subscale and modified items 6 and 7 of the TETRAS- PS (ie,  TETRAS composite 
outcome score). The TETRAS -ADL subscale is a patient -rated scal e of the impact of tremor on 
day-to-day functioning that is administered by a trained interviewer. The TETRAS- ADL 
subscale directly measures how a patient functions by assessing activities impacted by tremor, such as eating and drinking, dressing and personal hygiene, carrying items, and finer motor skills 
(Elble , 2012). The TETRAS -ADL demonstrated sensitivity to change with JZP385 in the 
T-CALM study (see the JZP385 IB for full results).  The TETRAS -PS is a valid and reliable 
clinical rating scale that has demonstrated sensitivity to change with treatment and  is 
recommended by the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force to assess tremor severity 
(Elble , 2013). Items 6 (drawing an Archimedes spiral) and 7 (handwriting) of the TETRAS- PS 
evaluate the impact of upper limb tremor on performance, and thus represent an objective 
measure of the impact of upper limb tremor on functional tasks. Together, the items from the 
TETRAS -ADL subscale and TETRAS -PS that comprise the primary endpoint represent both 
patient -rated and objective measures of the functional impact of tremor.  
The key secondary endpoint is  the CGI -S. The clinician -rated CGI -S will specifically evaluate 
patients’ ability to function  due to ET and  will adequately complement the primary endpoint . In 
the T -CALM study, a numerically higher percentage of patients reported improvement on the 
CGI-C when treated with JZP385 at 16 and 20 mg/day (administered as 8 and 10 mg BID, 
respectively) compared to placebo . Given that the CGI -C score generally correlates with the 
CGI-S such that improvement in one follows the other ( Busner and Targum, 2007), these data 
provide preliminary support that CGI- S will be sensitive to improvement with JZP385.   
4.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of JZP385 being evaluated in the study are 10, 20, and 30 mg/day administered in the morning. In the T-CALM study conducted in patients with ET, daily doses of 16 and 20 mg/day 
JZP385 (administered as the IR formulation at doses of 8 and 10 mg BID, respectively), 
improved symptoms of tremor across several clinically meaningful endpoints, including the TETRAS -ADL  subscale, and were safe and well tolerated. Preliminary PK data and subsequent

Amendment 04 
 
    PK s
imulations from the relative bioavailability study (Study CX -8998- CLN2 -005) indicate that 
the same daily doses of the IR and ER formulations produce similar exposures (ie, steady state 
daily AUC). Therefore, this study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of 20 mg/day 
JZP385, in addition to a higher dose of 30 mg/day and a lower dose of 10 mg/day administered 
orally, once daily in the morning. Preliminary safety and tolerability data from study JZP385-101, which enrolled 100 healthy older volunteers with a mean age of 44.1 years (median 
= 42.9 years; range 23 to 76 years) indicate that titrated doses of up to 36 mg were generally safe 
and well tolerated.  
The titration schedule in this protocol is based on the PK of JZP385, as well as the titration 
experience in previous clinical studies conducted to date. Steady state levels of JZP385 are 
reached  in 5 days. In the T-CALM study in patients with ET, participants received the IR 
formulation of JZP385 for 1 week each at doses of 8  and 16 mg/day before the final dose of 
20 mg/day (doses were administered as 4, 8 and 10 mg BID, respectively). Preliminar y safety 
and tolerability data from study JZP385-101 also indicate that the starting dose of 8 mg/day of the ER formulation of JZP385, with dose escalation at weekly intervals, was generally safe and 
well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Although these dat a indicate the 8 mg/day dose is tolerated 
as a starting dose, all participants in this study will initially receive 5 mg/day for the first week of 
the treatment period to evaluate whether starting at a lower dose may further improve tolerability.  
4.4. End of St udy Definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all periods of the study including the last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA.

    5. STUDY POPULATION  
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as 
protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. 
5.1. Inclusion Criteria  
Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: 
Age 
1. Participant must be 18 to 80 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. 
Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics  
2. Participants who are diagnosed with ET (including ET plus) according to the MDS Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors from the Task Force on Tremor of the International Parkinson’s and Movement Disorder Society ( Bhatia , 2018) and 
centrally reviewed by an Eligibility Adjudication Committee (EAC; see 
Section  10.1.5).  
3. Participants have moderate to severe disability associated with tremor at both the Screening and Baseline visit s, as determined by all of the following: 
a. Score of ≥ 22 on the TETRAS -ADL  subscale; and

c. CGI-S rating of at least moderate for participants’ ability to function.  
Note:  Participants who need washout of a medication (s) that could impact their tremor 
assessment (eg, medications that produce tremor  or that treat tremor but are prohibited 
because of potential PK drug-drug interactions with study intervention [ such as  
prim idone] ) at Screening Visit 1 must return to the clinic for a second Screening Visit 
(Screening Visit 2). For these participants, the Screening TETRAS- ADL  subscale and 
CGI-S assessments that will be used to determine eligibility will be performed at 
Screening Visit 2 , after par ticipants have washed out their medication. 
Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements  
4. Participant is male or female.  
a. Male participants:  
Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the 
study intervention period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study intervention:

OR
•Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective, with a
failure rate of < 1%, as described in Appendix 5 during the study interventionperiod and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study intervention. Note:  In
addition to hormonal contraception, male partners of WOCBP are required to use
barrier protection,  eg, condoms, from the first dose of study intervention until
30 days after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator should evaluatethe potential for contraceptive method failure (eg, noncompliance, recentlyinitiated) in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.

Amendment 04 
 
    6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are 
provided to the sites . 
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study interventions received, and any discrepancies are reported 
and resolved before use of the study intervention. 
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized site 
staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention must be stored in a 
secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Ra ndomization and Blinding  
All participants who sign the informed consent form (ICF) will receive a participant number assigned by interactive response technology ( IRT) at screening . The participant number 
identifies the participant for all study procedures that occur throughout the study. This number is unique and once assigned, cannot be reassigned to another study participant.  
Treatment allocation/randomization for this study will occur centrally through the use of an IRT. 
Participants eligible for the study will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once daily 
doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg JZP385 or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by the TETRAS 
composite outcome score (≤ 17 or > 17) and the use of concomitant a ntitremor  medication (Yes 
or No ), as assessed at the Baseline Visit.  
A double-blind approach will be used throughout the 12-week treatment period. During the study (including the titration period), the number of capsules taken each day will be the same for patients randomized to each trea tment. JZP385 and placebo capsules will look and feel identical. 
The IRT will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’ s 
intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the 
investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant.  
If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 
24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and IRT system, as applicable. The participant’s treatment 
assignment may be unblinded for regulatory reporting purposes. Notification of the treatment 
assignment is only made known to those who require it for safety reporting and submission processes. All other individuals involved in the study, including the investigator, will remain

Amendment 04 
 
    bl
inded to treatment assignment. Participants for whom the blind is broken for this reason will 
not be withdrawn from the study.  
Sponsor safety staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant with an SAE. If 
the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, 
a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s intervention assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or sponsor policy.  
6.4. Study Intervention/Treatment Compliance  
When participants administer study intervention in the clinic (ie, at Week 1, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 visits), they will take the last dose from the kit dispensed at the previous visit, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents.  
Particip ants will take the first dose of study intervention at home in the morning on the day 
following the Baseline Visit (or Day  1). When participants self -administer study intervention at 
home, compliance with study intervention will be assessed at each clinic visit. Compliance will 
be assessed by counting returned capsules during the site visits and documented in the source 
documents Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded. 
A record of the quantity of JZP385 or placebo capsules dispen sed to and administered by each 
participant must be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and compliance records. 
Intervention start and stop dates should also be recorded. 
6.5. Dose Modification  
No dose adjustments or modifications will be allowed. Participants who cannot tolerate their 
assigned fixed dose of JZP385 will be discontinued from the study intervention (see Section  7.1). 
Every eff ort should be made to have the participant attend an Early Discontinuation Visit (see 
Section  1.3).  
6.6. Continued Access to Study Intervention A fter the End of the Study  
There is no continued access to study intervention upon completion of the study. Participants 
should follow-up with their healthcare provider regarding the resumption of any medications that were discontinued prior to study participation.  
6.7. Treatment of Overdose  
Any dose greater than the assigned dose that a participant receives in a 24 -hour time period will 
be considered an overdose. In a case of an acute overdose, it is recommended that the stomach is emptied and that oral gavage with activated charcoal is used to reduce absorption of JZP385. See the JZP385 IB for further details.  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 
• Contact the medical monitor  immediately.  
• Evaluate the participant to determine, in consultatio n with the medical monitor , 
whether study intervention should be interrupted or discontinued.

Amendment 04 
 
    •
 Report any AE/SAE or laboratory abnormalities associated with the overdose. 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose. 
6.8. Conc omitant Therapy  
Any medication or vaccine (including over- the-counter or prescription medicines, recreational 
drugs, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of 
enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with: 
• Reason for use 
• Dates of administration including start and end dates 
• Dosage information including dose and frequency 
Concomitant treatment with some medications/therapies is not permitted during the study (see Exclusion C riteria 11 to 17 in Section  5.2). A full list of prohibited medications is provided in

JZP385 has a potential to inhibit P -glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP) in the intestine at the studied doses. T herefore, medicines that  are known sensitive 
substrates of P-gp and BCRP should be administered approximately 12 hours apart from study 
intervention. In vitro data indicate JZP385 is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. 
Therefore, medicines that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4  and CYP2B6 that are taken 
concomitantly with JZP385 should be monitored for potential decrease in pharmacological effect . 
The medical monitor  should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy.

    7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
Discontinuation from study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study 
(Section  7.2). Participants may discontinue from study intervention at any time for any reason, or 
at the discretion of the investigator. In addition, a participant may be dropped from study 
intervention by the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioral, compliance and/or administrative reasons.  
For participants who discontinue study intervention, all effort should be made to complete the 
procedures listed in the Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section 1.3). Participants should be asked to 
return 2  weeks later for the EoS/Safety Follow- up Visit. If the Early Discontinuation Visit occurs 
2 or more weeks after the last dose of study intervention, an additional safety follow- up visit is 
not required. 
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study intervention. If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will not remain in the study. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention for any of the following reasons: 
• The participant or participant’s legal representative requests to discontinue study 
intervention. 
• The participant has an AE that may compromise the participant’s continued participation.  
• The participant has a suicide risk reported or assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS; see Section  8.3.6 ). 
• The participant has a positive serum pregnancy test or becomes pregnant during the study (see Appendix 5 and Section  8.3.5).  
• The participant is noncompliant with study intervention or procedures. 
• Sponsor decides to terminate the study prior to completion.  
7.1.1. Positive Alcohol or Urine Drug Screens  
The i nvestigator may discontinue study intervention for any participant with a positive alcohol or 
urine drug screen. However, if the investigator believes discontinuation of study intervention is not necessary despite a positive alcohol or urine drug screen result, approval from the medical monitor is required in order to retain the participant in the study. 
7.1.2. Temporary Discontinuation/Study Intervention Interruption 
If a participant must temporarily interrupt study intervention for any reason, the sponsor’s 
medi cal monitor  should be consulted to determine whether the participant will continue in the 
study.

    7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, or compliance reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. 
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an Early Discontinuation Visit should be 
conducted, as shown in the SoA ( Section 1.3). See SoA for data to be collected at the time of 
study discontinuation and follow-up, and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
The participant will be permanently discontin ued both from the study intervention and from the 
study at that time.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a partici pant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be 
taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address, or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented 
in the participant’s medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Study and Site Start and Closure  Section 10.1.9.

    8.1. General Administrative Procedures  
8.1.1. Informed Consent  
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) must obtain 
documented consent from each potential participant/legal representative prior to participation in this study. No study procedures, including washout of prior medications , may  be undertaken 
before signing the ICF. A signed copy of the ICF should be given to the participant and the 
original should be placed in the participant’s medical records.  
8.1.2. Assignment of Participant Number  
Each participant who signs the ICF will be assigned a unique number that will identify the 
participant throughout the study. Once a number has been assigned, it cannot be reassigned to 
another study participant. 
8.1.3. Medical History  
A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or a medically qualified designee 
(consistent with local regulations). All active conditions should be recorded and any condition 
diagnosed within the participant’s lifetime that the investigator deems clinically significant. The information will include, but is not limited to, symptoms of ET (current and past, including 
symptoms experienced prior to any ET treatment); history and treatment (if any) of 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, immunologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; reproductive status; current contraceptive method (if appropriate); and confirmation of relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
8.1.4. Medication Review (Prior and Concomitant Medications)  
The investigator or medically qualified designee should review the participant’s prior medication 
use within 30 days (any medication (s) taken for ET should be reviewed within the prior 
6 weeks) . Medication that is required to be washed out prior to the study should also be recorded. 
All medications currently being taken by the participant should be recorded.  
Additional information related to any medications taken for the treatment of ET since d iagnosis 
(eg, treatment duration, satisfaction) should be collected.  
8.1.5. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Review  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria should be reviewed by the investigator to ensure the 
participant qualifies for the study. A research diagnost ic verification form will be completed  by 
the site within 2 days of completion of the TETRAS -PS assessment, which will be video-
recorded at Screening Visit 1 or Screening Visit 2, as applicable (see Section 1.3), and rated by a trained blinded rater on site. To support selection of the appropriate patient population in the 
study, the video recording of the TETRAS-PS conducted at Screening will undergo central 
review by an independent expert rater from the EAC to confirm a correct diagnosis of ET. Results of this review will be available in the electronic clinical outcome assessment provider’s 
portal. Screening results from all participants meeting the eligibility requirements will be further 
assessed for final approval of inclusion in the study. Details of the eligibility review by the EAC will be provided in the EAC Charter .

    8.1.6.
 Timing of Study Intervention Dosing  
Participants will be requested to take study intervention in the morning on an empty stomach 
upon awakening (and no more than 1 hour after awakening). After the Baseline Visit, on days when participants come into the clinic, study intervention will be administered on site on an 
empty stomach. When participants administer study intervention in the clinic (ie, at the Week 1, 
Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 visits), they will take the last dose from the kit dispensed at the previous visit, under medical supervision. 
8.1.7. Montreal Cognitive Assessment  
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is designed as a rapid screening instrument to 
detect mild cognitive dysfunction. The MoCA test was validated in 2000 and revalidated in 2004 (Nasreddine, 2005). The assessment comprises a 30 -question test that can be compl eted in 
approximately 10 minutes. The MoCA assesses different cognitive domains, including attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of < 20 is 
considered exclusionary in the current study. According to the DSM- V criteria, people with 
major neurocognitive disorders typically have scores on cognitive scales that fall at least 2 SD 
below the mean of a normative sample.  The eligibility cutoff of < 20 represents 2 SD below the 
mean for the highest age group (75 to 85 years) and lowest education level (elementary school or lower) in a rigorously selected normal cognitive population in Sweden (N = 758) (Borland, 2017). In the largest population- based US sample (N = 2,653) where cognitive 
impairment was not rigorously screened out, the eligibility cut- off of < 20 represents 1 SD below 
the mean ( Rossetti, 2011), lending additional support for this cut- off in a  different sample. 
A sample MoCA can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder . 
8.2. Efficacy Assessments 
Planned time points for all efficacy assessments are provided in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
8.2.1. Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale – Activities 
of Daily Living 
The Tremor Research Group first published TETRAS in 2008 ( Elble , 2008). TETRAS consists 
of a 12- item activities of daily living (ADL) subscale, and a 9 -item performance subscale (PS). 
TETRAS was developed as a rapid clinical assessment of ET that requires no equipment other 
than pen and paper.  
The ADL sub scale includes many of the items assessed in previously developed scales for the 
evaluation of tremor ( Fahn, 1993; Louis, 2000; Bain , 1993), including eating and drinking, 
dressing and personal hygiene, carrying items and finer motor skills. Each item in t he 
TETRAS -ADL subscale is rated on a 0 to 4 scale, with 0 representing normal activity and 4 
representing severe abnormality. The sum of the individual scores provides the overall score, 
ranging from 0 to 48. The TETRAS -ADL subscale has face validity, has preliminarily 
demonstrated test -retest reliability, and is highly correlated with the TETRAS -PS (Elble , 2012; 
Elble , 2016). It has also demonstrated sensitivity to change with JZP385 treatment in the

    T
-CALM study. Items 1  to 11 of the TETRAS- ADL subscale assess the impact of tremor on 
day-to-day functioning, while item 12 assesses the social impact of tremor. 
A sample TETRAS -ADL subscale can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder . 
During the study, the TETRAS- ADL will be administered and scored by a trained rater at the 
site. 
8.2.2. Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale – 
Performance Subscale 
The TETRAS -PS quantifies tremor in the head, face, voice, limbs, and trunk. Each item on the 
TETRAS -PS is rated  on a 0 to 4 rating scale, with scoring of upper limb tremor allowing for 
0.5-point increments. Specific amplitude ranges (measured in centimeters) define the tremor 
rating. Raters first estimate the maximum amplitude of tremor and then assign the correspo nding 
rating. The sum of the individual rating scores provides the overall performance score, ranging 
from 0  to 64. Administration of the TETRAS-PS takes approximately 10 minutes. The 
TETRAS -PS has demonstrated both test- retest reliability and sensitivity to change ( Elble , 2012; 
Study CX-8998- CLN2 -001 [T- CALM] – see IB for details) and was given a “recommended” 
rating as a tremor severity scale by the MDS ( Elble , 2013).  
TETRAS -PS items 6 and 7 are the Archimedes spiral and handwriting assessments, respectiv ely. 
Both are rated on a 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) rating scale. The Archimedes spiral is tested in both the right and the left hands, while the handwriting is assessed with the dominant hand only. The sum of the TETRAS -PS items 6 and 7 provides a score ran ging from 0 to 12. The Archimedes 
spiral and handwriting tasks have been integral in the routine examination of patients with tremor for decades, heavily utilized in tremor rating scales beyond the TETRAS ( Bain , 1993; Fahn , 
1993; Louis, 2001), and have demonstrated sensitivity to change with treatment ( Calzetti , 1982; 
Haubenberger, 2011; Hopfner, 2015; Koller , 1986 ; Shill, 2004; Tolosa and Loewenson, 1975).  
A sample TETRAS -PS can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder .  
During the study, t he TETRAS -PS assessment will be administered and scored by a blinded 
trained rater at the site throughout the study and conducted as detailed in Table 5.

Note:  Potential participants screened an additional time (rescreened) who had previously met the inclusion c riteri on 
relative to ET diagnosis confirmed by the central EAC  (Inclusion Criterion #2) will not have to complete the 
TETRAS -PS assessment and subsequent central review by the EAC at Screening Visit 1 or 2, as applicable. 
8.2.3. Clinical Global Impression of Severity  
The CGI -S will be assessed by qualified medical personnel (ie, a clinician)  to assess the se verity 
of participants’ ET. The severity assessment will rate the participants’ ability to function due to 
their ET.  
The CGI -S is a 5 -point Likert- type rating scale and a widely used assessment in clinical 
psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness. The responses to this clinician -completed 
scale range from 1 (no limitations) to 5 (severe). The clinician  will rate his/her impression of the 
severity of the participant’s current ability to function due to their ET relative to his/her experience w ith this patient population. 
A sample CGI -S can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder .

questionnaire comprising 5 subscales (physical, psychosocial, communication, hobbies/leisure, 
and work/finance) and a total score, plus 3 additional items relating to sexual function and 
satisfaction  with tr emor  control and  medication  side effects. Initial reports pr ovide  preliminary  
support of it
s reliability and validity. The internal consistency was very good to excellent for 4 o f 
the subscales and the total score, and moderately high for the Work/Finance subscale 
(Tröster, 2005). The QUEST has also demonstrated sensitivity to change with deep brain 
stimula
tion for ET (Sandvik, 2012). 
A sample QUEST questionnaire can be found in the Investigator  Trial Site Binder . 
8.2.5. Clinic
al Global Impression of Change  
The CGI -C will be assessed by qualified medical personnel (ie, a clinician) to assess the change 
in the participants’ ability to function due to ET.  
The CGI -C is a 5 -point Likert- type rating scale and a widely used assessment to assess efficacy 
in clinical drug trials. Clinicians will rate their impression of any change in the severity of the 
participant’s condition since Baseline on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (much improved) to 5 
(much worse). Clinicians’  rating will focus on the participants’ change in their ability to function 
due to ET. 
A sample CGI -C can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder . 
8.2.6. Patient Global Impression of Change 
The PGI -C is a 5 -point Likert-type rating scale and a widely used assessment to assess efficacy 
in clinical drug trials. Participants will rate the change in their condition since Baseline on a 
5-point scale ranging from 1 (much improved) to 5 (much worse). Participants’ rating will focuson the change in their ability to function due to ET.
A sample PGI -C can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder . 
8.2.7. 36-item Short Form Health Survey Version 2
The 36-item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) is a multi-purpose, short form 
health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being 
scores as well as psychometrically -based physical and mental health summary measures and a 
preference -based health utility index ( Hays  and Stewart , 1992; Ware and Sherbourne, 1992 ). 
A sample SF -36v2 can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder .  
8.2.8. Essential Tremor Embarrassment Assessment  
The Essential Tremor Embarrassment Assessment (ETEA) is a patient-rated questionnaire administered by a health care provider or researcher that contains 14 -items assessing 
embarrassment related to tremor. Participants provide a simple response (disagree or agree) to each of the 14 -items, the sum of which yields an initial score (Score A, range = 0 to 14). 
Participants then provide a more nuanced response to each question on a 0- to-5-point Likert 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 58 of 109CRIO Envelope ID: 11260149 - Page: 58/113

Amendment 04 
   scal
e ranging from disagree (0) to agree strongly (5). The sum of the nuanced responses yields a 
second score (Score B, range = 0 to 70). Higher scores on both the simple and nuanced responses 
indicate greater embarras sment. The ETEA was developed based on input from both tremor 
experts and patients and  was subsequently validated in 75 patients with ET where it 
demonstrated high internal consistency ( Traub , 2010). The ETEA has also demonstrated 
sensitivity to change wit h treatment in patients with ET ( Kreisler , 2019 ). 
A sample ETEA questionnaire can be found in the Investigator Trial Site Binder . 
8.3. Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 
8.3.1. Physical Examinations 
A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems; a genitourinary exam is excluded. Height 
and weight (in ordinary indoor clothes without shoes) will also be measured and recorded as indicated in the SoA in Section 1.3.  
Any abnormalities identified at the screening physical exam should be recorded as medical 
history.  
8.3.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (to be taken before blood collection, when applicable), including body t emperature, 
respiratory rate, and orthostatic blood pressure, and pulse rate will be assessed at each clinic 
visit, as indicated in the SoA (Section 
1.3). 
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assesse d wi th a completely automated de vice. 
Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. 
Orthostatic blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate will be obtained after the 
participant has been in a supine position for at least 5 minut es, and again a fter the  partic ipant has 
been standing for 2 m inutes. B aseline  and Screening or thostatic  assessments w ill be  taken in 
triplicate ( at 15  to 30- minute intervals), a nd a single or thosta tic assessment will be pe rformed at 
all other vi sits. 
Respiratory r ate and  body temperature will be  as sessed after t he participant ha s been resting  and 
seated ( or supine) f or at l eas t 5 m inutes. 
8.3.3. Elect
rocardiograms  
Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) using an ECG 
machine that aut omatically cal culates t he heart r ate and  measures P R, Q RS, Q T, and cor rect ed 
QT (Q Tc) intervals. 
Electrocardiograms w ill be reviewed, initially interpreted, signe d, a nd dated by the investigator 
or a designated physician after each ECG collection. All ECGs (with the exception of ECGs for 
participants w ho are screen f ailures) w ill be  transmitted to a de signa ted c entral ECG la boratory. 
A cardiologist at the central ECG laborator y will conduct a ful l over-rea d. A re port based on data

nical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
See Appendix 3 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA ( Section  1.3) 
for the timing and frequency. 
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The laboratory reports must 
be filed with the source documents.  
Abnormal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease are not considered 
clinically significant unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
participan t’s condition. 
All laboratory tests with abnormal values considered clinically significant during participation in 
the study and considered related to study intervention should be repeated until the values return 
to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor.  
•If clinically significant values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time  
judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be 
identified, and the 
sponsor notifie d.
•All protocol-required laboratory tests, as defined in  Appendix 3, must be conducted in  
accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Section
 1.3).
8.3.5. Pregn
ancy Testing  
Refer to Section 5.1 for pregnancy testing entry criteria. 
Pregnancy testing (urine or serum as required by local regulations) should be conducted as 
specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, 
as determined necessary by the investigator or required by local regulation, to establish the 
absence of pregnancy at any time during the 
study. 
8.3.6. Sui
cidal Ideation and Behavior R isk Monitoring  
JZP385 is considered to be a central nervous system-active study intervention. Participants being treated with JZP385 should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation 
and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior, especially at the beginning and end of 
the course of study intervention, or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior, should undergo a risk 
assessment. All factors contributing to suicidal ideation or behavior should be evaluated and 
consideration should be given to discontinuation of the study intervention.  
Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior/ intervention emergent suicidal ideation 
and behavior will be monitored using the C- SSRS. At the Screening Visit, the 
Baseline/Screening Version of the C -SSRS will be administered to pa rticipants to exclude any 
individuals with active suicidal ideation or behavior. 
The Since Last Visit Version of the C -SSRS will be administered to participants at every clinic 
visit after their Screening visit, including the Baseline and Follow-up visits. At the Baseline 
Visit, any participant who reports active suicidal ideation (eg, a positive response to Question 4

or 5 on the C
-SSRS) or behavior (eg, a positive response to any suicidal behavior question on the 
C-SSRS) will be excluded. At post- baseline visits, active suicidal ideation or behavior must be
recorded as an AE and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first knowledge of
the event by study personnel. Please refer to Appendix 4 for details on reporting other reportable
experiences (OREs).
8.4. Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Safety 
Reporting  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Appendix 4. 
Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, whe n appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant’s legally authorized representative). T he investigator and any 
qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet 
the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up all AEs. The method of 
recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4. 
8.4.1. Tim
e Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
All AEs a nd SAEs w ill be  collected from the start of study i ntervention unt il the follow-up visit 
at the  time poi nts spec ified in the  SoA (S ection  1.3). 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and within 
24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel, as indicated in Appendix 4. The 
investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available.  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorde d as medical history/current medical conditions, not as AEs. Al l SAEs 
tha
t occur after the consent form is signed but before study intervention/treatment must be 
reported by the investigator if they cause the participant to be excluded from the study,  or are the 
re
sult of a protocol-specified study intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment, or a procedure. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after conclusion of 
the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharge d from the st udy, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly 
notify the sponsor. 
8.4.2. Met
hod of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.  
8.4.3. Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event

herwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further 
information on follow-up procedures is provided in Appendix 4. 
8.4.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . 
The Reference Safety Information for the determination of expectedness of JZP385 can be found in the IB. 
8.4.5. Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, if indicated, female partners of male 
participants will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 30 days after last study intervention. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the female participant or female partner of male participant (after obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the female partner) pregnancy.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complications or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. Abnormal 
pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, 
ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as such. 
The participant/pregnant female pa rtner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent, t he investigator will collect 
follow-up information on the participant/pregnant female partner and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Neonates will be followed for 6 months following birth . 
Any post-study pregnancy-related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by the investigator will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section  8.4.5. While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants/ pregnant female partners, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

   9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
The null and alternative hypotheses for analysis of the primary estimand variable are:  
H0: u JZP385  = u  Placebo  
H1: u JZP385  ≠ u Placebo  
Specifically, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the mean change on the 
TETRAS composite outcome score from B aseline to Week 12 between each dose of JZP385 and 
the placebo control group. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean change on the TETRAS 
composite outcome score from B aseline to Week  12 is not equal between each dose of JZP385 
and the placebo control group.  
The null and alternative hypotheses for analysis of the key secondary estimand variable are: 
H0: p JZP385  = p  Placebo  
H1: p JZP385  ≠ p Placebo  
Specifically, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the proportion of participants 
who improved by ≥ 1 point on the CGI- S from Baseline to Week 1 2 between each dose of 
JZP385 and the placebo control gro up. The alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of 
participants who improved by ≥ 1 point on the CGI -S from Baseline to Week 1 2 is not equal 
between each dose of JZP385 and the placebo control group. 
Each JZP385 treatment group will be compared individually to placebo. The remaining secondary and exploratory endpoints will not be controlled within the formal hypothesis test for type Ⅰ error . All safety analyses will be descriptive; no formal statistical testing will be 
performed.  
9.2. Sample Size Determina tion 
A sample size of 80 evaluable participants per treatment group will provide 90% power to detect a difference of 3. 1 points for the change from B aseline to Week 12 on the TETRAS composite 
outcome score between JZP385 and placebo , with  a common SD of 6.0 points. This sample size 
will also provide 91.7% power to detect a 26% between -treatment (assuming JZP385 at 66% 
versus placebo at 40%) difference in proportion of participants who improved by at least 1 point 
on the CGI- S from Baseline to Week  12. Assuming a 20% dropout rate, a total of 
400 participants (100 participants per treatment group) will be randomized. The sample size 
calculation for the TETRAS composite outcome score is based on t- test and the CGI -S sample 
size calculation is based on chi-square test,  both tests are 2 -sided at the significance level of 0.05. 
For the TETRAS composite outcome score, at least 80% power is still achieved if there is a reduction of 0.4 points from the assumption in the difference in mean change from baseline 
(assuming a constant common standard deviation) or an increase in common standard deviation 
by 1 point, (assuming a constant difference in means) .

hier
archical testing sequence will be employed. The testing procedure will stop when a p- value 
exceeds 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 (see below). 
Statistical hypotheses to be tested (in sequential order): 
1. Change in the TETRAS composite outcome score from Baseline to Week 12, 30 mg/day
versus placebo.
2.Difference in  proportion of participants who improved ≥  1 point on the CGI -S from Baseline
to Week 12, 30 mg/day versus placebo.
3. Change in the TETRAS composite outcome score from Baseline to Week 12, 20 mg/day
versus placebo.
4. Difference in proportion of participants who improved ≥  1 point on the CGI -S from Baseline
to Week 12, 20 mg/day versus pla cebo.
5. Change in the TETRAS composite outcome score from Baseline to Week 12, 10 mg/day
versus placebo.
6. Difference in proportion of participants who improved ≥  1 point on the CGI -S from Baseline
to Week 12, 10 mg/day versus placebo.
9.4.1.2. Intercurrent Event Strategies 
Discontinuation of study intervention, as specified in Section 7.1, will be considered as 
intercurrent events.  
For the primary and key secondary estimands, the following 2 types of intercurrent events will be 
considered: 
•Discontinuation of treatment due to an AE, for lack of efficacy, or any other reason.
Participants wh o experience this type of intercurrent event will be treated as if they
did not experience an intercurrent event ( hypothetical strategy). The hypothetical
strategy used is defined as the pharmacologic effect of JZP385 compared to placeboassuming the intercurrent event did not happen with continuation of studyintervention for the duration of the study. Analyses will be conducted using datacollected at time points obtained at or prior to participants’ discontinuation of studyintervention and combined with imputed values for post-discontinuation time pointsfor which the underlying assumptions are considered appropriate.
•Any change to concomitant antitremor medication  use after the initiation of study
intervention, including but not limited to the following: 1) start ing a new antitremor
medication, 2) stopping a concomitant antitremor medication, and 3) a dose orregimen change to current anti tremor medication . This type of intercurrent event w ill
be disregarded , and measurements obtained subsequently will be reported and
analyzed ( treatment policy). Treatment policy is defined as the effect of randomized
treatment over the study period regardless of the occurrence of the intercurrent event.In accordance with treatment policy, data collected after this type of intercurrentevent will be reported and included in analys es.
If a participant experiences  a combination of both types of ICE (eg, change the use of anti- tremor 
medication and discontinue the study intervention afterwards), each ICE should be treated

indepe
ndently. Data collected after the change of antitremor med ication but on or before the 
study intervention discontinuation will be included in  analy ses per treatment policy , the 
postdiscontinuation data will be handled by hypothetical strategy.  
9.4.1.3. Pooling of Investigational Centers 
Data from all investigational centers will be pooled for presentation of the main results (eg, 
demographics, safety, PK, and efficacy). Data may be pooled by region or country as appropriate for exploratory analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
9.4.1.4. Dropouts and Missing Data  
The TETRAS composite outcome score will be derived as the sum of items 1 to 11 of the ADL 
section of TETRAS  plus the sum of items 6 (left and right) and 7 of the PS section of the 
TETRAS (for a total of 1 4 items on the composite primary out come) . If ≤ 3 items of the 
TETRAS composite outcome score are missing at a specific time point, the mean of the 
remaining non- missing TETRAS composite outcome score item scores at that point will be used 
to impute the missing TETRAS composite outcome score item value. The TETRAS composite 
outcome score will then be calculated as the sum of the observed and imputed item scores. If ≥ 4 
items of the composite primary outcome are missing, the TETRAS composite outcome score will 
not be calculated.  
For the analysis of the TETRAS composite outcome score, the primary analysis will rely on 
MMRM, assuming  participants who early discontinue the study intervention (defined as an 
intercurrent event ) or missed the assessments due to  other reasons would have efficacy outcomes 
like other participants in their treatment group, randomization strat um, and initial trajectory who 
completed the study. Sensitivity analyses will adopt control- based drop-out imputation  methods 
to assess the imp act on the treatment effect of JZP385 when underlying miss ing at random 
(MAR ) assumption on the primary MMRM analysis shifted accordingly. A tipping point analysis 
will further assess the robustness of the primary analysis method.  
For the analysis of CGI-S, the primary analysis will adopt a 2 -step multiple imputation method 
and assume data to be missing  at random. A tipping point analysis will be conducted as 
sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the primary analysis method.  The details will be further described in the SAP. 
9.4.2. Primary Estimand 
The primary estimand is a composite outcome score of the sum of modified items 1  to 11 of the 
TETRAS -ADL and modified items 6 and 7 of the TETRAS- PS. For the primary estimand, the 
scoring of each of the items 1 to  11 of the TETRAS -ADL subscale as well as items 6 and 7 of 
the TETRAS -PS will be modified. For TETRAS- ADL, each item will be modified from 5 
response items to 4 response items by collapsing options 0 and 1 together and for TETRAS- PS, 
each item will be modified from 9 response items (due to 0.5 scoring increments) to 4 response 
items . Each item has a maximum score of 3. As item 6 of th e TETRAS -PS includes assessments 
for both hands, there are a total of 3 items from the TETRAS-PS and 11 items from the 
TETRAS -ADL that contribute to a 14- item TETRAS composite outcome score. The total range 
of the TETRAS composite outcome score that will be used for the primary analysis will therefore be 0 to 42.

Amendment 04 
The
 attributes of the primary estimand are listed below: 
•Treatment: 10, 20, and 30 mg/day JZP385 and placebo.
•Population: Adults with moderate to severe ET.
•Variable: Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the TETRAS composite outcome
score.
•Intercurrent Events:
−Discontinuation of study intervention due to an AE , for lack of efficacy, or any
other reason. Participants who experience this type of intercurrent eve nt will be
addressed by hypothetical strategy.
−Any change to concomitant antitremor  medication use after the initiation of study
intervention ( refer to Section 9.4.1.2).  Participants who experience this type of
intercurrent event will be addressed by treatment policy.
•Summary: Difference in the mean TETRAS composite outcome score from B aseline
to Week  12 between each dose of JZP385 and placebo.
For the main estimator analysis, a MMRM will be used to include the difference in the TETRAS 
composite outcome score  from the B aseline Visit to Weeks 4, 8, and 12. The model will include 
fixed effect s for treatment group, week, treatment group by week inte raction, baseline TETRAS 
composite outcome score  stratification ( ≤ 17 or > 17), baseline concomitant antitremor  
medication stratification (Yes or No ), baseline TETRAS composite outcome score by week 
interaction , baseline  TETRAS composite outcome score as a continuous covariate, and week 
repeated within each  participant as a repeated effect. An unstructured variance- covariance matrix 
will be used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. 
For sensitivity  analyses, a control- based Pattern  Mixture Model (PMM) will be used to explore 
the possibility of data being missing not at random (MNAR). A supplementa ry analysis will be 
conducted with only those participants who have Week 12 TETRAS composite outcome scores. 
Additional details on sensitivity and supplementa ry analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
Subgroup analyses by randomization stratum, sex, age, and region will be conducted as applicable. Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.4.3. Secondary Estimands and Endpoints  
9.4.3.1. Key Secondary Estimand  
The attributes of the key secondary estimand are listed below: 
•Treatment: 10, 20, and 30 mg/day JZP385 and placebo.
•Population: Adults with moderate to severe ET.
•Variable: Proportion of participants who improved ( ≥ 1 point improvement) from
Baseline to Week 12  on the CGI-S.

− Any change to concomitant antitremor medication  use after the initiation of study
intervention (refer to Section 9.4.1.2).  Participants who experience this type of 
intercurrent event will be addressed by treatment policy. 
• Summary: Difference in the proportion of participants who improved ( ≥ 1 point
improvement) from Baseline to Week 12 on the CGI -S between each dose of JZP385 
and placebo. 
The main estimator  will be analyzed using the CMH test adjusting for the strat ification factor s at 
randomization (baseline TETRAS composite outcome score [ ≤ 17 or > 17] and the use of 
concomitant antitremor  medication  [Yes or No ]). The 2 -sided p- values from the CMH test, the 
adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment differences across the strata with the CMH weights, and the associated 2 -sided 95% CIs using a 
normal approximation to the weighted average will be provided . 
For the intercurrent event of discontinuation of study intervention due to an AE , for lack of 
efficacy, or any other reason, under the hypothetical strategy, the primary analysis will adopt a 
2-step multiple imputation approach, with MCMC to impute non- monotone intermittent missing
followed by a predictive mean matching method to impute the rest monotone missing outcomes. 
Sensitivity analys is will be conducted through the tipping point analysis, with further details 
provided in the SAP. 
Supplementary analyses will be performed using the Non-responder Imputation (NRI) method as 
well as  completers analysis with only participants who have Week 12 CGI- S assessment . 
9.4.3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
For the analysis of CGI -C and  PGI-C at Week 12 , the CMH test stratified by the randomization 
stratum will be used for the comparison between each dose of JZP385 and placebo. 
For the analysis of change from Baseline to Week 12 on the TETRAS -ADL, TETRAS -PS, 
TETRAS -PS upper limb score (item 4 ), and TETRAS total score, the same MMRM models used 
for the primary estimand will be used. For the analysis of change of QUEST score from Baseline to Week 12, an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model will be used. The model will include treatment group, randomization stratum,  
and corresponding baseline value as fixed effects. 
For the analysis of change of ETEA score from Baseline to Week 12, an ANCOVA model will 
be used. The model will include treatment group, randomization stratum, and corresponding 
baseline value as fixed effects.

For the analysis of change from Baseline to Weeks 4 and 8 on the TETRAS composite outcome 
score, TETRAS -ADL, TETRAS -PS, TETRAS upper limb score (item 4), TETRAS total score, 
the analyses results wi ll be derived from the MMRM used in the Week 12 analysis on the 
primary estimand and the secondary endpoints. 
For the analysis of change from Baseline to Week 12 on modified items 6 and 7 of the 
TETRAS -PS (where each item is modified from 9 response items [due to 0.5 scoring increments] 
to 4 response items), the sum of modified items 1 to 11 of the TETRAS- ADL subscale (where 
each item is modified from 5 response items to 4 response items) , and TETRAS total score, the 
analyses results will be derived from a similar MMRM used  in the Week 12 analysis on the 
primary estimand endpoint.  
For the analyses of proportion of participants who improved ≥  1 point from Baseline to Weeks 4 
and 8 on the CGI -S, the CMH test stratified by the randomization stratum will be used for the 
comparison between each dose of JZP385 and placebo. For the analyses of PGI -C and CGI- C at 
Weeks 4 and 8, the CMH test stratified by the randomization stratum will be used for the 
comparison between each dose of JZP385 and placebo.  
For the analysis of change in SF-36v2 score from B aseline to Week 12, a descriptive summary at 
each scheduled visit along with change from Baseline to Week 1 2 will be tabulated  and listed . 
The time course efficacy analysis using the sum of modified items 6 and 7 of the TETRAS -PS

Amendment 04 
Study m
onitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into 
the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
10.1.9. Study and Site Start and Closure  
First Act of Recruitment  
The study start date is the date on which the first participant has the first visit.  
Study/Site Termin ation 
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study site closure visit has been performed. 
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are 
not limited to:  
For study termination: 
•Discontinuation of further study intervention development
For site termination:  
•Failure of the inves tigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines
•Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) ofparticipants by the investigator
•Total number of participants included earlier than expected
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organiza tion(s) 
used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable 
regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should 
ensure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up.

APPENDIX  5. CONTRACEPTIVE AND BARRIER GUIDANCE  
Definitions  
Woman of Non- childbearing Potenti al 
Women in the following categories are considered women of non-childbearing potential 
(WONCBP):  
1. Premenopausal female with permanent infertility due to one of the following:
2.Documented hysterectomy
3.Documented bilateral salpingectomy
4. Documented bilateral oophorectomy
5. For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the
above, (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), investigator
discretion should be applied to determining study entry.
Note : Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 
6.Postmenopausal female
7. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alter native
medical cause.
8. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be
used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or
hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months ofamenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required.
9. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT to
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.
Woman of Childbearing Potential 
Women in the following categories are considered women of childbearing potential (WOCBP; 
fertile):  
10. Following menarche
11. From the time of menarche until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile
(see below)
•A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
medical cause.
•A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may beused to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception
or HRT. Howe ver, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with
more than one FSH measurement is required.

Amendment 04 
•Fem
ales on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one
of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allowconfirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.
•Permanent sterilization methods (for the purpose of this study) include:
•Documented hyste rectomy
•Documented bilateral salpingectomy
•Documented bilateral oophorectomy
•For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other thanthe above, (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis),investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry.
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
•If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cyclecannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluationshould be considered.
Contraception Guidance:  
CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE:  
Highly Effective Methodsb That Have Low User Dependency Failure rate of <1% per year when 
used consistently and corr ectly.  
•Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc
•Intrauterine device (IUD)
•Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or due to a medical cause)
Azoospermia is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is 
approximately 90 days.  
Note: documentation of azoospermia for a male participant can come from the site personnel’s review 
of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
Highly Effective Methodsb That Are User Dependent Failure rate of <1% per year when used

 Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition 
of ovulationc 
•oral
•intravaginal
•transdermal
•injectable
Progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
•oral
•injectable
Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
a Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive 
methods for those participating in clinical studies.  
b Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those when used consistently and correctly.  
c Male condoms must be used in addition to hormonal contraception. If locally required, in accordance with Clinical 
Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable contraceptive methods are limited to  those which inhibit 
ovulation as the primary mode of action.  
Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods  of contraception. Male 
condom and female condom should not be used together due to risk of failure from friction.

APPENDIX  6. GENETICS 
Use/Analysis of DNA  
•Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study intervention,
susceptibility to, and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to studyintervention may be due to genetic determinants that impact intervention absorption,distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the intervention;
disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore,
where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected forDNA analysis from consenting participants.
•DNA samples will be used for research related to JZP385 and related diseases. They
may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic tests related to JZP385.
Genetic research may consist of the analysis of one or more candidate genes or theanalysis of genetic markers throughout the genome (as appropriate).
•DNA samples will be analyzed for polymorphisms in calcium channel genes.Additional analyses may be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help furtherunderstand the clinical data.
•The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors
involved in the response to JZP385 or study interventions of this class to understandstudy disease or related conditions.
•The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report or in aseparate study summary.
•The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequatemeasures to protect confidentiality.
•The samples will be retained while research on JZP385 continues but no longer than
15 years from the date of sample collection or other period as per local requirements.

APPENDIX  7. CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ESSENTIAL TREMOR 
Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors 
from the Task Force on Tremor of the International Parkinson’s and Movement Disorder Society ( Bhatia , 2018)  
Ess
ential Tremor 
•Isolated tremor syndrome of bilateral upper limb action tremor
•At least 3 years’ duration
•With or without tremor in other locations (eg, head, voice, or lower limbs)
•Absence of other neurological signs, such as dystonia, ataxia, or parkinsonism
Essential Tremor Plus  
Tremor with the characteristics of ET and additional neurological signs of uncertain significance such as impaired tandem gait, questionable dystonic posturing, memory impairment, or other 
mild neurologic signs of unknown significance that do not suffice to make an additional 
syndrome classification or diagnosis. ET with tremor at rest should be classified here. 
Exclusion Criteria for Essential Tremor and Essential Tremor Plus  
•Isolated focal tremors (voice, head)
•Orthostatic tremor with a frequency > 12 Hz
•Task - and position- specific tremors
•Sudden onset and step- wise deterioration

1.1 Synopsis;  
3 Objectives, Estimands and Endpoints;  9.4.4 Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoint(s) The following endpoints were added under exploratory endpoints: 
•Items 6 and 7 of the
TETRAS -PS, with a
change to the analysis to
modify from 5 responseitems to 4  response items
•The sum of modified items
1 to 11 of theTETRAS -ADL subscaleTo provide clarification regarding the 
use of original and modified scales. 
9.2 Sample Size Determination;  9.3 Analysis Sets; 9.4 Statistical Analyses  New effect sizes for study sample size were calculated, text regarding the impact to power with shifts in assumptions were added, and multiplicity adjustments were revised to refle ct the changes to 
the endpoints. As a result of changes to the primary endpoint, new effect sizes were calculated. The sample size assumptions and power were also provided for the key secondary endpoint. Changes to the number of key secondary endpoints led to a new multiplicity testing sequence.  
1.1 Synopsis;  
4.1 Overall Design;  
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding The randomization stratum was 
changed from the 
TETRAS -ADL subscale to 
select modified items from the TETRAS -ADL subscale and 
TETRAS -PS (ie, TETRAS 
composite outcome score). To align the randomization 
stratification with the primary 
endpoint. 
1.3 Schedule of Activities;  8.2.2 Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale – Performance Subscale;  9.4.4 Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoint(s) The efficacy assessments and breath alcohol test were removed from the Week 1 clinic visit.  The 5 mg dose that is administe red to 
participants randomized to active treatment arms during the first study week serves as a titration dose only and is not being evaluated for efficacy.  
1.3 Schedule of Activities  The CGI -S was added as an 
assessment at Weeks 4 and 8.  To enable assess ment of this new key 
secondary endpoint at each clinic visit.

Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) was changed to only include participan ts with 
“much improvement.” To align with feedback received from the FDA.  
2.3.2 Benefit Assessment  Participation in long -term study 
was removed.  To not imply a benefit to participants for such a study, which is not part of this protocol. 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria  Inclusion criterion #4 was revised to add clarification from Appendix 5 about barrier contraception for male partners of female participants.  To clarify the contraception requirements for female participants with male partners.  
5.2 Exclusion Criter ia  Exclusion criterion #6 was updated to add estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) exclusionary values and to move the bilirubin exclusionary values into the parenthesis with other values addressing hepatic function.  To clarify the level of renal disease that is considered exclusionary and correct an error on the placement of the exclusionary bilirubin values.  
6.8 Concomitant Therapy  Added clarification regarding timing of administration for concomitant medications that are known sensitive substra tes 
of P-glycoprotein (P -gp) and To align with feedback received from the FDA.

8.4.5 Pregnancy The term “participant” was 
added into the language regarding follow-up of pregnancy outcome and it was specified that the neonate will be followed for 6 months following birth. To clarify that in addition to the participant’s pregnant female partner, the participant herself who may become pregnant needs to be appropriately followed for the pregnancy outcome. 
8.3.3 ECGs  Corrected text to indicate that electrocardiograms (ECGs) measurements will be taken in 
triplicate not as single 
measurements  To align with the Schedule of Activities (SoA) and clarify that ECG measurements should be taken in triplicate.  
Appendix 3; Table 6 The description “fasted state required at Screening only” was removed for glucose testing.  All labs will be fasted (8 hours) prior to visit, as study drug is taken in the fasted state. Therefore, it is redundant to indicate that glucose should be taken in the fasted state.  
Appendix 3; Table 6 The eGFR assessment added to Clinic
al Chemistry.  To clarify the method of eGFR assessment.  
Appendix 3; Table 6 Removed “drug” from the list of exceptions for study-required laboratory tests performed by a central laboratory. Also added the clarification that urine pregnancy tests are not performed at the central lab.  To correct an error and clarify the 
following text in Appendix 3: “The tests detailed in Table 6 will be performed by the central laboratory, with the exception of urine pregnancy and breath alcohol tests, which will be performed locally.” 
Throughout The molecule name was changed from CX-8998 to JZP385. To reference the current molecule name and link it to interchangeable names of CX -8998, suvecaltamide, 
and MK-8998 and to ensure consistency across JZP385 studies.

Amendment 04 
 Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria #3 Removed Inclusion 3b (Score 
of > 5 on the sum of items 6 and 7 of the TETRAS- PS). Inclusion 3a (TETRAS -ADL score 
≥ 22) and 3c (CGI- S rating of at least 
moderate for participants’ ability to 
function) are considered sufficient to 
enroll a moderate to severe ET population.  
5.1 Inclusion Criteria #4b; 
Table 6 Protocol -required 
Safety Laboratory Tests Revised Inclusion 4b to 
clarify when serum vs urine pregnancy tests are required for WOCBP.  To provide clarification.  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria #4; 
8.1.7 Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment  Revised Exclusion #4 to lower MoCA eligibility threshold to < 20 and added 
clarification that the 
investigator should ensure participants are able to 
accurately self- report on study 
questionnaires. To better assess and exclude 
participants with severe cognitive impairment based on more rigorous 
data on the use of the MoCA and the 
judgment of the investigator on the individual participant.  
The original cut- off of <  23 was 
developed based on a limited study in a convenience sample of 
participants with Parkinson’s disease 
(N = 114) and healthy controls 
(N = 47) at a single non -US center. 
However, a m ore thorough literature 
review showed that in a normal cognitive population, MoCA average 
scores fell within this range, which 
suggested that the original criteria (< 23) had low specificity to detect 
severe cognitive impairment.  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria #6 Revis ed Exclusion 6 to 
remove specified threshold of 
the eGFR to define renal 
disease and to add severe 
renal impairment or end- stage  
renal disease. Based on the finding that JZP385 is primarily cleared via metabolism, 
and that, previously, patients wit h 
creatinine clearance ≥  39 mL/min 
were allowed in the T -CALM study 
with no safety concerns, the specific 
eGFR threshold to define renal disease will be removed from the 
protocol. The eGFR will still be 
calculated for each participant as part of the labora tory assessment.

abuse disorder should be diagnosed. To provide clarification.  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria #11 Revised Exclusion 11 to clarify that MR -guided 
focused ultrasound is a thalamotomy.  To provide clarification.  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria #12 Revised Exclusion 12 to 
specify botulinum toxin (ie, 
Botox) for the treatment of upper limb tremor is exclusionary.  JZP385 is targeting treatment of the 
core symptom of ET, which is upper 
limb tremor. Thus, the use of botulinum toxin for other reasons 
(eg, cosmetic, head tremor, etc.) will 
not confound this assessment. 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria #13b Revised Exclusion 13b to clarify that PRN use of 
medications that impact 
tremor is not permitted.  To provide clarification. 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria #16 Revised Exclusion 16 to 
allow the use of histamine -2 
receptor antagonists under the 
condition they ar e taken at 
least 4  hours after and 
12 hours before study intervention. Administering a dose of H2RA at 
least 12 hours before JZP385 will 
ensure that H2RA effect has washed out before JZP385 administration. 
Administration of H2RA 4 -hours 
post-JZP385 dose will ensure that 
JZP385 has been absorbed or passed through the stomach to the intestine.

whereby -there is no JZP385 left 12 hours postdose in the intestine to 
elicit transporter inhibition, 
permitting safe administration of P-gp/BCRP substrates at that time.

temporarily interrupts study 
intervention. To provide clarification.

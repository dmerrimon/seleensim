CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY
Amendment: 4
Date: 01 February 2019
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGESThis protocol is being revised to make the following changes:
1. The following exploratory objectives have been moved to secondary 
xEvaluation of change from baseline in bod y proportion ratios of the extremities [§8.0, 
Synopsis, and additional a ppropriate sections]. 
xEvaluation of the effect of BMN 111 on bone morphology/quality by X-ray and dual 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [§8.0 and additional appropria te sections]. 
xEvaluate potential changes in health-rela ted quality of life (H RQoL) and functional 
independence as measured by quality of  life questionnaires [§8.0 and additional 
appropriate sections]. 
Rationale: Due to the importance of clinical, morbidity, and HRQoL outcomes in 
achondroplasia, all clinical outcome e ndpoints (with the exception of optional 
assessments) have been moved from exploratory to secondary. 
2. Description of contraception in the st udy inclusion criteria (§9.3.1 and additional 
appropriate sections) and birth control during and after the study (§9.3.3) have 
been updated. 
Rationale: To provide clarity on requirements for the use of highly effective methods 
used in female participants and acceptable methods in male participants, and to define true abstinence to clarify when it is  considered an acceptable method of 
contraception. This is in line with  the Clinical Tr ial Facilitation Group 
“Recommendations related to contraception a nd pregnancy testing in clinical trials.”
3. Duration of Subject Participation updated (§9.3.6 and add itional appropriate 
sections) to 4-week safety follow-up after Week 52.  
Rationale: Follow-up after the study has been extended to ensure adequate passage of 
time before the final safety follow-up so that potentially drug-related AEs should 
have already occurred- protocol.pdf Page 3
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 3
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
4. Primary and secondary efficacy variab les separated so that new secondary 
variables are incorporated (§9.12.2 a nd additional appropr iate sections).
Rationale: This change ma de to support Rationale 1. 
5. Move selected exploratory objectives to  be new secondary objectives (Synopsis, 
§9.12.3, and additional appr opriate sections). 
Rationale: This change ma de to support Rationale 1. 
6. Exploratory efficacy variables dele ted from §9.12.4 and moved to secondary 
efficacy variables (§9.12.3). 
Rationale: This change ma de to support Rationale 1.
7. Change medical monitor from   MD, PhD to , MD. 
8. Replace “18 years of age” with “age  of majority” (§5.3, §12 and additional 
appropriate sections).
Rationale: The age of majority varies by country.
9. Inserted “In Japan, subject enrollment will be staggered initially, with a 
minimum of a 2-week window between the first 4 subjects enrolled” in Study 
Design and Plan in Synopsis and §9.1. 
Rationale: This measure was taken in Japan and implemented in a country-specific 
protocol given the limited exposure experien ce of Japanese subjects to BMN 111 at 
the time of the 111-301 study. The sponsor has now consolidated into one global 
protocol. 
10. Removed “plasma DNA” in §9.12.4.4. 
Rationale: DNA is not obtained from plasma
11. Administrative changes have been made  throughout the amended protocol for 
consistency, accuracy, and clarity.- protocol.pdf Page 4

TITLE OF STUDY: 
A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Cont rolled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of BMN 111 in Children with Achondroplasia 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:
111-301
STUDY SITES:Approximately 33 clinical centers worldwide
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:
Phase 3
STUDY RATIONALE:Achondroplasia (ACH), the most common form of disp roportionate short stature or dwarfism, is an 
autosomal dominant genetic skeletal disorder caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene (FGFR3), a negative regulator of endochondral bone 
formation. Due to this FGFR3 mutation, there is exaggerated negative regulation on endochondral ossification, which results in ACH ( Laederich, 2010 ).
The use of modified recombinant C-type natriureti c peptide (rhCNP) as a potential therapy for the 
treatment of ACH is based on the mechanism of ac tion of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). CNP 
and its receptor, NPR-B, are key regulators of skeletal growth. CNP binding to its receptor, 
natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B), acts as a key regulator of longitudinal bone growth by 
down-regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. CNP-mediated activation 
of NPR-B results in the rescue of the dwarfism  phenotype of mice with a FGFR3 gain-of-function 
mutation ( Yasoda, 2004; Yasoda 2009 ). The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored 
in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012, ), and a mild [Ach] /+ 
model. Partial or complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models 
after BMN 111 administration. Additionally, in wild-type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 administration resulted in growth plate e xpansion and dose-dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically-tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015, ). Therefore, administration of CNP has been 
proposed as a therapeutic approach for ACH.- protocol.pdf Page 5

BioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111)  that has a longer half-life than endogenous 
CNP, thereby allowing daily subcutaneous (SC) administration. Similar to CNP, BMN 111 
activates NPR-B signaling with subsequent inhibi tion of FGFR3 downstream signaling, leading to 
the promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and subsequent increased 
endochondral bone formation. BMN 111 administrati on has been shown to promote endochondral 
bone formation at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in both normal animals and mouse 
models of ACH reported (refer to current Investigators Brochure for additional information).
Human studies to date have demonstrated that BM N 111 is safe and well-tolerated at doses that 
result in improvements in growth velocity approaching that of children of average stature.
Study 111-101 was a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and 
tolerability of BMN 111 in healthy adult male volunteers without ACH. Part 1 examined a series of 
single subcutaneous doses (5 μg/kg, 10 μg/kg and 15 μg/kg), and Part 2 included 10 days of either 
fixed dosing or dose escalation (0.5 μg/kg to 8 μg/kg). BMN 111 was generally well tolerated at all 
doses. As expected, mild, transient, self-limited hypotension was reported (refer to current 
Investigators Brochure for additional information). BMN 111 demonstrated dose-related linear 
increases in exposure by maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) (from 2.5 μg/kg to 
15μg/kg) in healthy volunteers; plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2) ranged from 30.7 to 140 minutes.
Study 111-202 was a Phase 2, open-label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study that assesses 
daily SC BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH, starting with a dose of 2.5 μg/kg and escalating 
through additional dose cohorts up to 30 μg/kg. The primary objective of Study 111-202 was to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 administered for 6 months and up to 24 months; 
the secondary objectives were to determine chan ge from baseline in annualized growth velocity 
(AGV), growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluate the dose-exposure and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profiles of BMN 111 in children with ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6-month initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that treatment 
with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg was generally well tolerated 
at all dose levels (refer to current Investigators Brochure for specific details).
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6-month initial phase of Study 111-202 demonstrated a positive 
dose-dependent response in mean change from baseline AGV at doses ranging from 2.5-15 μg/kg 
daily. Subjects treated with 30 μg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in AGV after 6 
months compared with subjects treated with 15 μg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30- μg/kg daily 
dose was also similar to the 15- μg/kg daily dose. Given that no clinically significant difference 
could be identified between the 15- μg/kg and 30- μg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6-month safety 
and efficacy data, the lower of the two doses has been chosen for this Phase 3 study.- protocol.pdf Page 6

STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: 
This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the
effect of BMN 111 on growth velocity in children with ACH. Subjects who are 5 to < 18 years old, 
with documented ACH confirmed by genetic testing will have been enrolled in Study 111-901 for at least a 6-month period immediately before study en try, and meet all study eligibility criteria will 
participate. At least 110 eligible subjects will be stratified based on sex and Tanner stage (Stage 1, 
and > Stage 1, with no more than 20% of subjects > Tanner Stage 1) at Screening, and randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: placebo or BMN 111 at 15 μg/kg/day. To 
achieve gender balance, approximately 50% of each gender will be enrolled, with neither to exceed 55%. In Japan, subject enrollment will be staggered initially, with a minimum of a 2-week window 
between the first 4 subjects enrolled. 
For both placebo and BMN 111, the route of administration is subcutaneous injection and the 
frequency is daily. Approximately 33 clinical cent ers worldwide will participate in the study.  
Safety monitoring will be conducted for all subjects randomized to BMN 111 or placebo after the 
first dose of BMN 111 or placebo is received and over the duration of the study. This will include a 
minimum of 2 hours post-dose observation on the first 3 days of dosing (and 30 minutes for all 
other days of dose administration) in conjunction with caregiver training for BMN 111 or placebo 
administration and adverse event (AE) documentation/reporting. It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating BMN 111 or placebo well and specified criteria have been met (refer to
Study Reference Manual), caregivers will begin administering BMN 111 or placebo at home. If the 
caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer BMN 111 or placebo, home health care may be 
provided. Contact by a study staff member to the caregiver will be required every 4 weeks 
(± 10 days) to all study subjects after the Week 6 visit when there are no study visits or contact in the preceding 4 weeks. During these contacts, st udy staff will ask about dose administration and 
seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. Information on all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) should be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.- protocol.pdf Page 8

morphology and quality, clinical hip assessment , anti-BMN 111 immunogenicity assessments; 
salivary cortisol, serum prolactin, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (FSH/LH will be monitored for all subjects >8 years of age, and for subjects at Tanner 
stage 2, whichever is earlier); and cognitive assessment with the Childhood Behavioral Checklist 
(CBCL). Additional assessments will be conducted to evaluate changes from baseline in bone 
metabolism.
Pharmacokinetics:
PK sampling will be carried out over the 12-month study period in subjects randomized to 
BMN 111 or placebo. If supported by the data, the PK variables to be calculated for subjects 
randomized to BMN 111 will include: 
xArea under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-).
xArea under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of last measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-t).
xMaximum observed plasma concentration (C max).
xTime to reach C max(Tmax).
xElimination half-life (t 1/2).
xApparent clearance (CL/F).
xApparent volume of distribution (V z/F).
All PK variables will be estimated by non-compartmental analysis.
Secondary:
Secondary assessments will include change from baseline in growth parameters (height), body 
proportions of the upper and lower segments, and proportions of the extremities by anthropometry. 
Growth parameters will be assessed by height Z-scores. Body proportions will be assessed by 
anthropometric measurements and measurement ratios. Anthropometric measurements may include 
but are not limited to standing height; sitting height; weight; head circumference; upper and lower 
arm length; leg length; and arm span. Measurement ratios may include, but are not limited to, 
upper:lower body segment ratio, upper arm:forearm length ratio, upper leg:lower leg length ratio, 
and arm span:standing height ratio. Further details are provided in the Study 111-301
Anthropometric Measurement Guidelines.
Health-related quality of life and functional independence will be assessed using the QoLISSY, 
PedsQL, and WeeFIM (reference Training Materials for specifics).

exploratory assessments will be conducted to evaluate changes from baseline in BMN 111 activity 
biomarkers and optional genomic biomarkers will be evaluated.
STATISTICAL METHODS: 
Sample Size Determination:
With 55 subjects planned in each of the two randomized groups (one BMN 111 group and one 
placebo group), the power to detect a difference of 1.75 cm/year between the BMN 111 group and 
the placebo group in change from baseline in AGV at 12 months is approximately 90%, assuming 
that the pooled standard deviation of the change from baseline in AGV is 2.80, using a two-sided two-sample t-test at a 0.05 significance level. The power calculation is based on data from Study 
111-202 (a phase 2, open-label, sequential cohort dose-escalation study) and Study 111-901 (a 
natural history study for pediatric subjects with achondroplasia). 
Efficacy Analysis: 
Efficacy analysis will be carried out for the 52-week (12-month) period. Efficacy analysis will be 
based on all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or placebo in this study.
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in AGV at the 12-month time point 
based on standing height measures. The details of the derivation for AGV are provided in 
Section 14.2.1 . The AGV and its change from baseline at each scheduled post-treatment visit will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and 
maximum) per group. The primary estimand is the difference in mean change from baseline in 
AGV at the 12-month time point between the BMN 111 group and the placebo group. The 
estimand is defined on all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or placebo. - protocol.pdf Page 15

Subjects who discontinue from the study drug will be encouraged to remain in the study, and their 
non-missing height measurements will continue to be used in calculating the AGV and to beincluded in the analysis per intend to treat principle. In the event that missing data does occur 
despite all efforts, missing standing height will be imputed based on multiple imputation (MI) with
pattern-mixture models ( Little 1993 ;Molenberghs 2007, ) implemented in Proc MI of SAS where
the missing, unobserved observations of the standing height are assumed to follow missing not atrandom (MNAR) mechanism. For each imputation, the standing heights collected from thesubjects in the same randomization group who also discontinue treatment prematurely(but remain in the study), referred to as off-treatment data, will be used as the reference data forMI. Ten (10) sets of imputations of the missing standing heights will be constructed from MI andthe AGV at the 12-month time point will be calcul ated based on these 10 sets of data. For each 
subject whose value is imputed, the 10 imputed values  will be provided in a data listing that will be
included in the appendix of the CSR. 
The primary null hypothesis of no difference be tween the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
in the mean change from baseline in AGV at the 12-month time point will be tested based on an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with fixed-effect terms including treatment group, sex, and Tanner stage, and age and the baseline AGV as covariates. The above-mentioned ANCOVA model will be applied to the 10 imputed data sets from MI. The analysis results based on the 10 imputed datasets will be summarized using Proc MIANALIZE in SAS.The key secondary efficacy endpoints are the change from baseline in height Z-score, and the change from baseline in upper:lower body segment ratio. The estimand of the key secondaryefficacy endpoints is the difference in mean change from baseline in the corresponding endpoint atthe 12-month time point between the BMN 111 group and the placebo group (all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or placebo). The measurement of standing height at each scheduled visit will be converted to age-and sex-appropriate standard 
score, also referred to as Z-score, by comparison with normal reference standards (not ACH). The 
height Z-score and its change from baseline will  be summarized using descriptive statistics. Any
missing observations will be imputed based on MI wi th pattern-mixture models described above. 
The null hypothesis of no difference between the BMN 111 group and the placebo group in themean change from baseline in the height Z-scor e at the 12-month time point will be tested based on

The change from baseline in upper:lower body segment ratio at the 12-month time point will be similarly summarized and tested.- protocol.pdf Page 16

The overall type I family-wise error rate for testing the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
will be controlled at the 0.05 significance level using the following 3-step serial gatekeeping 
multiple comparisons procedure (MCP). Following this MCP, advancement to the next step will only occur if the null hypotheses within a step and the previous step(s) are all rejected at the 
significance level of 0.05 in favor of BMN 111. If any null hypotheses within a step is not rejected 
or is rejected but not in favor of BMN 111, the hypothesis tests corresponding to all subsequent 
steps will not be considered statistically sign ificant. All hypothesis tests will be two-sided. 
1. The first step will be the test comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for the 
primary efficacy endpoint, the change from ba seline in AGV at 12-month time point. If the 
null hypothesis is not rejected (ie, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in favor of 
BMN 111, all subsequent statistical tests will not be considered statistically significant. The study is considered positive if the primary test is significant in favor of BMN 111. 
2. The second step will be the test comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for 
the secondary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in height Z-score at 12-month 
time point. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (ie, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in 
favor of BMN 111, the subsequent statistical test will not be considered statistically 
significant. 
3. The third step will be the test comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for the 
secondary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in upper:lower body segment ratio 
at 12-month time point at a significance level of 0.05. 
Additional secondary efficacy analyses will also include change from baseline in body proportions 
of extremities, and HRQoL and functional independence assessments. 
Change in body proportions of extremities will be assessed by anthropometry. To assess the robustness of the primary analysis re sult, sensitivity analyses such as the following 
will be performed:- protocol.pdf Page 17

Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM)
The primary null hypothesis of no difference between the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
in the mean change from baseline in AGV at the 12-month time point will be tested based on all 
available AGV assessments from all scheduled visits using a mixed model with repeated measures 
(MMRM), with fixed-effect terms including treatment group, visit, sex, Tanner stage, and 
interaction of treatment group and visit, and age and the baseline AGV as covariates, repeated over 
visits. 
MI Based on Missing At Random (MAR) Assumption
The sensitivity analyses will be based on the MI technique as proposed by Little and Rubin (1987)
implemented in PROC MI of SAS where the missing, unobserved observations of the response variable are assumed to follow MAR mechanism. The MI procedure will be directly applied to 
standing height and AGV w ill be calculated based on imputed height. The ANCOVA model 
described in the primary analysis will be performed separately for each imputation dataset and a 
summary overall imputed samples will be provided for each analysis.
Random Coefficients Model
The mean change from baseline in height at 12-month time point will be estimated for both the 
treatment group and the placebo group based on a MMRM, with fixed-effect terms including 
treatment group, visit, sex, Tanner stage, and age and the baseline height as covariates, and 
random-effect terms of the intercept and the subject ×visit interaction. For each randomized group, 
an AGV at 12-month time point will be defined as the mean change from baseline in height at 
12-month from the MMRM model above.  
ANCOVA on Completers
In this sensitivity analysis, the estimand will be the difference of the means of the change from 
baseline in AGV at 12-month observed from subjects who have non-missing observation at 
12-month between the two randomized groups. The LS means of the change from baseline in AGV 
at 12-month will be estimated for both the randomized groups based on the ANCOVA model 
described in the primary analysis. In this analysis, only subjects with observed AGV change from 
baseline at 12-month will be included. No extrapolation or imputation will be performed for 
missing 12-month or Day 1 st anding height measurements. 
Similar sensitivity analyses may also be performed on secondary efficacy endpoints.  Subgroup 
analyses on the efficacy endpoints based on Tanner  stage or age groups may also be performed. 
By-subject listings will also be provided for efficacy endpoints. Detailed statistical methods will be 
provided in the SAP.
Safety Analysis:
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or placebo will 
be included in the study safety analysis. The safety analysis will be descriptive. 
All AEs will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) to assign system organ class and preferred term classification to event and 
disease, based on the original terms entered on the CRF. The incidence of AEs will be summarized 
by system organ class, preferred term, relationship to study treatment as assessed by investigator, 
and severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent discontinuation from the study and from the study treatment, will be listed.
All other safety measures including X-ray/DXA assessments of bone morphology, quality, and 
growth of the extremities and spine (X-rays only), laboratory tests, CBCL assessments, vital signs,

7 INTRODUCTION
BMN 111 is a proposed pharmacologic therapeutic option for achondroplasia (ACH), the 
most common form of dwarfism. 
ACH is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1/25000 in the US ( Wynn, 2007 ). The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm, respectively ( Genetics
Home Reference, 2012 ). Characteristic features include long and narrow trunk, a large head
with frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid-face,  bowed legs and stenosis of the foramen and 
spinal canals that can be life-threatening. Foramen magnum stenosis can lead to 
cervicomedullary compression in infants with  complications including hydrocephalus, 
hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, apnea, cyanotic episodes, feeding problems, 
quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacological therapy for achondroplasia in the United States of
America (USA) or European Union (EU). Current treatments for achondroplasia are focusedon neurosurgical interventions for foramen  magnum stenosis or lumbar stenosis, 
thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis, or limb lengthening requiring multipleoperations over 2 to 3 years ( Shirley, 2009 );Horton 2007).
ACH is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) R3, a 
negative regulator of chondrocyte prolifer ation and differentiation. The most common 
mutation (98%) in ACH patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of 
FGFR3. The majority of new cases (80%) orig inate from parents of average stature.   
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR3 inhibition of  chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation 
(Foldynova-Trantirkova, 2012, ). The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by CNP, a positive 
regulator of chondrocyte prolifer ation and differentiation. Binding  of CNP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide-Receptor B (NPR-B) antagonizes FGFR3 downstream signaling by inhibiting the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF-1 ( Krejci, 2005, ); (Yasoda, 2004,); (Yasoda, 
2009,);(Pejchalova, 2007) . This crosstalk was demonstrated in a mouse model of FGFR3-
related chondrodysplasia ( Yasoda, 2004, );(Yasoda, 2009,) . The dwarfism phenotype of mice 
harboring the FGFR3G380R mu tation was rescued by expre ssion of C-type natriuretic 
peptide (CNP) in cartilage or by the con tinuous administration of CNP (infusion). 
CNP is a member of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family that includes Atrial Natriuretic 
Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). These peptides are structurally related but are distinct paracrine/autocrine (CNP) or endocrine (ANP and BNP) factors that regulate the cardiovascular (CV), skeletal, nervous, reproductive and other systems. Synthetic analogs - protocol.pdf Page 35

of ANP (anaritide and carperitide) and BNP (nesiritide) have been investigated as potential 
therapies for the treatment of decompensated heart failure and cardiovascular-related diseases.
BMN 111 is a 39-amino acid CNP analogue ha rboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C-terminal sequence and modified by the addition of two amino acids (Pro-Gly) on 
the N-terminus. It is a recombinant human pep tide fused to human transcription factor (TAF) 
and expressed as an inclusion body in E. coli . BMN 111 is liberated and solubilized from the 
TAF-fusion protein by formic acid cleavage, and purified by column chromatography ( Long, 
2012,). BMN 111 was designed to 1) mimic CNP activities in terms of re ceptor binding and 
pharmacological activity and 2) be resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) digestion in 
order to have an extended half-life in comp arison to CNP that is presumed to increase 
exposure to the target growth plate ( Wendt, 2015,).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 111 is contained in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin. Investigators are required to review the Investigator’s 
Brochure prior to initiating this study.
7.1 Nonclinical StudiesThe pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was ex plored in two mouse models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model (Lorget, 2012,) , and a mild [Ach] /+ model. Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype was obs erved in these mouse models after 
BMN 111
administration. Additionally, in wild-type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growth plate expans ion and dose-dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolerated dose levels (Wendt, 2015,) .
BMN 111-related adverse findings in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechanism of action of  CNP on the growth plate and vasculature. 
Reversible subcutaneous injection site reactions were reported, incl uding injection site 
discoloration and microscopic findi ngs of perivascular mononuclear  cell infiltrates that were 
seen with slightly higher incidence and se verity in BMN 111-treated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control. Adverse skeletal changes associated with exaggerated 
growth were seen in normal nonclinical species  with open growth plates, and were dose-,
exposure- and time-dependent.

7.2 Previous Clinical Studies7.2.1 Study 111-101Study 111-101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double B lind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of BMN 111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers,” was a first-in-human study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the safety, tolera bility, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a 
single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunteers.
Doses ranging from 5.0 μg/kg to 15.0 μ g/kg were administered as a single SC dose; doses 
ranging from 0.5 μg/kg to 8.0 μ g/kg were administered daily in the multiple ascending dose 
segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self-limited hypotension occurred. The majority of these cases were asymptoma tic and observed upon assumption of an upright 
posture following recumbence. Hypotension even ts were reported in the BMN 111 treatment 
groups with higher frequency compared with placebo. All events were judged to be mild in severity and resolved spontaneously without an  intervention. These events occurred across 
dose ranges. Due to the limited number of events  at each dose, it is unclear if symptomatic
hypotension is dose related. No dose limiting toxicities were identified outside of these cardiovascular findings. The only AEs occurring in more than one subject receiving BMN 111 were orthostatic hypotension, contact de rmatitis, and back pain, and injection site 
reactions. Most AEs in the study were of mild severity, and no SAEs were reported. There were no AEs that led to premat ure discontinuation of study drug.  
The PK parameters for BMN 111 were obtained fr om Part 1 of the study and from the first
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Pa rt 2.

7.2.2 Study 111-202
Study 111-202 was a Phase 2, open-label, seque ntial cohort, dose escalation study that 
assesses daily SC admin istration of BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH. The primary 
objective of Study 111-202 was to evaluate  the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6 months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives were to determine 
change from baseline in annualized growth  velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body 
proportions, and evaluate the dose-exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6-mont h initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg 
(Cohorts 1 to 4, respectively) was generally we ll tolerated. The most common AEs were mild 
injection site reactions, pyrexia, asymptom atic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. 
For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to  the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  Analysis of efficacy data from the 6-month in itial phase of Study 111- 202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) change from baseline AGV when BMN 111 is administered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year, respec tively. Thus, a positive dose-dependent 
response was observed in change from baseline AGV at doses ranging from 2.5-15 μg/kg 
daily.  In regards to 12-month data, subjects in Cohor t 3 completed 12 months on a stable daily dose 
of 15 μg/kg and positive change from baseline in  AGV was observed in subjects in Cohort 3. 
Subjects treated with 30 μg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 
6 months and their mean changes from baseline in AGV were similar to subjects treated with 
15 μg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30 μg/kg daily dose was also similar to the 15 μ g/kg daily 
dose. Thus, no clinically significant diff erence could be identified between the 15 μg/kg and 
30 μg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6-month safety and efficacy data.
Single-dose PK data from Day 1 showed BMN 111 was rapidly absorbed (median T
max
between 5.00 and 16.0 minutes) and rapidly cleared from plasma (mean t 1/2ranging from 
24.4 to 27.0 minutes).   - protocol.pdf Page 38
CBI
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 38
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
There was no evidence of accumulation with mu ltiple daily dosing, and all pre-dose PK 
samples were below the limit of quantitation, consistent with the short half-life relative to the 
daily dosing regimen. Overall, exposure following multiple dosing was similar to exposure following single doses, and remained consiste nt through 24 months, indicating no apparent 
time-dependence in PK through 24 months of treatment. 
Further details regarding results from the 111- 202 study can be found in the current version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure.
7.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies7.3.1 Study 111-205Study 111-205 is an ongoing open-label, Phase 2 extension study to assess long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN 111 in childre n with ACH. Subjects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111-202 study (up to 
30 μg/kg daily). This 5-year study allows for l ong-term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN 111 administration on safe ty, tolerability, growth velocity, height, and body 
proportions in subject completing 2 years of  BMN 111 treatment in Study 111-202 (7 years 
total BMN 111 treatment duration) . Additional exploratory endpoints are being examined to 
determine long-term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and the medical complications 
of ACH.
7.4 Study RationaleBioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111) that has a longer half-life than 
endogenous CNP, thereby allowing  daily subcutaneous (SC) ad ministration. Similar to CNP, 
BMN 111 activates NPR-B signaling with s ubsequent inhibition of FGFR3 downstream 
signaling, leading to the promotion of c hondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and 
subsequent increased endochondral bone fo rmation. BMN 111 administration has been 
shown to promote endochondral bone formation at  hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in 
both normal animals and mouse models of AC H reported (refer to current Investigators 
Brochure for additional information).
Human studies to date have also demonstrated  that BMN 111 is safe and well tolerated at 
doses that result in improvements in growth velo city approaching that of children of average 
stature.
Analysis of safety data from the Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with BMN 111 was 
generally well tolerated at all dose levels (refer to current Investigators Brochure for specific details). - protocol.pdf Page 39
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 39
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
Analysis of efficacy data from Study 111- 202 demonstrated that that subjects given 
BMN 111 at the dose of 15 μg/kg daily had a clinically significant improvement in AGV, 
with approximately ~50% increa se over baseline seen with trea tment for 6 months which was 
sustained after continued tr eatment for 12 months.   
Subjects treated with 30 μg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 
6 months and their mean changes from baseline in AVG were similar to subjects treated with 
15 μg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30- μg/kg daily dose was also similar to the 15- μg/kg daily 
dose. Given that no clinically significant difference could be identified between the 15 μg/kg 
and 30 μg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6-month safety and efficacy data, the lower of the 
two doses has been chosen for this Phase 3 study. 
Study 111-301 is designed to further characte rize and confirm efficacy and safety of 
BMN 111 at a dose of 15 μg/kg for 52 weeks in a placebo-controlled study. This 60-week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52 weeks of treatment with an additi onal 4 weeks of safety 
follow up) will allow for assessment of the effect of daily BMN 111 administration on 
growth velocity, growth (height), and body pr oportions (lower:upper segments) in subjects 
treated with BMN 111 compared with the plac ebo group, as well as further characterize 
safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in children with ACH. Additional endpoints will also be 
examined. Secondary endpoints to determine the effects of BMN 111 include evaluation of 
change from baseline in body proportions of the extremities by anthropometry, bone 
physiology (including changes in bone morphology, quality, and growth via X-rays and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the extre mities and spine). Othe r secondary endpoints 
assessing quality of life and da ily function of study subjects include health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) and functional independence assessments.  These endpoints include 
administration of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Quality of Life in Short 
Stature Youth (QoLISSY), and Functional I ndependence Measure (WeeFIM) assessments. 
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) will also be administered. Additional exploratory endpoints include polysomnography to evaluate  sleep apnea, BMN 111 activity biomarkers, 
and genomic biomarkers. Subjects who are in the control arm of the study who have been
receiving placebo may be eligible to receive active treatment after they have completed the treatment period of the study.

7.5.2 Summary of Risks from Clinical Studies
7.5.2.1 Study 111-101Based on review of the first-in-human Phase 1 study of BMN 111 in healthy adult volunteers, 
Study 111-101, BMN 111 administered SC daily was well tolerated with doses ranging from 
0.5 μ g/kg to 15 μg/kg. All AEs were of mild severity, and no SAEs were reported. The most 
common AE was mild, transient, self-limited orthostatic hypotension, of which the majority 
of cases were asymptomatic and observed only upon assumption of an upright posture 
following recumbence. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified outside of these CV 
findings.
7.5.2.2 Study 111-202Analysis of safety data from the 6-mont h initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg was generally 
well tolerated. In addition BMN 111 at 15 μg/kg was well tolerated for over 12 months with 
no new safety concerns identified. Based on review of data from the Phase 2 clinical trial, injection site reactions and 
hypotension have been identified as risks associated with BMN 111 injections. Hypersensitivity reactions including developm ent of BMN 111 antibodies are potential risks 
associated with BMN 111 injections. For a deta iled summary of risks, please refer to the

benefits may include improvement of AGV rates such that their increase in growth velocity may approach that of children of average st ature. Additional potentia l benefits may include 
improvement of the disproporti onate growth as well as impr ovement in quality of life, 
activities of daily living, and medical complications of ACH. For example, improvement in height could have an impact on daily activity performance.- protocol.pdf Page 42

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlle d, double-blind multicenter study to evaluate 
the effect of BMN 111 on growth in children w ith ACH. Subjects who are 5 to < 18 years old 
with documented ACH confirmed by genetic testing will have been enrolled in Study 111-901 for at least a 6-month period immediately before study entry, and meet all study 
eligibility criteria will participate. At least 110 eligible subjects will be stratified based on sex and Tanner Stage (Stage 1, and > Stage 1) (w ith no greater than 20% of subjects > Tanner 
Stage 1), and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment  groups: placebo or 
BMN 111 at 15 μg/kg. To achieve gender balance, approximately 50% of each gender will 
be enrolled, with neither to exceed 55%. In Japan, subject enrollment will be staggered 
initially, with a minimum of a 2-week window between the first 4 subjects enrolled.
For placebo and BMN 111, the route of adminis tration is subcutaneous injection and the 
frequency is daily. Approximately 33 clinical centers worldwide will participate in the study.
The 111-301 study design is presented below in Figure 9.1.1.
Figure 9.1.1:  111-301 Study Design
BMN 111 or placebo will be administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 15 μg/kg given 
daily for 52 weeks. The control group will receive  subcutaneous injections with placebo daily 
for 52 weeks.
Safety monitoring will be conducted for a ll subjects randomized to BMN 111 or placebo 
after the first dose is received and over the duration of the study. This will include a minimum of 2 hours post-dose observation on the first 3 days of dosing and 30 minutes on all 
- protocol.pdf Page 44

other days of dose administration, in conjunc tion with caregiver training for BMN 111 or 
placebo administration and AE doc umentation/reporting. It is generally expected that after 
subjects are tolerating BMN 111 or placebo well and specified criteria have been met, 
caregivers will begin administering BMN 111 or placebo. If the caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer BMN 111 or placebo, ho me health care may be provided. Contact 
by a study staff member to the caregiver will be required every 4 weeks (± 10 days) to all study subjects after the Week 6 visit when th ere are no study visits or contact in the 
preceding 4 weeks. During these contacts, st udy staff will ask the caregiver about dose 
administration and seek information on advers e events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) by 
specific questioning. Information on all AEs and SAEs should be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and on the AE elec tronic case report form (eCRF).
After the study is completed, subjects in both tr eatment and control groups  will be eligible to 
receive BMN 111 in 111-302, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over the longer term. Subjects will have the option to enroll in 111-302 after the Week 52/Study Completion 
Visit. Week 52 assessments will serve as Base line assessments for entry to study 111-302 if 
the visit occurs on the same day or within 2 weeks. Subjects who enroll into 111-302 more than 2 weeks after the 111-301 Week 52 visit w ill have a separate Ba seline visit; the same 
assessments as those performed at Week 52 will be repeated at that time.
Data Monitoring CommitteeIn addition to safety monitoring by BioMarin  personnel, an independent data monitoring 
committee (DMC) will act as an advisory body to BioMarin and provide input on the safety data collected in the study. DMC data review will occur at regular time periods during the study (or ad hoc, if indicated). Membership, roles, and responsibilitie s of the DMC will be 
outlined in a separate DMC charter.

NOTE: ALL BLOOD AND URINE LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS ARE PRE-DOSE EXCEPT WHEN SPECIFIED. OTHER ASSESSMENTS CAN BE CONDUCTED EITHER 
PRE-DOSE OR POST-DOSE UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.
a.Day 10 visit has a ± 1-day window; all subsequent visits have a ±7-day window. 
b.If both visits are on the same day, the 111-901 procedures that can be used as the 111-301 screening data are outlined in the S tudy Reference Manual.
c.Demographics, medical history, including ACH-related history, should include all major illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries that the subject has ever had; including any prior or 
existing medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety.
d.Standing height of the subject’s biological parents may be assess ed (optional) via height measurement or stated height. Height measurement can be done at any point in the 
study. Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent is required to complete an ICF specific to parent height assessment. T he ICF will be signed prior to the 
assessment, which can be done at any point in the study. If the biological parent is not available during the course of the stu dy to take his/her standing height, if consented, 
the biological parent can provide his/her stated height.  - protocol.pdf Page 48
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 48
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2018
e.If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have e ither a written letter by the physician confirming genetic testin g, including the specific mutation required for Study 
111-301 include the identification of FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or “other”) OR a lab report from a certified laborato ry with the study specific mutation 
documented.
f.Complete physical exam includes all major body systems. 
g.Pregnancy test will be conducted at each indicated visit for female subjects who have begun menses or are 10 years of age and ol der. Either urine or serum test may be used. 
Serum pregnancy tests will be performed in the event that urin e pregnancy test results are positive or equivocal (indeterminate ).
h.All treatment visits have pre- and post-dose vital sign assessments. Left brachial arm should be the first method of assessment considered, and the same site should be used for 
blood pressure measurement in each subject throughout the study. 
x Pre-Dose vital sign assessments: Vital signs at pre-dose include: body temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), heart rate, BP, and respiratory rate
o Pre-dose vital signs should always be taken and recorded prior to pre-dose blood draw.
x Post-dose vital sign assessments: Vital signs  at post dose include heart rate and BP
o Vital signs should be taken prior to blood draws.
o When blood samples and BP assessments are scheduled at the same time or within the same time window, BP should be measured befo re blood 
samples are drawn.
o If a BP measurement must be taken after a blood draw, ensure adequate analgesia for the blood draw and at least 5 minutes before  measuring BP.
o Vital signs may be monitored more frequently or for longer duration post-dose as clinically indicated.
x Hypotensive Event:
x If a subject has symptoms potentially consistent with hypotension or a decrease in systolic BP of 20 mm Hg or more from pre-dos e systolic BP, blood pressure and 
heart rate (BP/HR) should be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes there after until the systo lic BP returns to 
pre-dose systolic BP (or within the normal range for this subject as defined by PI) and symptoms (if present) resolve.
NOTE: If the hypotension resolves within the first hour and returns to the normal range, additional BP monitoring as described above is not required. Detailed guidance for blood 
pressure assessments is provided in the most recent Blood Pressure Instrument and Technique Guidelines. - protocol.pdf Page 49

Note: Please reference the Blood Pressure Instrument and Technique Guidelines document for additional information on blood pres sure measurement requirements.
i.Growth measures should be collected at approximately the same time each visit (± 2 hr from the time when the first measurement a ssessment was taken at Screening) by a 
study staff member, preferably the same person throughout the study, who has been trained by a BioMarin representative. Anthrop ometric measurements may include but 
are not limited to standing height; sitting height; weight; head circumference; upper and lower arm length; leg length; and arm  span (See Anthropometric Measurement 
Guidelines). Anthropometric measurements will be taken three time s in a row with the exception of weight, which is taken once. Anthropometric measurements will be 
taken at the early termination visit only if subject discontinues  after Week 6 and > 2 weeks since previous anthropometric measu rement assessment.
j.Reference the study-specifi c HRQoL and WeeFIM guidance documents. NOTE: for th e Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), no data will b e collected from the language 
scale, as it is supplemental and not required to calculate any of the behavior measures.
k.Hip clinical assessment: this assessment will include medical hist ory of the hip and physical exam (including observation of ga it when possible) to determine changes in 
hip function or pain with hip (active and passive range of motion, when possible). Changes from baseline may trigger further eva luation based on the investigator’s clinical 
assessment. 
l.If sleep study results in a poor recording or is uninterpretable, the subject may need to repeat the assessment. Sleep study oc curs at the early termination visit only if early 
termination visit occurs after Week 26 and subject has had a previous sleep study during the trial, ie, has entered the substud y. 
m.A standard 12 lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, and anatomic abnormalities. All ECG s will be performed in triplicate at the 
visits indicated in the Schedule of Events  (Table 9.1.1). ECGs will be performed pos t-dose on study day visits at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be 
performed pre-dose. On days when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs should be performed within a 5-minute window prior to 30-minu te PK assessment
n.Clinical labs (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) are all pre-dose collections.  
o.FSH/LH will be monitored for all subjects >8 years of age, and for subjects at Tanner stage 2 (whichever is earlier).- protocol.pdf Page 50
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 50

p.Immunogenicity: Total and neutralizing anti-BMN 111 antibody samples (serum) will be drawn pre-dose on Day 1, Weeks 13, 26, 39,  52, and Safety Follow-Up or Early 
Termination visit as listed in the SOE. NAb testing and TAb testing for cross-reactivity with endogenous CNP, ANP or BNP will b e performed only on Baseline and TAb 
positive samples. Blood (serum) samples for testing Total immun oglobulin E (IgE) and drug-specific IgE will be drawn on Day 1 a nd in the event of a Grade 3 or 
significant hypersensitivity adverse event, or at investigator or  Sponsor discretion. The drug-specific IgE sample should be dr awn at least 8 hr after the event start time or 
before the next dose. A sample for total IgE and serum tryptase should be drawn within 1 hour of the start of the event when pos sible or during the unscheduled safety visit. 
q.Bone metabolism blood biomarker samples will be  collected pre-dose on the indicated visits. 
r.Bone metabolism urine biomarker samples will be collected as soon as possible upon arrival at the clinic. Each sample will be te sted for biomarker concentration and 
creatinine concentration for normalization.  
s.BMN 111 activity urine biomarker and urine chemistry samples will be collected pre-dose, and 1, 2, and 4 hr post-dose on the in dicated visits (± 20 minutes for all urine 
sample time points). Each collection will be tested for biomarker concentration and urine creatinine concentration for normaliz ation.
t.Full PK samples are collected pre-dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 45(± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min),  120 (± 5 min) minutes post dose at Day 1, 
Week 26, and Week 52 visits. Partial PK samples are collected pre-dose and at 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), and 60 (± 5 min) minu tes post-dose at Week 13 and Week 39 
visits.
u.DXA at early termination visit only if subject discontinues after 9 months to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure (unless addi tional X-rays are recommended by 
investigator, BioMarin, or DMC).
v.Left hand and wrist X-ray (PA view), and bilateral X-ray of lowe r extremity (AP/lateral views) including distal femoral growth plate and proximal tibia growth plate. 
Week 52 X-ray is bilateral whole leg, AP only. X-rays are obtained  at the early termination visit only if subject discontinues af ter 9 months to reduce unnecessary radiation 
exposure (unless additional procedure is recommended by investigator, BioMarin, or DMC). For PA of hand and wrist X-ray, the lef t-sided extremities should be first sites 
of assessment considered, and the same sites should be used for measurement in each subject throughout the study.
w.Lateral and AP lumbar spine X-rays at early termination visit on ly if subject discontinues after 9 months to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure (unless additional 
X-rays are recommended by investigator, BioMarin, or DMC). 
x.Injection site photos are optional, but sites are strongly encouraged to take photos on Day 1, Week 26, Week 52, and Early Term Visit. During a scheduled visit, photos of 
the injection site will be taken in either of these two situa tions: 1) If an injection site r eaction (ISR) occurs, photos will be taken for each ISR when it becomes apparent (or 
at onset), at most severe, and then post resolution. The time of the post-resolution photo may not be the same as the time the AE resolved, and this is expected. If the visit 
has ended and the ISR has not resolved, the subject is not expect ed to remain on site until ISR resolves. If the ISR is ongoing at the end of the visit, record as an ongoing 
AE. 2) If the subject has not had an ISR by the end of the study  visit, a photo will still be take n of the injection site used on that day. In between visits, if an ISR worsens or 
changes in pattern, then the subject should have an unscheduled site visit. During the visit photos of the injection site with t he ISR should be taken. Also, injection sites 
may be photographed if there is a new ISR or at any other time at the discretion/medical judgment of the investigator or as rec ommended by the sponsor. 
y.All medications (prescription, over-the-counter and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken 30 days prior to Screening and th roughout the study should be documented.
z.The same injection site should not be used 2 days in a row, a nd should be rotated between the four injection sites bilaterally (upper thigh, upper back of arm, abdomen or 
buttocks).- protocol.pdf Page 51

aa.After written informed consent but before study treatment initiation , only SAEs associated with protocol-imposed interventions will be recorded. After study drug 
initiation, all AEs and SAEs will be recorded until 4 weeks after either the last administration of study drug or the Early Ter mination visit. In the event of pregnancy the 
reporting period will be 12 weeks after either the last administ ration of study drug or the Early Termination visit. If a subje ct is discontinued from the study prematurely, 
AEs and SAEs will be recorded at the Early Termination visit. 
bb.All procedures/interventions/surgeries will be recorded after info rmed consent is obtained and after the first administration o f study drug, until 4 weeks after either the last 
administration of study drug or the Early Termination visit. If a subject is discontinued from the study prematurely, all proce dures/interventions/surgeries will be recorded 
at the Early Termination visit.
cc.Contact by a study staff member to the caregiver will be required after the Week 6 visit every 4 weeks (±10 days) when there ar e no study visits or contact in the preceding 
4 weeks. During these contacts, study staff will ask about dose administration and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific  questioning. Information on all AEs and 
SAEs should be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.
dd.The 4-week safety follow up visit will be waived for subjects who enter BMN 111 study 111-302 within the 2-week period followin g last dose of study drug. If sponsor
discontinues development program at any time, a 4-week safety follow-up visit should occur.- protocol.pdf Page 52

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, In cluding Choice of Control Group
The intent and design of this Phase 3 study is to assess BMN 111 as a therapeutic option for 
the treatment of children with ACH. The age range of enrollment of children with ACH has been chosen to be 5 to < 18 years old for this study. Identification of efficacy at this age 
range is congruent with mechanism of action of BMN 111, because BMN 111 is expected to act at open epiphyseal growth plates. Therefor e, to have a potential t herapeutic benefit for 
subjects with ACH, treatment is expected to be required prior to epiphyseal growth plate 
closure. The exact chronological age at which growth plates completely fuse is variable but is thought to occur sometime in late adolescence, hence the upper limit of the age range for subjects to be enrolled in this study is < 18 years old.  
To achieve gender balance, a pproximately 50% of each gender will be enrolled, with neither 
to exceed 55%.
In terms of the study design, a randomized double-blind placebo control will be used to 
mitigate the risk of selection bi as and any potential bias in da ta collection and study conduct. 
Additionally, this design provides a framewor k for interpretation of any endpoints with a 
subjective component, eg, HRQoL and functi onal independence ques tionnaires and any 
subjective assessment of safety.

9.3.3 Use of Birth Control During and After Study Participation
Female subjects who choose to be sexually active must agree to use a highly effective 
method of birth control during the study and for 30 days after taking the last dose of study 
drug. This includes combined (estrogen and pr ogestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intr avaginal, or transdermal) ; intrauterine device 
(IUD); or intrauterine hormone-releasing systems.  
Male subjects must use a double-barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 
months after taking the last dose of study dr ug. This includes a combination of male condom 
with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with sper micide, which is considered an acceptable but 
not highly effective method. True abstinence fro m having heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with study trea tments can be used as an acceptable method of 
contraception if considered preferred and us ual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic - protocol.pdf Page 57
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 57
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptother mal, post-ovulation met hods), declaration of 
abstinence for the duration of period at risk, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. 
9.3.4 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or AssessmentSubjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without prejudice. Th e investigator must withdraw from the study 
any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A s ubject’s participation in the study may be 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit should be carried out. BioMarin must be notif ied of all subject withdrawals as soon as 
possible. 
Investigators may discontinue administratio n of BMN 111 or placebo at any time. Reasons 
for which the investigator or BioMarin will withdraw a subject from study treatment include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1. Evidence of both (1) growth plate fusion as assessed by radiographic imaging of 
distal femur and proximal tibial and (2) decreased AGV (AGV < 1.5 cm/yr) as 
assessed over a period of at least 6 months. In case of discordant imaging and AGV, 
subject continuation will be discussed with BioMarin Medical Monitor, Principal Investigator and the DMC.  
2. Subject experiences a serious  or intolerable AE due to BMN 111 as determined by the 
investigator or sponsor.
3. Subject requires medicati on or medical procedure prohibited by the protocol. 
4. Subject does not adhere to study re quirements specified in the protocol.
5. Subject is lost to follow-up.6. Subject becomes pregnant (refer to Section 10.3.1.11  for details on the reporting 
procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy).
If a subject fails to return for scheduled visits , documented effort must be made to determine 
the reason. If the subject’s caregiver cannot be reached by telephone, a certified letter should 
be sent to the subject (or the subject’s lega lly authorized represen tative, if appropriate) 
requesting that he or she contact the investig ator. A copy of this letter and any response 
should be kept in the subject study records. If the subject cannot be contacted or does not 
respond, the subject will be considered lost to follow-up.
The investigator (or designee) must explain to each subject before enrollment into the study 
that the subject’s protected health informati on obtained during the study may be shared with - protocol.pdf Page 58
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 58
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
BioMarin, regulatory agencies, and the IRB/IEC/RE B. It is the investigator’s (or designee’s) 
responsibility to obtain written permission to  use protected health information per 
country-specific regulations, such as the Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA) in the USA, from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized representative). If permission to use protected he alth information is withdrawn by the subject, 
it is the responsibility of the investigator to obt ain a written request from the subject to ensure 
that no further data will be collected from the subject. The subject will then be removed from the study. 
It is a priority of the study to maximize study subject retention and adherence to study-
specific procedures. The completeness of the study data may affect the integrity and accuracy of the study results. Therefore, subjects who discontinue study treatment should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo as many of the protocol-specified procedures and 
assessments as possible for the remainder of  the study, as long as such continued 
participation does not de trimentally affect the health, safe ty, or welfare of the subject and 
consent remains in place. It is important that following treatment discontinuation the original visit schedule is strictly adhered to.
For subjects who discontinue BMN 111 or pl acebo but remain in the study, PK and 
BMN 111 activity assessments w ill be waived completely; vital signs and clinical 
labs/biomarkers will be obtained only once at each visit subsequent to BMN 111 or placebo 
discontinuation. Pre-and post-dose designations will not apply as  the subject has discontinued 
dosing and vital sign and clinical  lab/biomarkers assessments pr eviously designated as “post-
dose” will be waived. All other a ssessments at each visit should be completed if possible and 
the subject is willing. Data from the study proced ures and assessments may be used to further 
characterize the natural progression of ACH. 
BioMarin reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time. Premature termination of 
the study may occur because of regulatory aut hority decision, a change in the opinion of the 
IRB/IEC/REB, clinical or safety reasons, or at the discretion of the Sponsor. The Sponsor 
reserves the right to discontinue the developm ent of BMN 111 at any time, or to discontinue 
participation by an individual i nvestigator or site for poor en rollment or noncompliance. Any 
decision to terminate the study will be promptly communicated to investigators, regulatory authorities, and IRB/IEC/REB. The investig ator is responsible for communicating any 
decision to terminate a study to hospital staff involved in the conduct of the study and the 
participating subjects (and their families).- protocol.pdf Page 59

9.3.5 Subject Identification 
Each subject will be assigned a unique subject identifier. This unique identifier will be on all 
eCRF pages.
9.3.6 Duration of Subject ParticipationThe planned duration of subject  participation in this study is approximately 60 weeks, 
including up to 4 weeks of screening. After screening, subjects randomized to BMN 111 or placebo will receive study treatment daily for 52 weeks. Following completion of 52 weeks, subjects will be followed for safety for an additional 4 weeks. After the Phase 3 study has been completed, subjects in both the BMN 111 treatment arm and the control arm of the 
study may be eligible to receive BMN 111 over  the longer term. If the sponsor discontinues 
development program at any time, a 4-week  safety follow-up visit should occur.  
Subjects who are not eligible to  receive BMN 111 in a separate study will return at Week 56 
for the Safety Follow-Up visit to assess for any AEs that may have occurred following completion of dosing.
Follow-up assessments and procedures should be  performed as outlined in the Study 111-301
Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 ). 
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment wi ll be asked to complete study assessments 
and procedures for the remainder of the study.  If subjects discontinue from study treatment
and decline to participate for the remainder of the study, they will be asked to return for a final follow-up visit 4 weeks after their last  study visit, and the agreement should be 
documented.
Subjects will participate in the study until completion or until one of the following occurs: 
the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued 
from the study at the discretion of the inves tigator or BioMarin ( upon consultation and in 
agreement with the investigator) or the study is terminated.
9.4 Treatments9.4.1 Treatments AdministeredBioMarin and/or its designee w ill provide the study site with a supply of IP sufficient for the 
completion of the study.
Subjects will be randomized to BMN 111 at a daily dose of 15 μg/kg or placebo for the 
duration of the study. The normal dosing schedul e is a single daily s ubcutaneous injection 
given 7 days a week.- protocol.pdf Page 60

If a recent acute illness associated with volume depletion (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) has 
not completely resolved prior to the first dose of BMN 111 or placebo, the dosing will be 
delayed until hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowed for the visit window).
9.4.1.1 BMN 111 During the study, BMN 111 will be administered as a single 15 μg/kg SC injection given 
daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible. The same injection site should not be used 2 days in a row, and shoul d be rotated between th e four injection sites 
(upper thigh, upper back of arm, abdomen or bu ttocks). Doses may be administered in any of 
the common SC areas (upper arm, thigh, abdom en, buttocks). Following administration of 
each dose, subjects will be observed for at leas t 2 hours after the injection for Days 1 to 3, 
and 30 minutes for all other days of dose adminis tration (longer if clinically indicated) either 
in the clinic by study personnel, by a hom e health nurse, or by a parent/caregiver. 
Instructions for home administration of  BMN 111 for subjects who qualify for 
parent/caregiver administration are provided in the Study Drug Injection Guide and Injection media.
9.4.1.2 PlaceboDuring the study, placebo will be administered as a single SC injection given daily at 
approximately the same time each day whenever possible. The same injection site should not 
be used 2 days in a row, and should be rotate d between the four injection sites (upper thigh, 
upper back of arm, abdomen or buttocks). Dose s may be administered in any of the common 
SC areas (upper arm, thigh, abdomen, buttock s). Following administration of each dose, 
subjects will be observed for at least 2 hours after the injection for Days 1 to 3, and 
30 minutes for all other days of dose administration (longer if clinically indicated) either in the clinic by study personnel, by a home health  nurse, or by a parent/caregiver. Instructions

Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 61
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurring tissue-expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP-53). BMN 111 is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
includes the 37 C-terminal amino acids of the human CNP-53 sequence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids (Pro-Gly) on the N-terminus, which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degradation. It is a cyclic peptide formed by an intramolecular disulfide 
bond. The molecular weight of th e purified product is 4.1 kDa.
9.4.2.1 Product Characteri stics and Labeling
The clinical drug product will be supplied in sterile, single-dose, Type I glass vials with 
coated stopper and flip-off aluminum cap. BMN 111 drug product is supplied as a 0.8-mg, or 
2-mg lyophilized, preservative-free, white to yellow powder for reconstitution with commercially sourced sterile water for injection (WFI). The reconstituted solution is colorless to yellow and contains 0.8 mg/mL to  2 mg/ml of BMN 111, as well as citric acid, 
sodium citrate, trehalose, mannitol, methioni ne, polysorbate 80, and sterile WFI. The target 
pH of the reconstituted solution is 5.5. Sterile  water for injection will be commercially 
sourced for reconstitution. All reconstitution and dose preparation steps should be performed 
as indicated in the Study Drug In jection Guide and Injection media. 
BMN 111-placebo lyophilized product will be supplie d in sterile, single-dose, Type I glass 
vials with coated stopper and flip-off alu minum cap. The placebo is designed to be 
comparable in appearance to the drug product an d contains all of the components of the drug 
product including commercially sourced st erile WFI except the drug substance.
The BMN 111 or placebo kit label includes the following information: the contents, 
directions, lot number, quantity, subject ID, vial ID, investigator, the required storage 
conditions, a precautionary statement, the ex piry date, the study number, and BioMarin

9.4.4 Directions for Administration
Refer to the Study Drug Injection Guide fo r complete BMN 111 or placebo preparation 
instructions.  
The injection will be administered as a daily dose of BMN 111 15 μg/kg or placebo given as 
a single subcutaneous injection. The dose shoul d be given at approx imately the same time 
every day whenever possible. Following admin istration of each dose, subjects will be 
observed for at least 2 hours after the injecti on for Days 1 to 3, and 30 minutes for all other 
dose administration days. Subjects should have ad equate food intake prior to dosing. In the 
hour prior to injection, all subjects should have attempted to drink approximately 
8-10 ounces or 240-300 mL of fluid (eg, water, milk, juice, etc).
Caregivers will administer BMN 111 or placebo at home once approved by the investigator 
and adequate training is demonstrated. Inst ructions on how to complete and document the 
training can be found in the Study Referen ce Manual. A caregiver will be eligible to 
administer BMN 111 or placebo if he or sh e meets all of the following criteria:
xThe subject has been on a stable dosing regimen for a minimum of 3 days 
xPI has approved adminis tration of BMN 111 or placebo by the caregiver
xThe caregiver has completed the Administr ation Training conduc ted by qualified 
study site personnel and has been observed by  the study site personnel to be able to 
adequately prepare the proper dose and perform the injections safely
For dosing between planned clinic visits prio r to caregiver approval, a home health nurse 
may administer BMN 111 or placebo, or subject s may be administered BMN 111 or placebo 
in the clinic by study staff or trained caregiver.  
A subject’s suitability for continued at-home drug administration will be evaluated by the 
investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical M onitor if a subject experiences a Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or higher AE that is considered 
possibly or probably drug-related, and/or a hy persensitivity reaction during the study.  
Contact by a study staff member to the caregiver will be required after the Week 6 visit every 
4 weeks (± 10 days) when there are no study visits or contact in the preceding 4 weeks. During these contacts, study staff will ask th e caregiver about dose administration and seek 
information on AEs and SAEs by specific que stioning. Information on all AEs and SAEs 
should be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.  - protocol.pdf Page 63
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 63

The investigator or the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor may request that BMN 111 or placebo 
administration by the caregiver be halted at any time and that injections be administered by 
study site personnel or a home health nurse.
9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment GroupsSubjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, ie, injection with placebo: 15 μg/kg of BMN 111, 
using an interactive voice/web response syst em. The randomization will be based on Tanner 
Stage (Stage 1, or > Stage 1) and sex. An independent third party ve ndor will develop the randomizati on schedule so that BioMarin 
and site personnel are blinded to treatment assignments.

9.4.7 BlindingAn independent third-party ve ndor will develop the randomizati on schedule so that BioMarin 
and site personnel will not know treatment assignments. BMN 111 or placebo will be labeled 
with the study number and a unique identificati on number. Subjects and th e participating site 
members will be blinded to the two study treatments (15 μg/kg BMN 111 or placebo).
The investigator and other members of site staf f involved with the study will remain blinded 
to the treatment randomization c ode during the assembly procedure. In the event of a medical 
emergency, the investigator may contact the S ponsor’s Medical Monitor or other authorized 
BioMarin representative to discuss the necessity of unblinding the subject’s treatment 
assignment. The blinded treatment  assignments will be directly accessible to the investigator 
should a subject need to be unblinded in an emergency. If unblinding occurs, the investigator - protocol.pdf Page 64
CBI
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 64

or study pharmacist must record the reason for unblinding, as well as the date and time of the 
event. Corresponding information will be r ecorded on the eCRF by the investigator. 
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant MedicationsAll medications (prescription, over-the-counter and herbal), and nutritional supplements 30 
days prior to screening and throughout the study will be recorded on the designated eCRF. The investigator may prescribe additional medi cations during the study, as long as the 
prescribed medication is not prohibited by the protocol. In the event of an emergency, any 
needed medications may be prescribed without  prior approval, but the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor must be notified of the use of an y contraindicated medi cations immediately 
thereafter. Any concomitant me dications added or discontinue d during the study should be 
recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medication information will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 ). Restricted medications are listed in 
Table 9.3.2.1.
9.4.9 Treatment ComplianceSubjects will be instructed to return all us ed and unused BMN 111 or placebo kits at each 
study visit. Subject compliance with the dosing regimen will be assessed by reconciliation of the used and unused vials. The quantity dispensed,  returned, used, lost, etc must be recorded 
on the dispensing log provided for the study.
The date, time, and volume of each dose of  BMN 111 or placebo administered to each 
subject must be recorded. These data will be used to assess treatment compliance. 
9.5 Investigational Product Acco untability (BMN 111 or Placebo)
The investigator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates 
and quantities) of IP(s) received, subjects to whom IP is dispensed (subject-by-subject kit specific accounting), and IP lost or accidentally  or deliberately destroyed. The investigator or 
designee must retain all unused or expired study supplies until the study monitor (on-site CRA) has confirmed th e accountability data.
9.5.1 Return and Disposition of Clinical SuppliesUnused BMN 111 or placebo must be kept in a secure location for accountability and 
reconciliation by the study monitor. The investigator or designee must provide an explanation for any destroyed or missing BMN 111 or placebo kits/vials.  
Unused BMN 111 or placebo may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard operating 
procedures, but only after BioMarin has grante d approval for destruction. The study monitor 
must account for all BMN 111 or placebo kits/vials  in a formal reconciliation process prior to - protocol.pdf Page 65

destruction. The site must document all BMN 111 or placebo destroyed on site, and 
documentation must be provided to BioMarin and retained in the i nvestigator study files. If a 
site is unable to destroy BMN 111 or placebo ap propriately, the site can, upon request, return 
unused BMN 111 or placebo to the BioMarin cont racted facility. The return of all BMN 111 
or placebo kits/vials must also  be documented and accounted for per instructions provided by 
BioMarin.
All BMN 111 or placebo and relate d materials should be store d, inventoried, reconciled, and 
destroyed or returned according to applicab le state and federal regulations and study 
procedures.
Caregivers of subjects who qualify for hom e administration of study BMN 111 or placebo 
will be provided with instructi ons for returning used and unused kits and the proper disposal 
of any ancillary supplies. 
9.6 Dietary or Other Protocol RestrictionsBMN 111 will be administered as a single daily dose of 15 μg/kg SC injection given daily at 
approximately the same time each day whenever  possible. Placebo will be administered as a 
single SC injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible. Following administration of each dose, subjects will be observed for at least 2 hours after the 
injection for observation for Days 1 to 3, and 30 minutes for all other days of dose 
administration. 
Subjects should have an adequate  food intake. In the hour prio r to injection, all subjects 
should have attempted to dr ink approximately 8-10 oun ces or 240-300 mL of fluid 
(eg, water, milk, juice).
9.7 Demographic Data and Medical History Demographic data and a detailed medical history will be obtained at Screening. This medical 
history should elicit all major illne sses, diagnoses, and surgeries th at the subject has ever had; 
any prior or existing medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety; and evaluation for knee, thigh, hip or groin pain, or change in gait/activity.  
9.8 Biological Parental Standing HeightStanding height of the subject’s biological parents will be assessed via height measurement 
or stated height. Height meas urement can be done at any point in the study. Prior to the 
measurement being taken, each parent is required to complete an ICF specific to parent height assessment. The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the study. If the biological parent is  not available during the course of the study to - protocol.pdf Page 66

Coping, Beliefs about Height, Future and Effe cts on Parents) and has both child self-report 
and parent-report versions.
9.12.3.4.3 Functional Inde pendence Measure
The WeeFIM instrument is an assessment t ool that measures func tional performance across
three domains (self-care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland, 2011; Ireland, 2012 ).
The WeeFIM instrument has been used in prev ious research in children with ACH, and has 
identified ongoing limitations in functional performance across these domains extending beyond the age of 7 years ( Ireland, 2011 ). Because the WeeFIM considers the child’s 
performance from a caregiver’s perspective ( Ireland, 2012 ), this tool in turn gives an 
indication of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of children with ACH.
9.12.4 Exploratory Efficacy Variables9.12.4.1 Sleep Sub-StudyGiven that sleep apnea is a fi nding in children with ACH ( Waters, 1993, ) and has 
implications on functional and health outcomes, an optional sleep sub-study will be performed in a limited number of qualified sleep centers for a subset of subjects. A sleep testing device will be used to assess the presence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing by measurement of blood oxygen saturati on, pulse rate, and airflow during overnight 
monitoring. Assessment of episodes of sleep apnea will include, but may not be limited to, the number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour (Apnea/Hypopnea Index). - protocol.pdf Page 69

9.12.4.2 BMN 111 Activity Biomarkers
Biomarkers may include but are not limited to assessment of changes in bone and collagen 
metabolism and BMN 111 bioactivity. BioMarin or designee will perform analysis, and samples may also be used for assay development.   
Samples for blood and/or urine bi omarkers will be collected at the time points presented in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 ). Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual for instructions 
regarding obtaining and shipping samples. The sample type will also be included in the Study Laboratory Manual.
9.12.4.3 Biomarker Research Sample AnalysesAll samples collected in this study may be us ed for exploratory biom arker research once the 
primary use has been completed.
For each portion of the blood and urine samples reserved for protocol -specified analyses, 
there may be multiple sample a liquots. Once samples have been successfully analyzed during 
the study, unused sample portions may be used  during the study for assay development or 
other purposes stated in this section. 
9.12.4.4 Genomic Biomarker AnalysisWhile the inherited FGFR3 muta tions associated with achondropl asia are well characterized, 
disease phenotype in monogeneic diseases is ofte n modified by variants in other genes. To 
identify and study genetic variants that ma y modify achondroplasia, a whole blood sample 
will be collected. Exploratory genomics will include, but are not limited to NPR-B, BRAF, and other genes associated with CNP signalin g. Exploratory genomic analysis may inform 
understanding of the BMN 111 mechanism of  action in achondroplasia. Exploratory 
genomics will not be c onducted without express consent from the subject and his/her legally 
authorized representative (parent or legal guardian).   
9.12.5 Pharmacokinetics VariablesFull PK samples are collected pre-dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 
45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), 120 (± 5 min) minutes post dose at Day 1, Week 26, and Week 52 visits. Partial PK samples are collected pre-dose and at 15 (± 2 min), 
30 (± 5 min), and 60 (± 5 min) minutes post dose at Week 13 and Week 39 visits.
Whenever possible, the following PK parame ters for subjects randomized to the BMN 111 
treatment group will be  estimated by non-compartmental analysis:

9.12.6 Safety Variables Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant changes in 
vital signs, physical examination, ECG, X-ray/DXA assessments of bone morphology, 
quality, and growth of the extremities and spine (X-rays only), laboratory test results (urinalysis, chemistry, hematology), and CBCL assessments. Imaging (X-ray/DXA assessments), hip monitoring, biomarker, immunog enicity, salivary cortisol, serum prolactin, 
follicle stimulating (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and physical measurement data will be utilized for safety-related reviews and analysis. FSH/LH will be monitored for all subjects > 8 years of age, and for subjects at Ta nner stage 2 (whichever is earlier). Additional 
assessments will be c onducted to evaluate changes fro m baseline in bone metabolism. 
9.12.6.1 Adverse EventsThe occurrence of AEs will be assessed continuou sly from the time the subject receives study 
drug. The determination, evalua tion and reporting of AEs will be  performed as outlined in 
Section 10. Assessments of AEs will occur at the time points shown in the Schedule of 
Events Table 9.1.1 ). Additionally, contact by a study staff member to the caregiver will be 
required approximately every 4 weeks (+/- 10 days) after the Week 6 visit when there are no 
study visits or contact within in the preceding 4 weeks. During these contacts, study staff will 
ask the caregiver about dose administration and seek information on AEs and SAEs by 
specific questioning. Information on all AEs and SAEs should be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and on the AE eCRF.  
9.12.6.2 Procedures During the StudyAll procedures/intervention/surgery will be recorded after informed consent is obtained and 
after the first administration of study drug, until 4 weeks after either the last administration of - protocol.pdf Page 71

study drug or the Early Termination visit. If a subject is discontinued from the study 
prematurely, all procedures/intervention/surgery will be recorded at the Early Termination visit.
9.12.6.3 Bone Morphology, Bone Mineral Dens ity, Bone Mineral Content and Bone 
Age
The effect of BMN 111 on bone morphology and pathology will be assessed by X-ray and 
bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) by DXA. Bone growth and 
age will be assessed by the means of X-rays of wrist/hand. 
9.12.6.4 Imaging Assessment Procedu res (per Schedule of Events)
Imaging assessment procedures for all visits must be performed using the same instruments.
xLeft hand and wrist X-ray, posterior-ant erior (PA) view, to assess bone age ( Greulich, 
1971, ;Tanner, 1975, ).
xBilateral X-rays of lower extremity (anterior-posterior [AP] and lateral views) to 
assess growth plates. 
xHip imaging via pelvis X-ray to identify hip pathology if clinically indicated by 
clinical hip assessment.
xLumbar spine X-rays to measure changes from baseline in bone morphology and 
pathology.  
xDXA scan (whole body less head, spine) to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and 
bone mineral content (BMC). 
Additional imaging may be conduc ted should there be any issues or concerns with the 
subject’s imaging assessments; one example is a situation in which the lower extremity X-rays are not sufficient to determine whethe r the subject’s distal, femoral, and proximal 
tibia growth plates are closed. Imaging assessments will be collected and interpreted by a central reader. If clinically significant abnorma lities are noted, the investig ator or designee is 
required to assess whether it is a ppropriate to report an AE and if the subject should continue 
in the study. Refer to the vendor Imaging Guidelines for detailed imaging assessment 
requirements and procedures.
9.12.6.5 Clinical Laboratory AssessmentsSpecific visits for obtaining c linical laboratory assessment samples are provided in the

9.12.6.9 Vital Signs, Physical Examinations a nd Other Observations Related to Safety 
9.12.6.9.1 Vital SignsVital signs assessed pre-dose will include seated  systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) measured in mm Hg, heart ra te in beats per minute, respiration rate in 
breaths per minute, and temperature in degrees  Celsius (°C). All treatment visits have 
pre-dose vital sign assessments. Post-dose meas urements include heart rate and BP. For all 
dosing visits, assessment frequency is detailed in Table 9.12.6.9.1.1 (see Schedule of Events, 
Table 9.1.1).
At Screening, after at least 5 minutes of rest , subject’s BP is taken in sitting position. Then 
the subject will stand and BP will be taken again at approximately 1 and 3 minutes after standing. At other visits, vital sign measurements are taken once per time point in a sitting position after at least 5 minutes of rest. Heart rate  should be taken at each time point that BP 
is measured. When blood samples and BP asse ssments are scheduled at the same time or 
within the same time window, BP should be m easured before blood samples are drawn. If a
BP measurement must be taken after a blood dr aw, ensure adequate analgesia for the blood 
draw and wait several minutes before measuring BP. Pre-dose vital signs should always be 
taken and recorded prior to pre-dose blood draw. Vital signs may be monitored more 
frequently or for longer duration pos t-dose as clinically indicated.  
If a subject has symptoms potentially consistent with hypotension or a decrease in SBP of 20 
mm Hg or more from pre-dose SBP, blood pressure  and heart rate (HR) should be measured
and recorded approximately every 15 minutes  for the first hour and every 30 minutes
thereafter until the systolic BP returns to pre-dose systolic BP (or within the normal range for this subject as defined by PI) and symptoms (if present) resolve. If the hypotension resolves 
within the first hour and returns to the normal range, additional BP monitoring as described 
above is not required. Detailed guidance for blood  pressure measurements is provided in the 
Blood Pressure Instrument and Technique Guidelines.- protocol.pdf Page 75

9.12.6.10 Mitigating the Risk of Potential Hypotension 
Study personnel and caregivers should be made  aware of the potential risk of hypotension 
with BMN 111 administration. Subjects must be well hydrated and at a minimum eat a light 
snack prior to administration of BMN 111 or placebo. In the hour prior to injection, all 
subjects should have attempte d to drink approximately 8-10 ounces or 240-300 mL of fluid 
(eg, water, milk, juice). If a recent acute illness associated with volume depletion (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) has not completely resolved prior to the first dose of BMN 111 or placebo, BMN 111 or placebo dosing may be dela yed until hydration stat us has improved (up 
to the maximum period allowed for the screening window).
Caregivers should be trained to observe a nd recognize the symptoms of dehydration 
(eg, from fever, vomiting, diarrhea) and contact the investigator prior to BMN 111 or placebo 
administration if dehydration is suspected. Site  personnel and caregivers  should be trained to 
identify the symptoms of hypotension and, if they occur, should implement first-aidstrategies at the discretion of the investigator  such as having the subject lie down supine, 
elevating the lower extremities, and administering fluids. For guidelines on how to report adverse events associated with  hypotension, refer to Section 10.- protocol.pdf Page 76

9.12.6.11 Electrocardiography
A standard 12-lead ECG will include heart rate , rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, 
and anatomic abnormalities. All ECGs will be performed in triplicate at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1). ECGs will be performed post-dose on study day visits 
at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre-dose. On days 
when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs s hould be performed within a 5-minute window 
prior to 30-minute PK assessment.  
9.12.6.12 Hip Clinical AssessmentThe hip clinical assessment should be complete d by an appropriately qualified health care 
professional at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1). Medical 
history will be obtained to evaluate for hip, thigh, or knee pain, or change in gait. The physical exam (including observation of gait when possible) identifies and evaluates any 
changes in hip function or pain with asse ssment of active and passive range of motion. 
Changes from baseline may trigger further eval uation based on the investigator’s clinical 
assessment, which may include hip imaging a nd/or orthopedic consultation. If findings on 
clinical hip exam are determined to be clinically significant by the investigator and inconsultation with Sponsor’s Medical Monitor a nd orthopedic specialist (if needed), the DMC 
will be notified of AEs resu lting from clinically signific ant abnormal hip monitoring 
assessments. DMC may provide  recommendations as to if/when BMN 111 or placebo

9.12.6.14 Pediatric Blood Volume
Clinical labs and immunogenicity samples are necessary to perform to adequate safety 
assessment in this study. The objectives of testing pharmacodynamics biomarkers are to demonstrate biologic activity of BMN 111 and to understand the impact of immune 
responses on drug activity; and for exploratory bl ood biomarkers, to investigate the effects of 
treatment on changes in bone metabolism and endog enous CNP production. 
To minimize blood collection volumes, assay tech nologies were chosen that are capable of 
sensitively detecting analytes using the lo west possible volume of blood for analysis. 
Additionally, assays capable of detecting an alytes in urine rather than blood have been 
selected where possible. Bl ood volume for testing has been reduced to the minimum 
necessary for adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of BMN 111.
9.12.6.15 Anti- BMN 111 Immunogenicity AssessmentsSubjects randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo will undergo immunogenicity testing. 
Blood (serum) samples for immunogenicity assess ments will be collected at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 ) and testing performed using validated 
assays. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) testing will be performed on Baseline and TAb positive samples. 
Scheduled samples will be tested in one or more of the following assessments:
xAnti- BMN 111 total antibody (TAb).
xAnti-BMN 111 antibody cross-reactivity with endogenous CNP, ANP, and 
BNP (TAb).
xAnti- BMN 111 Nab.
Testing for the presence of cross-reactive an tibodies that bind to endogenous CNP, ANP, or 
BNP and for the presence of BMN 111 NAbs will be performed on baseline samples and anti- BMN 111 TAb-positive samples. Baseline NAb sample and cross-reactive TAb sample testing will be done at any time  prior to the end of study.- protocol.pdf Page 78

9.12.6.16 Ad Hoc Safety Assessments
Samples for total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and drug-specific IgE testing will be drawn on 
Day 1 and in the event of a significant hypersensitivity AE, or at the discretion of the investigator and/or BioMarin. A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that is grade 3 or higher, requires temporary or perm anent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined 
to be significant at the discretion of investigat or and/or BioMarin (excluding reactions that 
are solely a localized injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an unscheduled safety visit should occur no later than 48 hour s of the start of the reaction, including 
inspection of the injection site and clinical laboratory tests. 
Blood (serum) samples should be collected and tested in one or more of the following 
assessments:
xDrug-specific IgE
xTotal IgE
xSerum tryptase
If feasible, a sample for drug-specific IgE s hould be drawn no sooner than 8 hours after the 
event start time or before the next dose. A sa mple for total IgE and serum tryptase should 
also be drawn within 1 hour of the start of th e event when possible or during the unscheduled 
safety visit. 
A localized injection site reaction is defined as skin signs or symptoms restricted to one 
affected primary location, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the site  of injection. Management of such localized 
reactions should be determined by the investigat or’s clinical judgment in consultation with 
the Sponsor’s Medical M onitor (if warranted).
9.12.6.17 HPA Axis AssessmentsTo address potential effects of BMN 111 on activ ation of the hypothala mic pituitary adrenal

case, the procedures performed at the unscheduled visit will be completed on a case-by-case basis .
9.12.6.19 Medical PhotographyInjection site photos are optional, but sites ar e strongly encouraged to take photos on Day 1, 
Week 26, Week 52, and Early Termination visit. Du ring a scheduled visit, if photos are being 
planned, photos of the injection s ite will be taken in e ither of these two situations: 1) If an 
injection site reaction (ISR) occurs, photos will be taken for each ISR when it becomes 
apparent (or at onset), at most severe, and then post resolution. The time of the post-
resolution photo may not be the same as the time th e AE resolved, and this is expected. If the 
visit has ended and the ISR has not resolved, the subject is not  expected to remain on site 
until ISR resolves. If the ISR is ongoing at the end of the visit, record as an ongoing AE. 2) If the subject has not had an ISR by the end of th e study visit, a photo will still be taken of the 
injection site used on that day. The site is instructed to document the absence of an ISR on 
the injection administration eCRF. In between vis its, if an ISR worsens or changes in pattern, 
then the subject should have an unscheduled s ite visit. During the visit, photos of the 
injection site with the ISR may be taken. Also, injection sites may be photographed if there is 
a new ISR or at any other time at the discretion/medical judgment of the investigator or as recommended by the sponsor. - protocol.pdf Page 80

10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Safety Parameters and Definitions
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring  and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs; 
measurement of protocol-s pecified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-defin ed events of special 
interest that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.
10.1.1 Adverse EventsFor this protocol, a reportable AE is any unt oward medical occurrence (eg, sign, symptom, 
illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study-drug or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following:
xAEs not previously observed in the subject  that emerge during the course of the 
study.
xPre-existing medical conditions judged by the investigator to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the study.
xComplications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedur es, medication washout, or no-treatment 
run-in).
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study-drug and the AE.
10.1.2 Serious Ad verse Events
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets one or more of the 
following criteria:
xIs fatal.
xIs life threatening 
Note: Life-threatening refers to an event that places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a r eaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.
xRequires or prolongs in patient hospitalization.  
xResults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.- protocol.pdf Page 81
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 81
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
xIs a congenital anomaly or birth defect in th e child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy.
xIs an important medical event or reacti on – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or require inte rvention to prevent one of the above 
consequences (eg, anaphylaxis).
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for SAEs should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs.
10.1.3 Events of Special InterestThe following events of special interest (EOSI)  need to be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of site awareness, irrespective of seriousness, severity or causality: 
xFracture
xSlipped capital femoral epiphysis
xAvascular necrosis or osteonecrosis
10.2 Methods and Timing for Capturin g and Assessing Safety Parameters
10.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting PeriodThe study AE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported. After informed consent is obtained a nd the first administration of study drug, all 
non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begi ns and continues until 4 weeks following 
either the last administration of study drug or the Early Termination visit, whichever is longer (refer to Section 12.4). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of, SAEs is 
provided in Section 10.1.2 .
10.2.2 Eliciting Adverse EventsInvestigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject contact by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examina tion. Information on all AEs and SAEs should be
recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.
10.2.3 Assessment of Seriousne ss, Severity, and Causality 
The investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified medical designee will 
assess AEs for severity, relationship to stud y drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.1.2
for SAE definitions). These assessments must be made by a study clinician with the training and authority to make a diagnosis (eg, MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, orDDS).- protocol.pdf Page 82

10.2.3.1 Seriousness
The investigator will assess if an AE shoul d be classified as “serious” based on the 
seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2 . Seriousness serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.
10.2.3.2 SeveritySeverity (as in mild, mode rate, or severe headache) is not e quivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on subject/event outcome or  action criteria usually associat ed with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. The severity of each will be assessed using the 
defined categories in Table 10.2.3.2.1.
The investigator will determine the severity of each AE and SAE [and EOSI, if applicable] 
using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CT CAE v4. Adverse events that do not have a 
corresponding CTCAE term will be  assessed according to the general guidelines for grading 
used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below.
Table 10.2.3.2.1: Adverse Event Gr ading (Severity) Scale
Grade Description
1Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
2Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental ADLa
3Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening: hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADLb
4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 4 and 5 AEs 
should always be 
reported as SAEs5Death related to AE
aInstrumental ADL refers to the following examples: preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money.
bSelf-care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dr essing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet, 
taking medications, not bedridden.
10.2.3.3 Causality 
The investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE CRF. To ensu re consistency of causality assessments, 
investigators should apply the guidance in Table 10.2.3.3.1 .- protocol.pdf Page 83

Not Related xExposure to the IP has not occurred
OR
xThe administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time
OR
xThe AE is considered likely to be re lated to an etiology other than the 
use of the IP; that is, there are no facts, evidence, or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship to the IP.
Related xThe administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time

The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process. Regard less of the investigator’s  assessment of causality for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will prom ptly evaluate all re ported SAEs against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new 
safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities. 
10.3 Procedures for Reco rding Adverse Events 
10.3.1 Recording Adverse Events on an eCRF
Investigators should use precise medical ter minology when recording AEs or SAEs on an 
eCRF. Avoid colloquialis ms and abbreviations.
Record only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (eg, nausea and 
vomiting should not be recorded in the same  entry, but as 2 separate entries).
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferre d terms will be assigned by the Sponsor to the 
original terms entered on the eCRF, using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.
10.3.1.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and SymptomsUsing accepted medical terminology, enter th e diagnosis (if known). If not known, enter the 
most medically significant sign(s) and/or symp tom(s). If a diagnosis subsequently becomes 
available, then this diagnosis should be entered on the AE form, replacing the original entries 
where appropriate.
10.3.1.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other ev ents (eg, cascade events) should be identified 
by their primary cause. For example, if seve re diarrhea is known to have resulted in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. However, medically important events that may be linked an d/or separated in time should be recorded as 
independent events on the eCRF. For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, 
both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF. 
10.3.1.3 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse EventsA persistent AE is one that extends con tinuously, without resolution, between subject 
evaluation time points. Such an event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its 
severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF).
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but 
then subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of  the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF. - protocol.pdf Page 85
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 85
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
10.3.1.4 Hypotension
If an asymptomatic drop in bl ood pressure meets the protocol definition of AE per clinical 
judgment of the reporter, report the event as “b lood pressure decreased.” If the drop in blood 
pressure is associated with signs or symptoms, complete the symptomatic hypotension eCRF and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE eCRF: If a unifying diagnosis is available to explain the event of hypotensi on, report the diagnosis as an AE and capture 
signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hy potension eCRF page. If no other unifying 
diagnosis is available, report “hypotension” as  the event and capture signs and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. 
10.3.1.5 Injection Site ReactionsIf an injection site reaction is associated with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (eg, redness at injection site, AE is injection site redness). If the injection site reaction is associated with multiple signs or sy mptoms, report injecti on site reaction as the
adverse event on the AE page, and individual signs and symptoms will be reported on the ISR eCRF page (eg, if the subject experience s redness and induration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, and in the corres ponding Injection eCRF page, report erythema 
and induration).
10.3.1.6 Abnormal Laboratory ValuesA data transfer file from the central laboratory will provide laboratory test results.Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF.- protocol.pdf Page 86
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 86
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be docum ented as AE if it is not otherwise refuted 
by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality and any one or mo re of the following conditions 
are met:
xAccompanied by clinical symptoms.
xLeading to a change in study medication (eg, interruption or permanent 
discontinuation).  
xRequiring a change in concomitant therapy (eg, addition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment).
xThe abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity.
xThe abnormality is of a degree that require s active management (eg, discontinuation 
of study drug, more frequent follow-up asse ssments, further diagnostic investigation).
This applies to any protocol and non-protocol specif ied safety and efficacy laboratory result 
from tests performed after the first dose of stud y medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clinical significance criteria.
This does not apply to any abnormal laborator y result that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type explicitly exempted by the protocol, or those which are a result of an AE that has already 
been reported.
10.3.1.7 Pre-existing ConditionsA pre-existing condition is one that is present at the screening visit. Such conditions should 
be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF. 
A pre-existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the c ondition worsens during the study period. It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre- existing condition has changed by including 
applicable language in the verbatim description of the event (eg, more frequent headaches).
10.3.1.8 General Physical Examination FindingsAt screening, any clinically significant abno rmality should be recorded as a pre-existing 
condition (refer to Section 10.3.1.7 ). During the study, any new clinically significant findings 
and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination th at meet the definition of an AE 
(or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF. - protocol.pdf Page 87
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 87
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
10.3.1.9 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalizati on should be documented 
and reported as an SAE unless specifically instru cted otherwise in this protocol (refer to 
Section 10.1.2 ).
There are some hospitalization scenarios that do not require reporting as an SAE when there 
is no occurrence of an AE. These scenarios include planned hospita lizations or prolonged 
hospitalizations to:
xPerform a protocol-mandated procedure.
xUndergo a diagnostic or elective surgical pr ocedure planned prior to study enrollment 
or for a pre-existing medical condition that has not changed.
xReceive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication. 
10.3.1.10 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the AE  reporting period (refer to Section 10.2.1 ), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF a nd expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE.
When recording a death, the event or conditi on that caused or contributed to the fatal 
outcome should be recorded as the single medi cal concept on the eCRF. If the cause of death 
is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” 
or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the eCRF. If th e death is attributed to progression of the 
disease or condition being studied, record prog ression of achondroplasia as the SAE term on 
the eCRF.
10.3.1.11 PregnancyAlthough not an AE per se, pregnancy in either a subject or the partne r of a subject taking 
trial medication should be re ported to facilitate outcome monitoring by the Sponsor. 
The reporting period for pregnancy in a subject or partner begins following the first dose of 
study drug and continues until 12 weeks after the final dose of study drug. Pregnancy events must be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy by faxing the 
Pregnancy Form in the study reference materials to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV). In addition, pregnancy in a subject is also reported on the End of Study eCRF. The investigator must make every effort to  follow the subject through resolution of the 
pregnancy (delivery or termin ation) and to report the reso lution on the Pregnancy Follow-up
in the eCRF. In the event of pregnancy in the partner of a study subject, the investigator - protocol.pdf Page 88
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 88
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected 
health information.
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, shou ld always be classified as an SAE (as the 
Sponsor considers these to be medically significant), recorded on the eCRF, and 
expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an SAE.
10.4 Reporting RequirementsThe Sponsor is responsible for identifying, pr eparing, and reporting all suspected unexpected
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees, and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.
10.4.1 Expedited Reporting RequirementsAll SAEs that occur during the course of the AE Reporting Period (refer to Section 10.2.1 ), 
whether or not considered re lated to study drug, must be reported by faxing the 
study-specific SAE Report Form to BPV within  24 hours of the site becoming aware of the
event. Each SAE must also be reported on th e appropriate eCRF. Investigators should not 
wait to collect information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of an SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that investigators submit any information requested by BioMarin  as soon as it becomes available.
The study SAE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported. After informed consent is obtained a nd the first administration of study drug, all 
SAEs must be reported through 4 weeks following either the last administration of study drug 
or the Early Termination vi sit, whichever is longer. 
10.4.2 IRB/EC Reporting RequirementsReporting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC/REB will be done in compliance with the standard 
operating procedures and policie s of the IRB/IEC/REB and with applicable regulatory 
requirements. Adequate documen tation must be obtained by BioMarin showing that the 
IRB/IEC/REB was properly and promptly notified as required.- protocol.pdf Page 89
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 89
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
10.5 Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events
The investigator should follow all unresolved AEs SAEs until the events are resolved or have 
stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the AE /SAE. Outcome of AEs and resolution of SAEs 
(with dates) should be documented on the AE e CRF and in the subject’s medical record to 
facilitate source data verification.
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by  telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details  (eg, hospital discharge summary, consultant 
report, autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report.
10.6 Post-Study Adverse EventsAt the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the 
investigator and/or to BPV directly, any s ubsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.
The investigator should notify the study Sponsor  of any death or SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or  terminated study participati on, if the investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have been relate d to prior study treatment. The Sponsor should 
also be notified if the investigator should beco me aware of the development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subseque ntly conceived offspring of a subject that participated in 
this study. 
10.7 Urgent Safety MeasuresThe regulations governing clinical trials state th at the sponsor and investigator are required to 
take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards that may affect the safety of subject s, and th at the appropriate regula tory bodies should be 
notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of th e circumstances, notab ly the occurrence of 
any new event relating to the conduct of the tria l or the development of  the investigational 
medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the 
sponsor and the investigator sh all take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the 
subjects against any immediate hazard. The spons or shall forthwith inform the competent 
authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the IRB/IEC/REB is notified at the same time.” 
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, pr eparing and reporting all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees - protocol.pdf Page 90
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 90
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
and investigators in accordance with the requirements identified in the Clinical Trials 
Regulations.
The reporting period for these events, which may require the implementatio n of urgent safety 
measures, is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last 
study visit or at the Early Termination visit. Investigators are required to report any events 
which may require the implementation of urge nt safety measures to BioMarin within 
24 hours. 
Examples of situations that may require urge nt safety measures include discovery of the 
following:
xImmediate need to revise the IP adminis tration (eg, modified dose amount, frequency 
not defined in protocol).
xLack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management.
xDiscovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements.

11 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS
The parameters to be evaluated in this study reflect the combined experience in the clinical 
study 111-202 and reflect the need to further de fine the efficacy and safety profile of 
BMN 111 in the context of ACH, a complex skeletal dysplasia disorder with multiple clinical manifestations.
The efficacy parameters to be evaluated in this  study reflect the sponsor’s experience in the 
clinical study 111-202 and of previous studies of approved growth products ( Kemp, 2009; 
Bright,2009 ). Evaluation of the parameters proposed in  this study will document the effect of 
BMN 111 treatment on AGV in children with ACH a nd are relevant to assessing the medical 
complications of ACH in this patient population.  
The PK assessments in this study are generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant.
Bone-related biomarkers and ot her biochemical markers of the pharmacological activity of 
BMN 111 in the blood or urine, as well as geno mic biomarkers, are ex ploratory assessments.- protocol.pdf Page 92

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
BioMarin personnel or designees will visit the st udy site prior to initiation of the study to 
review with the site personnel information about the IP, protocol and other regulatory
document requirements, any applicable ra ndomization procedures, source document 
requirements, eCRFs, monitoring  requirements, and procedures for reporting AEs, including 
SAEs. 
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with 
regulatory documentation, with a focus on accura te and complete reco rding of data on CRFs 
from source documents, adherence to protocol, randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting 
and drug accountability records. 
Sites will enter study data into eCRFs into the study electronic data capture (EDC) system. 
Data Quality Control will be performed by BioMarin Clinical Data Management or designee through implementation of  quality control checks specified in the study data management 
plan and edit check specifications. Additional subject-reported study data may be entered 
into the study EDC system via electronic diary. - protocol.pdf Page 103

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details on the planned statistical 
analysis and the final version must be finalized prior to database lock. The SAP will overrule any differences with the analytical plan descri bed in the protocol . Unless otherwise stated, 
all analyses will be performed using SAS v. 9.4.
14.1.1 Interim AnalysesNo formal futility/efficacy interim analyses are planned for this study.14.1.2 Procedures for Accounting for Missing, Unused and Spurious DataBecause the completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study 
analysis, every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurate and timely data collection and, therefore, avoid missing da ta. In addition, a subject who prematurely discontinues study 
drug should be asked if they ar e willing to continue to  participate in the study assessments for 
remaining duration of the study, as long as in the judgment of the investigator such continued 
participation would not detrimentally affect the health, sa fety, or welfare of the subject.
No missing data will be imputed for any analysis, except for unless otherwise specified for 
the efficacy analyses or for the missing dates for AEs and concomitant medications. Missing dates or partially missing dates will be imputed conservatively to ensure that an AE is considered treatment emergent and has th e longest possible duration, if the partial 
information available indicates that the AE is likely treatment emergent. 
Additional details regarding the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP. 14.2 Efficacy AnalysisAll efficacy analysis will be done on th e efficacy population defined in Section 14.7.1
14.2.1 Primary Efficacy AnalysisThe primary efficacy endpoint is the cha nge from baseline in AGV at the 12–month time 
point. For a given interval [Date1, Da te2], the AGV is defined as follows:
where the interval length in days is calcul ated as Date2 – Date1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals:

The baseline of the AGV is established in th e natural history stud y of Study111-901, based 
on the standing height measurements in the last 6 months prior to enrollment to Study 111-301.  
The primary estimand is the difference in mean change from baseline in AGV at 12-month 
time point between the BMN 111 group and th e placebo group. The estimand is defined on 
all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or 
placebo. The least-squares (LS) means of the change from baseline in AGV at 12-month will 
be used to estimate the primary estima nd for the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  model, with fixed-effect terms including 
treatment group, sex, and Tanner stage, and age and the baseline AGV as covariates. The 
following primary hypothesis will be tested (two-tailed):

Subjects who discontinue from the study drug w ill be encouraged to remain in the study and
their non-missing height measurements will continue  to be used in calculating the AGV and
to be included in the analysis per intend to tr eat principle. In the event that missing data does
occur despite all efforts, missing standing height will be imputed based on multipleimputation (MI) with pattern-mixture models ( Little 1993; Molenberghs 2007 ) implemented 
in Proc MI of SAS where the missing, unobserved observations of the standing height areassumed to follow missing not at random (MNAR) mechanism. Each imputation will requiresufficient standing height data collected from the subjects in the same randomization group who also discontinue treatment prematurely (but remain in the study), referred to as off-
treatment data, as these subjects will be us ed as the reference data for MI. Ten (10) sets of
imputations of the missing standing heights will be constructed from MI and the AGV at themissing time points will be calculated based on these 10 sets of data. For - protocol.pdf Page 105

each subject whose value is imputed, the 10 imput ed values will be provided in a data listing 
that will be included in the appendix of the CSR. The above-mentioned Mixed model will be 
applied to the 10 imputed data sets from MI. The analysis results based on the 10 imputed 
datasets will be summarized using Proc MIANALIZE in SAS. 
In the event there is insufficient data to perf orm the imputations for subjects who discontinue 
the treatment early, then the mixed model w ill be applied without mu ltiple imputations. The 
study is considered positive if the primary test is significant in favor of BMN 111.  
The AGV and its change from baseline at each  scheduled post-trea tment visit will be 
summarized at Week 26 and Week 52 using desc riptive statistics (mea n, SD, median, Q1,Q3, 
minimum, and maximum) per group.  
14.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses The key secondary efficacy endpoints are the ch ange from baseline in height Z-score and the 
change from baseline in upper:lower body se gment ratio. The estimand of the secondary 
efficacy endpoints is the difference in mean change from baseline in the corresponding 
endpoint at 12-month time point between  the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
(all randomized subjects).
The measurement of standing heig ht at each scheduled visit w ill be converted to age-and sex-
appropriate standard score, also referred to as Z-score, by comparison with normal reference 
standards (not ACH). The height Z-score and its change from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The null hypothe sis of no difference between the BMN 111 group 
and the placebo group in the mean change from  baseline in the height Z-score at 12-month 
time point will also be tested  based on 10 imputed data sets  using an ANCOVA model, with 
fixed-effect terms including treatment group, se x, and Tanner stage, and age and the baseline 
Z-score as covariates. The analysis results based on the 10 imputed datasets will be summarized using Proc MIANALIZE in SAS. The upper:lower body segment ratio and its 
change from baseline will be similarly summarized and tested.    
Additional secondary efficacy e ndpoints include change from base line in body proportions of 
the extremities, HRQoL (QoLISSY, PedsQL) scores, and functional independence (WeeFIM) scores. 
Details regarding the analysis methods fo r the additional secondary endpoints will be 
provided in the SAP. - protocol.pdf Page 106

14.2.3 Controlling for Multiplicity
The overall type I family-wise error rate for testing the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be controlled at the 0.05 significan ce level using the following 3-step serial 
gatekeeping multiple comparisons procedure (MCP). Following this MCP, advancement to the next step will only occur if the null hypotheses within a step and the previous step(s) are all rejected at the significance level of 0.05 in favor of BMN 111. If any null hypothesis 
within a step is not rejected or is rejected  but not in favor of BMN 111, the hypothesis tests 
corresponding to all subsequent steps will not  be considered statistically significant. 
All hypothesis tests will be two-sided.
1. The first step will be the test compar ing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for 
the primary efficacy endpoint, the chan ge from baseline in AGV at 12-month time 
point. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (i e, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in 
favor of BMN 111, all subsequent  statistical tests will not be  considered statistically 
significant. The study is considered positive if the primary test is significant in favor of BMN 111. 
2. The second step will be the test comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group 
for the secondary efficacy endpoint, the chan ge from baseline in height Z-score at 
12-month time point. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (ie, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in favor of BMN 111, the subsequent statistical test will not be
considered statistically significant. 
3. The third step will be the tests comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group 
for the secondary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in upper:lower body 
segment ratio at 12-month time point  at a significance level of 0.05. 
By-subject listings will also be provided for efficacy endpoints.  
14.2.4 Sensitivity AnalysesTo assess the robustness of the primary analys is result, sensitivity analyses such as the 
following will be performed: 
Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM)
The primary null hypothesis of no difference between the BMN 111 group and the placebo 
group in the mean change from baseline in A GV at the 12-month time point will be tested 
using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM), with fixed-effect terms including treatment group, visit, sex, Tanner stage, and interaction of trea tment group and visit, and age 
and the baseline AGV as covariates, repeated  over visits. All available AGV assessments 
from all scheduled visits up to 12-month will be used in the MMRM analysis.  - protocol.pdf Page 107
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 107
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
MI Based on Missing At Random (MAR) Assumption
The sensitivity analyses will be based on the MI technique as proposed by Little and Rubin 
(1987) implemented in PROC MI  of SAS where the missing, unobserved observations of the 
response variable are assumed to follow mi ssing at random (MAR) mechanism. The MI 
procedure will be directly applied to standing height and AGV will be calculated based on imputed height. The ANCOVA model described in  the primary analysis will be performed 
separately for each imputation dataset and a summary overall imputed samples will be provided for each analysis. 
Random Coefficients Model
The mean change from baseline (Day 1) in height at 12-month time point will be estimated 
for both the treatment group and the placebo group based on a MMRM, with fixed-effect
terms including treatment group, visit, sex, Tanne r stage, and age and the baseline height as 
covariates, and random-effect terms of the in tercept and the subject*visit interaction. For 
each randomized group, an AGV at 12-month time poi nt will be defined as the mean change 
from baseline in height at 12-m onth from the MMRM model above.  
ANCOVA on Completers
In this sensitivity analysis, the estimand will be the difference of the means of the change 
from baseline in AGV at 12-month observe d from subjects who have non-missing 
observation at 12-month between the two ra ndomized groups. No missing data will be 
imputed. The LS means of the change from baseline in AGV at 12-month will be estimated 
for both the randomized groups by applying the mixed model described in the primary 
analysis. In this analysis, only subjects with  observed AGV change from baseline at 12-
month will be included. No extrapolation or imputation will be performed for missing 12-month standing height measurements.  
14.2.5 Exploratory AnalysesExploratory endpoints include sleep apnea assessment, BMN 111 activity biomarkers and 
genomic biomarkers. 
Details regarding the analysis methods for th e exploratory endpoints will be provided in the 
SAP.

For subjects randomized to BMN 111, PK paramete rs generated over the course of the study 
will be evaluated and summarized with descriptive statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, percentage of coefficient of vari ation [CV%], minimum, median and maximum). 
Correlative analyses of some of the PK parame ters with efficacy, safety and immunogenicity 
measures may be conducted.
14.4 Safety AnalysisAll randomized subjects who receive at le ast one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or 
placebo in this study will be included in the safety analysis. The safety analysis will be performed on safety populati on as defined in Section 14.7.2  and will be considered 
descriptive.
All AEs will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA will be used by the 
Sponsor to assign system organ class and prefer red term classification to  events and diseases, 
based on the original terms entered on the CRF.
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA. The inci dence of AEs will be summarized by system 
organ class, preferred term, rela tionship to study treatment (as assessed by investigator), and 
severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs th at lead to permanent discontinuation from the 
study and from the study treatment, will be listed. Hypersensitivity reactions and symptomatic hypotension are of interest, and th e percentage of subjects who report these AEs 
will be presented. Hypersensitivity reactions will be defined in the SAP.
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by the type of laboratory test. For each clinical 
laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided on baseline as well as all subsequent visits.  
Descriptive statistics for other safety endpoints such as vital signs, ECG results, X-ray and 
DXA assessments of bone morphology and quality , clinical hip assessment, CBCL, anti-
BMN 111 immunogenicity assessments, and bone metabolism biomarke rs, will also be 
provided. Detailed sta tistical methods will be provided in the SAP. All other safety measures 
including laboratory tests, vital signs, EC G, X-ray and DXA assessments, clinical hip 
assessment, and anti-BMN 111 immunogenicity (d iscussed in the next section) will be 
summarized descriptively by group, listings w ill be provided for these safety endpoints. 
14.5 Immunogenicity AnalysisImmunogenicity will be summarized as change from baseline as well as by study time point 
in subjects randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo. Results will be summarized as - protocol.pdf Page 109

incidence and titer for all cohorts. Additiona lly, immunogenicity may be assessed for 
correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy.
14.6 Determination of Sample SizeWith 55 subjects planned in each of the two randomized groups (one BMN 111 dose group 
and one placebo group), the power to detect  a difference of 1.75 cm/year between the 
BMN 111 group and the placebo group in change from baseline in AGV at 12 months is approximately 90%, assuming that the pooled stan dard deviation of the change from baseline 
in AGV is 2.80, using a two-sided two-sample t- test at a 0.05 significance level. The power 
calculation is based on data from Study 111- 202 (a phase 2, open-labe l, sequential cohort 
dose-escalation study) and Study 111-901 (a natu ral history study for pediatric subjects with 
achondroplasia). 
14.7 Analysis Populations14.7.1 Efficacy PopulationAll randomized subjects who receive at le ast one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or 
placebo in this study.
14.7.2 Safety Population All randomized subjects who receive at le ast one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or 
placebo in this study. 
14.7.3 PK Population All randomized subjects who receive at leas t one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 in this 
study and have at least one evaluable PK concentration.  
14.8 Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned AnalysesOnly BioMarin may modify the protocol. Any change in study conduct considered necessary 
by the investigator will be made only after consultation with BioMarin, who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to implement the change. The only exception is when an 
investigator considers that a subject’s safety  is compromised without immediate action. In 
these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB/IEC/REB must be sought, and the investigator should inform BioMarin and the full IRB/IEC/REB within 2 working days after the emergency occurs. 
With the exception of minor administrative or typographical changes, the IRB/IEC/REB 
must review and approve all pr otocol amendments. Protocol am endments that have an impact - protocol.pdf Page 110

on subject risk or the study objectives, or require revision of the ICF, must receive approval 
from the IRB/IEC/REB prior to their implementation.
When a protocol amendment substantially alters  the study design or the potential risks or 
burden to subjects, the ICF will be amended and approved by BioMarin and the IRB/IEC/REB, and all active subjects mu st again provide informed consent. 
Note: If discrepancies exist between the text of the statistical analysis as planned in the 
protocol, and the final SAP, a protocol amendment will not be issued and the SAP willprevail.- protocol.pdf Page 111

16 COMPENSATION AND INSURANCE
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. BioMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/EC/REB 
approval, BioMarin may reimburse the cost of travel for study-related visits. BioMarin will not pay for any hospitalizations, tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort, 
whether or not related to the study subject’s di sease that are not part of this study. Costs 
associated with hospitalizations , tests, and treatments should be  billed and collected in the 
way that such costs are usually billed and collected.
The investigator should contact BioMarin imme diately upon notification that a study subject 
has been injured by the IP or by procedures pe rformed as part of the study. Any subject who 
experiences a study-related injury should be inst ructed by the investigator to seek medical 
treatment at a pre-specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subject should be give n the name of a person to contact to seek 
further information about, and assistance w ith, treatment for study-related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the investigator’s 
instructions, BioMarin will pay for reasonable  and necessary medical services to treat the 
injuries caused by the IP or study procedures , if these costs are not covered by health 
insurance or another third party that usually pays  these costs. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin 
is obligated by law to pay for study-related in juries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.- protocol.pdf Page 113

17 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS
Electronic case report forms will be provided for each subject. The investigator must review 
and electronically sign the completed eCRF casebook to verify its accuracy.
eCRFs must be completed using a validated we b-based application. St udy site personnel will 
be trained on the application and will enter th e clinical data from source documentation, 
except in the instances when electronic subject reported data is transmitted directly to EDC, as referenced in the study sp ecific vendor management plan. 
Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable. In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be 
corrected by deselecting the erroneous response and then selecting or entering the factual 
response. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, th e system will require the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction and the identity of the operator.
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the e CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, 
which necessitates access to all original record ings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data shoul d be attributable (signed and dated). The investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If an investigator or institution refuses to allow access to subject re cords because of confidentiality, arrangements 
must be made to allow an “inter view” style of data verification.
A CRA designated by BioMarin will compare the eCRFs with the original source documents 
at the study site and evaluate them for completeness and accuracy before designating them as “Source Data Verified” (SDV). Electronic subject-reported data transmitted directly into EDC will not be SDV’d or queried.
If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will 
create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personne l will then answer the query 
by either correcting the data or responding to the query. The CRA will then review the 
response and determine either to close the query  or re–query the site if the response does not 
fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook can be locked, da ta fields must be source data verified and 
all queries closed. Refer to the Clinical Monito ring Plan for details on which fields must be - protocol.pdf Page 114

source data verified. The Data Manager, or designee, will then set the status of the forms, 
visits, and the entire casebook to Locked. The in vestigator will then electronically sign the 
casebook, specifying that the information on the eCRFs is accurate and co mplete. As part of 
site close-out activities, an electronic copy of  each site’s casebooks will be copied to a 
compact disc or digital versatile disc and sent to each study site for retention with other study documents. - protocol.pdf Page 115

18 STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING
Qualified individuals designated by BioMarin w ill monitor all aspects of the study according 
to GCP and standard operating procedures fo r compliance with applicable government 
regulations. The investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical supplies, dispensing, and storage areas and to th e clinical files, including original medical 
records, of the study subjects, and, if reque sted, agrees to assist the monitors. The 
investigator and staff are responsible for bein g present or available for consultation during 
routinely scheduled site visits conduc ted by BioMarin or its designees.
Members of BioMarin’s GCP Compliance Depart ment or designees may conduct an audit of 
a clinical site at any time before, during, or af ter completion of the study. The investigator 
will be informed if an audit is to take pl ace and advised as to the scope of the audit. 
Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory  Agencies may also conduct an inspection of 
the study. If informed of such an inspection, the investigator should notify BioMarin immediately. The investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilitie s, original source docume ntation, and all study files.- protocol.pdf Page 116

19 RETENTION OF RECORDS
The investigator must retain all study records required by BioMarin and by the applicable 
regulations in a secure and safe facility. The investigator must consult a BioMarin representative before disposal of any study reco rds, and must notify BioMarin of any change 
in the location, disposition or custody of the st udy files. The investigator /institution must 
take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively pe rmit evaluation of the conduct of a study and 
the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study records (eg, subject charts)
as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by applicable regulatory requirements. 
All study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the U.S. or an ICH re gion or (2) at least 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The investigator /institution should retain subject identifiers for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation 
of the study. Subject files and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice, but not less than 15 years. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the 
applicable regulatory requirements or by a BioMarin agreement. BioMarin must be notified and will assist with retention should investigator /in stitution be unable to continue 
maintenance of subject files for the full 15 year s. It is the responsibility of BioMarin to 
inform the investigator /institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.- protocol.pdf Page 117

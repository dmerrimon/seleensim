 Protocol Synopsis 
 
Full Title  Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Covered and Uncovered Biliary 
Self Expanding Metal Stents (SEMS)  for Pre -operative Drainage During 
Neoadjuvant Therapy in  Patients with P ancreatic  Cancer  
Abbreviated 
Title  Pre-operative Biliary SEMS  RCT  During Neoadjuvant Therapy 
Primary Objective  To demonstrate non -inferiority of Fully Covered biliary SEMS to 
Uncovered biliary SEMS in biliary drainage for the pre- operative 
management of biliary obstructive symptoms caused by pancreatic cancer in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. 
Devices     Stent Type:  
FC Arm:  WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered S tent  
       UC Arm:  WallFlex Biliary RX Uncovered Stent  
Stent Diameter:  
8mm or 10mm 
Stent Length:  
40mm, 60mm, or 80mm 
The stent length will be selected to be such that the stent length should be long enough to cover the stricture completely but to leave sufficient 
length of normal bile duct for subsequent anastomosis.  
Device Indication The WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent is  indicated for use in the 
palliative treatment of biliary strictures produced by malignant neoplasms, relief of malignant biliary obstruction prior to surgery, and for treatment of benign biliary strictures . 
 The WallFlex Biliary RX Uncovered Stent is indicated for use in the palliative treatment of biliary strictures produced by malignant neoplasms  
and relief of malignant biliary obstruction prior to surgery.

 Primary 
Endpoint  Successful pre -operative biliary drainage  defined as absence of 
reinterventions for the management of biliary obstructive symptoms.  
• For patients undergoing surgery: from stent placement until surgery 
• For patients transitioning to palliative management: from stent 
placement until transition to palliation  
Secondary Endpoints  
 
           1. Occurrence and severity of adverse events  related to the stent and/or 
stenting procedure  
2. Occurrence and severity of surgical complications  
3. Occurrence and severity of peri -surgical complications (up to 30 days 
after surgery)  
4. Ability to deploy the stent in  a satisfactory position across the stricture 
(Stent Placement Success)  
5. Improvement of bi liary obstructive symptoms during stent indwell at 
Week 1 and Monthly until surgery or transition to palliation  as 
applicable, compared to Baseline 
6. Improvement of Laboratory Liver Function Tests (LFTs)  until surgery 
for patients undergoing surgery, and at Week 1 and Monthly until 
transition to palliation, and at 1 year after stent placement for patients not undergoing surgery. 
7. Biliary Reintervention  rate  
8. Ability to complete neoadjuvant therapy as intended without stent related interruptions of neoadjuvant therapy  
9. Stent migration rate  
10. Assessment by surgeon of interference, if any, of SEMS on time to surgery and/or success of pancreaticoduodenectomy  
11. For patients transitioning to palliative management:  Successful biliary drainage defined as absence of reinterventions for the management of biliary obstructive symptoms  from stent placement  to 
1 year after stent placement  
Hypothesis  Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the rate of success when 
using the Fully Covered SEMS is non-inferior to the rate of success when 
using the Uncovered SEMS. The following hypothesis will be tested: 
Ho: πUC−πFC ≥∆  (Inferior)

  Page 6 of 43 
 Ha: πUC−πFC <∆  (Non -inferior)  
where πFC  and πUC  are the probabilities of having success in the WallFlex 
Fully Covered Stent and WallFlex Uncovered Stent arms respectively, and 
∆ is defined as the non -inferiority margin.  
The sample size was calculated for the test using an exact non- inferiority  
test. The assumed success rates for both study arms and the non- inferiority 
margin are guided by t he following analysis of literature:  
The success rate estimate is extracted from a full literature search which yielded nine articles ( 377 patients ) 
2, 7, 21, 24, 25, 27 , 29-31 on the use of metal 
stents for pre -operative biliary drainage.  The nine articles yielded a success 
rate estimate of  84.6 % with a 95% CI of (80.5% - 87.9%).  
Each arm is assumed to have a success rate of 8 0.5%.  The non- inferiority 
margin (Δ) is set at 20%.  Given these assumptions a sample size of 51 x 2 = 102 patients provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-
value calculated for the test is below 0.05 it will be concluded that the test is significant, and that the WallFlex Fully Covered stent is non- inferior to 
the WallFlex Uncovered stent.   
An additional 20% of patients  will be enrolled to compensate for possible 
loss of patients  to follow-up, giving a total sample size of 122 patients .

 1.  Introduction  
 
In the United States, pancreatic cancer is the second most common digestive cancer1  and the 
fourth leading cause of death with a 5-year survival rate of only 5%.2   Globally, there are an 
estimated 216,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer annually.3  Pancreatic cancer , which is the 
most prevalent peri- ampullary cancer,  is located in the head of the pancreas in approximately 
two thirds of cases.4   Patients with pancreatic cancer presenting with biliary obstruction can be 
stratified into patients with unresectable tumors, with borderline resectable or locally advanced tumors, or with resect able tumors.  More than 70% of pancreatic cancer patients are poor 
candidates for surgery or are deemed unresectable
5; the WallFlex Biliary SEMS are currently 
indicated for use in these patients.  Some patients may be candidates for PD with curative intent, however, 25%-41% do not undergo PD as planned due to disease progression, evolving comorbidities, or decline in performance status during the time between diagnosis and scheduled PD.
6-8  Pre-operative neoadjuvant chemo 
or chemoradiation therapy is increasingly considered in the treatment of patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.  The aim is to downsize tumors and improve the likelihood of a margin- free (R0) resection, to provide early treatment of micrometastases, and 
ultimately to optimize post-operative survival.
9-13 In a recent report, 32 of 84 (38%) patients with 
borderline resectable disease underwent a PD after neoadjuvant therapy, with R0 resection achieved in 94% of patients and resulting median survival of 40 months post PD.
13   In another 
report on 132 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, it was found that combined neoadjuvant chemoradiation and PD yielded a median survival of 21 months from the time of tissue diagnosis, and at a median follow-up of 14 months 42 of 132 patients (32%) survived with no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease.
14   The duration of neoadjuvant chemoradiation 
typically ranges from 2 to 7 months6,14 and tends to require a subsequent pre- operative resting 
and restaging period which can last up to several months.7   
  Periampullary cancer including cancer in the head of the pancreas is associated with biliary obstructive symptoms such as jaundice at initial patient presentation in approximately 50% -70% 
of patients.
7  Biliary obstruction requires biliary decompression.6,15  Indeed, if left untreated, 
prolonged biliary obstruction leads to coagulopathy, malabsorption and consequent progressive malnutrition, pruritus, hepatic dysfunction, recurrent attacks of cholangitis and altered bile salt metabolism.
16,17  Pre-operative biliary drainage provides relief of biliary obstructive symptoms 
during neoadjuvant therapy18,19 and improves post PD tissue healing in response to reduced 
bilirubin levels.20  Without such pre- operative drainage patients may lose their resectable or 
potentially resectable status due to interruption of the neoadjuvant therapy and/or delayed scheduling of the intended PD.  In addition, for patients receiving 3 to 4 months of neoadjuvant therapy, biliary drainage may be beneficial since some chemotherapeutic agents require adequate liver function and pre-operative immunosuppression can increase susceptibility to the risks of cholangitis if bile duct drainage is inadequate.
21  If severely jaundiced patients do undergo PD, 
they may be at risk of significant post- operative complications36 such as renal failure and

 sepsis.22,23  It is therefore important that pre -operative biliary drainage be provided during 
neoadjuvant therapy and the subsequent restaging and resting period.  
 Pre-operative biliary drainage has traditionally be en achieved with plastic stents.  However, these 
stents have been associated with high complication rates and relatively low success rates in pre -
operative management of biliary obstruction .
6,21,24 -27  Plastic stents used for pre-operative 
drainage can occlude within a few weeks which in turn may necessitate additional pre- operative 
ERCPs21.  The use of SEMS provides a viable alternative that has been shown to be superior to 
plastic stents for pre -operat ive biliary drainage due to lower rates of occlusion, fewer episodes of 
cholangitis/cholestasis, fewer additional ERCPs before surgery, and longer stent patency resulting in most patients completing  uninterrupted neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and preventing delays of surgery.
1,24,27 
 A literature review was conducted of clinical success of pre -operative biliary drainage using 
plastic or metal biliary stenting including all SEMS types used.  Two associated meta -analyses 
were generated based on published reports of ratios of the number of patients experiencing clinical success in pre- operative biliary drainage without stent related complications over the 
total number of stented patients.  A meta -analysis representing a total of 429 patients in six  
public ations using plastic biliary stents  yielded a biliary drainage success rate estimate of 45.9% 
[95% CI, 34.7% - 57.5 %].
2,6, ,24-27  A meta -analysis representing a total of 377 patients in nine 
publications using SEMS yielded a biliary drainage success rate estimate of  8 4.6% [95% CI, 
80.5% - 87.9%].2, 7, 21, 24, 25, 27 , 29-31 In patients who do ultimately undergo PD with curative intent, 
the SEMS is removed en -bloc inside the surgical specimen.  Six  of the 9 publications reporting 
on the use of pre-operative biliary drainage using SEMS state explicitly on the fact  that SEMS do 
not interfere with successful PD  and could be easily removed intra-operatively without 
complications. 7,21,24,25,27,31  Some studies have reported an increased risk of post- operative wound 
infection13,33-35, but there were no other reported increases in  intra-operative or post- operative 
complications related to the use of SEMS.  In addition, SEMS could be easily removed intra-operatively without complications.
20, 27-30 
 
Pre-operative biliary drainage (PBD) prior to Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) continues to be 
routine in many centers despite retrospective data showing that P BD increases post -operative 
wound infection.13,33-35  It was shown that these post-operative wound infections were classified 
on a grading scale of 1-5, with all reported occurrences  rated as either 1  (oral medication and 
bedside intervention) or 2 (IV medication, TPN, enteral nutrition, or blood), and managed non-invasively.
33  Other studies have also reported an inc rease in post -operative wound infection in 
the PBD group, but have indicated that although there is an increase in length of hospitalization, the length of time under anesthesia, amount of blood loss, and transfusion requirements were unaffected .
32,34 
 In line with the findings summarized above, SEMS have emerged as an alternative to using plastic stents for pre -operative biliary drainage.  Several opinion- leading centers in this field 
have adopted SEMS drainage as their standard of practice in PD -bound patients undergoing

 neoadjuvant therapy. Most recently leading cancer centers7, 21, 3 2  have published that the use of 
pre-operative biliary SEMS, and not plastic stents, in patients with resectable or potentially 
resectable pancreatic or periampullary cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy is effective and safe.  
Boston Scientific is proposing a multi- center, randomized , prospe ctive , post- market  trial on the 
use of SEMS for biliary drainage in patients with pancreatic cancer  undergoing neoadjuvant 
therapy.    
2.  Objectives  
 
The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of Fully Covered biliary SEMS to Uncovered biliary SEMS in biliary drainage for the pre- operative management of biliary 
obstructive symptoms caused by pancreatic cancer in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. 
3.  Design  
 This is a post- market, prospective , multi- center, randomized study e valuating covered and 
uncovered SEMS for p re-operative management of patients with pancreatic  cancer  undergoing 
neoadjuvant therapy. 
3.1. Scale and Duration  
Patients  that have gone to surgery will be followed for 30 days post-surgery.  For patients that 
have transitioned to palliation, the Long Term Follow- Up V isit will occur one (1) year after 
initial treatment.   Patients that have not gone to surgery and have not transitioned to palliation 
(with or without Neoadjuvant Therapy) will be followed up to 1 year post- stent placement.   
There will be 6-12 participating centers  with anticipated enrollment of 122 patients.  
 At each investigational center, there will be one principal investigator (PI) who will be an 
endoscopist.  Where possible at least one co -investigator should be a pancreaticobiliary surgeon.   
3.2. Treatment Assignment  
Patients will be randomized at Screening  in equal proportions of 1:1 ratio between Arm 1 and 
Arm 2 as follows: 
• Arm 1: WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent  
 
• Arm 2: WallFlex Biliary RX Uncovered Stent  
 Block randomization through an online database system will be used.  Randomization will be stratified by study center.

 6.  Study Devices  
 
The WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered stent  and the WallFlex Biliary RX Uncovered stent  will 
be used for the treatment of patients.   The WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered and the WallFlex Biliary RX Uncovered Stent Systems 
are indicated for use in the palliative treatment of biliary stricture s produced by malignant 
neoplasms and relief of malignant biliary obstruction prior to surgery ; the WallFlex Biliary RX 
Fully Covered Stent System is also indicated for use in the palliative treatment of biliary  
strictures  produced by malignant neoplasms and treatment of benign biliary strictures, per CE 
Mark. For a detailed description of the WallFlex Biliary Stent Systems, please reference the Directions for Use (DFU) included in each device package.  
Investigators should use the WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered and Uncovered Stent Systems 
in accordance with the DFUs.  
Study devices are labeled on the box and inner pouch and contain information including but not limited to:  device name and dimensions, lot number, expirati on date, name of legal 
manufacturer, and investigational use statement. Device labeling will be provided in local language(s) as per national regulations. 
Study devices will be available in the following dimensions: 
 
WallFlex Biliary 
RX Stent  Diameter  Leng th Delivery System 
Diameter  Guidewire 
Diameter  
 Uncovered  8 mm  
10 mm  40, 60 , 80mm

 Fully Covered 8 mm  
10 mm  60, 80mm 
40, 60 , 80mm 8.5 Fr .035” 
 
Stent placement should be such that the proximal end of the stent is minimum 2 cm from the 
hilum.   Performing a biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy or enlarging a prior sphincterotomy 
will be done at the discretion of the endoscopist.  Per literature, it is recommended that the shortest length of stent required to bridge the stricture
21 is used so as to leave enough of the 
normal bile duct above the stent available for subsequent anas tomosis7, 21,24,25,29.  It is hence 
anticipated that SEMS of 80 mm length will rarely or never be selected in this trial.   
 
In case of a failed stent placement due to a device event, a new attempt to place a stent will be made.  If a stent placement is not possible due to non- device related reasons (such as inability to 
cannulate the CBD or reach the papilla, extensive tumor gr owth at site of papilla, etc.), 
interventional radiologic (IR) access is allowed and, where possible, should be associated with placement of a study stent over a transhepatically inserted guide- wire in a "rendez -vous"

 procedure.  Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiograp hy (PTC) and a subsequent internal drainage 
with a stent placement may be done at the same time (one-stage procedure), or PTC with 
external drainage may be performed 2 -3 days before stent insertion (two- stage procedure) per 
standard of practic e.  If access to the biliary tree or endoscopic placement of the study stent 
through a “rendez-vous” procedure fails and patient requires percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), then the patient will exit the study .  In case of failure of SEMS f unctionality 
during the neoadjuvant therapy, a new investigational SEMS may be placed, covered or uncovered at the discretion of the investigator.  In case of failure of SEMS functionality after transition to palliation, no new investigational SEMS will be  provided and patient should be 
treated per standard of practice.

• Informed Consent  
• Eligibility Criteria Assessment 
• Randomization 
 
No study- specific testing will be conducted until after the patient  has signed an Informed 
Consent Form. A Screen Failure/Enrolled Log will be maintained in EDC by the center to 
document select information about candidates who signed consent.  
Written Informed Consent must be obtained for all patients  who are potential study 
candidates.  Patients  will be ask ed to sign the Informed Consent Form before any study-
specific tests or procedures are performed.  The Informed Consent Form is study -specific and 
must be approved by the study Institutional Review Board (IRB).  Study personnel should 
explain that even if a patient  agrees to participate in the study and signs an Informed Consent 
Form, the inclusion/exclusion criteria may demonstrate that the patient  is not a suitable 
candidate for the study. Screening and enrollment information will be collected in the database for all patients who sign a consent form.

8.  Statistical Considerations  
8.1  Hypotheses  
Compared to the use of an Uncovered SEMS, use of a Fully Covered SEMS may present a higher risk of migration, but offers the ability to remove the stent were this deemed indicated by the treating endoscopist.  Statistical testing will be performed to deter mine if the rate of 
success when using the Fully Covered SEMS is non- inferior to the rate of success when 
using the Uncovered  SEMS.  The following hypothesi s will be tested: 
 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈−𝜋𝜋𝐹𝐹𝑈𝑈 ≥ ∆  (Inferior) 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈−𝜋𝜋𝐹𝐹𝑈𝑈 <∆  (Non-inferior) 
 
w
here 𝜋𝜋𝐹𝐹𝑈𝑈  and 𝜋𝜋𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 are the probabilities of having success in the WallFlex Fully Covered 
Stent and WallFlex Uncovered Stent arms respectively, and ∆ is defined as the non-
inferiority margin.  
8.2
 Sample Size  
The sample size was calculated for the test using an exact non- inferiority  test in StatXact 9® 
software. The non- inferiority margin (Δ) is  set at 20%. Each arm  is assumed to have a 
success rate of 8 0.5%, which is the lower 95% CI boundary from the meta- analysis , which is

 done below. Given thes e assumptions  a sample size of  51 x 2 = 102 patients provides 80% 
power to reject the null hypothesis listed above. If the p- value calculated for the test is below 
0.05 it will be concluded that the test is significant and that the WallFlex Fully Covered s tent 
is non- inferior to the WallFlex Uncovered stent .   
 
In order to compensate for possible loss of patients  to follow-up or per Endoscopist’s 
decision to select the Uncovered stent based on ductal anatomy, namely stricture involving the low cystic duct confluence, an additional 20% of patients  will be enrolled giving a total 
sample size of 122 patients . 
The suc cess rate estimate is extracted from a full literature search which yielded nine articles 
(377 patients ) 
2, 7, 21, 24, 25, 27, 29 -31 on the use metal stents for pre -operative biliary drainage.  
The nine articles yielded a success rate estimate of 8 4.6% wit h a 95% CI of (80.5%, 87.9%).  
8.3 Analysis Populations  
8.3.1   Enrolled Cohort  
A patient  is considered “enrolled” after signing the study- specific ICF.  Patients  who sign the 
ICF but subsequently do not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria provided in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 will be considered screen failures and excluded from the study. 
8.3.2. Intent -to-Treat Cohort  
This cohort consists of those “enrolled” patient s who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria  and 
are subsequently randomized. 
8.3.3.   Per-Protocol Cohort The per -protocol cohort is a subset of the ITT patients  who are treated per protocol and have 
no major protocol deviations (per ICH E9 definitions). 
8.4 Data Analysis 
All statistical analyses will be done using The SAS System software, version 8 or higher 
(Copyright © 2000 SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, North Carolina 27513, USA. All rights reserved).   The distribution of prognostic factors be tween patients with and without data will be 
examined. Statistical models that account for censored data will be employed in appropriate circumstances, e.g. for time- to-event outcomes. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to 
assess the impact of missing data on the interpretation of the results, e.g. a tipping point analysis.

  Page 26 of 43 
 Patient  demographics, clinical history, risk factors, obstructive symptoms, LFTs, tumor 
diagnosis, patient  overall health, neoadjuvant therapy, and assessment of tumor invasion will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, 
maximum) for continuous variables and frequency tables for discrete variables.    8.4.2.  Post Procedure Data  Post-procedure information will be collected at regularly scheduled follow-up examinations as detailed in the clinical study event schedule and will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum) and frequency tables or proportions for discrete variables.  
 
8.4.3.  Interim Analyses  
 No formal interim analyses are planned for this study. 
 
8.4.4.  Subgroup Analyses  
 Stratified  analyses will include tabulating the primary endpoint and sele ct secondary 
endpoints by patients that undergo potentially curative surgery  versus transition to palliation, 
by bilirubin level above or below 3 mg/dL , and gender .  
 8.4.5.  Justification of Pooling  The analyses will be performed using data pooled across institutions. An assessment of the poolability of patients  across sites will be made by fitting generalized linear models with site 
as the factor of interest and the primary endpoint as the outcome.  
 8.4.6.  Multivariable Analyses  Univariate and multivariate analyses may be performed to assess the effect of potential predictors on the primary endpoint using logistic regression or Cox Proportional Hazards regression.  
Variables from the follow ing categories will be considered as possible predictors: 
demographics, tumor diagnosis, baseline LFTs, neoadjuvant therapy protocol, obstructive 
symptoms, baseline health status, and medical history. Factors from the univariate model with p≤0.20 will also be modeled multivariately using a stepwise procedure in a generalized linear model or Cox Proportional Hazards regression model. The significance thresholds for entry and exit into the model will be set to p≤0.10.  8.4.7.  Changes to Planned Analyses

9.   Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
9.1.  Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
The following anticipated adverse device effects (ADE)  should be reported only if they are 
related to the stent and/or stenting procedure.  They have been identified for the WallFlex 
Biliary FC and UC Stent, as indicated in the commercial Directions for Use (DFU) and may include, but are not limited to:   
• Pain 
• Bleeding  
• Fever  
• Nausea  
• Vomiting  
• Infection  
• Inflammation  
• Recurrent obstructive jaundice  
• Stent occlusion 
• Tumor overgrowth around ends of stent 
• Tumor ingrowth through the stent 
• Mucosal hyperplasia  
• Cholangitis  
• Cholecystitis  
• Pancreatitis  
• Ulceration of duodenum or bile duct 
• Perforation of duodenum or bile duct 
• Stent migration  
• Death (other than that due to normal disease progression) 
• Stent misplacement 
• Perforation of the gallbladder due to the stent covering the cystic duct 
• Stent Fracture  
• Hepatic abscess

• Portal Vein Thrombosis  
• Cholangitis   
• Hemorrhage  
• (Emergency) (re)laparotomy   
• Pneumonia 
• Myocardial infarction  
• Mortality  
9.3.   Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized by performing procedures in the 
appropriate hospital environment, adher ing to patient  selection criteria, and close monitoring 
the patient 's physiologic status during research procedures and/or follow- up visits.   Promptly 
supplying BSC with all pertinent information required by this protocol may facilitate inter -
center communications regarding serious AEs. 
9.4.  Anticipated Benefits  
Patients  may not receive any benefit from participating in this study but this study may 
provide a future benefit to medical science and other patients.  To date there is no broadly accepted standard of practice pertaining to the use of SEMS for Pre -operative management of 
patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. 
9.5.  Risk to Benefit Rationale 
Based on prior BSC’s clinical studies and collected reports in literature to -date, the risk -to-
benefit ratio is within reason for foreseeable risks. However, literature reports do not always capture all side effects. Observation and follow up of patients  is required as outlined in the 
protocol.

requirements.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device 
Effect (UADE) 
 
Ref: 21 CFR Part 812  
 Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigatio nal plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (USADE)  
 
Ref: ISO 14155 -2011  
 
 
 Serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity, or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.  
Note: Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect 
which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report.  
Device Deficiency  
 
Ref: ISO 14155 -2011  
 
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3 12/2010  A device deficiency is any inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance.  
Note: Device deficiencies include malfunctions, misuse or use errors, and 
inadequate labeling.  
Note: All device deficiencies that could  have led to a SADE if suitable 
action had not been taken or if circumstances had been less fortunate shall be reported as required by the local IRB/EC, national regulations, or the 
protocol.  If applicable, see MEDDEV 2.7/3 12/2010 for reporting 
timeline requirements.  
Abbreviations: EC=Ethics Committee; IRB=Institutional Review Board  
 
Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be recorded as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of a specific SAE (see Table 4  for AE  definitions).  
All device -related events and all surgery related events  experienced by the study patient  after 
informed consent, whether during or subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
10.2.  Relationship to Study Device(s)  
The Invest igator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study device as related or 
unrelated. Unrelated AEs will not be reported.  Per protocol, only complications related to stent and/or stenting procedures will be reported.  See criteria in Table 5 .

 Table 5: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Study Device to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or effect of 
another device and is not related to the investigational product.  
Related  • The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the investigational 
product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to investigational product. 
• There is a strong relationship to investigational product, or recurs on re -
challenge, and another etiology is unlikely. 
• There is no other reasonable medical explanation for the event.  
10.3.  Investigator Reporting Requirements 
Investigators will be required to report all SAEs and ADEs.  
10.3.1.  Serious Adverse Events 
 These events should be reported to the Sponsor within 2 business days of first becoming aware of the event.  Events should be documented in the eCRF and all relevant source documentation for the event should be provided to the Safety Trial Manager, as applicable.  
10.3.2.  Adverse Events  Device-related events should be reported to the Sponsor within 10 business days of first becoming aware of the event.  Unrelated AEs will not be collected.  
10.3.3.  Device Failures, Malfunctions, and Product Nonconformities  
 These events should be reported to the Sponsor within 1 business day of first becoming aware of the event.  Events should be documented in the eCRF. 
10.4.  Boston Scientific Device Deficiencies  
All device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, use errors, product nonconformities, and labeling errors) will be documented and reported to BSC. If possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the investigational device(s) will be provided. If it is not possible to return the device, the investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
Device deficiencies, failures, malfunctions, and product nonconformities are not to be reported as adverse events. However, if there is an adverse event that results from a device failure or malfunction, that specific event would be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

APPENDIX B : SPONSOR REQUIRED PROTOCOL SECTIONS  
B.1.  Data Management  
 
B.1.1.  Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
 
Patient  data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside on a production server. All changes made to the clinical data 
will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review by Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) or its representative. The associated software and dat abase have been 
designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backu ps are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electronic case report forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature on printouts of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator acknowledging and approving the changes. 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database.

B.1.2.  Data Retention  
 
The Investigator will maintain, at the investigative site, in original format all essential study 
documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study patients  in 
compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines.  Documents must be retained for at least 2 years after  
the last approval of a marketing application or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical investigation of the product. These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by agreement with BSC or in com pliance with other local 
regulations. It is BSC’s responsibility to inform the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be maintained. The Investigator will take measures to ensure that these essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the Investigator withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change.   
B.2.  Amendments  
 
If a protocol revision is necessary which affects the rights, safety or welfare of the patient  or 
scientific integrity of the data, an amendment is required. Appropriate approvals (e.g., IRB/ EC/ FDA /CA) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior to implementation.  
B.3.   Device/Equipment Accountability  
 There are no investigational devices used in this study. The WallFlex Biliary Fully Covered and Uncovered Stent Systems are available for commercial use in the geographic areas in which this clinical study is taking place; therefore, there is no requiremen t for device 
accountability for the purposes of this study. Device lot information must be maintained in the subject’s medical record and recorded on the appropriate case report form.   Any individual country/region requirements that depart from the aforementioned will be implemented on a case- by-case basis.  
B.4.  Deviations 
 
An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol, except to protect the life and physical well -being of a patient  in an emergency. An investigator shall notify the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB /EC of any deviation from the investigational plan to protect 
the life or physical well-being of a patient  in an emergency, and those deviations which affect 
the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Such  notice shall be given as soon as

If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a patient's future health and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected patient (s) in w ritten form 
via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled patients  may be requested to sign and date 
an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF,  such as if there are amendments 
to the protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or following annual review by the IRB /EC. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the IRB /EC. 
Boston Scientific approval is required if cha nges to the revised ICF are requested by the 
center’s IRB /EC. The IRB /EC will determine the patient  population to be re-consented.

 In accordance with the Corporate Policy on the Conduct of Human Subject Research, BSC 
requires disclosure of its involvement as a sponsor or financial supporter in any publication or presentation relating to a BSC study or its results. In accordance with the Corporate Policy for the Conduct of Human Subject Research, BSC will submit study results for publication (regardless of study outcome) following the conclusion or termination of the study. Boston Scientific Corporation adheres to the Contributorship Criteria set forth in the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE; http://www.icmje.org). In order to ensure the public disclosure of study results in a timely manner, while maintaining an unbiased presentation of study outcomes, BSC personnel may assist authors and investigators in publication preparation provided the following guidelines are followed.  
• All authorship and contributorship requirements as described above must be followed. 
• BSC involvement in the publication preparation and the BSC Publication Policy should be discussed with the Coordinating Pr incipal Investigator(s) and/or Executive/Steering 
Committee at the onset of the project.  
• The First and Senior authors are the primary drivers of decisions regarding publication content, review, approval, and submission.  
B.11.  Definitions of complication criteria  (per van der Gaag article):  
 Specific PBD (ERCP, PTC) related:  
 
• Acute pancreatitis :  Abdominal pain and a serum concentration of pancreatic enzymes 
(amylase or lipase) three or more times the upper limit of normal, that required more than 
one night of hospitalization  
• Acute cholecystitis :  No suggestive clinical or radiographic signs of acute cholecystitis 
before the procedure and if emergency cholecystectomy is subsequently required 
• Perforation:  Retroperitoneal or bowel-wall perforation documented by any radiographic technique or direct visual evidence  
• Stent Occlusion:  Recurring obstructive jaundice with necessary stent replacement  
Specific surgery related:  
 
• Pancreaticojejunostomy leakage:  Dr ain output of any measurable volume of fluid on 
or after postoperative day 3 with an amylase content greater than 3 times the serum 
amylase activity, graded according to clinical course (ISGPS grade A, B, C), or direct visual evidence of defect at anastomo sis  
• Delayed gastric emptying:  Gastric stasis requiring nasogastric intubation for 10 days or more, or the inability to tolerate a regular (solid) diet on or before the fourteenth

 postoperative day, not due to sequelae of intra- abdominal complications (i. e. abscess, 
anastomotic leakage)  
• Biliary leakage:  Bilirubin in abdominal drain or dehiscence found at laparotomy  
• Gastro/-duodenojejunostomy leakage:  Conclusive radiographic or direct visual 
evidence of a defect of the anastomosis  
• Intra -abdominal abscess formation:  Intra-abdominal fluid collection with positive 
cultures identified by ultrasonography or computed tomography, associated with 
persistent fever and elevations of white blood cells  
• Wound infection:  Requiring intervention otherwise considered as minor complication  
• Portal Vein Thrombosis:  Conclusive radiologic evidence of thrombosis  
 
Following either procedure:  
 
• Cholangitis:  Elevation in temperature more than 38°C, thought to have a biliary cause, without concomitant evidence of acute cholecystitis, requiring intervention  
• Hemorrhage :  Bleeding after the index procedure requiring transfusion of ≥4 units of 
packed cells within a 24-hour period, or leading to relaparotomy/intervention  
• (Emergency) (re)laparotomy:  Any (other) reason following either preoperative biliary 
drainage or another surgical procedure  
• Pneumonia :  Pulmonary infection with radiological confirmation and requiring antibiotic 
treatment  
• Mortality:  In -hospital death, due to protocol complications or any cause, including 
progression of disease, within the study period

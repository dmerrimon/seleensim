5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Rationale and B ackground  
It is estimated that soft contact lenses account for over 90% of lens fits. Moreover , almost 
32% of soft contact lenses were prescribed in a daily disposable  modality.   DT1 contact 
lenses were introduced as a unique dual technology that combines  a low water content 
silicone hydrogel core, to achieve optimal oxygen supply, with a high water content hydrogel 
surface to provide a highly lubricious, wettable lens.  Previous studies support  the hypothesis 
that Water Gradient Technology in DT1 lenses produces superior clinical performance and 
subjective acceptance . 
5.2 Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall clinical performance of DT1contact lenses 
when compared to another commercially available daily disposable contact le ns, Infuse.  
 
 
 The design of this study i s justified based upon 
preclinical and clinical testing, as described within the package insert. Infuse contact lenses 
were chosen as the comparator product because these lenses have the same wear modality.  
At the end of the study, a clinical study report will be prepared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and standards.

Alcon – Business Use Only  5.3 Risks and Benefits  
The clinical investigation process risks are managed through appropriate training and 
monitoring according to the protocol -specific monitoring plan . Investigational device risks , 
including risks associated with use of device  and methods and procedures for application of 
device , are defined in the product labeling and are managed through review of safety 
assessments outlined in this protocol.  
Contact lenses may offer improved peripheral vision and the convenience of not weari ng 
spectacles. Material properties and  design characteristics of the contact lens in development 
are features consistent with  successful contact lens wear.  
The test products are for daily wear use under a daily disposable wear modality; further  
details on any known potential risks and benefits can be found in the package insert. The test 
products are not intended for use with a cleaning/disinfecting solution, and the  
biocompatibility with lens care solutions and any associated clinical effects are unknown.  
A summary of the known potential risks and benefits associated with the DT1 and Infuse 
contact  lenses can be found in the package insert. Risks are minimized by compliance with 
the eligibility criteria and study procedures, and through close supervision by  a licensed 
clinician  during exposure to the study lenses

Alcon – Business Use Only  7.2 Rationale for Study Design  
This study design is justified based upon an evaluation of the results of relevant preclinical 
and clinical testing, as described within the package insert s.  
The crossover design will ensure that the same subject is exposed to both the test and 
comparator  lens materials;  
 study will include only those 
subjects who are current wearers of spherical soft contact lenses in both eyes with at least 3 
months wearing experience, with a minimum wearing time of 5 days per week and 10 hours 
per day.  
Furthermore, the subjects will not be permitted to use lubrication/rewetting drops during the 
duration of the study as this may confound the primary effectiveness endpoint. The study will 
exclude any habitual  DT1and Infuse contact lens wearers in the past 3 months prior to 
consent in order to reduce potential bias of wearers to their habitual contact lenses. The study 
will also exclude subjects who wish to wear their contact lenses in monovision modality 
durin g the study and multifocal lens wearers.  
 
 
 
7.2.1 Purpose and Timing of Interim Analyses and Resulting Design 
Adaptations  
An interim analysis will not be performed.  
7.3 Rationale for Duration of Treatment/ Follow -Up 
Subjects will wear each study product bilaterally for approximately 1 week.  
 
 The primary  
will be assessed on approximately after 1 week of wearing each study prod uct  
 
. 
7.4 Rationale for Choice of Comparator  Product  
B+L Infuse spherical , daily disposable  contact lenses were chosen as the comparator product 
because these lenses have the same wear modality and replacement schedule

• Neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea  
• Permanent vision loss as defined by loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A from enrollment 
visit that fails to resolve  
• Uveitis (anterior, intermediate, or posterior)  
• Corneal abrasion affecting ≥ 50% of corneal surface area  
 
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm ( i.e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The investigator  should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm se parately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications (e .g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens /solution  cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging defici t (e.g., mislabeled product , tampered seal,  leaking bottle/container ) 
• Suspect product contamination  
• Lack of performance  
11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the invest igator  should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions  shown 
below and report as applicable : 
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take because of a new health issue 
since your last study visit? ”

Alcon – Business Use Only  In addition, c hanges  in any protocol -specific parameters  evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by the investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the investigator , is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.   
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
Histo ry section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the investigator  assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.   
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of

Alcon – Business Use Only  Note:  Should the EDC system become nonoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device Deficiency  Form. The 
completed form is emailed to the study sponsor at msus.safety@alco n.com for US  according 
to the timelines outlined above; however, the reported information must be entered into the 
EDC system once it becomes operational.  
Study sponsor representatives may be contacted for any protocol -related question and their 
contact in formation is provided in the Manual of Procedures that accompanies this protocol.  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor  may request copies of applicable portions of the subject ’s medical records . The 
investigator  must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigator  must assess the in tensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is mo derate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in t heir usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator  must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by study sponsor utilizing the same definition s, as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by the medical device or study procedure.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i .e., there are other more likely causes for the AE).  
The study sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator  of any AEs that is 
upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to related . 
11.4 Return product analysis  (if applicable)  
Study sponsor  representatives and their contact information are provided in the MOP that 
accompanies this protocol.  
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the Complaint # , which will be provided by study sponsor after the 
case is entered in the study sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Management System 
(GPCMS).  
11.5 Unmasking of the Study Treatment  
Masked information on the identity of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the study . If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of subject safety, the 
investigator  is encouraged to contact an appropriate study sponsor representative prior to 
unmasking the information if  there is sufficient time. Dependent upon the individual 
circumstances (i.e. medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to contact with the 
Study Sponsor. The Study Sponsor must be informed of all cases in which the code was 
broken and of the circums tances involved.  Additionally, the Study Sponsor may be required 
to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting requirements  
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The investigator  is responsible for adequate and safe medi cal care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator  should provide the study sponsor  with any new safety information (which 
includes new AE s and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to  study completion (i .e., database lock).

spontaneous (following the post - market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated 
to the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
The investigator  should also report complaints on non -Alcon products (i.e., Infuse contact 
lenses ) directly to the manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory 
requirements . 
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study  
Women of childbearing potential or women w ho are pregnant at the time of study entry are 
not excluded from participation. Pregnancy should be included in the Medical History section 
of the eCRF when a pregnant woman enters the study or if a woman becomes pregnant 
during the study. Pregnancy is not  reportable as an AE; however, complications may be 
reportable and will be decided on a case -by-case basis  .An Alcon form will be utilized to 
capture all pregnancy - related information until birth of the child.  
12 ANALYSIS PLAN

Alcon – Business Use Only  12.4.1.1  Statistical Hypotheses  
The null and alternative hypotheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority:  
H0: µ(T) – µ(C) ≥ 0.05  
Ha: µ(T) – µ(C) < 0.05  
where µ (T) and µ (C) denote the mean distance VA for DT1 and  Infuse, respectively, on the 
logMAR scale.  
12.4.1.2  Analysis Methods  
A mixed effect repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, period, and sequence as fixed effects. Within -subject correlation 
due to e ye and the crossover design will also be accounted for in the model. Lens difference 
(DT1 minus Infuse) and the corresponding one -sided 95% upper confidence limit will be 
computed. Noninferiority in distance VA will be declared if upper confidence limit is  less 
than 0 .05.

All data obtained in evaluable subjects/eyes will be included in the analysis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out  
 
12.6 Safety Analys es 
The safety endpoints are:  
• AEs  
• Biomicroscopy findings  
• Device Deficiencies  
There are no safety hypotheses planned in this study. The focus of the safety analysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of adverse events as well as the other 
listed parameters.  
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs inf ormed consent to study exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (frequencies and percentages) for 
ocular and nonocular AEs will be pres ented by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
Preferred Terms. AEs leading to study discontinuation and SAEs will be identified. Individual 
subject listings will be provided, as necessary.  
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur after signing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP.  
Each biomicroscopy parameter will be tabulated by its grade. For each applicable 
biomicroscopy parameter, counts and percentages of eyes that experience an increase of ≥ 2 
grades from basel ine (last assessment prior to study lens exposure) to any subsequent visit 
within the same period will be presented. A supportive listing will be generated which will 
include all biomicroscopy data from all visits within the same period for those eyes 
expe riencing the increase.

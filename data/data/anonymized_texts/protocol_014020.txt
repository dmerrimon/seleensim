Study Purpose  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pulse widths <500 µsec and 
>1000 µsec on clinical outcomes during a temporary SCS trial . 
Study Design 
and Scope  The proposed study is a prospective, multi -center, two -arm, randomized, 
crossover design to be conducted at up to 10 sit es. The study will enroll up to 
100 subjects in order to include up to 10 subjects in the study per site. Subjects 
selected to participate in the trial have back and/or leg pain, have been evaluated 
as a candidate for SCS and have agreed to undergo a tempo rary SCS trial using 
the Algovita® system with percutaneous leads. Each subject will be followed 
during the trial period of approximately 7+/-2 days. 
The study will end when the last subject has completed the trial period and 
exited. The expected enrollmen t period for this study is approximately six 
months. After exit from the clinical study, subjects will continue to be followed 
by their physician per usual care. All device and procedure -related AEs will be 
collected and reported per the study protocol. 
Primary 
Effectiveness 
Objective  Compare the change in the patient defined pain coverage map from baseline to 
the end of the 7+/-2 day trial. 
Secondary 
Effectiveness Objectives  Secondary measures of therapy effectiveness will include:  
• Compare the change fr om baseline of pain scores between the two study 
arms. Pain scores are obtained using the Numeric Rating Score (NRS) 
administered at baseline and after completion of each arm of the study.  
• Paresthesia distribution: At end of each arm, subjects will be aske d to 
complete a diagram that shows distribution of paresthesia.  
• At the end of the trial period, subjects will be asked to select their favorite 
program. 
• At the end of the trial period, subjects will be asked to rate the quality of 
the pain relief achieved during the trial (from either arm) using the 
following scale ; Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor . 
• At the end of the trial period, subjects will be asked to rate their overall 
satisfaction with the pain relief achieved during the trial (from either arm) 
using the following scale: Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neither Satisfied nor 
Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied,  or Very Unsatisfied . 
              
  Secondary 
Safety Objectives  Secondary measures of therapy safety will include:  
• Rate of device- related and/or procedure -related AEs from the Trial 
procedure through study completion. 
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL  
  iii Study Procedures  After the subject has consented to the study, he or she will be enrolled in the 
clinical study and undergo a baseline evaluation. The patient will then be 
randomly assigned to arm one (pulse with <500 µsec) or arm two (pulse width 
>1000 µsec) and undergo an Algovita® trial procedures. Following the trial 
procedure, the subject’s EPG will be set to the appropriate pulse width, based on 
the arm assigned, and then programmed to achieve optimal pain relief. For the 
next three days, the subject will evaluate pain relief generated by the 1st assigned 
program (arms).  
After 3 days, the patient will visit the Ohio Pain Clinic for data collection and 
then reprogramming of the EPG for the next arm. For the next thr ee days, the 
subject will evaluate the SCS therapy generated by the 2nd assigned program and 
then return to the clinic for data collection, removal of the leads and exit from 
the study. After the subject is exited from the study, he or she will be followed  
by the Ohio Pain Clinic per usual care. The data collection requirements are 
listed below.

  8 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Patients with chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs are typically trea ted on a continuum 
with less invasive therapies prescribed first. Established, non -surgical treatment options include, 
but are not limited to, oral medications, physical therapy, TENS, acupuncture, nerve blocks, 
radiofrequency ablation and other options based on clinical judgment. The surgical treatment options for these patients include surgery of the spine, sympathectomy, intrathecal drug pumps, 
and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) systems
i. 
 An advantage of a SCS system is that it is a reversible and nondestructive treatment option. The 
main principle of SCS therapy is pain suppression via the delivery of electrical signals to the spinal 
cord and related nerves through electrodes in the epidural space. An implantable pulse generator 
(IPG) is implanted under the skin, typically in the abdomen or buttock area, to generate mild electrical signals. The electrical signals typically produce paresthesia overlapping the area of pain 
for the patient. The IPG is programmed to deliver the electrical signals in a therape utic manner and 
is then activated by the patient as needed to assist in management of their pain. SCS therapy treatment is deemed successful if there is a 50% reduction in pain as measured by a numeric rating 
scale or visual analog scale. The most common u se of SCS therapy is for failed back surgery 
syndrome (FBSS) that affects up to 40% of patients who undergo spinal surgeries
ii iii iv v. 
 A candidate for SCS therapy is first tested by undergoing a trial procedure in which a temporary 
lead is implanted in the epidural space and then externalized and connected to eternal pulse 
generator (EPG). A temporary trial typically last 5 to 10 days and will allow the patient and doctor 
to determine the effectiveness of the therapy before undergoing a permanent implant.  
  SCS therapy has been in use since the early 1970s and has been implanted in over 600,000 patients 
to treat chronic pain. Over the past 30 years, SCS system technology has advanced from single 
channel IPGs with single contact leads to multi - channel IPGs wi th over 32 channels, rechargeable 
batteries, and lead designs improved for reliability and stability. Though the principles of operation 
of the SCS system have essentially remained the same, these advances have increased safety, 
efficacy and longevity of the therapy. 
 
The Algovita® SCS System is similar in design and performance to newer SCS systems from other medical device companies. The FDA approved Algovita® system has many advanced features 
including the ability to better control the shape of the elect rical pulse. One such feature is a longer 
pulse width range than the other systems on the market. Pulse width determines how long an electrical pulse is activated. A longer pulse width is not associated with any safety concerns as 
determined by the FDA. The intent and justification for this study is to understand if a longer pulse 
width provides better outcomes to patients.  
 Although the effects of pulse width are mentioned in many SCS investigations, it has been the 
primary focus of very few studies. Several decades ago, research was conducted into the technical 
aspects of SCS, including PW. In a study of SCS, Jobling showed that different patients required 
widely varying amplitudes of stimulation and concluded that 200 μsec was the optimum pulse 
durat ion, because it was the most energy - efficient
vi. In 1980, Davis and Gray concurred that 200 
μsec was the preferred PW to deliver adequate amplitude while conserving energyvii. Some 
published reports suggested that there was therapeutic value to having higher  parameter ranges than 
were available on previous primary cell IPGs. In addition, longer PWs have been anecdotally 
described as achieving better pain -paresthesia overlap and comfort for the patient, thus potentially 
more effective at relieving painviii.  
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL  
  9  
The introduction and widespread adoption of rechargeable IPGs for SCS has diminished the 
importance of energy efficient programming to prolong time between revision surgeries and resulted in longer pulse width settings in these systems. Gould and Bradley reported in a 
retrospective analysis of patient -preferred programs that over 50% of the programs used PWs in 
excess of 450 μs
ix. Yearwood et al. showed that 10/19 patients had greater coverage, and 8/19 
patients displayed “caudal shift” of paresthesia coverage with increased PWx. A mathematical 
model of electrical field and neural activation in SCS has shown good agreement with clinical data 
that a longer PW is associated with increased paresthesia coverage and a shift of the paresthesia 
coverage caudallyxi. 
 
Investigation into the clinical and technical effects of PWs may be important in the continued effort 
to more fully understand the mechanisms of SCS. In other neurostimulation applications, varied 
PW has been shown to provide large and small fiber neural selectivity, where shorter PWs 
maximized the difference between large and small fiber thresholdsxii. With advances in SCS 
technology, particularly rechargeable IPGs, patients are now being offered a wider range of parameters to treat their pain. In particular, P W programming ranges of the Algovita® system can 
be programmed up to 1500 μsec).

10.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
10.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
At each evaluation, the investigator will determine whether any adverse events 
(AE’s) have occurred.  For the purpose of this protocol, an adverse event  is any 
undesirable clinical occurrence in a subject that can be attributed to the device or incision closure procedure.  In this study, patients should be encouraged to report AE’s spontaneously or in response to general, non -directed questioning (e.g., “How has your health been 
since the last visit?”).  Any time during the study, the patient may volunteer information that resembles an AE.  If it is determined that an AE has occurred, the investigator should obtain all the information required to complete the AE Form of the CRF.  
 
The following categories of  adverse event severity are to be used:  
Mild  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the 
patient's usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and 
with no sequelae  
Moderate  Interferes with the patient's usual activity  
Severe  Any fatal or immediately life -threatening clinical experience that 
requires a subject to be hospitalized, or hospitalization is unduly 
prolonged because of potential disability or danger to life  or because 
an intervention has been necessitated.  This includes events that cause 
fetal distress, fetal death, congenital abnormality or malignancy or 
any permanently disabling event.  
 
10.2 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS  
The following ANTICIPATED EVENTS have been identified as possible 
complications of implanting neurostimulator  leads . 
• Infection at implant site  
• Pain at implant site  
• Bleeding  
• Bruising  
• Device failure  
o Unintended stimulation  
o Increased stimulation  
o Decreased stimulation  
o Lead breakage /migration  
o Battery depletion  
o Erosion of device 
o General device failure  
 
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL  
  21 10.3 UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS  
Unanticipated adverse device effects are defined as any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application),  or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of 
subjects.  
For the purposes of this study, serious is defined as any significant adverse 
experience, including those which may be either li fe-threatening or involve 
permanent or long term injuries, but excluding injuries that are non- life-threatening 
and that are temporary and reasonably reversible.  
An Investigator must submit to the sponsor and to the responsible Medical 
Ethics Committee ( I RB ) any unanticipated adverse device effects occurring 
during the study as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten (10) working 
days after the Investigator first learns of the effect.

  28 15.0 Declaration of Helsinki  
 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
 Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by the  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983  
41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989  
48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset  West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996 
and the 52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
  
1. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles 
to provide guid ance to physicians and other participants in medical research involving human subjects. Medical 
research involving human subjects includes research on identifiable human material or identifiable data.  
2. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguar d the health of the people. The physician's knowledge and 
conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, "The health 
of my patient will be my first co nsideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A 
physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of 
weakening the physical and mental condition of the patient."  
4. Medical  progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation involving human 
subjects.  
5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the human subject should take 
precedence over the interests of  science and society.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease. Even the best proven 
prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedu res 
involve risks and burdens.  
8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and protect their health 
and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and need special protection. The particular needs of the 
economically and medically dis advantaged must be recognized. Special attention is also required for those who 
cannot give or refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for 
those who will not benefit personally from the research and for t hose for whom the research is combined with 
care.  
9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for research on human 
subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international requirements. No national ethical, legal or 
regulatory requirement should be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set 
forth in this Declaration.  
2. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL  
  29 1. It is the duty of the physician in medical research to pro tect the life, health, privacy, and dignity of the human 
subject.  
2. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based 
on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and on adequate 
laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.  
3. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the environment, and the 
welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
4. The d esign and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly 
formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be submitted for consideration, comment, 
guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a specially a ppointed ethical review committee, which must be 
independent of the investigator, the sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This independent committee 
should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experi ment is 
performed. The committee has the right to monitor ongoing trials. The researcher has the obligation to provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially any serious adverse events. The researcher should also 
submit to the committee, for r eview, information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other 
potential conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects.  
5. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indica te that there is compliance with the principles enunciated in this Declaration.  
6. Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and 
under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for the human subject must 
always rest with a medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the 
subject has given consent.  
7. Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by  careful assessment of 
predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. This does not 
preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical research. The design of all studies should be publicly 
available.  
8. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they are confident 
that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians should cease 
any investigation if the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive 
and beneficial results.  
9. Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance of the objective 
outweighs the inherent risks and b urdens to the subject. This is especially important when the human subjects 
are healthy volunteers.  
10. Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in which the research is 
carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research.  
11. The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project.  
12. The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. Every precaution should be 
taken to respect the privacy of th e subject, the confidentiality of the patient's information and to minimize the 
impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
13. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequa tely informed of the aims, methods, 
sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated 
benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject should be info rmed of the 
right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's 
freely -given inf ormed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non -written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL  
  30 14. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious i f the 
subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In that case the informed 
consent should be obtained by a well -informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is 
completely independent of this  relationship.  
15. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent or is a 
legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized 
representative in accordance with applicable law. These groups should not be included in research unless the 
research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be 
performed on legally competent persons.  
16. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions about 
participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally 
authorized representative.  
17. Research o n individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance consent, 
should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed consent is a necessary 
characteristic of the research population. The sp ecific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition 
that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration 
and approval of the review committee. The protocol should state that consent t o remain in the research should 
be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.  
18. Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, the investigators 
are obliged to preserv e the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results should be published or 
otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest 
should be declared in the publication. Reports of  experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down 
in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
3. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
1. The physician may combine medical research with medical care , only to the extent that the research is justified 
by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical research is combined with medical 
care, additional standards apply to protect the patients who are research subjects.  
2. The benef its, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current 
prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in 
studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
3. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of access to the best proven 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the study.  
4. The physician should fu lly inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal 
of a patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the patient -physician relationship.  
5. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnos tic and therapeutic methods do not exist or have 
been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the patient, must be free to use unproven or new 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -
establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be made the object of 
research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, 
where appropriate, p ublished. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

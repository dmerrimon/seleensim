Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 6 3.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
3.1 Background Implanting aqueous drainage devices has become an increasingly common surgical treatment for 
glaucoma.  Medicare data between 1995 and 2004 demonstrated a steady increase in the use of these devices.
1,2 Even with the advent of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), aqueous drainage 
devices is still a mainstay of treatment for uncontrolled  intraocular pressure (IOP ).3  Currently, one of the 
most common aqueous drainage devices used is the Baerveldt implant ( Johnson & Johnson, Vision, 
Jacksonville, Florida) (Figures 1&2).

Baerveld t 101- 350 model that will be ut ilized  in this study.  
 
 
 Figure 2.  Depiction of typical Baerveldt implant once positioned and implanted on the eye.  
(www.towerclockeyecenter.com ) 
  The Baerveldt implant is an FDA -approved silicone, non- valved implant. This device comes in 3 variants: 
a single 250 mm
2 model and two 350 mm2 models (Figures 1&2). For the purposes of this study, we will 
be focusing on the Model BG-101-350, (Figures 1&2) which will be the only variant of the Baerveldt 
evaluated in this study.  As it is non -valved, it needs early restriction of fluid flow to minimize hypotony 
while the eye forms a fibrous capsule around the implant . One common way of restricting fluid flow is by 
ligating  or tying off the Baerveldt tube with an absorbable suture that dissolves  by post -operative week 4 
to 6. For better control of the tube opening and intraocular pressure reduction during the post- operative 

Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 7 period, many surgeons place a suture within the lumen of the implant , called a ripcord, at the time of 
surgery. This ripcord suture is accessible at the slit lamp in clinic.  
 The Ahmed ClearPath is a new ly developed  non-valved glaucoma drainage device that ente red United 
States markets in late 2019 (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) (Figure 2). This device comes in two sizes: a 250 mm
2 model (Figure 3A) and a 350 mm2 model (Figure 3B). W e will be focusing 
on the 350 mm2 model which will be the only variant of the ClearPath evaluated in this study.  There are 
several features of the ClearPath that are advertised as advantageous compared to the Baerveldt. For instance, the 350 mm
2 model features a posteriorly positioned plate in order to avoid intraocular muscle 
attachment points upon insertion. It  has a  flexible, contoured design and anteriorly positioned suture 
points which are intended to  optimize the process of device implantation for the surgeon , though this has 
not yet been confirmed. As it is non-valved  implant, it also requires early restriction for the same reasons 
mentioned for the Baerveldt. However , the ClearPath  device comes packaged with a pre-threaded 4-0 
polypropylene ripcord though some surgeons do replace this with sutures of differi ng materials or size per 
preference.

2 (A) and 350 mm2 (B) (www.newworldmedical.com).  
 
 
3.2 Rationale Previous studies  have compared the efficacy  of the Baerveldt to the older , valved Ahmed  FP7 glaucoma 
drainage device (Ahmed Glaucoma Valve; New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) . These 
studies have yielded mixed results, and many surgeons will opt to use e ither a Baerveldt or an Ahmed  FP7 
depending on a number of patient-dependent factors. However, there is currently no data published 
comparing the Baerveldt to the new, non -valved Ahmed ClearPath. We are interested in performing a 
head -to-head trial in orde r to compare  overall efficacy  and failure rates  of the Baerveldt as compared to 
the ClearPath . Criteria for device failure includes: IOP >18 mmHg or not reduced by 20% less than 
baseline on two consecutive visits after three months, IOP < 6 mmHg on two consecutive visits after three months, need for additional glaucoma surgery or device removal, and the loss of light perception vision. Given the similarities in design, in particular the equal sizes of the implant plate, we hypothesize that there is no difference in the efficacy of IOP reduction  or complication rates in patients who undergo Baerveldt 
implant v ersus those who undergo ClearPath implants. However, this can not be verified without sufficient 
investigation. The results of this study will provide important data for surgeons to select the most appropriate device to achieve favorable outcomes  while minimizing complications.  
  

Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 8 4.0 OBJECTIVE 
 To compare the post -operative surgical outcomes and complication rates in patients with a Baerveldt 350 
aqueous drainage device (model 101-350; Johnson & Johnson, Vision) vs  the Ahmed ClearPath implant 
(350 mm2; New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA).  5.0 STUDY DESIGN  AND METHODS  
 5.1 Experimental Design  
This is a randomized prospective study of post- operative surgical outcomes and complication rates in 
patients with a Baerveldt 350 implant vs  the Ahmed ClearPath implant. Each subject will be randomized 
to the Baerveldt group or ClearPath group at the time of consent for the study. A baseline eye exam will 
be conducted as per the study flowchart (Section 2). Surgeons will include  
• Pratap Challa, MD  
• Jiaxi Ding, MD  
• Sharon Freedman, MD 
• Divakar Gupta, MD 
• Leon W. Herndon Jr, MD 
• Thomas G. L. Hunter, MD 
• Stuart J. McKinnon, MD, PhD 
• Filipe Medeiros, MD, PhD 
• Frank J. Moya, MD  
• Kelly Muir, MD 
• Jullia Rosdahl, MD 
• Henry Tseng, MD, PhD 
• Molly Walsh, MD 
• Joanne Wen, MD 
 It will not be possible for the surgeon to be masked  given that s/he will be implanting the device. The 
subject will then be seen on post-operative day 1 (±1 day), week 1 (±5 days), week 4 (±1 week), week 6 
(±1 week), month 3 (±1 week), month 6 (± 2 weeks) and year 1(±1 month) as per the standard-of- care 
post- operative schedule.  At each of these post operative visits, ophthalmic exams will be conducted, 
collecting data such to be in accordance with the study flowchart (Section 2).  
 5.2 Subject Selection  
Subjects will be identified from patients presenting for ophthalmologic consultation at the Duke Eye Center and/or one of its satellite clinical locations. Individuals with uncontrolled glaucoma are routinely available from this clinic and will be the prim ary study group. A care provider known to the patient will 
introduce the study and his/her ophthalmologist will be asked for prior approval to enroll the patient.  The target enrollment will be approximately 304 subjects.  Subjects will not be compensated for participation. 
All adults meeting study criteria (as detailed in Section 6.0) will be asked to participate.  
Informed consent will be obtained for each patient. The surgeon or his /her study staff will initially 
approach potential subjects for consent. During the consent process, the person obtaining consent will  
inform the potential subject of all elements of informed consent and shall discuss the nature of the study, its requirements and its restrictions. Adequate time will  be allowed for the potential  subject to ask 
questions prior to deciding whether to participate in the study.   
 
Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 9 5.3 Sample Size  
Approximately 152 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment gr oup for a total of approximately 304 
subjects. This sample size was based on a power analysi s aimed at detecting a 2 mmHg difference in IOP 
between the Baerveldt and ClearPath groups with 80% power, using the mean post- op year 1 Baerveldt 
IOP of 13.6±5.9 mmHg from the pooled AVB and ABC data.4 The results were adjusted for an expected 
10% drop out rate at 1 year.  
 
5.4 Baseline Evaluation  
The initial evaluation for glaucoma and need for surgical intervention will include a standard -of-care 
ophthalmic examination that is performed by a licensed ophthalmologist . Collection of all data will be 
under the supervision of a licensed ophthalmologist  5.5 Study Evaluation  
If the potential subject meets the criteria for study -inclusion and consent s to participate following full 
explanation of the research , the subject will be randomly assigned to either group. The subject’s baseline 
exam findings will be documented, including:  age, sex, race, glaucoma diagnosis and cause, ocular history 
(including prior treatments and procedures), best- corrected Snellen visual acuity, IOP by Goldmann 
applanation tonom etry (masked, 2-person) , glaucoma medications, slit l amp findings , external exam 
findings, motility exam, Humphrey Visual Field, Optical Coherence Tomography, and a patient reported -
reported dysesthesia scale.     5.6 Randomization  and Masking 
At the time of consent,  subjects will be randomized to receive either the Baerveldt or ClearPath  according 
to a computer -generated randomization code.  Study subjects will be masked as to which implant they will 
receive. In the patient chart, the device will be noted at a glaucoma drainage device (GDD).  
 5.7 Duration of Subject Participation  
Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 1 year . Participation will include an initial 
evaluation where the decision to undergo implantati on of Baerveldt or ClearP ath implant is made and a 
baseline visit.  Following surgery, the patient will be evaluated per study schedule (detailed in Section 2.0) 
 5.8 Duration of Study The clinical portion of the study will last approximately 1 year  for each patient enrolled. Study recruitment 
is anticipated to occur over the cour se of 2 years with 1 year follow up for each patient enrolled. 
Therefore, we anticipate a total study duration of 3 years.

 7.0 STUDY SCHEDULE  (see Flowchart)  
All study procedures are performed as standard of care for the condition.    7.1 Surgical Procedure The patient will undergo standard  supero temporal or inferonasal  placement of either a Baerveldt or 
ClearPath implant, which may include placement of a suture ripcord as per the surgeon’s preference. The methods utilized to place the tube will vary based on surgeon preference to enhance the generalizability of the resul ts.  
 7.2 Post- operative interval visits  
The subject will be evaluated at post -operative day 1 (±1 day), week 1 (±5 days), week 4 (±1 week), week 
6 (±1 week), month 3 (±1 week1), month 6 (±2 weeks), and year 1 (±1 month) as described in Section 2.0 . 
Additional appointments may  be made as deemed necessary per standard -of-care.  The subject will 
undergo a standard of care post- operative evaluation including assessment of visual acuity, slit lamp 
biomicroscopy, and tonometry at each interval visit . Additi on of glaucoma medications will be at the 
surgeon’s discretion throughout the post- operative period  in addition to standard post-operative eye drops, 
which includes an  antibiotic eye drop, a steroid eye drop, and an antibiotic ointment . Ripcord removal and 
additional glaucoma surgery will be at the surgeon’s discretion throughout the post-operative period.  
 7.3 Post- operative visit year 1  (± 1 month) 
The subject will undergo a standard of care post- operative assessment of visual acuity, slit lamp 
biomicroscopy, and tonometry. At the year 1 post- operative visit, subjects will also undergo visual field  
testing, optical coherence tomography, pachymetry, and motility testing . Subjects will also complete self -
report questionnaires pertaining to  dysesthesia and quality of life.  
  8.0 SUBJECT MONITORING AND DATA COLLECTION PLAN  
Clinically indicated care will be provided to all subjects as required. Descriptive statistics will be applied to safety assessments .  
Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 11  
8.1 Statistical Considerations  8.1.1 Analysis Plan The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subj ects who had at least one post -op 
assessment. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population with Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). If a subject is deemed to hav e a failed surgery and undergoes a rescue 
procedure, the last observation collected prior to the intervention will be used  for efficacy analyses at all 
later timepoints.    8.1.2 Study hypotheses The analysis will be based on the following null hypothesis:   there is no difference in IOP or complication 
rates in patients who undergo Baerveldt implant vs those who undergo ClearPath implants . 
 8.1.3 Sample Size Considerations With a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, a sample size of 152 in each group would be required to detect a 
2 mm difference in IOP with  80% power (accounting for a 10% drop out rate). The total planned 
enrollment for this pilot study is approximately 304 subjects   8.1.4 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistical analysis of patient characteristics across the 2 treatment groups will be performed. Snellen VA measurements will be converted to logMAR equivalents for the purpose of data analysis. Student t test for continuous variables, Fisher exact test, and the χ2 test, or exact permutation χ2 test for categorical variables will be utilized. All tests will be 2 -sided in accordance with our hypothesis. A P-
value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
 9.0 HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTION  9.1 Safety and Confidentia lity 
No long- term safety concerns are anticipated as a result of study interventions  as both devices are FDA 
approved.  The surgeon and his /her study staff will monitor safety events on a regular basis. Afte r-hours 
contact information will be provided to all study participants in case of an adverse event. Subject records will be maintained on a password -protected computer or in a locked file, and a study -assigned 
identification number will be used in lieu of th e subject’s name or personal identifiers on data summary 
sheets.   
 9.2 Subject Consent:  A consent form has been developed that describes the nature of the research, the risk/benefit ratio, and the voluntary nature of subject involvement. Consent will be obtained directly from the participant in a private location within the clinic by the study PI, study coor dinator, or other study staff. Potential s ubjects will be 
given a verbal explanation of the research and then will be granted ample time to read the co nsent form or 
have the consent read to them if necessary, and permitted to ask questions. Subjects unwilling to provide signed consent will not be enrolled.  
 9.3 Risks and Benefits:   As both arms of this study are consistent with current standard-of- care practices, we do not anticipate any 
increase in rates of complication compared to the reported rates in published literature.     
Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 12 9.4 Discomforts and Inconveniences:   
The expected discomforts and inconveniences are related to the placement of a Baerveldt or ClearP ath 
implant and the time required in the standard -of-care post- operative follow u p. Participation in this study 
is not expected to add any significant discomfort and/or inconv enience to the subject as the study 
interventions and follow-up schedule are utilized in current standard of care post- operative management.   
 
9.5 Discontinuation of Treatment and Withdrawal of Subjects 
The reasons why a subject may discontinue or be with drawn from the study include, but are not limited to, 
adverse effects, subject request, investigat or request, protocol violation and lost to follow -up.   
 10.0 ETHICS  
This study will not commence without approval of  the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed 
consent forms, and other relevant documents from the Duke IRB.  The study  will be performed in 
accordance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and  applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. Additionally, the study will be 
conducted accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

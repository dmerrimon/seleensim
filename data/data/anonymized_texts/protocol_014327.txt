 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 3 Background and Rationale  
RISK CALCULATOR  (Parent grant)  
Epidemiology seeks to improve public health by identifying risk factors for cancer and other diseases and 
conveying that information to relevant audiences (e.g., physicians, the public).  The audience is presumed to 
understand and use that information to m ake appropriate decisions about lifestyle behaviors and medical 
treatments.  Yet, even though a single risk factor can affect the risk of multiple health outcomes, this 
information is seldom communicated to people in a way that optimizes their understandin g of the importance of 
engaging in a single healthy behavior.[1]  Providing individuals with the ability to understand how a single 
behavior (obtaining sufficient physical activity) could affect their risk of developing multiple diseases could 
foster a more coherent and meaningful picture of the behavior’s importance in  reducing health risks, and 
increase motivation and intentions to engage in the behavior.  
We will test  the effectiveness of a risk calculator that conveys individualized risk estimates for colon cancer, 
heart disease, diabetes, stroke , and breast cancer (w omen) to socio -demographically diverse laypeople who 
do not get 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per day.  Estimates of how the participant’s risk 
would change if they were to engage in at least 3 hours of moderate intensity activity per  week will also be 
provided.  
MENTAL IMAGERY  (Supplement)  
Although risk calculators can improve comprehension and produce favorable changes in health cognitions that 
lead to behavior change (e.g., accuracy of perceived risk, response efficacy, intentions), the effect of 
calculators on behavior itself is modest.[2-4]  However, the gap between intentions and behavior can be bridged 
via intervention s that help people develop self -regulatory skills, such as developing action plans for how to 
achieve each step of the behavior.[5-8]  Mental imagery may be particularly useful  in the development and 
realization of these plans.[5, 9, 10]   
We will adapt an existing and effective mental imagery -based self -regulation physical activity intervention[5] for 
incorporation into the working risk calculator and compare its effectiveness in increasing physical activity 
behavior  to an active control that addresses sleep hygiene.  
RISK CALCULATOR AND MENTAL IMAGERY  (Conceptual Model)  
The conceptual model was adapted from the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA).[8]  It asserts that 
behavior change occurs in two phases.  The motivation phase  is most relevant for people who do not engage 
in the recommended behavior.  The goal of interventions that target the motivation phase – such as the risk 
calculator – is to increase intentions  to engage in the behavior.  Risk perceptions  are important in this phase 
because they raise awareness of the consequences of not engaging in the behavior.  Together with outcome 
expectancies  (e.g., the expected consequences of engaging in the behavior, operationalized here as response 
efficacy ), perceived severity  of the health outcome,  and action self -efficacy  (i.e., confidence in one’s ability to 
initiate a new behavior), risk perceptions  influence intentions to start the behavior change process.  Note that 
the risk calculator is not expected to increase action self -efficacy  or perceived severity  because it was not 
designed with a component to target  those constructs.  
We enhanced the motivation phase of the conceptual model with additional components drawn from risk 
perception and communication research.  Comprehension  of information was added because perceptio ns and 
comprehension are slightly different constructs that each have an important role in influencing health behavior 
and decisions.[11]  Worry , affective reaction  to the information, affective attitudes  to exercise, and anticipated 
regret  were  added because a growing body of research demonstrates that affect and emotion are integral to 
the formation of risk perceptions, in increasing motivation to change behavior, and in changing behavior 
itself.[12-17]  Demographics, numeracy, health literacy, and graph literacy  were added because they are 
associated with the ability to understand and use health risk information.[18-20] 
According to HAPA, p rogression to the action  phase  is dependent upon factors  not included in the motivation 
phase.  These new factors include developing action  plans  for engaging in the behavior , coping plans  for 
overcoming barriers to action, maintenance self -efficacy  (i.e., confidence in the ability to overcome barriers to 
acting), and recovery self -efficacy  (i.e., confidence in the abil ity to recover from a relapse ).  
 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 4 Objective s 
RISK CALCULATOR  
To compare the effectiveness of communicating personalized risk estimates via text, table , or risk ladder.  
Primary outcomes hypotheses  and exploratory research questions  
H1:   Comprehension of risk information and intentions to increase physical activity will be higher 
among individuals who see multiple disease risks presented as a risk ladder than as text.  
RQ1: Prior research has shown that tables can be effective in communicating risk information.[21]  
Compared to the table, w ill the risk ladder elicit higher comprehension and intentions?  
Secondary outcomes hypotheses  and exploratory research questions  
H2:   Any significant effect of the risk ladder on intentions will be mediated by comprehension, risk 
perceptions, response efficacy, worry , affective reactions  to information , affective attitudes  to 
exercise , and anticipated regret.  
H3:   Engagement in physical activity will i ncrease from baseline to 90 day follow -up to a greater extent 
for individuals who see the risk ladd er than those who see text only.  
H4:   Intentions will mediate any significant  effect of the risk ladder on physical activity . 
RQ2: Compared to the table, w ill the risk ladder elicit higher risk perceptions, response efficacy, worry , 
affective reactions to information, affective attitudes to exercise, and anticipated regret ? 
Sociodemographic exploratory research questions  
RQ3: Will education, race/ethnicity, numeracy, health literacy, and/or graph literacy moderate the effect 
of risk communication strategy on primary outcomes?  
MENTAL IMAGERY  
To test whether supplementing the risk calculator with a mental imagery -based self -regulation  intervention will 
increase actual engagement in phy sical activity  over time, and to explore  several possible mechanisms . 
Primary outcome  and exploratory research questions  
H5:   Engagement in physical activity will increase from baseline to 90 -day follow -up only among 
individuals in the physical activity mental imagery intervention ,[5, 7-9] not in the sleep hygiene 
imagery active control  condition.  
RQ5: Will education, race/ethnicity, numeracy, health literacy, and/or graph literacy moderate the effect 
of mental imagery condition on behavior?  
Secondar y outcome s and exploratory research quest ions 
H6:   Within the physical activity mental imagery condition, increases in activity from pre -intervention 
baseline to 90 -day follow -up will be preceded  by the following measures assessed at the week 4 
follow -up: action  planning, coping planning, action  self-efficacy, maintenance self -efficacy, 
recovery self -efficacy, affect ive attitudes  to exercise , and perceived vividness of imagery.[5, 7-9, 16] 
RQ6: Within the physical acti vity mental imagery condition, the direction and magnitude of change in 
activity from pre -intervention baseline to week 1  follow -up will be preceded  by the following 
measures assessed at the survey assessed immediately post -intervention: action planning, 
coping planning, action self -efficacy, maintenance self -efficacy, recovery self -efficacy, affective 
attitudes to exercise, and perceived vividness of imagery .[5, 7-9, 16]  Similarly, measures assessed at 
week 1 will predict change in behavior from week 1 to week 2; measures assessed at week 2 will 
predict behavior change from week 2 to week 3; and measures assessed at week 3 will predict 
behav ior change from week 3 to week 4.  
Eligibility Criteria  
 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 5 RISK CALCULATOR AND MENTAL IMAGERY   
Inclusion c riteria are: 30-64 years of age, less than three relevant comorbidities (diabetes, heart disease, 
stroke and cancer, where cancer counts as 2 comorbiditie s for women but 1 for men  due to the statistical 
properties of the risk calculator ), having a SMS /text capable mobile phone that is not shared with anyone else, 
text messaging more than once a month, and not meeting national guidelines for aerobic physical activity (i.e., 
at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity) .[22] 
Registration Procedure  
RISK CALCULATOR AND MENTAL IMAGERY   
Participants will be recruited from the Recruitmen t Enhancement Core (REC), reasearchmatch.org, the Health 
Communication Research Lab’s  FReDa database, word of mouth, newspaper advertisements, and a database  
maintained by the Waters  Lab.  REC will follow their established standard procedures by posting in formation 
about the study in BJC today (Appendix P: Aim 2, BJC Ad), on the REC website (Appendix T: Aim 2, Website 
posting), Facebook (Appendix R: Aim 2, Facebook Posting), Centerwatch (Appendix Q: Aim 2, Centerwatch 
Ad), and newspaper advertisements (Appe ndix CC, Newspaper Advertisement).  REC will forward interested 
participants’ contact information to the study team, who will make outbound calls to potential participants.  
Researchmatch.org will email registry members with information about the study (Ap pendix U: Aim 2, 
Researchmatch.org email), and offer participants a chance to contact the study team if they are interested in 
participating.  The study team will make outbound calls and emails to members of the HCRL FReDa database 
and Waters Lab  database (Appendix N: Aim 2, Screening Call Script; Appendix O: Ai m 2, Recruitment Email 
Script).  
In addition, we will also recruit participants in person at various locations around St. Louis.  The location s will 
be determined by the REC  and will include publicly available places with private space available, like 
laundromats , libraries, and community centers.  In this case, research assistants will speak with potential 
participants in person to assess interest in the study.  If potential  participants are interested in participating in 
the study, research assistants will go through appendix H, the eligibility screener.  If the participant is eligible, 
the study team member will record the participant’s contact information on Appendix I, th e Contact Info Sheet.  
If the participant is able to conduct the data collection session immediately, the research assistant will continue 
on to begin the data collection session following Appendix W (Aim 2 Data collection session 1 guide).   If the 
partici pant is not able to conduct the data collection session immediately, we will schedule a time for the 
session at a later date, or offer times for walk -in sessions.  Study coordinators will schedule sessions to take 
place either at the Taylor Avenue Building  (Wash U) or at a mutually agreed upon public place with adequate 
private space to conduct the interview (e.g. a meeting room at a library).  When the participant arrives for the 
session, the research assistant w ill explain the study procedures, obtain wri tten consent , and begin data 
collection.  
 
We will enroll 500 participants .  Recruitment will be stratified based on race ( at least 50% racial /ethnic minority) 
and education ( at least 50% will have no college experience ) to ensure adequate representation of  populations 
that experience health disparities  and, consequently, to increase relevance  of the intervention to those groups . 
Research  Plan 
RISK CALCULATOR AND MENTAL IMAGERY  
Design  
This study will use  a 3 (risk presentation  condition : text vs. table vs. risk ladder) x 2 (mental imagery  condition : 
physical activity vs. sleep hygiene) experimental design.   Participants will be block randomized to ensure that 
each of the 6 experimental conditions has equal numbers of participants at the end of the study.   
Randomization will occur by the computer program after eligibility screening and consent, but prior to engaging 
in any study activities.    
Blinding  
 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 6 The research staff will be blinded to participants’ risk presentation conditions, but they will unblinded to mental 
imagery condition.  This unblinding was the result of a combination of the block randomization (which 
prevented us from preparing packets of study materials ahead of time and assigning participants to condition in 
order of completion (e.g., A, B,  C, D, E, F)), and the need for the goal cards  and Baseline Survey 2 to include 
information specific to the mental imagery condition the participant was assigned to (see below).  
Procedure  
The procedures for the study will occur in 3 parts.   Part 1 is an initial 45  minute data collection session in 
person, followed by (Part 2) reminders and surveys conducted by Short Message Service (SMS) text  
messaging over the subsequent 4 weeks, and (Part  3) a final mailed survey on paper .  The last half of Part 1 
and all of Part 2 are adapted from prior research conducted by Linda Cameron for use with University of 
Auckland employees.[5, 9]  We worked closely with Dr. Cameron to adapt the interventions so they would be 
acceptable to our St. Louis community sample (e.g., minimize burden, reduce the need for Internet access , to 
accom modate cell phone plans that do not have unlimited text and/or data, etc ).  This adaptation was 
performed in Spring 2017 and involved 3 sets of cognitive interviews, each set including 6 -7 participants ( Aim 
2, Part 1 ). 
Part 1, Baseline Intervention  Adminis tration and Data Collection .  Participants will complete all baseline 
activities in person with a research assistant .  After completing eligibility screening and informed consent 
processes, participants will use a smartphone provided by research staff to complete the risk calculator  portion 
of the study .  The research assistant will enter the participant ID into the responsive website, and then the 
participant will provide information about their demographic s, health behaviors, and personal and family heal th 
history  (Appendix A Aim 2, Risk Display App Screens , pg. 2 -34).  The website then provides participants with 
personalized risk results for their current activity level and how it would change if they began exercising 
regularly.   Results are displayed ei ther as alphanumeric text, table, or  risk ladder (Appendix A Aim 2, Risk 
Display App Screens , pg. 35 -38).  Afterwards , the participant will complete Baseline Survey 1 independently on 
paper  (Appendix C, Instructions Appendix HH ).   
Immediately after completing Baseline Survey 1, participants will begin the mental imagery component of the 
study.  The research assistant will enter the participant’s personal phone number into the website so they can 
receive text messages for the next 4 weeks.  Then, participants will use the smartphone and headphones 
provided by the research team to listen to an audiorecording that walks the participant through how to set a 
physical activity or sleep goal  and asks them to imagine themselves exercising or  improving their sleep 
hygiene ( Appendix A Aim 2, Risk Display App Screens , pg. 39-42; Appendices D and E, Mental Imagery audio 
recording scripts).  Participants will be asked to practice this mental imagery twice a day for 5  minutes each 
day the subsequen t weeks.  The audio recording also instructs the participant to write down an exercise or 
sleep -related goal on a pamphlet provided by the research assistant (Appendix F, Pamphlet ).  Participants will 
then complete Baseline Survey 2 independently on paper (Appendices L and M).  Based on the cognitive 
interviews conducted in Spring, 2017, Part 1 will take approximately 45 minutes.  Participants will receive  a $20 
gift card to Schnucks for their time and effort.  
Part 2, SMS/Text Message Intervention and Data Collection .  Beginning at 7:00pm on the day the 
participant completes the Baseline/Part 1 activities , the participant will begin receiving text messages related to 
the study.  The first texts will welcome them to the study and provide information about how to contact the Lab, 
how to stop the texts from being sent, and how to access the audiorecording to which they were assigned 
(physical activity vs. sleep ).  At noon on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, they will be sent 1 of 3 texts that 
remind them to practice the imagery presented in the audio recording twice daily for five minutes each time.  
These reminders will continue for 3 weeks.  Each week after t he 3rd reminder they will rece ive a text message 
based survey.  A final text message based survey will be sent one week after the third text message based 
survey.  The content and schedule for the text messages and text surveys are found in Appendices X an d Y 
(Text Message Reminders and Survey - Exercise, Sleep) .  Each text message length is no more than 160 
characters, including spaces, to fit within the universal constraints of SMS messaging protocols.  This was 
done to avoid having 1 intended message bein g sent in multiple pieces.  The total participation time per week 
is estimated to be approximately 10 minutes.  Participants will earn a $10 gift card to Schnucks for each text 
mess age survey they complete.   This amount is intended to help offset the cost of text messages for 
participants who may not have unlimited text messaging.  
 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 7 Part 3, Mailed 90-Day Follow -Up Survey .  Ninety days after Baseline/Part 1 , participants will receive a 
final follow -up study survey (Appendix BB) in the mail  along with a written survey invitation (Appendix AA) . If 
participants do not complete the first mailed survey, we will follow -up with one reminder call (Appendix Z) and 
one additional mailed survey.  The survey is expected to take approximate 15 minutes.  Participants will 
receive a $20 gift card for Schnucks for completing the follow -up survey.  
Part 4, Follow -Up Phone Call .  Within one year of the final follow up period, we may contact up to 2 0 
participants by phone and ask them questions about their  experience and  thoughts on the study process 
(Appendix II).   If this occurs, the phone call will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  
Measures    
To reduce participant burden, we limit the number of survey questions by adapting single item measures used 
in nationally representative surveys and in published empirical research.  Many items are identical or very 
similar to the items in Aim 1  and Aim 2,  Part 1  of the study.  All items for the proposed research, including items 
that were adapted or developed specifically for Aim 2, Part 2, underwent cognitive testing in either Aim 2, Part 
1 or in prior research studies conducted by the Waters Lab.   Adapta tions to the items intended for use in the 
text messaging surveys (160 -character limit) were made in close collaboration with Linda Cameron, who was 
the initial developer of the interventions.  Table 1 below provides each of the measures that will be asses sed in 
each part of the survey.

Note:  Race and education will be assessed during eligibility for recruitment stratification purposes only.  Baseline 
Survey 1 excludes characteristics that will be assessed in the R isk Assessment  questionnai re. 
 
 
Statistical Considerations  
Preliminary Analyses  
We will begin by using descriptive statistics to understand the frequency and distributional properties of all 
items.  For variables with non -normal distributions, data transformations or non -parametric tests will be used 
for subsequen t analyses.   
Cronbach  will be used to test the internal consistency of multi -item constructs in Baseline Survey 1 (i.e., 
cognitive and affective perceived risk; response efficacy; action self -efficacy; affective reaction to the 
information; affective at titude about exercise; anticipated regret; intentions to engage in physical activity, 
message acceptance), Baseline Survey 2 (i.e., message acceptance, perceived clarity and vividness of 
images), and the Follow -Up Survey (i.e., intentions, action self -efficacy, cognitive and affective perceived risk, 
response efficacy, anticipated regret, affective attitude about exercise).  Where  ≥ .70 we will create a scale 
by averaging responses to a given construct across diseases.  That average score will be used in subsequent 
analyses.  Comprehension, numeracy, and graph literacy will each be operationalized as continuous variables 
comprised of the number of items answered correctly.  
Next, we will verify that participant characteristics (i.e., demographics, personal diagnosis of one of the target 
 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 9 diseases, self -reported health status, numeracy, health literacy, graph literacy, pre -intervention minutes of 
physical activity per week) are equivalent across experimental conditions by conducting t -tests, one -way 
ANOVAs, ch i-square tests, or other tests, as appropriate.  If any differences are found, these variables will be 
included in subsequent analyses as potential covariates.  Personal characteristics will also be explored to 
determine if they are related to the outcomes  of interest.  Any characteristic that has a significant association 
with the outcomes will be included in subsequent analyses as potential covariates.  
Main Analyses  
All hypotheses and research questions will be examined using separate analyses for each outcome variable.  
Assumptions of each type of test will be checked (e.g., assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance 
for ANOVAs).  If there are violations, n on-parametric tests will be used instead.  Sex will be a covariate 
because there are no valid prediction models for male breast cancer, so men will not be shown a breast cancer 
risk estimate.  The inclusion of other personal characteristics as covariates w ill be determined by the results of 
the preliminary analyses.  Tests of moderation will be conducted by creating interaction terms between the risk 
presentation condition or mental imagery condition variable s, as appropriate,  and the variable assessing the  
moderator of interest.  All statistical tests will be based on list -wise deletion except structural equation models, 
which can accommodate missing data.  
Mediation analyses will be conducted using s tructural equation modeling  (SEM).  Full Information Maxim um 
Likelihood estimation (FIML)[44] will be used to allow the inclusion of missing data.  Standardized estimates will 
be calculated and bias -corrected bootstrapping will be used to obtain the 95% confidence intervals.[45-48]  
Criteria assessing model fit will also be examined  (e.g., Standardized Root Mean Square Residual ≤.08, 
comparative fit index ≥.95, root mean square error of approximation ≤.06).[49, 50]  Mediational analyses will 
examine each construct as an individual mediator first, and then as a multiple mediator model.  
Table 2 below describes the analyses that will be conducted for each hypothesis or research question.

Sample Size Calculations  
We will enroll 500 participants at baseline.  This will enable us to test the primary hypothesis for each of the 
components of the study.  This calculation was based on the information below.  
RISK CALCULATOR  
Sample size was calculated to be able to detect an effect of risk presentation strategy on the primary outcome 
variables comprehension and intentions (Risk Calculator Hypothesis 1 and RQ1).  Based on a 2 -sided test of 
means for 3 groups (ANOVA) at 80% powe r, =.05, df=2, and Cohen’s f effect size of 0.15 (approximately 
equivalent to Cohen’s d of 0.3),[51, 52] we anticipate needing 432 participants.  The effect size estima te was 
based on a study of personalized breast cancer risk and risk reduction communication that found an effect on 
intentions to increase physical activity of approximately f=0.25 and an effect on response efficacy of 
approximately f=0.20.[4]  However, most of those participants were white, highly educated, had high health 
literacy, and recruited from a breast health center.  Thus, we can expect the findings in our more diverse 
sample to be somewhat lower.  We chose f=.15 as a reasonable compr omise because it represents slightly 
more than a minimal effect,[53] but is also logistically feasible.  To account for the possibility of 10% missing 
data in Baseline Survey 1, which assesses the constructs for the Risk Calculator Hypothesis 1, we would need 
to enroll 480 participants to obtain 432 comple ted surveys.  
MENTAL IMAGERY  
Dr. Cameron’s prior self -regulatory intervention accounted for approximately 20% of the unique variance in 
physical activity at 4 -week follow -up.[5]  This is approximately equivalent to a Cohen’s d effect size of 1.0, which 
is considered a large effect.[53]  Because our follow -up is 90 days, we can expect that our effect size will be 
somewhat lower.  Other self -regulation interventions yielded smaller effects over varying timeframes (e.g., 
d=0.28 -0.78).[7]  Thus, pow ering the study to detect an effect of d=0.30  of the intervention on behavior (Mental 
 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 11 Imagery Hypothesis 5) would be conservative and reasonable.  Based on a 2 -sided test of means for 2 groups 
(t-test) at 80% power, =.05, and Cohen’s d effect size of 0.30 ,[51, 52] we anticipate needing 352 participants  at 
90-day follow -up.  To account for the possibility of 30% attrition rate due to our underserved sample 
(unpublished data), we expect needing to enroll 500 participants at baseline to achieve this goal.

Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
RISK CALCULATOR AND MENTAL IMAGERY  
Voluntary participation  
We will protect against emotional discomfort by emphasizing that participation is voluntary.  Participants will 
provide informed consent.  They will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they can elect not to 
answer any question that makes t hem uncomfortable or withdraw at any time during the study without any 
penalty. Additionally, participants will be informed that all study data will be kept confidential and that all 
personal identifiers will be destroyed when the study is completed.  
Confi dentiality and Data Security  
There are several layers of protection regarding confidentiality and data security.  
First, the study is undergoing  a Washington University Information Security Office IRB Study Security review.  
A detailed description of our st udy’s confidentiality and data security features is described in that document . 
(see Appendix JJ).   
 Communicating Multiple Disease Risk, Aim 2, Par t 2 (Version 1) 12 Second, the websites that host the data (i.e., Amazon Web Services and Twilio) have extensive security 
precautions.  These precautions are being reviewed b y the Information Security Office (see Appendices JJ, 
KK, and LL ). 
Third, t he study team will be alert for any potential breaches to prevent inadvertent release of confidential 
information.  If a potential breach in confidentiality occurs, the PI will work with the Institutional Review Board , 
HIPAA, and the Information Security Office according to their rules and regulations for such a situation.  
Fourth, all study data will be downloaded to WUSM servers on a daily basis.  Access to data will be password  
protected to restrict use by non -study personnel.  All data will be stored using ID numbers, not names. 
Participants’ responses to study questions will be coded to protect their confidentiality, and names will be kept 
separate from survey data.  Any data that is transported on portable storage devices will be encrypted. Hard 
copies collected at the in person recruitment loca tions will be transferred to storage by an RA in a closed 
envelope and will not leave sight of the RA until securely stored . All paper  copies will be  will be stored in a 
locked filing cabinet in a loc ked suite in an entry controlled building . No personally identifying information will 
appear in any presentations or publications that results from this study; only aggregated data will be 
disseminated.  
Record Keeping  
RISK CALCULATOR AND MENTAL IMAGERY  
Records will be maintained by the study coordinator and supervised by the PI.  All information will be recorded 
in password -protected databases and held on WUSM servers, which are encrypted and  backed up nightly.  
The study coordinator  will record the following pieces of information:  
• Participants’ contact information , which is needed for the text messaging and follow up activities (i.e., 
Parts 2 and 3) . 
• Survey responses, which are linked to participants via an individual identifier but are not linked to 
names or contact information.  
Paper copies of study materials will be kept in a locked filing cabinet located within a locked office suite.   For 
additional information, see Data Safety and Mon itoring Plan .

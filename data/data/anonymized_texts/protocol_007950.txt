A Phase 1b/2 Study of FT -2102 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Gliomas with an IDH1 
Mutation   
Cohort 1  will include 16-46 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory glioma (per World Health 
organization [ WHO] criteria 2016) with confirmed IDH1 mutation.  
Cohort 2 will include approximately 21- 78 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory hepatobili ary 
tumors with confirmed IDH1 mutation previously treated with an approved therapy for hepatobiliary 
cancer (HBC). 
Cohort 3 will include approximately 16- 46 evaluable patients with recurrent, refractory or either locally 
advanced or metastatic chondrosarcoma with confirmed IDH1 mutation not amenable to complete 
surgical excision.  
Cohort 4 will include approximately 21- 77 evaluable patients with advanced, nonresectable or 
metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with confirmed IDH1 mutation not eligible for curative resection or transplantation.  
Cohort 5 will include up to 6 patients with relapsed or refractory other tumors with confirmed IDH1 
mutation . 
Study Duration:  
It is estimated that this study will last approximately 30 months. The expected duration of study 
treatment for each patient will be approximately 26 weeks.  
Patients will remain on study treatment (either single -agent FT -2102 or combination therapy) until  
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . 
Patients will be followed for safety for 28 days  after last dose of study drug or until resolution or 
stabilization of ongoing adverse events ( AEs).  
Patients may be followed for survival approximately every 3 months for up to 24 months from first 
dose of study treatment or for up to 12 months after treatment discontinuation (whichever is longer).  
The end of the study will be defined as last patient last visit (LPLV) . 
Study Centers:  
Enrollment is anticipated at approximately 50 global sites  (in North America, Europe, and Asia 
Pacific).

FT-2102  
(Version 5) 28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 113  Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, Phase 1b/2, open -label, multiple -cohort study examining the efficacy and safety 
of FT -2102 as a single agent or in combination for the treatment of patients with advanced solid 
tumors and gliomas with an IDH1 R132X mutation.  
The starting dose of FT -2102 is 150 mg twice daily ( BID) admini stered continuously in 28-day 
cycles; the selection of the starting dose is based on results from a Phase 1 study in patients with 
hematologic malignancies.  
Safety Lead -in Period: Phase 1b  
Safety Lead -In, Single -Agent:  The study will consist of a Safety L ead-in Period to confirm the safety 
and tolerability of single -agent FT -2102 150 mg BID administered over 28 days (1 cycle). The Safety 
Lead -in Period will employ a traditional 3+3 design, whereby 3 patients with any of the specified 
solid tumors and (Coho rts 2a-5a) or glioma (Cohort 1a)  are treated with FT -2102 150 mg BID and 
monitored for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of study treatment.  
• If no dose -limiting toxicities occur in the first 3 patients in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 
2a-5a inclusive ) or the glioma group (Cohort 1a) , and available pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic ( PD) data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the 4 disease -
specific cohorts described below.  
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients in either group, an additional 3 patients will be treated at 
that dose level in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 2a -5a inclusive ) or the glioma group 
(Cohort 1a) . If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients (ie , <2 DLTs per 6 patients) and 
available PK/ PD data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the 4 disease -specific cohorts 
described below.  
• If there are ≥ 2 DLTs at the starting dose, 150 mg once daily of FT -2102 will be evaluated 
following review  by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Likewise, higher doses may be 
evaluated based upon safety, PK, and PD  data as determined by the SRC.    
Safety Lead -In Combination: DLTs will be evaluated within the first 3 (or 6) patient s of any cohort 
examining combination therapy to confirm the safety and tolerability of combination therapy 
administered over 28 days (1 cycle) for Cohort 1b, Cohort 2b, Cohort 3b, and Cohort 4b using a 3+3 
design (i .e., up to the first 6 patients in each combination cohort ).  The cohort will be stopped if there 
is more than 1 DLT out of the first 6 patient s, and additional dose levels will be evaluated as follows:  
• If no DLTs occur in the first 3 patients in a combination cohort and available PK/PD  data 
support the dose, enrollment will continue in  that disease -specific cohort.  
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients in a combination cohort, an additional 3 patients will be 
treated at that dose level. If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients (ie, < 2 DLTs per 
6 patients) and available PK/PD data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the specific 
combination cohort.  
• If there are ≥ 2 DLTs at the starting dose, the following dose de -escalations of either the 
combination agent or FT -2102 will be evaluated following review  by the  SRC. Following that 
evaluation, the SRC will evaluate the available safety, PK , and PD data to determine the dose(s) 
to be used in the combination Phase 2.

Other Non-CNS Solid Tumors with IDH1 M utations (n= 6, Cohort 5 a) 
Up to 6 patients with relapsed or refractory non -CNS solid tumors harboring an IDH1 R132X 
mutation. This cohort will only include treatment with single -agent FT -2102. Due to the diverse 
population, this is an exploratory cohort without pre -defined efficacy/futility determinations. 
Aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC and if unacceptable toxicity  (a DLT)  is observed 
in ≥2 of the first 6 patients, the cohort will be closed for additional enrollment.

FT-2102  
(Version 5) 28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 113  Disease-S pecific Cohorts: Phase 2  
Four disease- specific cohorts will employ a stage-wise design, whereby 8 patients in the first stage of 
each cohort will be treated with study therapy (either  single -agent FT -2102 or in combination with 
antineoplastic agents) and evaluated for efficacy and safety.  
After up to 8 patients in Stage 1 have been evaluated for at least 4 cycles of study treatment, disease-
specific efficacy data will be evaluated to determine continued enrollment to Stage 2. Enrollment will 
continue during the Stage 1 evaluation. If Stage 1 efficacy criteria from any single -agent FT -2102 
cohort is not met, then examination of combination therapy may  be initiated in a new Simon’s 2 -
stage design.  
Safety data from Stage 1 will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by SRC. Significant safety 
findings may lead to an early stopping for any cohort and will be considered when deciding to initiate 
Stage 2 of any cohort.  
For the Safety Lead -in Period and Stage 1 of each disease- specific cohort, blood samples for PK and 
PD will be obtained. Limited PK and PD  samples will be obtained during Stage 2.  
Overall response is defined as follows:  
- Glioma:  the proportion of patients with a best response of complete response/remission ( CR) 
or partial response/remission (PR ) or minor response ( MR) (low -grade glioma [ LGG]) 
- Hepatobiliary cancer: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR  
- Chondr osarcoma:  the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR  
- Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma:  the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or 
PR 
Cohort 1: Glioma (n =16-46) 
Cohort 1 will include patients with glioma harboring an IDH1 R132X  mutation that is relapsed or 
refractory. Glioma patients will be initia lly treated with single -agent FT -2102 ( Cohort 1a). Cohort 1a 
will employ a Simon’s 2 -stage design, in which 8 evaluable patients will be treated with single -agent 
FT-2102 for a minimum of 4 cycles (cycle= 28 days) and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1). If 
≥1 clinical response is observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=15) will initiate with single -agent FT -
2102.   
If no clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single-agent FT-2102, then combination therapy 
may be examined (FT -2102 + 5 -azacitidine) (Cohort 1b ). Cohort 1b will employ the same Simon’s 
2-stage design, enrolling 8 evaluable patients in Stage 1 and 15 evaluable patients in Stage 2 with combination therapy.   
During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC. If unacceptable toxicity is observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC.  
Note: Any glioma patients en rolled in the Safety Lead -in Period will be considered part of Stage 1 
enrollment  for single -agent or combination treatment .   
Cohort 2: Hepatobiliary Cancer (HBC) (n =21-78) 
Cohort 2 will include patients with relapsed/refractory HBC harboring an R132X IDH1 mutation.

a minimum of  4 cycles (cycle= 28 days) and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1). If ≥ 1 clinical 
response is observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=15) will receive single -agent FT -2102.   
If no clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102, then combination therapy 
may be examined (FT -2102 + PD -1 inhibitor) ( Cohort 2b ). Cohort 2b will employ a new Simon’s 2-
stage design, whereby 13 evaluable patients will be treated in Stage 1 with combinatio n therapy for  a 
minimum of  4 cycles (cycle= 28 days) and assessed for efficacy and safety. If ≥ 4 clinical response is 
observed in Stage 1 of Cohort 2b, then Stage 2 (n=42) will initiate with combination therapy.  
During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC. If unacceptable toxicity is 
observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC.  
Note: any HBC patients enrolled in the Safety Lead -in Period will be considered part of Stage 1 
enrollment. 
Cohort 3: Chondrosarcoma (n =16-46 ) 
Cohort 3 will include patients with relapsed/refractory, locally advanced or metastatic 
chondrosarcoma harboring an R132X IDH1 mutation. Chondrosarcoma patients will be initially 
treated with single -agent FT -2102 ( Cohort 3a). Cohort 3a will employ a Simon’s 2-stage design, in 
which 8 evaluable patients will be treated with single -agent FT -2102 for  a minimum of  4 cycles 
(cycle= 28 days) and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1). If ≥1 clinical response is observed in 
Stage 1, then Stage 2  (n=15) will initiate with single -agent FT -2102.   
If no clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single-agent FT -2102, then combination therapy 
may be examined (FT -2102 + 5 -azacitidine) (Cohort 3b ). Cohort 3b will employ the same Simon’s 
2-stage design, enrolling 8 evaluable patients in Stage 1 and 15 evaluable patients in Stage 2 (n=15) 
with combination therapy.  
During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC. If unacceptable toxicity is 
observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC.  
Note: any chondrosarcoma patients enrolled in the Safety Lead -in Period will be considered part of 
Stage 1 enrollment.  
Cohort 4: IHCC (n= 21-77) 
Cohort 4 will include patients with advanced IHCC harboring an R132X IDH1 mutation. IHCC 
patients will be initially  treated with single -agent FT -2102 ( Cohort 4a). Cohort 4a will employ a 
Simon’s 2 -stage design, in which 8 evaluable patients will be treated with single -agent FT -2102 for a 
minimum of 4 cycles and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1). If ≥ 2 clinical responses  are 
observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=14 ) will initiate with single -agent FT -2102.   
If <2 clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102, then combination therapy 
may be examined (FT -2102 + GemCis) ( Cohort 4b ).  
Cohort 4b will employ a Simon’s 2-stage design, whereby 13 evaluable patients will be treated in 
Stage  1 with combination therapy for 4 cycles and assessed for efficacy and safety.  
If ≥4 clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 of Cohort 4b, then Stage 2 (n=42) will be initiate d 
with combination therapy.

observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC.  
Note: any IHCC patients enrolled in the Safety Lead -in Period will be considered part of Stage 1 
enrollment.  
Combination therapy in cohorts 1-4 may also b e examined in the event that the single agent cohort 
passes the futility analysis and the enrollment in the single agent cohort is completed  following 
review by the SRC (below) .  
Safety Review Committee  
This study will utilize a n SRC, which will meet quart erly at a minimum to review all accumulated 
data, including safety, PK, PD , and efficacy. The SRC will be c omposed of a medical representative 
from the Sponsor, and all Principal Investigators (PIs) or delegates at each of the enrolling sites. The 
SRC will use all available data to confirm dose decisions and if needed recommend changes to the 
dosing paradigm.  
Dosing Frequency  
FT-2102 will initially be administered either as a single  agent at 150 mg BID or in combination until 
disease progression or unac ceptable toxicity. In the combination cohorts, FT-2102 150 mg BID will 
be administered in combination with 5-azacitidine  in glioma and chondrosarcoma, with nivolumab in 
HBC , and with GemCis in IHCC. The SRC will monitor the safety, PK, and PD of both singl e-agent 
FT-2102  and combination therapy during Stage  1 of each cohort  and may recommend altering the 
dosing paradigm based on available data. The SRC will conduct an aggregate assessment of PK/ PD 
data as well as a review of the study drug -related AEs to  ensure that the combination therapies is safe 
and well tolerated . 
Monitoring of Adverse Events: 
Patients will be monitored continuously for toxicity while on study drug. AE  severity will be 
assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI 
CTCAE) version 4.03. If a patient has an AE of a particular severity or an AE assessed as at least 
possibly related to study drug, then dose modifications will be made according to the guidelines set 
forth in the study protocol.  
DLT Evaluation Period/Definition: 
Single -Agent Safety Lead -in  
DLTs will be evaluated during the Safety Lead -in Period during the first treatment cycle (28  days) 
using NCI  CTCAE criteria version 4.03 and defined for each part of the study as described below. 
Drug relatedness will be Investigator -assessed. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities recorded as an AE, 
but without clinical sequelae and not requiring treatment, are not c onsidered DLTs. Disease 
progression is not considered an AE if assessed  by Investigator  to be unrelated to study agent.  
Any DLTs that occur after the Cycle 1 DLT review period will still be considered by the SRC in the 
evaluation of Stage 1 from the Simon’s 2 -stage design and for the overall recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D).  
DLTs include the following AEs unrelated to underlying disease and considered related to  FT-2102:

Statistical Methodology  
Sample Size Determination  
This study will enroll up to approximately 200 patients.  
A single-agent Safety Lead -in Period will be implemented that may enroll approximately 12 patients, 
which includes approximately 6 patients with glioma and 6 patients with solid tumors. Following 
successful completion of the Safety Lead -in Period, the study will then enroll 4 disease -specific 
cohorts examining FT- 2102 as either single -agent or in combination. These cohorts include Cohort 1 
(glioma) with approximately 16-46  patients; Cohort 2 (HBC) w ith approximately 21-78 patients; 
Cohort 3 (chondrosarcoma) with up to 16-46 patients; and Cohort 4 (IHCC) with approximately 21-
77 patients.  There will be a fifth cohort of IDH1 mutant solid tumors, non-CNS with up to 6 patients, 
single -agent only.  
Cohor t 1a, Cohort 2a, Cohort 3a (single -agent FT -2102)  
Cohorts 1a, 2a, and 3a  will employ an optimal Simon’s 2 -Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, 
power of 80%, null hypothesis of 5% ORR and alternative hypothesis of 25%  ORR . Stage 1 of each 
single -agen t cohort will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or more 
responses, Stage 2 will initiate with additional 15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the 
total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5%  ORR  will b e rejected. If there is no response in Stage 1 
with single -agent FT -2102, combination therapy may  be evaluated.  
Cohort 4a (single -agent FT -2102)  
Cohort 4a employs an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, power of 80%, 
null hypothesis of 8%  ORR  and alternative hypothesis of 35%  ORR . Stage 1 will evaluate 8 patients 
and if there are 2 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with additional 14 patients. If there are 5 or more responses out of the total 22 patients, the null hypothesis of 8%  ORR  will be rejected.  If there 
is 0 or 1 response in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102, combination may  be evaluated.  
Combination Cohorts (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b)  
If there is no response in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102 combination cohorts m ay be examined.  
Cohort 1b and Cohort 3b  
For Cohorts 1b and 3b (combination therapy), an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design will be implemented with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, 80% power, with a null hypothesis of 5%  ORR  and 
alternative hypothesis of 25%  ORR . Stage 1 of each cohort will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 
4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or more responses, Stage 2 will initiate with additional 15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5%  ORR  will be 
rejected.

Cohort 2b employs an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, power of 80%, 
null hypothesis of 20%  ORR  and alternative hypothesis of 40%  ORR . Stage 1 will evaluate 13 
patients for efficacy; if there are 4 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with an additional 42 
patients. If there are 17 or more responses out of the total 55 patients, the null hypothesis of 20%  
ORR  will be rejected.   
Cohort 4b  
Cohort 4b employs an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design with a 1-sided alpha of 0.025, power of 80%, null hypothesis of 20%  ORR  and alternative hypothesis of 40%  ORR . Stage 1 will evaluate 13 
patients and if there are 4 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with additional 42 patients. If there are 17 or more responses out of the total 55 patient s, the null hypothesis of 20%  ORR  will be 
rejected.   
Cohort 5a 
Cohort 5a , due to the diverse population, this is an exploratory cohort without pre -defined 
efficacy/futility determinations (n= 6).  
Analysis Sets  
The DLT -Evaluable Analysis Set is defined as all patients in the Safety Lead -in Periods (single -
agent FT -2102, combination FT -2102 + 5-azacitidine, combination FT-2102 + GemCis, and 
combination FT -2102  + PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab) who either experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 or 
completed at least 75% of the prescribed Cycle 1 dose. This analysis sets will be used to assess the 
tolerability of FT-2102.  
The Safety Analysis Set  is defined as all patients who received any amount of study drug(s) (FT -
2102 and combination agents, if appropriate).  
This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all safety endpoints, excluding DLT evaluation. 
Safety analysis will be by cohort and by treatment within cohort if more than 1 dose or dosing combination are initiated for a particular indication cohort.  
The Response-Evaluable Analysis Se t is defined as all patients with measurable disease at baseline 
who received the study drug(s) specific to the part of their particular cohort (either FT -2102 
monotherapy or FT-2102 in combination) and had at least 1 post -baseline response assessment or 
discontinued the treatment phase due to disease progression (including death caused by disease progression) within 8 weeks (+2 -week window) of the first dose of study treatment. This analysis set 
will be the primary analysis set for efficacy endpoints. All response evaluations will be by cohort, 
and by treatment within cohort if more than 1 doses or dosing combinations are initiated for a 
particular indication cohort.  
The PK Ana lysis Set is defined as patients from Stage 1 who have received at least one dose of FT -
2102 and for whom it is possible to calculate at least one primary PK parameter (e.g. C
max, AUC last). 
The Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set  is defined as all patients who received at least one dose of FT -
2102 and have completed at least one pharmacodynamic assessment.

(Version 5) 28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 113  Safety Analyses:  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 19.0 or higher and will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE , v 4.03.  
For the Safety Lead -in Periods, the number and type of DLTs experienced by patients will be 
summarized for each dose level/combination, accompanied by a by -patient listing of DLT events. 
The listing will include the description, severity, and relationship of the events to study drug(s).  
Summaries of AEs will be based on treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs). A TEAE is an AE that starts 
or worsens in the period from the first dose of study treatment to 28 days  after the last dose of study 
drug (any of the combination agents, whichever is later).  
TEAEs will be summarized by  cohort and dose level and by the frequency of patients experiencing 
TEAEs corresponding to MedDRA System Organ Classes (SOC s) and Preferred T erms (PT s). 
Separate tabulations will also be produced for TEAEs assessed as related to study drug(s), TEAEs 
that led to treatment discontinuation, TEAEs that led to death, and TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 in severity. 
Treatment -emergent serious AEs (SAEs) and SAEs related to study drug(s) will also be tabulated.  
Shifts in grade from baseline to the maximum post -baseline grade will be summarized by dose level 
or treatment group for applicable laboratory data. Laboratory values ≥ Grade 3 in severity will be 
tabulated by dose level or treatment group.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 113  In addition to IDH inhibitors, demethylating agents have demonstrated reduction of methylation 
and growth inhibition in IDH1 mutant glioma xenografts and patient derived glioma initiator 
cells ( Borodovsky et al, 2013; Turcan et al, 2013 ). An investigation of single- agen t IDH1 
inhibitor and combination therapy with a demethylating agent with known safety profile, 
azacitidine, is proposed in the clinical study.  
IDH1 mutations have been reported in a subset of clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma and 
associated with poor prognosis in a single center investigation ( Lee et al, 2017 ). Histone 
modification and epigenetic DNA methylation has been demonstrated to repress tumor Th1-type 
chemokines and subsequently determine effector T- cell trafficking into the tumor 
microenvironment (Peng et al, 2015 ). Thus, cancer epigenetic reprograming may remove Th1-
type chemokine repressive marks and promote effector T -cell trafficking into the tumor 
microen vironment and improve the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. 
The PD -1 inhibitor, nivolumab, has demonstrated clinical activity in advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma  (El-Khoueiry et al, 2017 ). The proposed clinical study investigates single -agent FT-
2102, then possibly in combination with nivolumab in patients with HBC with the R132X IDH1 
mutation.  
Mutations of the IDH 1/2 gene s are present in up to 50% of chondrosarcomas and reported with 
the enchondromatosis-associated non- hereditary Maffucci and Ollier syndromes, suggesting that 
the IDH mutation may represent an early tumorigenic event ( Amary et al, 2011; Meijer et al, 
2012).  IDH mutations have been shown to create a hypermethylation phenotype in 
chondrosarcoma cells which may be reversed with demethylating agents, 5- azacitidine ( Lu et al, 
2012).  The proposed clinical study will evaluate single-agent FT-2102 followed by a 
combination with 5 -azacitidine  for patients with relapsed or refractory chondrosarcoma  with an 
IDH1 mutation. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary cancer incl uding IHCC, 
the current standard of care includes combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin  
(Valle et al, 2010) with a short duration of progression free survival ( PFS; 8.0 months, CI: 
6.6-8.6 months) and overall survival (OS)  of 11.7 months (CI: 9.5 -14.3 months). Other 
combination agents have been evaluated with comparable PFS and OS ( Eckmann et al, 2011).  As 
IDH mutations  have been reported to occur in up to 25% of IHCC ( Goyal et al, 2015 ), an 
evaluation of FT-2102 as a single agent followed by combination with gemcitabine + cisplatin for patients with advanced unresectable IHCC is proposed. 
1.4. Determination of Starting Doses and Regimen  
1.4.1. Single -Agent FT -2102 
Clinical Study  2102- HEM -101 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 investigation in patients with advanced 
hemato logic malignancies with IDH1 mutations. In this study, dose escalation was initiated using 
FT-2102 as a single agent in AML or MDS patients harboring an IDH1 -R132 mutation, as 
determined by local mutation testing. FT-2102 doses of 150, 300 mg QD and 150 mg BID have 
been evaluated . FT-2102 is administered orally in continuous 28-day cycles. There were no 
DLT s observed at any doses and an MTD was not determined. The Phase 1 single-agent study 
has been completed and a review of available safety data, including all adverse events ( AEs) 
reported in patients treated with the 150 mg BID dose concluded that the safety profile was 
consistent with that of patients treated in dose escalation; no new safety signals were observed  in 
the expansion cohorts.  
Protocol 2102- ONC-102  FORMA Therapeutics, Inc.  
FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 113  Based on this review , in combination with achievement of targeted 2 -HG depletion in plasma 
and preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) , FT-2102 150 mg BID was declared the RP2D for 
further evaluation  in hematologic malignancies (additional details in the IB).   
As part of the safety evaluation of the combinations, in each combination cohort, there will be a 
3+3 design, safety evaluation of the first patients enrolled in each combination cohort.    
1.4.2. FT-2102 in Combination with A zacitidine  
There have been extensive evaluations of azacitidine in patients with hematologic malignancies leading to the currently approved dose is 75 mg/m
2/day × 7 days delivered either subcutaneously 
or intravenously every 28 days ( VIDAZA US Prescribing Information ). In the Clinical Study 
2102- HEM -101, as of 7- April-2018, 26 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies 
received FT -2102 in combination with azacitidine at 75 mg/m2/day × 7 days every 28 days (20 
patients: FT -2102 at 150 mg BID ; 7 patients: FT -2102 at 150 mg QD).  When given i n 
combination, when compared to single- agent FT -2102, there were additional gastrointestinal 
toxicities noted in combination (nausea, constipation, and diarrhea) and electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia) which are known toxicities of azacitidine (additional 
details i n IB and azacytidine PI  (VIDAZA US Prescribing Information ). 
Clinical investigations of azacitidine in solid tumors however are quite limited.  Jeurgens 
evaluated the combination of a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat, with azacitidine dosed at either 30 mg/m
2/day or 40 mg/m2/day × 10 days (with a 48- hour interruption at Day 6) 
in patients with relapsed/refractory non -small cell lung carcinoma. The Investigator s concluded 
that 40 g/m2/day is a tolerable dose in this small subset of patients ( Juergens et al, 2011).  A meta -
analysis of 11 clinical studies in a total of 694 patients with a variety of solid tumors found 
response plus stable disease rates of ~35% in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.  The authors found that intravenous dosing was supported by the available data (not subcutaneous) 
and that 67.5 mg/m
2/day correlated favorably with response rates in gastrointestinal ( GI), lung 
and breast cancer (Cowan et al, 2010 ). Thus, the proposed study will investigate initially in a 3+3 
dose confirmation an azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m2/day for a total of 7 doses permitting a 48-
hour window as needed for patient convenience. If there is toxicity at that dose, additional doses 
will be investigated.  If the patient has intolerance to azacitidine, they can continue with FT-2102 as a single agent.  
1.4.3. FT-2102 in Combination with Nivolumab  
The dose of the PD -1 inhibitor, nivolumab is based upon the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved dose for hepatocellular carcinoma, specifically 240 mg IV every 2 weeks. This 
dose will be the basis for sites where nivolumab is not approved for hepatocellular carcinoma.  If 
the patient is intolerant of nivolumab, they can continue on single- agent FT -2102. Clinical 
experience to date with FT -2102 includes as a single agent or in combination with azacitidine.  
Based on the mechanism of action of nivolumab and FT- 2102, it is not anticipated that there will 
be overlapping toxicities, but it is unknown at this time.

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 113  1.4.4. FT-2102 in Combination with GemCis  
The dose of gemcitabine/cisplatin is based upon the standard of care regimen established by 
Valle and colleagues ( Valle et al, 2010 ) and a reasonable global standard  in a review by Weber 
and colleagues ( Weber et al, 2015 ): cisplatin (25 mg/m2) followed by gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2), 
each administered on Days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks for eight cycles for up to 24 weeks. For patient convenience and data analysis, cycle duration will be 28 days +/- 7 days when 
gemcitabine/cisplatin is being given with FT-2102. Following completion of the 24 weeks of 
therapy or if intolerant of either agent, the patient can continue on single-agent FT-2102 with 
28-day cycles. Clinical experience to date with FT -2102 includes as a single agent or in 
combination with azacitidine. Based on the mechanism of action of gemcitabine, cisplatin and FT-2102, it is anticipated that there may be overlapping toxicities (myelosuppression and/or hepatic toxicity) but it is unknown at this time.

employ a traditional 3+3 design, whereby 3 patients with any of the solid tumors (Cohorts 2a-5a) and 3 patients with gliomas (Cohort 1a) are treated with FT -2102 150 mg BID and monitored for 
DLTs during the first cycle of study treatment.  
• If no DLTs  occur in the first 3 patients in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 2a -5a) 
or the glioma group (Cohort 1a), and available PK/PD data support the dose, 
enrollment will continue in the 4 disease -specific cohorts described  below.   
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients  in either group, an additional 3 patients will be 
treated at that dose level  in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 2a-5a) or the glioma 
group (Cohort 1a). If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients ( ie, <2 DLTs per 
6 patients) and available PK/PD  data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the 
4 disease -specific cohorts described below.  
• If there are ≥2 DLTs at the starting dose, 150 mg once daily of FT-2102 will be 
evaluated following review  by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Likewise, higher 
doses may be evaluated based upon safety, PK, and PD  data as determined by the 
SRC. 
The 3+3 design of the Safety Lead- in period is based on DLT evaluable patients.  If a patient 
enrolls in this phase, but does not qualif y as DLT evaluable, that patient will be replaced.  
4.1.2. Combination  
DLTs will be evaluated within the first 3 (or 6) patient s of any cohort examining combination 
therapy to confirm the safety and tolerability of combination therapy administered over 28 days 
(1 cycle) for Cohort 1b, Cohort 2b, Cohort 3b, and Cohort 4b using a 3+3 design (ie, up to the 
first 6 patients in each combination cohort).  The cohort will be stopped if there is  more than 1 
DLT  out of the first 6 patients, and additional dose levels will be evaluated as follows:  
• If no DLTs  occur in the first 3 patients in a combination cohort and available PK/PD  
data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the that disease -specific cohort .  
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients  in a combination cohort, an additional 3 patients 
will be treated at that dose level. If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients (ie ,

available data. The SRC will conduct an aggregate assessment of PK/ PD data as well as a review 
of the study drug- related AEs to  ensure that the combination therapies is safe and well tolerated . 
4.2. Disease -Specific Cohorts: Phase  2  
Four disease-specific cohorts will employ a Simon’s 2- stage-wise design, whereby 8 patients in 
the first stage of each cohort will be treated with study therapy (either single -agent FT -2102 or in 
combination with antineoplastic agents) and evaluated for eff icacy and sa fety. After up to 
8 patients in Stage 1 have been evaluated for at least 4 cycles of study treatment, disease- specific 
efficacy data will be evaluated to determine continued enrollment to Stage 2. Enrollment will continue during the Stage 1 evaluation. If Stage 1 efficacy criteria from any single -agent  
FT-2102 cohort is not met, then examination of combination therapy will be initiated in a new 
Simon’s 2 -stage design.  Combination therapy in cohorts 1 -4 may also be examined in the event 
that the single agent cohort passes the futility analysis and the enrollment in the single agent 
cohort is completed .
 
Safety data from Stage 1 will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by SRC. Significant safety 
findings may lead to an early stopping for any cohort and will be considered when deciding to initiate Stage 2 of any cohort.  The Simon’s 2 -stage design is based upon Response Evaluable 
population.  Patients who are not in the Response Evaluable population will not be counted in the numerator or denominator of the number of patients needed in Phase 2. 
For the Safety Lead -in Period and Stage 1 of each disease- specific cohort, blood samples for PK 
and PD  will be obtained. Limited PK and PD  samples will be obtained during Stage 2.    
4.2.1. Cohort 1: Glioma (n=16-46) 
Cohort 1 will include patients with glioma harboring an IDH1 R132X mutation  that is relapsed 
or refractory . Glioma patients will be initia lly treated with single -agent FT -2102 ( Cohort 1a). 
Cohort 1a will employ a Simon’s 2 -stage design, in which 8 patients will be treated with single -
agent FT-2102 for 4 cycles (cycle= 28 days) and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1).  
If ≥1 clinical response is observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=15) will initiate with single -agent 
FT-2102.   If no clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single- agent FT -2102, then combination 
therapy may be examined (FT-2102 + 5- azacitidine) (Cohort 1b ).  
Cohort 1b will employ the same Simon’s  2-stage design, enrolling  8 evaluable patients in Stage 1 
and 15 evaluable patients in Stage 2 with combination therapy.  
If ≥1  clinical responses are  observed in Stage 1 of Cohort 1b, then Stage 2 (n=15) will be 
initiate d with combination therapy. 
During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC. If unacceptable toxicity is 
observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC. 
Note: any glioma patients enrolled in the Safety Lead -in Period w ill be considered part of 
Stage  1 enrollment for single -agent or combination  treatment.

agent FT-2102 for 4 cycles (cycle=28 days) and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1).  
If ≥1 clinical response is observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=15) will receive single-agent 
FT-2102.   If no clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102, then combination 
therapy may be examined (FT-2102 + PD-1 inhibitor) ( Cohort 2b ).  
Cohort 2b will employ a new Simon’s 2-stage design, whereby 13 patients will be treated in 
Stage 1 with combination therapy for 4 cycles (cycle =28 days) and assessed for efficacy and 
safety.  
If ≥4 clinical response is observed in Stage 1 of Cohort 2b, then Stage 2 (n=42) will initiate with 
combination therapy. 
During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC. If unacceptable toxicity is 
observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC. 
Note: any HBC patients en rolled in the Safety Lead- in Period will be considered part of Stage 1 
enrollment.  
4.2.3. Cohort 3: Chondrosarcoma (n=16-46) 
Cohort 3 will include patients with relapsed/refractory, locally advanced or metastatic 
chondrosarcoma harboring an IDH1 R132X mutation. Chondrosarcoma patients will be initially  
treated with single -agent FT -2102 ( Cohort 3a). Cohort 3a will employ a Simon’s 2-stage design, 
in which 8 patients will be treated with single -agent FT-2102 for 4 cycles (cycle=28 days) and 
assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1).  
If ≥1 clinical response is observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=15) will initiate with single -agent 
FT-2102.   If no clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single -agent FT-2102, then combination 
therapy may be examined ( FT-2102 + 5 -azacitidine) (Cohort 3b ). Cohort 3b will employ the 
same Simon ’s 2-stage design, enrolling 8 patients in Stage 1 and 15 evaluable patients in Stage 2 
(n=15) with combination therapy. If ≥1  clinical responses are  observed in Stage 1 of Cohort 3b, then Stage 2 (n=15) will be 
initiate d with combination therapy. 
During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by the S RC. If unacceptable toxicity is 
observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC. 
Note: any chondrosarcoma patients enrolled in the Safety Lead -in Period will be considered part 
of Stage 1 enrollment.

Cohort 4 will include patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma harboring an IDH1 R132X 
mutation. Cholangiocarcinoma patient s will be initia lly treated with single -agent FT -2102 
(Cohort 4a). Cohort 4a will employ a Simon’s  2-stage design, in which 8 patients will be treated 
with single-agent FT-2102 for 4 cycles and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1).  
If ≥2 clinical responses are observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=14) will initiate with single -
agent FT-2102.   If <2 clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102, then combination 
therapy may be examined (FT-2102 + GemCis) ( Cohort 4b ).  
Cohort 4b will employ a Simon’s 2 -stage design, whereby 13 patients will be treated in Stage 1 
with combination therapy for 4 cycles and assessed for efficacy and safety.  If ≥4 clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 of Cohort 4b, then Stage 2 (n=42) will be

During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC . If unacceptable toxicity is 
observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by the SRC. 
Note: any cholangiocarcinoma patients enrolled in the Safety Lead-in Period will be considered 
part of Stage 1 enrollment.  
4.2.5. Cohort 5a: Other  Non- CNS  Solid Tumors with IDH1 M utations (n=6) 
Cohort 5a will include patients with relapsed or refractory non -central nervous system ( CNS ) 
solid tumors harboring an IDH1 R132X mutation. This cohort will only include treatment with 
single- agent FT -2102. Due to the diverse population, this is an exploratory cohort without 
pre-defined efficacy/futility determinations. Aggregate safety data will be monitored by the SRC 
and if unacceptable toxicity (a DLT)  is observed in ≥2 of the first 6 patients, the cohort will b e 
closed for additional enrollment.  
4.3. Monitoring of Adverse Events:  
Patients will be monitored continuously for toxicity while on study drug. AE severity  will be 
assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03. If a patient has an AE of particular severity or an AE assessed as at 
least possibly related to study drug, then dose modifications will be made according to the guidelines set forth in the study protocol. 
4.4. DLT s 
4.4.1. Single -Agent Safety Lead- in  
DLTs will be evaluated during the Safety Lead-in Period during the first treatment cycle  
(28 days) using the NCI CTCAE  version 4.03. DLT s are any of the toxicities outlined in below 
unrelated to underlying disease and considered related to FT-2102.

non-hematologic laboratory finding 
Hematologic Toxicities : 
• ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for >7 days 
• ≥Grade 3  febrile neutropenia  
Drug relatedness will be Investigator -assessed.  Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities recorded as an 
AE, but without clinical sequelae and not requiring treatment, are not considered DLTs. Disease 
progression is not considered an AE if assessed  by the Investigator  to be unrelated to study 
agent. Any DLTs t hat occur after the Cycle 1 DLT review period will still be considered by the 
SRC in the evaluation of Stage 1 from the Simon’s 2 -stage design and for the overall RP2D. 
4.4.2. Combination Therapy Safety Lead- in 
DLTs will also be evaluated during Stage  1 of any cohort examining combination therapy 
(Cohort 1b, Cohort 2b, Cohort 3b, and Cohort 4b) using a 3+3 design.  
DLTs will be assessed during the first full treatment cycle  of both agents (28 days) using NCI 
CTCAE  criteria version 4.03. Drug relatedness will be In vestigator - assessed.  Grade 3 laboratory 
abnormalities recorded as an AE, but without clinical sequelae and not requiring treatment, are 
not considered DLTs. Disease progression is not considered an AE if assessed by Investigator  to 
be within the expected  tempo of that disease.  
Dose -limiting toxicities are any of the toxicities outlined below  unrelated to underlying disease 
and considered related to FT-2102 and unrelated to the known toxicities of the combination 
agent(s).  
Non-hematologic Toxicities:  
• ≥Grade 3 toxicity except: Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash lasting 
<72 hours (with optimal medical management)  
• Clinically relevant (i.e. requiring treatment or with clinical sequelae) ≥Grade 3 non-

Any DLTs that occur after the Cycle 1 review period will still be considered by the SRC in the 
evaluation of Stage 1 from the Simon’s 2 -stage design and for the RP2D. Patients  who 
experience a DLT may have the opportunity to continue treatment at a lower dose.  
4.5. Treatment Discontinuation  
Treatment discontinuation is defined as any patient  who stops receiving study medication . A 
patient  should be discontinued from study treatment if, in the opinion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor , it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient . 
All patient s who discontinue study treatment should enter Safety  Follow-up ( see Section  6.5).  
Patients may  be discontinued from treatment in case of any of the following reasons: 
• An AE that requires permanent discontinuation of study treatment 
• Disease progression  with no evidence of clinical benefit as measured by the 
appropriate response criteria  
• Noncompliance to protocol  
• Investigator decision  
• Patient  becomes pregnant  
• Patient  death  
• Patient  lost to follow -up  
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor 
• Voluntary withdrawal of consent by patient   
AEs leading to the discontinuation of study drug will be followed until resolution, resolution to 
baseline or until the e vent is considered stable or chronic. 
If a patient discontinues study treatment, then a n End of Treatment (EoT) Visit should occur  
within 7 days after the last dose of study drug. Each EoT assessment need not be performed if 
the patient has had the identic al assessment within the previous 2 weeks or previous 30 days for 
disease response a ssessments.  
All patient s will have a Safety Follow -up visit approximately 28 (+7) days after the  last dose of 
study drug. If possible, this visit should occur prior to the initiation of any subsequent anticancer 
therapy. At a minimum,  this visit should include collection of AEs and concomitant 
medications/procedures.  
For combination cohorts, patients who discontinue FT-2102 are considered to have discontinued 
study treatment. Patients who discontinue azacitidine, nivolumab, or GemCis are allowed to 
continue FT -2102 until disease progression.

Patient s may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice.  
Patient s will be withdrawn from the study in case of any of the following reasons: 
• Patient  lost to follow -up  
• Termination of the study by Sponsor 
• Voluntary withdrawal by patient  
If the patient  withdraws consent from the overall study participation (and not just study 
treatment), no further evaluations should be performed,  and no attempts should be made to 
collect additional data.  
A patient is considered to have completed the study if they recei ve at least one dose of study 
drug and they are followed for survival for 24 months or if they died during the treatment or 
survival follow up period.  For interim data analyses, patients will be classified as ongoing if 
they have not died, been lost to follow -up, or withdrawn.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 113  6.1.3. Medical History, Demographics, and Cancer History  
Each patient’s complete medical history will be obtained, including demographics, cancer 
history, and documentation of all previous treatments and treatment results (ie, best response to 
previous disease- specific treatments), prior procedure s, current medications, and all medications 
used within 30 days prior to Screening.  
6.1.4. Prior/Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
At Screening, concomitant/previous medications and procedures will be assessed including all 
medications/procedures that have occurred within the previous 30 days. 
6.1.5. Physical Exam 
A full physical exam (PE) will be performed at Screening and will include vital signs 
(temperature, blood pressure [sitting for 5 minutes], pulse rate, and respiratory rate), height, and 
weight. If vital signs need to be repeated during a single visit, assessments should be conducted 
approximately 5 minutes apart.  All other physical exams performed on study should be 
symptom- led assessments.  
Following Screening, physical examination wi ll be symptom- directed , and will include 
collection of vital signs. Results from the symptom- directed physical exams will be used for 
assessment of disease response. Any new clinically significant abnormality from baseline or 
significant worsening of pre -existin g abnormality should be recorded as an AE. 
6.1.6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
ECOG Performance Status  will be assessed at Screening . If the ECOG Performance Status 
assessed at Screening is performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1, the Screening assessment can be used and does not need to be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose). Refer to Appendix 1 for a 
sample of the ECOG assessment . 
6.1.7. Electrocardiogram   
ECGs will be conducted following an approximate 10- minute rest period  and obtained in 
triplicate within approximately a 5 -minute time period  at the time points outlined in Table  1,

include serum ALT, serum AST, total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase.   
• Weekly liver function testing is required through Cycle 2. 
• Patients with hepatobiliary and cholangiocarcinoma only: alpha feto protein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA 19-9 (pre -dose and on treatment per 
Table  8).  
• PT/aPTT will be assessed in all patients at C1D1 only. 
Unscheduled assessments should be performed  as clinically indicated  and recorded in the eCRF . 
Clinically significant laboratory findings  at Screening should be recorded as medical history.    
For Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose), hematology and blood chemistry (including liver function tests) evaluations may be performed within 7 days prior to study treatment , and these results can be 
used in place of the Cycle 1 Day 1 results. 
Clinically significant laboratory findings, including but not limited to those findings resulting in 
a drug interruption/hold/reduction/discontinuation or medical intervention, should be reported as 
AEs (see Section  8.1.1 for definition of an AE).   
6.1.9. Additional Screening Laboratory Measurements  
At Screening, the following ass essments will be performed  to determine eligibility:  
Hepatitis: All patients will be tested for anti-hepatitis C antibody (anti- HCV) and hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg) at Screening. Reflex Hepatitis C RNA if antibody test is positive , then 
only patients with hepatitis C RNA <615 IU/L or 100 copies/ml per National Genetics Institute 
assay or local institutional standard will be eligible.    
6.1.10. Urinalysis  
Complete urinalysis with qualitative analysis for protein (dipstick) should be performed  at 
Screening  as outlined in  Table  1 and will be analyzed locally.  
6.1.11. Tumor Evaluation

For all patient s, non-serious AEs should be monitored from the time of the first dose of study 
drug through the post- treatment follow -up visit or 28 days after the last dose o f FT-2102, 
whichever is later. After the patient is enrolled, all AEs will be captured on the eCRF. 
All SAEs for all patient s will be reported from the time of the signing of the ICF until the post-
treatment follow -up visit or 28 days after the last dose o f FT-2102, whichever is later , or until the 
patient  has been deemed to be a screen failure. At any time after completion of the AE reporting 
period ( ie, 28 days post last dose of  FT-2102), if an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that 
the Investigator co nsiders to be related to any study drug, the event must be reported.  
All Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), as defined in Section 8.2.3, will be reported from 
first dose of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of FT-2102. 
See Section  8.2 for a full description of the collection and reporting of AEs during this study.  
6.2. Safety Assessments

sites. Data will be collected at baseline and at time of disease assessments.   
6.4.9. Additional Exploratory biomarkers 
Samples collected during the study will be banked for up to 25 years. Any material left over will 
be used to conduct research related to FT-2102. 
6.5. Safety F ollow -up Visit  
All patient s will have a Post -Treatmen t Follow-up visit 28 days after discontinuation of study 
treatment. If possible, this visit should occur prior to the initiation of any subsequent anticancer 
therapy. Patients continuing to experience toxicity at this point following the discontinuation of 
treatment will continue to be followed at least every 4 weeks until resolution or determination in the clinical judgement of the I nvestigator that no further improvement is expected.  
6.6. Safety Follow -up 
Survival follow -up assessments will occur every 3 months following documented disease 
progression or start of a new cancer therapy until the last patient is off treatment. These 
assessments may be conducted by telephone interview. Information on initiation of other 
anticancer therapy (including start date, therapy type/name, and response on treatment) will be collected. Additional survival follow -up calls may occur periodically if needed for data analysis.

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 113  6.7. Concomitant Medications  
6.7.1. Prohibited: Other Anticancer Therapy or Investigational Agents 
During the study treatment period, patients are not to receive any additional anticancer therapy or 
other inve stigational agents.  
6.7.2. Other Concomitant Therapies  
Any other medication which is considered necessary f or the patient ’s welfare, including 
antimicrobial prophylaxis, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator.  
6.7.2.1. Concomitant Medications to Use with Caution  
Co-administration of FT -2102 with strong CYP3A4 inducers significantly reduces FT-2102 
systemic exposure, therefore co-administration is not recommended and investigators should 
consider alternative medications.  
FT-2102 exhibits CYP3A4 induction potential in vitro and may impact the PK of co-
administered sensitive CYP3A4 substrates through increase d clearance.  Medications that are 
sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 should not be used while taking FT-2102.  
If the patient’s clinical condition requires a medication of concern, the clinical condition should 
be reviewed with the study Medical Monitor. Refer  to Appendix 5  for a list of strong CYP3A4 
inducers and sensitive substrates.  
6.7.2.2. Concomitant Medications Prohibited  
During study treatment and for three months following FT-2102, receipt of live vaccines is prohibited (including the yellow fever vaccine). Annual influenza vaccine is permitted. 
Concomitant medication(s) associated with known risk of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) are 
prohibited (s ee Appendix 3). Medications used as needed [PRN] [e.g., Zofran] are permitted.  
Concomitant medications that would be contraindicated with any of the combination agents are 
prohibited during the trial, based on approved prescribing information. For example, highly 
nephrotoxic agents with cisplatin.   
6.8. Precautions 
6.8.1. Differentiation Syndrome  
Differentiation syndrome has been observed i n patients participa ting in the hematologic 
malignancy protocol ongoing study and has also been reported in patients with AML/MDS 
receiving another therapy targeting the IDH1 -R132 mutation ( Birendra et al, 2016) o r receiving 
azacitidine ( Laufer et al, 2015).  It would be unlikely to occur in patients with solid tumors. If 
there are unexplained fevers, weight gain, respiratory  distress, interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, 
and pleural or pericardial effusion, with or without hyperleukocytosis ( Frankel et al, 1992),  
FT-2102 should be held and consideration given to prompt initiation of dexamethasone 10 mg IV 
every 12 hours. Discussion with the Medical Monitor  would be required to reinitiate FT-2102.

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 113  d. If after a minimum of 28 days of 150 mg once daily, the AST, ALT and total bilirubin 
have not elevated to Grade 2 or greater and no other symptoms have been reported, then FT-2102 may be re -escalated to the starting dose, if applicable .  
e. Frequent monitoring (at least twice per week) is required upon re -escalation, i f 
applicable, and may be decreased after patient has been on the escalated dose  for at least 
28 days without an increase in the AST, ALT and total bilirubin. 
Patients on active treatment with FT -2102 should be informed to promptly notify study staff if 
they develop any clinical symptoms of jaundice and to avoid personal habits (excessive ethanol 
consumption, over- the-counter hepatic injurious medications, herbal medications [e.g., 
cannabidiol or comparable products]) that may cause additional risk of hepatic injury.  
6.8.3. Phototoxicity 
A phototoxic potential was demonstrated for FT-2102 in a standard in vitro assay system. Until 
the photosafety of FT-2102 has been adequately demonstrated in vivo, photosafety risk in the 
clinical setting will be managed by the u se of light- protective measures. Patients should be 
instructed to avoid extensive sun exposure, phototherapy, or use of a tanning salon within a 
prudent amount of time prior to and following trial participation.  
6.8.4. Childbearing Potential  
For all patient s of childbearing potential , all methods of contraception, including abstinence, 
must be in use from the time of consent through the final study visit, and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Patient s who are not sexually active during th e Screening Period must 
agree to the contraceptive requirements if they become sexually active with a partner of the 
opposite sex during the study and for the following time periods after study treatment completed:  
- FT-2102 only: 90 days 
- Nivolumab (female): 150 days 
- Nivolumab (male): 210 days 
- Azacitidine: 180 days 
- Gemcitabine/Cisplatin: 180 days  
Unique situations that may not fall within these specifications may be discussed with the Forma 
Therapeutics Medical Monitor on an individual basis.  Investigators are advised to discuss with 
each patient their options regarding cryopreservation of sperm or ova prior to initiation of therapy per local institutional standard as the treatment may increase the risks of infertility.  
Female patient s will be considered of  childbearing potential after the onset of their first 
menstrual period. Female patients who are documented as being of nonchildbearing potential (postmenopausal or having undergone surgical sterilization) are exempt from this requirement. 
Female patients will be considered postmenopausal if they have had 12 months of consecutive 
spontaneous amenorrhea or less than 12 months of consecutive spontaneous amenorrhea and a serum FSH level > 40 mIU/mL at Screening. Female patients will be considered surgically sterile 
if they are post -hysterectomy, 6 months post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy, or 6 months post-
tubal ligation. The effects of FT-2102 on conception, pregnancy, and lactation are unknown.

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 113  6.8.4.1. Contraception Guidelines  
Acceptable methods of contraception under this protocol are listed below. Periodic abstinence 
(calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides 
only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Male patients  who can father a child must agree to use 1 highly effective method of 
contraception, which includes:  
• Abstinence: abstinence can be used, when in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the patient.  
• If a male patient  confirms that his female partner(s) is not of childbearing potential 
(i.e., postmenopausal or post- surgical sterilization, as defined above) or is using a 
highly effective method of contraception, this is acceptable as the only means of contraception.  
Examples of highly effective methods of contraception for male patient s’ female partner(s) 
include:  
• Hormonal contraceptives  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
Alternatively, two effective methods of contraception can be utilized and may include:  
• The use of a male condom with spermicide with a female occlusive cap (such as a 
diaphragm or cervical cap) with spermicide  
Male patients with documented infertility or surgical sterilization (performed at least six months 
before the first dose of study drug) are exempt from the contraception requirement. Infertility 
may be documented through examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the 
absence of the vas deferens on ultrasound before the first dose of study drug (Day 1).  
Female patients who are considered of childbearing potential must agr ee to use a highly 
effective method of contraception, which may include:  
• IUD  
• Abstinence: abstinence can be used, when in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the patient.  
• If a female patient  confirms that her male partner(s) has been confirmed  to be 
clinically sterile, this method is acceptable as the only means of contraception.  
Alternatively, effective double -barrier contraception may be used, to include:  
• The use of a male condom with spermicide with a female occlusive cap with 
spermicide (such as a diaphragm or cervical cap)  
Hormonal contraceptives are not considered an effective method of birth control for female patient s participating in this study. Male condoms with female condoms should not be used 
together.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 80 of 113  7.5. Dose Holds, Modifications, and Discontinuations  
Patient s will be monitored continuously for toxicity while on study treatment. Toxicity severity 
will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE  v. 4.03. If a patient has an AE related to  FT-2102, dose 
interruptions/holds with possible modifications may occur as described below. 
7.5.1. Dose Holds  and Modifications   
Dose modifications apply only to patients beyond a DLT period, either single -agent or in 
combination. If patients have a DLT, study agent should be stopped.  
For patients beyond a DLT period: a dose may be withheld up to 28 days for toxicity. Doses 
withheld for > 28 days may result in discontinuation from the study, unless approved by the 
medical monitor.  For azacitidine, nivolumab, gemcitabine and cisplatin, all dose modifications 
outside of DLT periods are at the discretion of the treating investigator and the following are 
provided as guidelines.  
7.5.1.1. FT-2102 
Dose modifications are required if any of the following toxicities occur and are judged by the 
Investigator  as related to study drug (i.e., assessed as unrelated to disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medications):  
If in the opinion of the Inves tigator, the patient experiences any of the study drug- related 
toxicities  outlined in  Table  12, FT-2102 dose(s) will be held until recovery of the toxic ity to 
≤Grade 1 . Dose modification guidelines for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are presented 
in Table  13.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 113  Escalation of FT -2102 following any dose reduction: 
Patients who have a dose reduction due to a toxicity may be eligible for a dose increase back to 
the dose level prior to the reduction (ie, the starting dose) if the patient has tolerated the reduced 
dose for a minimum of 28 days without any grade 2 or greater toxicities.  
Dose confirmation phases:  
During Cycle 1 in the dose confirmation stages of the study (single- agent and combination) , 
patients who do not receive their scheduled dose due to drug toxicity (dose hold) will have that 
counted towards the criteria for a DLT. Dose-reductions will not occur in Cycle 1.  
7.5.1.2. 5-Azacitidine  
Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values 
For subsequent doses, if the ANC has not recovered to >1x 109/L AND platelet >50 x 109/L 
within 14 days of completion of 5- azacitidine, subsequent courses should be modified per table 
below:

If a patient is unable or unwilling to continue treatment with the combination agent (s) at any time, they may continue participation in the study taking FT-2102 alone, at the discretion of the Investigator . Doses held during a cycle will not be made up. P atients who discontinue treatment 
must be monitored per study procedure and assessment schedule, unless they withdraw consent. Any patient who requires an additional dose reduction below 150 mg once daily will be permanently discontinued from study drug. 
7.6. Drug Accountability 
The Investigator  or designee is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of 
investigational product ( FT-2102) received and comparing it with the accompanying drug order 
form.  
All unused FT-2102 will be retained at the site. After full drug accountability and reconciliation, 
the Investigator will dispose of any study drug at the clinical trial site per  site procedures, or if 
necessary, all FT-2102 will be return ed to the Sponsor, or its designee. D isposition of all  study 
drug should be documented, including any study drug is lost or damaged.  
7.7. Assignment to Treatment 
All p atient s will receive open -label FT -2102, or FT-2102 in combination, at a dose and regimen 
based on the study design (see Sectio n 4).

REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated wi th the use of a drug, or with 
study participation, whether or not consider ed related to study treatment.   
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of the medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
AEs include worsening of a pre-existing medical condition, as well as clinically significant 
changes from baseline laborat ory values/conditions. Worsening of the preexisting medical 
condition (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) means that it has increased in CTC grade as compared to 
baseline.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened during the study is not considered an 
AE. 
8.1.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
- Electi ve or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing 
the ICF (as documented as medical history on the eCRF)  is not considered 
an SAE  
- Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for transfusion support or convenience, is not considered an SAE  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered  an important medical event  
- If an AE  does not meet one of the serious criteria, but the Investigator or 
Sponsor considers an event to be clinically important, the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of “Important medical event.” 
Examples of such medical events may include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization. 
Protocol 2102- ONC-102  FORMA Therapeutics, Inc.  
FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 87 of 113  8.2. Procedures for Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events 
8.2.1. Recording Adverse Events  
Patient s will be instructed to report all AEs and will be asked a general health status question at 
each study visit. All SAEs occurring in patient s will be recorded in the eCRF from the time of 
signing the ICF through 28 days after the last dose of FT-2102 (and for 150 days following last 
dose of nivolumab if applicable). All AEs  occurring in treated patient s will be recorded in the 
eCRF from the time of first dose through 28 days (and for 150 days following last dose of 
nivolumab if applicable).  after the last dose of FT -2102. An AE will be followed until it is either 
resolved, has returned to baseline, or is determined to be a stable or chronic condition.  
All SAEs occurring fro m the signing of ICF through 28 days after the last dose of FT-2102 (and 
for 150 days following last dose of nivolumab if applicable) will be processed as outlined in 
Section  8.2.2.  
All AESIs, as defined in Section 8.2.3, from first dose of study drug through 28 days after the 
last dose of FT-2102 will be processed as outlined in Section 8.2.3. 
At each required visit during the trial, all AEs that have occurred since the p revious visit must be 
reviewed by the Investigator. The I nvestigator must determ ine if the AE is serious or 
non-serious.  
The Investigator must assign the following AE attributes:  
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s) if known 
• If not known at time of the report, record the signs and/or symptoms as AEs and 
provide an updated report with diagnosis when obtained 
• Dates of onset and resolution 
• Severity as defined per protocol  
• Assessment of relatedness to each study drug  
• Action taken with each  study drug as a result of the AE  
In general, an AE that is the primary cause of subsequent events should be identified by the primary cause ( e.g., for dehydration due to diarrhea, the AE would be diarrhea). However, AEs 
occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events (e.g., sepsis secondary to pneumonia, both events should be recorded).  
The signs and symptoms of progressive disease that meet the AE criteria should be reported as 
specific AEs, and not as disease progression .  
8.2.1.1. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must assess whether the AE may be related to each study drug or study 
mandated procedure, when applicable. The relationship is defined below :   
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Not Drug Related”:  
• None:  The event is related to an etiology other than the study product administration (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study patient ’s medical record).  
Protocol 2102- ONC-102  FORMA Therapeutics, Inc.  
FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 88 of 113  • Remote:  The event is unlikely to be related to the study product and likely to be 
related to factors other than study product. 
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Drug Related”:  
• Possible: There is an association between the event and the administration of FT-2102, and there is a plausible mechanism for the even t to be related to the study 
product; but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the patient ’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
• Probable: There is an association between the event and the administration of 
FT-2102, there i s a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study 
product, and the event could not be reasonably explained by known characteristics of 
the patient ’s clinical status or an alternative etiology is not apparent.  
• Definite: There is an association between the event and the administration of FT-2102, there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product and causes other than FT-2102 have been ruled out and/or the event 
re-appeared on re -exposure to FT-2102. 
8.2.1.2. Adverse Event Severity  
The Investigator will assess the Grade of the AE per the NCI CTCAE  v. 4.03. Toxicities that are 
not specified in NCI CTCAE  will be defined as follows:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagno stic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disablin g; limiting 
self-care ADL  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE 
Note: it is important to distinguish betwee n SAEs and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is classified by the criteria based on the regulatory definitions as 
described in Section  8.1.2 above. 
8.2.1.3. Abnormal Laboratory and Electrocardiogram Values 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing clinical laboratory test and ECG results and 
determin ing whether an abnormal value in a patient  represents a clinically significant change 
from patient ’s baseline value. In general, abnormal laboratory findings and ECGs without 
clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as AEs. In 
general, an abnormal l aboratory test and ECG result s should be reported as an AE if the 
laboratory result:  
• Requires an adjustment or discontinuation of study drug

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 89 of 113  • Requires t reatment or adjustment to concomitant medications 
• Is considered to be an AE by the Investigator  
8.2.1.4. Medicati on Errors, Misuse, and Abuse of Study Drug  
Overdose, medication error, misuse, and abuse are defined as follows: 
• Overdose: refers to the administration of a quantity of study drug given per 
administration or cumulative, which is above the maximum dose according to the 
protocol.  
• Medication error: refers to an unintentional error in dispensing or a dministration of 
study drug not in accordance with the protocol 
• Off-label use: relates to situations where the study drug is intentionally used for 
medical purpose not in accordance with the protocol 
• Misuse: refers to situations where the study drug is intentionally and inapp ropriately 
used not in accordance with the protocol 
• Abuse: corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the 
study drug, which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects 
• Occupational exposure: refers to the exposure to the study drug because of  one’s 
professional or non-professional occupation 
Overdoses, medication errors, abuse , or misuse will be collected as part of investigational 
medicinal product dosing information and/or as a protocol violation, as required.  
8.2.2. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE Report Form will be completed and submitted to FORMA Therapeutics 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s first knowledge of the event, even if the 
experience does not appear to be related to study drug, from the time of signing ICF through 28 days after the last dose of FT-2102 (and for 150 days following last dose of nivolumab if applicable).  
Please refer to the SAE Report Form and completion guidelines on where and how to 
submit the form.  
The initial SAE report form must be as complete as possible, including details of the current 
illness and S AE, and an assessment of the relationship between the event and study drug. 
Additional information relating to a previously reported SAE must also be reported within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s first knowledge of information. The Investigator may also be 
asked, by the Sponsor, to provide clarifications or additional information. 
If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE considered related to study drug by the 
Investigator, occurring more than 28 days  after the last dose of  FT-2102 (and for 150 days 
following last dose of nivolumab if applicable) the SAE must be reported as described above.

Committee , and Institutional Review Board 
The Sponsor will determine expe ctedness of FORMA product for each reported SAE based on 
the appropriate reference safety information per local requirements .  
The Sponsor or designee shall notify regulatory authorities of serious, unexpected, and related 
AEs or other AEs, per local requi rements.  
The Sponsor or designee shall notify the Investigator of serious, related, and unexpected AE(s) 
submitted to the regulatory agencies, per local country requirements.  
The Sponsor or designee shall notify  any applicable Central Institutional Revie w Boards 
(CIRBs) and Central Ethics Committees (CEC s) of serious, related, and unexpected AE(s), or 
significant risks to patient s, per country requirements. 
The Investigator will notify the appropriate IRB/Local Ethics Committees (LEC s) of serious, 
related , and unexpected AE(s), or significant risks to patients, per local country requirements. 
The Investigator must keep copies of all AE information on file, including correspondence with 
FORMA or IRBs/LECs . 
8.2.3. Reporting of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
As described in Section 6.8.2, adverse events potentially associated with liver injury have been 
identified as A ESI. These AESI (regardless if serious  or non-serious) include the following : 
a.All events of Grade 2 or higher elevations in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin in patients with
normal LFTs at baseline; in patients with elevated LFTs at baseline, one Grade shift orhigher in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin;
b.Any hepatic adverse event, e.g., acute hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, orhepatic insufficiency
AESI occurring from time of first dose through 28 days after last dose must be reported as outlined below: 
a. Report to FORMA Therapeutics Pharm acovigilance within 24 hours of knowledge of
event
b.If the event meets both AESI and SAE criteria, complete both the SAE and AESI form
c.If the event is non- serious, complete the AESI form alone
Relevant forms (AESI, SAE, or both) should be submitted via fax ( ) or email 
to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance. 
8.2.4. Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure 
FT-2102 has not been evaluated in pregnant or nursing women. Thus, pregnant women or 
women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception are excluded from 
this study ( see Section  6.8.4 for instructions on birth control and pregnancy testing). 
Pregnancies occurring in patient s, or partners of male patients are considered immediately 
reportable events if the pregnancy occurs during the study treatment through 90 days after the patient ’s last dose of study drug. If a pregnancy occurs in a patient, study drug must be 
discontinued immediately. The pregnant woman should be referred to an 

Protocol 2102- ONC-102  FORMA Therapeutics, Inc.  
FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 91 of 113  obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling. 
The pregnancy must be reported to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form.  
The Investigator will follow the pregnant patient (or pregnant partner of male patient) until 
completion of the pregnancy and must notify the Sponsor of the pregnancy outcome within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the outcome. The Investigator will provide this information on the Pregnancy Report Form.  
If the pregnant patient (or pregnant partner of a male patient) experiences an SAE during 
pregnancy, or the outcome of the pregnancy meets any of the serious criteria (ie, sp ontaneous 
abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs (ie, report the event to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
All neonatal deaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of 
causality) should be reported as SAEs to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance. In addition, any infant death or congenital anomaly occurring after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to FORMA 
Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance.  
Please refer to the Pregnancy Report  Form and associated completion guidelines on where 
and how to submit the form.  
8.2.5. Disease Progression  
If progression of the underlying disease (i.e., the condition being treated with study drug) might 
be reasonably anticipated given the nature and severity of the underlying disease, then 
progression of the underlying disease per se will not constitute an AE. However, if the 
progression of the underlying disease meets the criterion for “serious” categorization of AEs (e.g., the underlying disease results in death or hospitalization), then the progression of 
underlying disease should be reported as an SAE ( Section  8.1.2).

Details of the statistical methods for this study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). The SAP may modify the statistical methods outlined in the protocol; however, any major 
modification will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
9.1. Sample Size 
This study will enroll u p to approximately  200 patients.   
A single- agent Safety Lead -in Period will be implemented  that may enroll approximately 
12 patients, which includes approximately 6 patients with glioma and 6 patients with solid 
tumors . Following successful completion of the Safety Lead-in Period, the study will then enroll 
4 disease -specific cohorts examining FT -2102 as either a single agent or in combination. These 
cohorts include Cohort 1 (glioma) with approximately 16 -46 patients; Cohort 2 (HBC) with up to 
approximately 21-78  patients; Cohort 3 (chondrosarcoma) with approximately 16-46 patients; 
and Cohort 4 (IHCC) with approximately 21-78 patients.  There will be a fifth cohort of R132X 
IDH1 mutant solid tumors, non-CNS with up to 6 patients, single-agent only. 
Cohort 1a, Cohort 2a, Cohort 3a (single- agent FT -2102) 
Cohorts, 1a, 2a and 3a  will employ an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design with a 1- sided alpha of 
0.025, power of 80%, null hypothesis of 5% and alternative hypothesis of 25%. Stage 1 of each 
of these cohorts will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or 
more responses, Stage 2 will initiate with additional 15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5% will be rejected. If there is no response in 
Stage 1 with single- agent FT-2102, or if the null hypothesis is not rejected at t he end of Stage 2, 
combination therapy may be evaluated.  
Cohort 4a (single- agent FT -2102) 
Cohort 4a employs an optimal Simon’s 2- Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, power of 
80%, null hypothesis of 8% and alternative hypothesis of 35%. Stage 1 will evaluate 8 patients 
and if there are 2 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with additional 14 patients. If there are 5 
or more responses out of the total 22 patient s, the null hypothesis of 8% will be rejected.  If there 
is 0 or 1 response in Stage 1 with single- agent FT -2102, or if the null hypothesis is not rejected at 
the end of Stage 2 , combination may be evaluated.  
Combination Cohorts (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b)  
If there is no response in Stage 1 with single- agent FT- 2102 combination cohorts may be 
examined.  
Cohort 1b and Cohort 3b 
For Cohorts 1b and 3b (combination therapy), an optimal Simon’s 2 -Stage design will be 
implemented with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, 80% power, with a null hypothesis of 5% and 
alternative hypothesis of 25%. Stage 1 of each cohort will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 
4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or more res ponses, Stage 2 w ill initiate with additional 
15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5% 
will be rejected.

Cohort 5 
Cohort 5, due to the diverse population, this is an exploratory cohort without pre- defined 
efficacy/futility determinations (n= 6).  
9.2. Analysis Sets 
9.2.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity -Evaluable Analysis Set  
The DLT-Evaluable Analysis Set  is defined as all patients in the Safety Lead -in Periods (single - 
agent FT-2102, combination FT-2102 + 5- azacitidine, combination FT-2102 + GemCis and 
combination FT-2102 + PD -1 inhibitor) who either experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 or 
completed at least 75% of the prescribed Cycle 1 dose. This  analysis set s will be used to assess 
the tolerability of FT-2102 
9.2.2. Safety  Analysis Set  
The Safety  Analysis Set  is defined as all patients who received any amount of study drug(s) 
(FT-2102 and combination agents , if appropriate) .  
This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all safety endpoints, excluding DLT 
evaluation. S afety analysis will be by cohort and by treatment within cohort if more than 1 dose  
or dosing combination are initiated for a partic ular indication cohort. 
9.2.3. Response-Evaluable Analysis Set  
The Response-Evaluable Analysis Se t is defined as all patients with measurable disease at 
baseline are included in the Safety Analysis Set  and had at least 1 post- baseline response 
assessment or discontinued the treatment phase due to disease progression (including death 
caused by disease progression) within 8 weeks (+2 -week window) of the first dose of study 
treatment. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for efficacy endpoints. All response evaluations will be by cohort, and by treatment within cohort if more than 1 doses or dosing combinations are initiated for a particular indication cohort.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 113  9.2.4. Pharmacokinetics Analysis Set  
The PK analysis set is defined as all patients who received at least one dose of FT-2102 and had 
at least one measurable concentration.  
9.2.5. Pharmacodynamics Analysis Set 
The Pharmacodynamics analysis set is defined as all patients who received at least one dose o f 
FT-2102 and have completed at least one pharmacodynamic assessment .  
 
9.3. Background Characteristics  
9.3.1. Patient  Disposition  
The number and percentage of patients in each disposition category (e.g., enrolled, included in each Analysis Set, completing a given number of treatment cycles, discontinuing treatment, and 
discontinuing study, with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized by 
cohort. 
9.3.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by cohort for the 
Safety  Analysis Set: sex, race, age, type of cancer, tumor stage (tumor -node- metastases), ECOG 
performance status, time elapsed since cancer diagnosis, and prior anti- cancer therapies. 
Additional parameters may be provided in the SAP.  
9.4. Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Total number of cycles  is defined as the maximum number of treatment cycles that a patient  
receives. Total cumulative dose (mg) is the sum of the actual doses that the patient receives across cycles. Total planned dose (mg) is the sum of the plann ed doses. The total number of days 
on treatment, total number of cycles, total cumulative dose (mg), total planned dose (mg) will be 
summarized.  
The study drug exposure will be summarized based on the Safety  Analysis Set by cohort and 
dose level. 
9.5. Efficacy Analyses  
All analysis in this section will be based on patients in the Response -Evaluable Analysis Set 
unless otherwise specified.  
Best response will be summarized as determined by applicable disease criteria, for disease 
specific cohorts (see Appendix 2 for definitions). RANO (LGG) for low -grade glioma, RANO 
for high-grade glioma, RECIST 1.1 for cholangiocarcinoma , HBC and other solid tumors.  
ORR is defined as follows: 
• Glioma: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR or MR (LGG)  
• HBC: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 95 of 113  • Chondrosarcoma: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR  
• Cholangioca rcinoma: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR  
It will be summarized by cohort and tabulated with 9 0% confidence interval estimated using 
Clopper-Pearson method. 
Time to event data will be analyzed using Kaplan- Meier (KM) methods for each cohort. The 
median time will be tabulated along with the 95% confidence intervals. The estimated 
probability of survival over time will be plotted as KM curves for each cohort (or by disease type and by treatment).  
For time to event variables, the following is considered:  
• PFS will be defined for all patients in the Response Evaluable Analysis Set. It is the 
time between first dose of study drug and disease progression, death from any cause, 
or start of other (non -protocol study drug) new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first. For a patient with none of these events before the end of study follow-up, P FS 
will be censored on the date of the last follow -up examination. 
• TTR will only be defined for patients who achieve a response (CR/ PR) . It is the  time 
between the first dose of study drug and documentation of the first response by 
applicable disease criteria.  
• DOR wi ll be defined only for patients who achieve a response. It is the time between 
documentation of the response by appropriate disease ass essment until the date of 
progression or any new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier. For patients who die without documentation/report of disease progression, DOR will be censored on the 
date of death, regardless of cause, or any other new anticancer  therapy (non-protocol 
study drug), whichever is earlier. For patients with no report of disease progression  
by the end of the follow-up data collection, DOR will be censored on the date of the last follow -up examination. Since DOR is patient  to the competing risk of death 
without progression, estimates of the cumulative incidence of progression will be 
reported for each cohort. Similarly, the duration of overall response will also be analyzed .  
• OS will be defined based on the Safety  Analysis Set. It is the time from study entry 
until death from any cause. For patients who are not known to have died by the end of study follow-up, OS will be censored on the date the patient was known to be alive. Patients who are lost to follow up with  be censored on the last date the patient was 
known to be alive.  The percentage of patients who are alive will be estimated at selected landmark timepoints such as 3 months, 6 months, etc.  
• TTP will be defined for all patients in the Response Evaluable An alysis Set. It is the 
time between first dose of study drug and disease progression. D eath from any cau se 
or start of other (non -protocol study drug) new anticancer therapy are censoring 
events . For a patient with none of these events before the end of stu dy follow-up, TTP  
will be censored on the date of the last follow -up examination. 
Additional efficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 96 of 113  9.6. Safety Analyses  
The Safety  Analysis set will be used to evaluate all safety endpoints unless the endpoints are 
applicable to only selected patients, e.g., DLT . 
9.6.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 
19.1 or higher and will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE , version 4.03.  
A TEAE is an AE that begins or worsens in the period from the first dose of study treatment to 28 days after the last dose of FT-2102. 
Summaries of AEs will be based on TEAEs. TEAEs will be summarized separa tely for each 
cohort and dose by the number of patient s experiencing TEAEs corresponding to MedDRA 
System O rgan C lasses (SOC s) and P referred T erms (PT s) by highest grade.  
Separate tabulations will also be produced for TEAEs assessed as related to study drug , TEAEs 
that led to treatment discontinuation, TEAEs that led to death, and TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 in severity. 
Common AEs will be summarized by MedDRA PT from most to least common.  Treatment -
emergent SAEs and SAEs related to study drug will also be tabulated.  A summary of 
non-serious TEAEs will also be produced.  
9.6.2. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
All statistical analyses of laboratory values will be performed using SI units.  
A sum mary of hematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory parameters will be performed 
using descriptive statistics on the raw values and change from baseline by dose group, disease, 
and nominal visit.  
Shifts in Grade from baseline to the maximum post-bas eline grade  will be summarized by 
treatment group for applicable laboratory data. Laboratory values ≥ Grade 3 in severity will be 
tabulated by treatment group. 
A listing of individual patient hematology, serum chemistry, and coagulation values outside the 
reference ranges will be provided. This listing will include data from scheduled and unscheduled time points. 
9.6.3. Electrocardiogram  
A summary of raw values and change from baseline values by dose group and disease for each 
scheduled visit will be provided for E CG parameters.  
QTc intervals based on Fridericia’s correction method will be summarized by  dose. The number 
and percentage of patient s will be presented for each of the following categories of QTcF 
intervals (≤480 ms, >480 to ≤ 500 ms, >500 ms). The number and percentage of patient s will also 
be presented for each of the following categories of changes from baseline >30 to ≤ 60 ms, >60 
ms).

International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good 
Clinical P ractice (GCP ), and all applicable local regulatory requirements. 
10.2. Informed Consent 
FORMA or its designee will provide a sample patient ICF f or modification, as appropriate, by 
the Investigator. The ICF must include all elements required by ICH  and GCP and must adhere 
to the IRB/IEC requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
The Investigator or his/her staff will explain the nature of the study, its purpose and associated 
procedures, the expected duration, and the potential risks involved to the patient  prior to 
enrollment. The Investigator or designee will obtain written, informed consent. The patient will 
have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide a 
reason for this decision. Following the discussion regarding the study, a patient  will be asked if 
they are willing to sign and personally date a statement of informed consent. Only if the patient  
voluntarily agrees to sign the informed consent statement and has done so, may he/she enter the study. A copy of the signed and dated ICF will be provided to the patient. The signed ICF is to remain in the Investigator’s file, per local requirements . 
The ICF and any other written information provided to the patient s will be revised whenever 
important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the patient ’s consent, or if 
there is an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change to the content of the patient ’s 
informed consent. The Investigator will inform the patients of changes in a timely manner and will ask the patient s to confirm continuation of their participation in the study by their signature 
on the revised ICF  (if applicable). Any written ICF and written information must receive the 
approval/favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC in advance of use. Any additional approvals from the initial ICF should be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
10.3. Patient Confidentiality  
The written IC F will explain that study data will be stored in a database, maintaining 
confidentiality in accordance with national data legislation. All data processed by FORMA or its representative(s) will be identified by patient  number and study code. 
The written ICF  will also explain that for data verification purposes, authorized representatives 
of FORMA, a regulatory authority, and an IRB/IEC may require direct access to parts of the hospital or clinic records relevant to the study that include the patient ’s medica l history.  
The Investigator must ensure that the patient s’ anonymity is maintained. On the eCRFs or other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor, patient s should not be identified by their names, but by 
their assigned patient  number and study code. Documents not for submission to the Sponsor, 
such as signed ICF, should be maintained in strict confidence by the Investigator.

1. Complete disappearance of the lesion on T2 or FLAIR imaging (if enhancement had  been 
present, it must have resolved completely)  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with 
radiation effects, and no new or inc reased enhancement;  
3. patients must be off corticosteroids or only on physiological replacement doses; and

Partial response 
Partial response requires all of the following criteria compared with the baseline scan:  
1. greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the product of perpendicular diameters of the  
lesion on T2 or FLAIR imaging sustained for a t least 4 weeks compared with baseline;  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with  
3. radiation effects, and no new or increased enhancement; and  
4. patients should be on a corticosteroid dose that should not be greater th an the dos e at time 
of baseline scan, and should be stable or improved clinically  
Minor response 
Minor response requires the following criteria compared with baseline:  
1. a decrease of the area of non-enhancing lesion on T2 or FLAIR MR imaging between 
25% and 50% compared with baseline;  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with 
radiation effect, and no new or increased enhancement; and 
3. patients should be on a corticosteroid dose that should not be greater than the dose at  time 
of baseline scan, and should be stable or improved clinically 
Stable disease 
Stable disease is present if the changes do not qualify for complete, partial, or minor  response, or 
progression and requires:  
1. stable area of non -enhancing abnormalities  on T2 or FLAIR imaging;  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with 
radiation effect, and no new or increased enhancement; and 
3. patients should be on a corticosteroid dose that should not be greater than the dose at t ime 
of baseline scan, and should be stable or improved clinically

Progression is defined by any of the following:  
1. development of new lesions or increase of enhancement (radiological evidence of 
malignant transformation);  
2. a 25% increase of the T2 or FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiati on of therapy, 
not attributable to radiation effect or to comorbid events;  
3. definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor, or 
decrease in corticosteroid dose; or  
4. failure to return for evaluation because of death or deteriorating condition, unless caused 
by documented non-related disorders.

Complete Response 
Complete response requires all of the following  with a confirming scan at least 4 weeks later. In 
the absence of the confirming scan, the response will be considered stable disease :  
1. complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and nonmeasurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks; and 
2. no new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions; and  
3. patient must be off corticosteroids or on physiologic replacement doses only, and 
4. stable or improved clinically.  
Partial Response  
Partial response requ ires all of the following  (In the absence of a confirming scan at least 4 
weeks later, this response will be considered only stable disease) :  
1. ≥50% decrease, compared with baseline, in the sum of products of perpendicular 
diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks;  and 
2. no progression of nonmeasurable disease; and 
3. no new lesions; and 
4. stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan; and  
5. patient must be o n a corticosteroid dose not greater than the dose at time of baseline scan 
and is stable or improved clinically.  
Stable Disease 
If the patient does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression (see next 
section) and requires the fol lowing: 
1.  stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids 
compared with baseline scan and clinically stable status.  
(In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without 
confirmation of disease p rogression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow-up imaging shows 
that this increase in corticosteroids was required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose) 
Progression  
Progression is defined by any of the following (Failure to return for evaluation as a result of 
death or deteriorating condition should also be considered as progression) :  
1. ≥25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions 
(compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids;

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 110 of 113 2.  a significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids compared wit h baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, 
not due to comorbid events; or 
3. the appearance of any new lesions;  or 
4. clear progression of nonmeasurable lesions; or 
5. definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from th e tumor, or to 
decrease in corticosteroid dose.  
Increase in corticosteroid dose alone, in the absence of clinical deterioration related to tumor, 
will not be used as a determinant of progression.  
*Patients with stable imaging studies whose corticosteroid dose was increased for reasons other 
than clinical deterioration related to tumor do not qualify for stable disease or progression. If 
their corticosteroid dose can be reduced back to baseline, they will be considered as having 
stable disease; if further clinical deterioration related to tumor becomes apparent, they will be considered to have progression. The date of progression should be the first time point at which 
corticosteroid increase was necessary.  
**The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the treating physician, but it is 
recommended that a decline in the Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS) from 100 or 90 to 70 or 
less, a decline in KPS of at least 20 from 80 or less, or a decline in KPS from any baseline to 50 or less, for at least 7 days, be considered neurologic deterioration unless attributable to comorbid 
events or changes in corticosteroid dose. Similarly, a decline in the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group and WHO performance scores from 0 or 1 to 2 or 2 to 3 would be considered 
neurologic deterioration.

Response  Definition  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All 
pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to <10 mm in 
short axis  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum of diameters  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR no r sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Sum of diameters increased by at least 20% from the smallest 
value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest) The sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm. (Two lesions increasing from 2 mm to 3 
mm, for example, does not qualify.)

Protocol Title:
A Phase 1a/1b Trial Investigating the CSF -1R Inhibitor LY3022855 in Combination with Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
or Tremelimumab in Patients w ithAdvanced SolidTumors
Rationale:
Checkpoint inhibitors of programmed cell death -1 protein (PD -1)/programmed cell death -ligand1 (PD-L1) and 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA -4) pathways have demonstrated proven, clinically meaningful 
improvement in survival f or patients with various tumor types.  Preclinical data demonstrate significant interplay 
between the innate and adaptive immune systems.  Targeting colon y-stimulating factor 1 (CSF -1) receptor (CSF -1R) 
may lead to disruption of the immunosuppressive effec ts of innate immune cells expressing CSF -1R.  Combining a 
checkpoint inhibitor with an inhibitor of the CSF -1 pathway may potentiate the antitumor response.  This trial will 
investigate the effects of CSF -1R inhibition using LY3022855 (anti -CSF-1R monoclon al antibody) in combination 
with durvalumab (MEDI4736, anti -PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) or tremelimumab (anti -CTLA-4 monoclonal 
antibody) in patients with advanced cancers.
Objectives:
The primary objectives of this study are:
To characterize the safety profile and tolerability of each combination, LY3022855 with durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) , and LY3022855 with tremelimumab, in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.
To define a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for LY3022855 with durvalumab combination , in the 
treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.
The secondary objectives of this study are:
Todocument the antitumor activity of each combination, LY3022855 with durvalumab, and LY3022855 
with tremel imumab, in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors .
To assess the development of antibodies against LY3022855, durvalumab, and tremelimumab 
(immunogenicity).
To characterize the single -dose and multiple -dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of LY3022855 in combination 
with either durvalumab or tremelimumab, and the single -dose and multiple -dose PK of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab, each in combination with LY3022855.

LY3022855Overall Design:
Study I5F -MC-JSCC is a Phase 1a/1b , open-label,nonrandomized, dose -escalatio n (Part Afor both durvalumab or
tremelimumab ), followed by dose -expansio n(Part B) study of intravenous (I.V.) LY3022855 in combination with 
onlyI.V. durvalumab, in patients with advanced solid tumors.  A cycle is defined as 28 days (4 weeks).  Eligible 
patients will receive treatment as follows:
LY3022855 (once weekly [QW] OR once on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle OR once every 2 weeks 
[Q2W]), in combination with:
odurvalumab Q2W
OR
otremelimumab once ever y 4 weeks(Q4W); after 6 doses, tremelimumab once ever y 12 weeks 
(Q12W) until discontinuation from study treatment
The following description applies to each combination therapy :
During Part A, patients will be enrolled in a 3+3 design .  In the LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab regimen, LY3022855 
will be administered at increasing dose levels, as tolerated ; durvalumab will be administered at a fixed dose .  In the 
LY3022855 -plus-tremelimumab regimen, both LY3022855 and tremelimumab will be administered at increasing 
dose levels, as tolerated.  In the event dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs)prevent further dose escalation (LY3022855 
[in both combinations] and tremelimumab only) , additional dosages between the highest dose tested and the 
previously identified safe dosage may be explored after further discussion among the investigators ,sponsor, and 
collaborato r.  Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified for LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab , 
enrollment to the 2disease-specific expansion cohort sin part B of the study cons isting of 20 patients eachwill begin
for ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Patients in Part B will be treated at the MTD for the
LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab combination.  Upon completion of Part B, w hich is intended to confirm tolerabi lity of 
a combination dose, the RP2D will be declared/defined.

Note:  The concept of “evaluable” (and, thus, 
replacement of patients) does not apply to 
patients in Part B.
aPatients who are enrolled in the trial are those who have been assigned to a treatment and have received at least one dose of
study treatment.  The assumption is that every patient who is enrolled in Part A is evalua ble.
bPatients in Part A who receive all doses of study treatment for Cycle 1 (DLT -evaluation period) will be considered evaluable 
for the assessment of a dose level, provided it can be documented whether the patient did or did not experience a DLT within 
28 days of Cycle 1, Day 1.

LY3022855 in Combination with Durvalumab (MEDI4736) or 
Tremelimumab in Patients with A dvanced Solid Tumors
5.Introduction
5.1.Rationale and Justification for the Study
Checkpoint inhibitors of programmed cell death -1 protein (PD-1)/programmed cell death -
ligand1 (PD-L1)and cytotoxic T-lymphocy te associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4)pathways have 
demonstrated proven,clinically meaningful improvement in survival for patients with various 
tumor types.  Preclinical data demonstrate significant interplay between the innate and adapt ive 
immune system s.  Targeting colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor ( CSF-1R)may lead to 
disruption of the immunosuppressive effects of innate immune cells expressing CSF -1R.  
Combining a checkpo int inhibitor with an inhibitor of the CSF -1 pathway  may potenti ate the 
antitumor response. This trial willinvestigate the effects of CSF -1R inhibit ion using 
LY3022855 (anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody)in combination wit h durvalumab (MEDI4736 , 
anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody)or tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody)in 
patients with advanced cancers.
The sponsor, monitor, and invest igators will perform this study in compliance with the protocol, 
good clinical pract ice (GCP) and Internat ional Conference on Harmonisat ion (ICH) guidelines, 
and applicable regulatory  requirements.
5.1.1.Summary of the Rationale for Amendment (a)
Amendment (a) was created to incorporate a protocol synopsis. The following changes were 
also included in this amendment :
Revised an error in Exclusio n Criterion #31 regarding left ventricular eject ion fraction
(LVEF).
Added Exclusio n Criterion #32 to exclude patients with known ROS1 mutation in
NSCLC, as a result of newly approved therapi es for this patient population.
Deleted the tem perature range ( 23°C to 27°C ) for preparation and infusio n of 
LY3022855. The instructions to do this a t room temperature are sufficient.
Revised the permissible electrocardi ogram(ECG)window prior to the start of the 
LY3022855 infusion from 1 hour to 2 hours to accommodate clinical sites.
Other minor changes and revisions throughout the protocol to ensure clarity, internal 
consistency, and correct sentence structure and grammar .
5.1.2.Summary of the Rationale for Amendment (b)
Amendment (b) was created to incorporate the following changes :
Modificat ion of enrollment criteria in terms of prior treatment to reflec t the changing 
landscape of cancer therapies .
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 22
LY3022855Dosing modification and toxici ty management guidelines for immune -mediated, 
infusion-related, and non -immune-mediated reactions included under Table JSCC.5, 
Table JSCC.6 , and Table JSCC.7 h ave been m oved to Attachment 7 with no content 
changes.
Cohort #3 (LY3022855 in combinat ion with durvalumab in pat ients with melanoma), 
Cohort #4 (LY3022855 in combinat ion with tremelimumab in pat ients with 
mesothelio ma),and C
ohort #5 (LY3022855 in combinat ion with tremelimumab in 
patients with melanoma) from Part B of the study  wasremoved.These changes we re 
made for strategic reasons, and not for any  identified safet y concerns. The dose 
escalation of LY3022855 in co mbination with tremelimunab in Part A of the study  will 
be completed, should this co mbination be developed in the future.
Adverse event sof special interest (AESIs)observed with durvalumab ortremelimumab 
were modified in Section 7.2.4.1.1 and  Attachment 8 for consistency with durvalumab
investigator’s brochure(IB)and tremelimumab IB .
Dose-limiting toxicit y (DLT)criteria (creatine kinase[CK] elevation >8×upper limit of 
normal[ULN]) for CKwasaddedfor consistency with the toxicit y management and dose 
modificationguidelines listed in Attachment 7 of I5F-MC-JSCC(JSCC)protocol, non-
immune-mediated reactions. These guidelines recommend different management for CK 
elevations that are > 8X ULN compared to CK elevat ions that are ≤ 8X ULN.
Modificat ion of DLT criteria to allow flexibilit y to continue dosing wit h Grade ≥2 
elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), CK, amylase, and lipase in certain 
situations as described in S ection 7.2.2.1based on the fo llowing rationale:
The key toxicological findings attributed to LY3022855 administration in preclinical studies 
included reversible mild -to-moderate increases in serum transami nases (AST and alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT]) and target organ effects in liver (Kupffer cell hypertrophy /hyperplasia).  
No histological changes in the liver were noted to correlate with the transaminase increases, nor 
were any changes noted in liver func tional parameters (that i s, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, or 
coagulation).  Therefore, based on the small magnitude of the elevat ions and their limited impact 
to the overall health o f the animal
, the increases in ALT and AST were not considered adverse.  
The effect on Kupffer cells, specialized macrophages in the liver that play  an important role in 
the clearance of several serum enzymes, including AST and C K,was regarded as 
immunomodulatory andwas possibly associated wit h elevations in circulat ing CSF-1 levels.
In clinical studies of LY3022855 monotherapy , increases in serum AST and CK levels (mostly 
Grades 1 and 2) were noted in19 and 17 pati ents,respectively, who received LY3022855 ( of the 
total 64 patients) as of 28 January 2017 .  The majority of these pati ents experienced elevati ons in 
both enzymes and received 1.25 mg/kg Q 2W, 2.5 mg/kg QW, 100 mg QW, or 150 mg QW of 
LY3022855.  Onecase of a dose -limiting adverse event (AE) of Grade 4 rhabdo myolysis leading 
to Grade 4 acute renal failure was reported in a patient treated with LY3022855 1.25 mg/kg QW.  
The patient recove red from the events fo llowing discontinuati on of study treatment.  One of the 3 
patients administered the dose of 150 mg QW experienced a Grade 3 CK elevat ion with 
associated elevated levels of serum and urine my oglobin.  Alt hough no similar observat ions were 
noted in additional 3 patients, the dose of 100 mg QW was selected as the recommended Phase 2 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 23
LY3022855dose for LY3022855 due to potential safet y issues related to the QW dosing of 150 mg as 
evidenced by the laboratory  abnormalities induced by  LY3022855.  No ne of the patients with 
increased le vels of AST experienced clinical symptoms suggest ive of hepat ic toxicity, nor were 
elevations of bilirubin noted at the time of the AST elevations.  Among all patients with AST and 
CK elevat ions, only 1 patient who received the dose of 2.5 mg/kg QW o f LY3022855 was 
discontinued fro m the study due to drug -related increases in CK (Grade 3), AST (Grade 3) ,and 
lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH; Grade 1).
Comparatively, preclinical and clinical studies on CSF-1R– targeted m onoclonal antibodies have 
shown asymptomatic increases in short -lived enzymes , such as LDH, CK, and AST (Cassier et 
al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2015).  These increases in the levels o f serum enzymes can be the result of 
decreases in Kupffer cells , depletion of which is co nsistent with the expected pharmaco logic 
effect of CSF -1R pathway inhibit ion onKupffer cells (Radi et al. 2011).
In clinical studies of LY3022855 monotherapy , increases in serum amylase and lipase (most ly 
Grades 1 and 2) were noted in 4and 9 pati ents, respectively, who received single -agent 
LY3022855 ( of the total of 64 patients) as of 28 January  2017.  These patients were treated with 
1.25 mg/kg QW, 1.25 m g/kg Q2W, 100 m g QW, or 150 m g QW of LY3022855.  One of the se 
patients who was treated with LY3022855 1.25 mg/kg QW developed mild-to-moderate 
increases in amylase and lipase levels and was ult imately diagnosed with Grade 3 pancreatit is, 
determined to be dose- limiting.  The patient recovered fro m pancreatit is following study  
treatment interruption but was subsequently removed from study due to the event.  There were 
no other cases of pancreat itis reported with administration of a single -agent LY3022855 as of 28 
January 2017.
These data suggest that elevat ions of serum levelsofenzymes AST, CK, amylase, and lipase, are 
not necessarily indicative of end organ damage, thus, supporting modificat ion of the DLT criteria 
in this protocol to allow flexibilit y to continue dosing with Grade ≥2 elevations of AST, CK, 
amylase, and lipase in certain situat ions as described in Section 7.2.2.1.
5.1.3.Summary of the Rationale for Amendment (c)

5.3.General Introduction to LY 3022855 , Durvalumab, and 
Tremelimumab
LY3022855 is a recombinant human monoclonal antibodyof the immunoglobulin G (IgG), 
subclass1 (IgG1) targeting CSF-1R.  LY3022855 was originally identified from a screen of 
hybridoma candidates generated fo llowing immunizati on of MEDAREX HuMAb™ human 
IgG-transgenic mice wit h soluble human CSF -1R andNIH-3T3cells stably expressing CSF-1R.  
The antibody comprises 2identical gamma () heavy chainsand 2identical kappa ( ) 
lightchains.  LY3022855 was selected for having high affinit y binding to CSF -1R and its abilit y 
to block the binding of CSF -1 and interleukin 34 ( IL-34)to CSF-1R.  The LY3022855 heavy and 
light chain ant ibody genes wer e then engineered into a suitable vector for expressio n in Chinese 
hamster ovary  cells.  Subclo ning techniques were u sedto generate a stable clone expressing high 
levels of LY3022855 for manufacturing purposes.   The nonclinical and clinical experience is 
fully described in the current version of the LY3022855 i nvestigator’s brochure(IB).  It is 
expected that treatment with LY3022855 will mit igate the immunosuppressive effects of cells 
expressing CSF -1R and lead to i ncreased act ivation of the human immune system.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 26
LY3022855Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , a human monoclonal antibodyof the immunoglobulin G1 kappa 
(IgG1κ) subclass ,inhibits binding of PD-L1and is being developed for use in the treatment of 
cancer.  As durvalumab is an engineered monoclonal antibody, it does not induce ant ibody-
dependent cellular cy totoxicity or complement-dependent cy totoxicity.  The proposed 
mechanism o f action for durvalumab is interference of the interaction of PD -L1with PD-1.  
Durvalumab is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 ident ical light chains, with an overall 
molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa.  Durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the 
constant domain of the IgG1 heavy  chain that reduces binding to complement protein C1q and 
the fragment crystallizable gamma (Fcγ) receptors invo lved in triggering effector funct ion.  
Durvalumab has high affinit y and specificityfor PD-L1.  Recently reported data demonstrated 
clinical act ivity with an acceptable safet yprofileacross a range of tumors including squamous 
cellcarcinoma of the head and neck , pancreat ic, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer s
(NSCLC), hepatocellular carcino ma, and melanoma ( Lutzky et al. 2014; Segal  et al. 2014; 
Rizviet al. 2015; Segal  et al. 2015).  The nonclinical and clinical experience is fully described in 
the current version of the durvalumab IB.   It is expected that treatment with an anti- PD-L1 
antibody, such as durvalumab, will lead to increased activat ion of the human immune system, 
increasing ant itumor activity in patients with solid tum ors.
Tremelimumab is an IgG2 kappa isoty pe monoclonal antibodydirected against CTLA -4,
alsoknown as CD152 (cluster of different iation 152).  This immuno modulatory therapy is being 
developed by AstraZeneca for use in the treatment of cancer.
Binding of CTLA -4 to its target ligands (B7 -1 and B7-2) provides a negat ive regulatory signal, 
which limit s Tcell activation.  Anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors antagonize the binding of CTLA -4 to 
B7ligands and enh ance human T cell activation as demonstrated by  increased cy tokine 
(interleukin2 [IL-2]and interferon [IFN] gamma) production in vitro in who le blood or 
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures ( Tarhini and Kirkwood 2008 ).  In addit ion, 
blockade of CTLA-4 binding to B7 by  anti-CTLA-4 antibodies results in markedly  enhanced 
Tcell activation and antitumor activity in animal models, including killing of established murine 
solid tumors and induct ion of protective ant itumor immunit y.  Therefore, i t is expected that 
treatment with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, such as trem elimumab, will lead to increased activation 
of the human immune system, increasing antitumor activit y in patients with solid tum ors.
An extensive program of nonclinical and clinical studie s has been conducted for tremelimumab 
both as monotherapy  and combinati on therapy  with conventional anticancer agents to support 
various cancer indications using different dose schedules.
The nonclinical and clinical experience is fully described in the cu rrent versio n of the 
tremelimumab IB.
Interactions between the innate and adapt ive immune systems are crit ical for normal immune 
function and in the tumor microenvironment.  For example, high numbers of tumor -associated 
macrophage s (TAMs) inversely correlate with infiltration by CD8+ T cells.  Targeting TAMs 
with antibodies directed against CSF -1R have been shown to significant ly decrease macrophage 
infiltration of tumors ( FigureJSCC. 1).  Additionally, anti-CSF-1R treatm ent that limit s 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 27
LY3022855associated macrophages enhances CD8+ Tcellinfiltration, leading to decreases in tumor burden 
(DeNardo et al. 2011 ).  Moreover, in a syngeneic breast cancer model, deplet ion of CD8+ T cells 
rendered treatment with CS F-1R inhibit ionless efficacious, indicat ing interplay between 
macrophage act ivity and Tcell infiltration.
Checkpoint inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4pathways have demonstrated clinically 
meaningful improvement sin survival for patients with various tumor types.  Preclinical studies 
with CSF-1R-blocking monoclonal antibodiesin combination with PD-L1-or CTLA-4-blocking 
monoclonal antibodieshave dem onstrated addi tive effects .  FigureJSCC.2demonstrates addi tive 
effects of CSF-1R and CTLA-4 inhibition; FigureJSCC.3demonstrates additive effects of 
CSF-1R and PD-L1 inhibition.  Given the immunomodulatory effects of the PD-1/PD-L1, 
CTLA-4, and CSF-1R inhibitors, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) as 
additive effects (that is, in the combinations) may be greaterthan that observed with the 
individual agents.  This trial will investigate the effects of CSF-1R inhibition using LY3022855 
in combination with durvalumab or tre melimumab in patients with advanced cancers.

Treatment of murine MC38 tumors with anti -murine CSF -1R antibody (CS7) results in 
reduction of tumo r-infiltrating macrophages.  MC38 colon tumors were treated for 
1week with 3 doses of CS7, and then tumors were isolated and examined for the 
presence of CD45+, CD11b+, CD11cNeg F4/80+ macrophages.  Representative FACS 
plots demonstrate an average of approximately 60% reduction in intra -tumor 
macrophages when treated with ei ther dose of CS7.

triple-negative breast tumors were allowed to grow for 7 day s before being treated for 
1week with 9H10 or CS7 alone or in combination, followed by 2 weeks of continued 
CS7 alone or after combination therapy.  Combination therapy resulted in dramatically

5.4.Rationale for Selection of Dose
5.4.1.LY3022855
Clinicalexperience withLY3022855 comprises 43 patients (as of 28 Jan 2016) who received the 
following doses intravenously  (I.V.):  2.5 m g/kg weekly (QW) (n=6), 0.3 mg/kg QW (n=4), 0.6 
mg/kg QW (n=3), 1.25mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W)(n=20), 1.25 mg/kg QW(n=5), and 1 mg/kg 
on Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 of every  6-week cycle (n=5) in 2 ongoing Lilly-sponsored Phase 1 
studies (I5F-IE-JSCA [JSCA] and I5F-MC-JSCB [JSCB ]).  At the first human dose studied,2.5 
mg/kg QW, which was also the highest dose administered, laboratory abnormalities were noted 
in 5patients (Grade 2 -3 creatine kinase orGrade 2-3 aspartate aminotransferase [AST]
elevations) butwere not classified as dose -limiting toxicit ies (DLTs) due to the lack of clinical 
signsor symptom s of organ toxi city.  Because of these laboratory  abnormalities,the study 
protocol was amended and dose escalat ion was restarted at a lower dose ,0.3 mg/kg QW. Three
dose-limiting toxicit ies (DLTs) have been obse rved in Study  JSCA:  an event of left ventricular 
dysfunction in Cohort 4 (1.25 mg/kg Q2W) and separate eventsof pancreatitis and 
rhabdomyolysis in Cohort 5 (1.25 mg/kg QW).  Upon further review, the patient with the DLT of 
left ventri cular dysfunct ionhad a baseline LVEF of 35% , which obfuscated the relat ionship 
between LY3022855 and the DLT event; therefore, the patient wasconsidered to be a 
suboptimal candidate for study  participation.  No DLTs have occurred at the otherdose levels.
In addition, elevated CK, AST, and LDH levels were observed in pat ients treated with 
LY3022855 at 2.5 mg/kg QW(JSCA), as previously  stated,and at 1.25 mg/kg Q2W(JSCB).  
However, enzyme levels decreased to Grade <2 upon discont inuation of LY3022855, indicat ing 
that these effects were reversible.
In addition to safety, the pharmacodynamics o f the biomarkers,plasma CSF-1,and circulat ing 
CD14DimCD16Brightmononuclear cells were also eval uated in Study I5F-IE-JSCA(JSCA)
(FigureJSCC.4andFigureJSCC.5,respectively ).While there were minimal changes observed 
at the 0.3-mg/kg and 0.6-mg/kg QW dose level s, CSF-1 levelsweresubstantially increased with
1.25-mg/kg and 2.5- mg/kg doses (in a dose-dependent manner) ,as well as suppressio n of 
circulatingCD14DimCD16Brightmononuclear cells , indicating sustained target engagement. 
Furthermore, thesebiomarker response s weremaintained throughout the dosing interval by 
increasing the frequency of dosing from  1.25 mg/kg Q2W to 1.25 mg/kg QW.

Preliminary analyses of the PKdata obtained in Study  JSCA reveal  a lack of correlati on between 
body weight and cl earance o f LY3022855 ( FigureJSCC.
6).  The protocol  for Study JSCA has, 
therefore, been amended (as Version 7.0) to investigate the use of non -weight-based dosing in 
the LY3022855 dose escalat ion, starting init ially with 100 mgQW.
Therefore, based on the available clinical PK, pharmacodynamic, and safety data collected for 
LY3022855 in Study  JSCA and Study  JSCB, and considering the lack of clinical experience wit h 
LY3022855 in co mbination wit h other drug treatments , dose escalat ion of LY3022855 will 
commence at an init ial dose level o f 25 mg QW(approximately  equivalent to a 0.3 -mg/kg QW
dose in a 75 -kgpatient)when incombination with durvalumab .  This LY3022855 dose was not 
associated with any DLTs in the JSCA mo notherapy  dose-escalation trial and is approximately 
one fourth of the current ly recommended Phase 2 dose of LY3022855 (1.25 mg/kg Q2W).  
Because the pl anned dose of durvalumab is equal to the dose being used in Phase 3 studies and 
because there is no plan ned dose escalat ion of durvalumab, a slight ly lower LY3022855 starting 
dose was selected for the combinat ion with durvalum ab, compared with that selected for the 
combination with tremelimumab.  Dose escalat ion of LY3022855 in co mbination with

(approximately equivalent to a 1.25 -mg/kg QWdose in a 75 -kg patient) .
Dose escalat ion of LY3022855 when incombination with tremelimumab will commence at an 
initial dose level o f 50mg QW(approximately equivalent to a 0. 6-mg/kg QWdose in a 75 -kg
patient).  This LY3022855 dose was not associated with any DLTs in the JSCA mo notherapy  
dose-escalation trial and is approximately  one half of the currently recommended Phase 2 dose of 
LY3022855 (1.25 mg/kg Q2W).  Because the planned starting dose of tremelimumab is 
approximately  one tenth of the dose being used in Phase 3 studies and because there i s a planned 
dose escalat ion for tremelimumab, a slight ly higher LY3022855 starting dose was select ed for 
the combination wit h tremelimumab , compared with that selected for the combinat ion with 
durvalumab.  Dose escalation o f LY3022855 in combinat ion with tremelimumab will proceed as 
a single 50- mg increment, up to a planned maximum o f 100 mg QW(approximately equivalent 
to a 1.25-mg/kg QWdose in a 75- kg patient).
Furthermore, in the case where unacceptable toxicity  is observed for the continuous dosing 
schedule ( that is,once per week), the impact of either a reduced dose or a reduced dosing 
intensity (that is,a weeklong break in treatment) on patient safety  will be evaluated.

LY30228555.4.2. D urvalumab
As of May  2015, approximately 1279 patientshave received I.V. durvalumab mo notherapy , the 
majority of which were enrolled on studies CD -ON-MEDI4736- 1108 (n=694) and 
D4191C00003/ATLANTIC (n=303).
Following dose escalat ion of durvalumab in the first-human-dose study,Study CD-ON-
MEDI4736-1108 in patients with advanced so lid tumors , 10 mg/kg Q2W was selected for dose 
expansion. This was the highest dose level admin istered in the dose -escalation phase of the 
study (with respect to total  cycle dose). Treatment -related G rade 3 or higher AEs were reported 
in 378patients (54.5%) who received 10 mg/kg Q2W and were m anageable by general treatment 
guidelines described in the durvalumab study protocols. Thesafety profile of durvalumab 
observed in Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is consistent with thatobserved in Study 
D4191C00003/ATLANTIC.   In combinat ion studies with tremelimumab, dabrafenib ,or 
gefitinib, durvalumab is dosed at 10 mg/kg Q2W or 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks ( Q4W)in the 
dose-expansion phases of each ongoing invest igational trial.
Near-complete target saturation is expected with durvalumab ≥3 mg/kg Q2W , as indicated by  
suppressio n of the biomarker for PD-L1 target engagement, sPD-L1(soluble PD- L1).
A population PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data fro m a Phase 1 
study (Study CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108; N=292; doses=0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg 
every3 weeks [ Q3W]; solid tumors). Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of 
body weight on PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤0.5). The impact of body weight-based 
(10mg/kg Q2W) and fixed d osing (750 m g Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by  comparing 
predicted steady  state PK concentrations (5th, median ,and 95th percent iles) using the populat ion 
PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median 
body weightof approximately  75 kg). A total of 1000 patients were simulated using body 
weightdistribution of 40to 120 kg. Simulation results demonstrate that body  weight-based and 
fixeddosing regimens yield similar median steady  state PK concentrations with sl ightly less 
overall between -subject variabilit y with fixed dosing regimen.
Similar findings have been reported by  others (Ng et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 
2012, Narwal et al. 2013).  Wang and co lleagues investigated 12 monoclonal ant ibodies and 
found that fixed and body  size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 
7 of 12 ant ibodies.  In addit ion, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides and 
showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in term s of reducing the between -subject 
variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD)parameters (Zhang et al .2012).
A fixed-dosing approach is preferred by  the prescribing communit y due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors.  Given expectation of s imilar PKexposure and variabilit y, it was
considered feasible to switch to fixed -dosing regimens.
The observed PK exposures of durvalumab in the presence of tremelimumab, dabrafenib ,or 
gefitinib were consistent with respect ive monotherapy  durvalumab exposure data, indicat ing no 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 37
LY3022855PK interaction between these agents.  The PK interaction between the combinat ion of interest for 
this trial, LY3022855 and durvalumab, has not y et been clinic ally evaluated.
Therefore, b asedon the available clinical PK, pharmacodynamic ,and safety data collected for
durvalumab monotherapy  and combinat iontherapywith tremelimumab , this combinat ion trial 
will commence enro llment at a dose of 750 mg of durvalumab Q2W(equivalent to a 10 -mg/kg 
Q2Wdose in a 75 -kg patient ).
5.4.3. T remelimumab
As of November 2014, approximately 973 patients have received I.V. tremelimumab 
monotherapy .
Following an initial multiple-dose escalat ion of tremelimumab (3, 6, 10 mg/kg every 28 days 
[Q28D]) in a Phase 1/2 study  (Study A3671002 ), patients were subsequent ly enrolled to evaluate 
the antitumor activit y of 2alternative dosing regimens: 10 mg/kg I.V.Q28D versu s 15 mg/kg 
I.V.every 90 days ( Q90D). Among patients treated with 10 mg/kg Q28D or 15 mg/kg Q90D, 
the median durations of object ive response were 553 day s and 722 day s, respect ively.  
Treatment -related SAEs occurred in 25.0% of patients treated wi th 10 mg/kg Q28D and in 8.9% 
of patients treated wi th 15 mg/kg Q90D. The results of this study  led to a decisio n to proceed 
with the dosing regimen o f 15 mg/kg Q90D in subsequent studies init iated by PfizerInc
(previous sponsor ).
However, subsequent retrospective exposure-responseanalyses suggested that the 15-mg/kg 
Q90Dschedule could result in underexposure to tremelimumab . An intensified schedule o f 
tremelimumab is now under evaluat ion whereby  patientsreceive 10 mg/kg Q28D for 6 doses, 
followed by 15 m g/kg Q90D unt il treatment discont inuation (Calabrò et al. 2015).
In the ongoing combination studywith durvalumaband tremelimumab (Study D4190C00006) , 
the dose level selected for tremelimumab in the dose -expansion phase is 1 mg/kg Q4W. Doses 
higher than 1 mg/kg Q4W ( that is,3 mg/kg Q4W and 10 mg/kg Q4W) in combinat ion with 
durvalumab at 10, 15 ,or 20 mg/kg Q4W were associated with increased incidence of AEs.
A population PK model was developed for treme limumab using data from Phase 1 through 
Phase3 studies (N=654; 0.01 -15-mg/kg doses Q4W or Q90D; metastatic melano ma) 
(Wangetal. 2014). The population PK model indicated minor impact of body  weighton PK of 
tremelimumab (coefficient of ≤0.5). The weight-based (1 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed -dosing (75 mg 
Q4W; based on median body  weightof approximately  75 kg) regimens were com pared using 
predicted PK concentrations ( 5th, median,and 95th percentiles ) using the population PK model 
in a simulated populat ionof 1000 pati ents with body weight di stribution of 40 to 120 kg. Similar 
to durvalumab, simulat ions indicated that both body  weight-based and fixed -dosing regimens of 
tremelimumab yield similar median steady -state PK concentrati ons with slightly less between-
subject variabilit y withthefixed-dosing regimen.
Therefore, b ased on the available clinical PKand safety data collected for tremelimumab in 
monotherapy and in combinat ion with durvalumab , this combination trial will commence 
enrollment at a dose of 75mg of tremelimumab Q4W(equivalent to a 1-mg/kg Q4W dose in a 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 38
LY302285575-kg patient) for the first 6 doses, fo llowed by dos ingon an every -12-week (Q12W)schedule, 
starting 4 weeks after Dose 6 (Week 25), until treatment discont inuation.  This starting dose is 
10-fold lower than the current ly recommended dose of tremelimumab monotherapy , andwas 
selected to allow for an increase dmargin of safety,since the combinat ion of LY3022855 and 
tremelimumab has not yet been studied in pat ients.
It is intended that the dose escalat ion of tremelimumab could reach 750 mg Q4W for the first 
6doses,followed by dosing on a Q12W schedule (approximately  equivalent to a 3-mg/kg Q4W 
dose in a 75- kg patient). This planned dose l evel is the currently  recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of tremelimumab for the monotherapy  (10 mg/kg Q4W) .

6.2.Summary of Study Design
Study I5F-MC-JSCC is a multicenter,nonrando mized, open -label, dose-escalation (Part A), 
followed by dose -expansion(Part B) Phase1a/1b study of LY3022855 in co mbination with 
durvalumab or tremelimumab (Part A) or durvalumab only (Part B) ,in patients with advanced 
solid malignancies.   A cycle is defined as 28 days (4 weeks).  Eligible patients will receive 
treatment as follows:
LY30228 55 (once weekly [QW] OR once on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle OR once 
every 2 weeks [Q2W]) , in combinat ion with:
odurvalumab Q2W(PartsA and B)
OR
otremelimumab once every  4 weeks (Q4W); after 6 doses, tremelimumab once 
every 12 weeks (Q12W) until discont inuation(Part A only)
The study  will be conducted in 2parts:
Part A –Phase 1a, doseescalation
Part B –Phase 1b,disease-specific expansio n
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 47
LY3022855The following descript ion applies to each combination therapy .
During Part A,patients will be enro lled in a 3+3design.  In the LY3022855- plus-durvalumab 
regimen, LY3022855 will be administered at increasing dose levels,as tolerated; durvalumab 
will be administered at a fixed dose .  In the LY3022855- plus-tremelimumab regimen, both 
LY3022855 and tremelimumab will b e administered at increasing dose levels, as tolerated.  In 
the event DLTs prevent further dose escalation (LY3022855 [in both combinat ions] and 
tremelimumab only) , additional dosagesbetween the highest dose tested and the previously 
identified safe dos agemay be explored after further discussion amongthe investigators , sponsor, 
and collaborator.  Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identifiedfor the 
LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab combination , enrollment to Part B(2 disease-specific expansio n 
cohorts of 20 patients per cohort )will begin .  The NSCLC cohort will consist of a minimum o f 
10 patients with disease refractory  to checkpoint therapy  and a minimum of 6 patientswith 
disease relapsed on prior checkpoint therapy.  Patients in Part B will be treated atthe MTDfor 
LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab combination .  Upon com pletion of Part B, which is intended to 
confirm tolerability of a combinat ion dose, the RP2D will be de clared/defined.
All patients enrolled to all cohorts of PartA or to the ovarian cancer cohort (only) of Part Bwill 
undergo mandatory attempted pretreatm ent and on-treatment (6-8 weeks after starting study 
treatment) tumor core needle or excisio nal biopsies.

To characterize the safet y profile andtolerability and to definethe RP2Dof the combinat ions of 
LY3022855 wi th durvalumab or tremelimumab , an adequate sam ple size is required.  The actual 
sample size in Part A depends on the incidence of DLTs and is est imated to be up to 
approximately  78patients; refer to Section 10.1for additional details.
In Part A, a fter all patients who are deemed evaluable for the assessment of dose levels complete 
the DLT-evaluation period or the MTD is determined, an interim safet y and PKanalysis may be 
conducted for each combinat ion for planningnext studi es.  After com pletion of enrollment to 
Part B, if it is deemed that enough data areobtained to assess the primary and secondary 
objectives, a clinical study report maybe written before the last patient visitfor the study .
The planned durat ion of treatment is not fixed; pat ients will remain on study unt il they fulfill one 
of the criteria for study discontinuation (Section 6.3) .
Refer to Attachment 1 for the Study  Schedule.
6.2.1.Study Completion and End of Trial
This studywillbe considered complete (that i s, the scientific evaluation will be co mplete[study
completion]) when the primary and secondary  study objectives have been met.  “Endof trial”
refers to the date of the last visit or last scheduled proced ure for the last patient.
The end o f trial occurs after study  completion and after the last patient has discont inued study 
treatment and com pleted any  applicable continued ac cess follow-up.
6.2.2.Continued Access Period
Patients who are still on study treatmentat the time of study co mpletion may continue to receive 
study treatment if they are experiencing clinical benefit and no undue risks.
Continued access will apply to this study  only if at least onepatient is st ill on study treatment
when study  completion occurs.  Lilly (the sponsor)will notify invest igators when the continued 
access period begins.

I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 50
LY3022855The sponsormay allow patients to enroll in a nLY3022855 “rollover” protocol to provide long -
term continued access for patients enrolled in this study .
Patients must sign a new ICF before continued access is provided.
The patient's continued access to study treatment(Visits 501-5XX)will end when the patient and 
investigator agree that the patient will no longer cont inue to receive study treatment .  Continued 
access follow-up (Visits 901[30-day] and 902 [90 -day, only for durval umab and trem elimumab 
safety]) will begin the day after the patient and the investigator agree that the patient will no 
longer continue to receive study  treatment.  Continued access fo llow-upfor Visit 901 lasts 
approximately  30 days (±7 days); Visit 902 occurs 90 days (±7 days)after the pati ent and 
investigator agree that the patient will no longer cont inue to receive study treatment .  Follow-up 
procedures will be performed as shown in the Continued Access Schedule in Attachment 1.

LY30228556.3.1.Discontinuation of Patients Inadvertently Enrolled
If the sponsoror the investigator site identifies a patient who did not meet enrollment criteria and 
who was inadvertent ly enrolled, a discussio n must occur between the sponsor’sclinical research 
physician ( CRP)/clinical research scient ist (CRS)and the investigator to determine if the pat ient 
may continue in the study.  If both agree that it is medically appropriate to continue, the
investigator must obtain documented approval from the sponsor’sCRP/CRSto allow the 
inadvertent ly enrolled patient to continue in the study  with or without study treatm ent.
6.3.2.Discontinuation of Patients from Study and/or Study Treatment
Patients who are di scontinued from the study treatment will have follow-up procedures 
performed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).

LY30228557.2.1.Dosing Schedule
Refer to Section 7.2.2for Part A (dose escalat ion) dose regimens for each co mbination, by 
cohort.  Refer to Section 7.2.3for Part B (disease -specific expansio n) dose regimens for 
LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab , by cohort.
For eachcombination regimen, LY3022855 will be administered first ,followed by a 30 -minute 
observation period.  After the observat ion period, durvalumab or t remelimumabwill be 
administered .In thisstudy, acycle is definedas 4 weeks (28 days); Day 1 of a cycle is based on 
the administration o f LY3022855 (rather than durvalumab or tremelimumab) .A delay of study 
treatmentdue to holiday, weekend, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances w ill be 
permitted for a maxi mum of 3 days and not counted as a protocol deviation.
7.2.1.1. LY3022855
Eligiblepatients will receive LY3022855 as an I.V. infusio n administered over a minimum 
duration of 30 minutes and a maximum durat ion of 4 hours, based on the known safety  and 
stability of the prepared drug. The infusio n rate should not exceed 25 mg/minute. Suggested 
infusion times are as fo llows:
90 minutes for the first infusio n; if noinfusion-related reacti on(IRR)is observed, 
decrease the infusio n time to 60 minutes for the second infusio n
60 minutes for the second infusio n; if no IRR is observed, decrease the infusion t ime to 
30 minutes for the third infusion
30 minutes for the third and subsequent infusio ns
If, at any time, a pati ent experiences an IRR, the infusio n time should not be decreased .  
Premedication is not recommended to be administered prior t o the first infusio n ofLY3022855 .  
However, if the pat ient experiences a Grade 1 or 2 IRR, premedication must be provided prior to 
any subsequent doses of LY3022855 .The choice of premedicat ion is to be made after 
discussion and agreement between the inv estigatorandsponsor.  In such cases (Grade 1 or 2 
IRRs), administration of steroids should be avoided, if possible.   If an IRR Grade ≤2 occurs 
during or after LY3022855 administration and the patient’s condit ion allows it, treatment with 
durvalumab or tr emelimumab will proceed as planned.   Patients experiencing an IRR Grade ≥3 
will be permanent ly discont inued from study treatment.
LY3022855 may be administered up to 3 day s AFTER the scheduled dosing date and up to 4
days BEFORE the next scheduled dosing dateto accommodate for patient vacat ions, holidays, 
inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances .  If, at any time, a dose is to be 
administered bey ondthe 3-day window, that dose is to be skipped.  A maximum of 28days 
between administered doses is allowed for delays due to adverse events .
7.2.1.2. Durvalumab
Patientsare toreceive durvalu mabI.V. on Days 1 and 15 of every cycle.  Durvalumab may be 
administered up to 3 days AFTER the scheduled dosing date.  If, at any t ime, a dose is 
administered bey ondthe 3-day window, that dose is considered a dose delay.  A maximum de lay 
of 28days between administered doses is allowed (for dose delay  in case of immune -related AE 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 57
LY3022855please refer to Secti on 7.2.4.1).  Note that a maximum of 12 months/26 doses of durvalumab 
treatment is permitted .
Refer to Attachment 9 for the durvalumab dose vo lume calculat ion.
Durvalumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately  25°C) by controlled 
infusion via an infusion pump into a peripheral or central vein.  Following preparati on of 
durvalumab, the entire contents of the I.V.bag should be administered as an I.V.infusion over 
approximately  60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2 -or 0.22-μm in-line filter.  Less than 
55minutes is considered a deviat ion.
The I.V.line will be flushed with a volume of I.V.solution (0.9% [w/v] saline) equal to the 
priming vo lume of the infusio n set used after the contents of the I.V.bag are fully administered, 
or complete the infusio n according to inst itutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered 
and document if the line was not flushed.
A 1-hour observat ion period is requi red after the first infusio n of durvalumab.  If no clinically  
significant infusi on reactions are observed during or after the first cy cle, subsequent infusio n 
observation periods can be at the investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each 
durvalumab infusio n).
Patients will be monitored during and after the infusion wit h assessment of vital signs at the 
times specified in th is study protocol.
In the event of a Grade ≤2 IRR, the infusion rate of study  drug may be decreased by  50% or 
interrupted until reso lution of the event and re -initiated at 50% of the initial rate unt il completion 
of the infusio n.For patients with a Grade ≤2 IRR, subsequent infusio ns may be administered a t 
50% of the init ial rate.Acetaminophen and/or an ant ihistamine ( for example , diphenhydramine) 
or equivalent medicat ions per institutional standard may  be administered at the discret ion of the 
investigator. If the IRRis Grade ≥3 in severit y, study drugwill be permanently discontinued.
7.2.1.3. Tremelimumab
Patients are toreceive tremelimumab I.V.on Day 1 of every cycle for the first 6 doses
(Cycles1-6).  Starting with Cycle 7 (4 weeks after Dose 6 [Week 25]),tremelimumab will be 
dosed once every 3 cycles (12 weeks), that is,on Day 1 of Cycles 7, 10, 13, and so on, until 
disease progressi on.
Tremelimumab may  be administered up to 3 days AFTER the scheduled dosing date.  If, at any 
time, a dose is administered beyo nd the 3-day window, that dose i s considered a dose delay .  A 
delay of up to 28 days between administered doses is allowed for Cycles 1 through 6, and up to 
60 days between doses for Cycles 7 and bey ond.
Refer to Attachment 9 for the tremelimumab dose vo lume calculat ion.
Tremelimumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately  25°C) by controlled 
infusion via an infusion pump into a peripheral or centr al vein.  Following preparati on of 
tremelimumab, the entire contents of the I.V.bag should be administered as an I.V.infusion over 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 58
LY3022855approximately  60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2 -or 0.22-μm in-line filter.  Less than 
55minutes is considered a deviat ion.
The I.V.line will be flushed with a volume o f 0.9% (w/v) saline equal to the priming volume o f 
the infusion set used after the contents of the I.V.bag are fully administered, or complete the 
infusion according to institutional po licy to ensure the f ull dose is administered and document if 
the line was not flushed.
In the event that either preparation time or infusio n time exceeds the time limits presented in this 
section, a new dose must be prepared from new vials.  Tremelimumab does not contain 
preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded.
A 1-hour observat ion period is requi red after the first infusio n of tremelimumab.  If no clinically 
significant infusi on reactions are observed during or after the first cy cle, subsequent infusio n 
observation periods can be at the investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each 
tremelimumab infusio n).
Patients will be monitored during and after the infusion wit h assessment of vital signs at the 
times specified in this study  protocol.
In the event of a Grade ≤2 IRR, the infusio n rate of study  drug may be decreased by  50% or 
interrupted until reso lution of the event and re -initiated at 50% of the initial rate unt il completion 
of the infusio n.For patients with a Grade ≤2 IRR, subsequent infusi ons may be administered at 
50% of the init ial rate.Acetaminophen and/or an ant ihistamine ( for example , diphenhydramine) 
or equivalent medicat ions per institutional standard may  be administered at the discret ion of the 
investigator. If the IRRis Grade ≥3 in severit y, study drug will be permanently discontinued.
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylact ic reactions must be immediately available, and 
study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The study  site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitat ion teams and equipment in addit ion to the abilit y to 
admit patients to an intensive care unit if necessary.
7.2.2.Part A:  Dose Esc alation (Phase 1 a)
By nature of being a dose -escalation study, data will be evaluated on an ongoing basis unt il the 
MTD is determined.   Safety data, in particular AEs, will be the primary  criteria for the dose 
escalation.  No dose escalat ion can occur with out prior discussion and agreement between the 
investigator ,theLillystudy team, and the collaborator ; thedecision will be documented in 
writing.
Based on the ongoing safety  reviews, m odifications to the dose -escalation strategy  or other 
design elements may be made via protocol amendment to ensure patient safet y.No intrapatient 
doseescalation is permitted for any patient.  Dose escalat ion may be ceased at any  time based on
available safety and PK behavior.
In Part A, study  drugs for the LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab and LY3022855 -plus-tremelimumab 
combinations maybe administered at the dose regimens shown in TableJSCC.1and

7.2.2.1. Dose-Limiting Toxicity Determination and Maximum Tolerated Dose 
Definition
Dose-limiting toxicit y is defined as an AE that is at leastpossibly related to the study drug(s) and
that occurs during Cycle 1 (the DLT -evaluation period) and does not improve to the National 
Cancer Inst itute’s (NCI) Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0
(CTEP 2009) Grade ≤2 (unless stated otherwise), despite medical management, including 
steroids (if applicable).  Toxicity that is clearly and direct ly related to the primary  disease or to 
another etio logy is excluded fro m this definition.  The following are considered DLTs,unless 
noted otherwise :
Grade 4 neutropenia last ing ≥7 days
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia complicated by fever or infect ionof any duration
Any Grade 4 thrombocy topenia

example, inflammatory  reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc)
Concurrent vit iligo or alopecia of any AE grade
Grade 3 IRR(first occurrence and in the absence of steroid prophylaxis) that 
resolves within 6 h ours with appropriate clinical management
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that is not associated with fever or systemic infect ion 
that improves by at least 1 grade within 3 days. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia 
will be a DLT regardless of duration or reversibil ity

Asymptomat ic Grade 3 AST induct ion that is accompanied by Grade ≤1 ALT and Grade 
≤1 TBand no change of ALT or TB from baseline l evels.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 64
LY3022855Adverse events meeting DLT criteria that occur bey ond Cycle 1 are defined as dose-limiting 
equivalent toxicities (DLETs).  If a patient is believed to be benefitting fro m studytreatment, 
patients who experience a DLT may continue to receive study treatmentupon agreement of the 
investigator, sponsor, and collaborator .
For the purpose of this study , the MTD i s defined as the highest tested dose that has less than 
33% probabilit y of causing a DLT.  The MTD will be determined as showninTableJSCC.3and 
TableJSCC.4.
7.2.2.2. Dose-Escalation Method
Three to 6 patients will be enro lled to Cohort 1a (that is, Cohort D1a or T1a; refer to 
TableJSCC.1and TableJSCC.2for LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab and LY3022855- plus-
tremelimumab co mbinations, respectively).  If none of the first 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients in 
Cohort 1a experiences a DLT event, enrollment to the next “a” cohort will proceed (that is, to 
Cohort 2a, and so on).  However, i f 1 of 3 pati ents in any cohort (that is, at any dose level)
experiences a DLT, up to 3 addit ional patients will be enro lled at that dose level.  If a DLT is 
observed in ≥2 of a m aximum of 6 patients in Cohorts 1a, 2a, 3a, or 4a, concurrent enrollment of 
3 to 6 patients to each of the respective “ b”, “c”, and “d” c ohorts(as applicable) will occur and 
no higher dosages will be explored.  For example, if no DLTs are noted in Cohort 1a, enrollment 
to Cohort 2a will occur; however, if 2 pat ients in Cohort 2a experience DLTs, enro llment to 
Cohorts 2b and 2c will occur concurrently and no higher dosages will be studied.  An except ion 
to this method is that enrollment to D nb/Tnb cohorts will occur only  if ≥2 DLTs are observed 
after Cycle 1, Day  21 of the corresponding D na/Tna cohorts.  All patients will be assigned to 
treatment cohorts by  the sponsor, withpatients assigned sequent ially to the “b”, “c”, and “d” 
cohorts.
The MTD identified for each combination therapy in Part A will then bethe dosage used 
(confirmed) in Part B (Phas e 1b/disease -specific expansio n).  However, if each of the“b”, “c”, 
and “d” cohorts (as applicable) in Part A are observed to have a probabilit y of causing a DLT
that is lower than 33% , the sponsor (in consultat ion with the collaborator) will select the dosage 
to be usedin Part B, based on clinical or correlat ive study results.

7.2.3.Part B:  Disease -Specific Expan sion(Phase 1b)
Once the MTDfor LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab combinat ion has been identified, enrollment to 
Part B (disease-specific expansion) will be ginand will include 2 expansion cohorts (refer to 
Section 6.1.1, Inclusion Criterion [2] ) .  Patients in these expansio n cohorts will be treatedat the 
MTDidentifiedfor LY3022855 -plus-durvalumab combination in Part A, unless otherwise 
specified by the sponsor.  If patients are treated at a dose other than the MTD, the dosage chosen 
will not exceed the MTD exposure.
Additional cohorts of patients with alternative tumor histologies may be added ifclinical act ivity 
is observed during Part A .In the event of DLTs (Section 7.2.2.1)  or DLETsoccurringin 33% or 
more of patients in Part B (with a minimum  enrollment of 6 pati ents) within a tumor-specific 
expansion cohort, invest igators and the sponsorstudy team will assess the nature and severit y of 
these toxicit ies. No additional patients will be accrued until this safet y review is co mpleted and 
a decision is made ei ther to continue at the current dose or to de -escalate the dose and define a 
new dose for the expansio n phase.
7.2.4.Dose Adjustments , Interruptions, and Delays
No dose reduction s (of any study  drug) arepermitted during this study .
Dosing interruptions o f study drugsare permitted for reasons not related to study  treatment (for 
example, minor surgery , unrelated m edical events, patient vacat ion, and/or holidays).  The 
reason for interruption should be documented on the case report form ( eCRF).
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 66
LY3022855In addition, doses of stu dy drug(s)may need to be delayed to manage specific AEs or other 
toxicities.  Refer to Section 7.2.4.1for implementation of dose delays due to AE s.
All dose modificat ions should be documented, including the approach taken and a clear rationale 
for the need for modification.
7.2.4.1. Dose Delays for Adverse Events
Study treatment may be held for a m aximum of28 days; see except ion for an immune -related 
AE below.  If appropriate, and in the opini on of the investigator and upon agreement with the 
sponsor, study  treatment may resume upon resol ution of clinically  significant AEs to baseline or 
improvement to Grade <2.   If AEs, see exception for an immune -related AE, do not resolve to 
baseline or improve to Grade <2 within 28 daysfollowing the last administered dose, study  
treatment should bepermanent ly discontinued and the patient should be discont inued from the 
trial.If treatment is held, the day  of treatment should continue as if no drug interruption has 
occurred.  For example, if study  drug is held on D6 of a cycle and AEs have resolved by D10
(4days later), the study  drugs shoul d be resumed per the original schedu le,  If the original 
schedule results in a study  drug being held for >28 day s, the study  drug may not be  resum ed.  
One or both study  drugs may be held, resum ed, or discontinued.
If the AE is an immune related AE as outlined in Attachment 7,andif the treatment management 
guidelines outlined in Attachment 7are followed and docum ented in the pati ent’s medical 
record, treatment may be held for >28 days to allo w taper of high dose steroids. Treatment may
resumein this setting only  upon resol ution of immune AEs to baseline or improvement to Grade
<2, and only  ifdeemed clinically appropriate by  the treating physician and agreed to by  
the 
sponsor.  If steroids cannot be tapered as o utlined in Attachment 7 ,  and/orAEs do not resolve to 
<Grade2, the patient may not be resumed on study treatment.
For the purposes of documentation, the invest igator must assess if the toxicit y is considered at 
least possibly  related to study  treatment(that is, the combinat ion regimen) and if the AE is 
considered to be immune related. Investigators are encouraged to consult the sponsor for 
additional guidance.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 67
LY3022855ForAEsthat are considered at least possibly relatedto study treatment,the following dose 
adjustment guidance may  be applied:
Treat each of the toxicit ies with maximum supportive care (including ho lding the study 
drug[s]suspected of causing the toxicit y where requi red).
If the symptoms prompt ly resolve w ith supportive care, considerat ion should be given to 
continuing the same dose of study drugsalong with appropriate continuing supportive 
care.
All dose modificat ions should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of 
the approach taken.
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which study drugsshould be perm anently 
discontinued (refer to Attachment 7 ).
Following the first dose of study drugs, subsequent administration of study drugscan be 
modified based on toxicit ies observed ( refer toAttachment 7).
7.2.4.1.1. Specific Adverse Events
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)observed with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab 
include colitis; pneumonitis; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT)/AST increases ;
hepatitis/hepatotoxicit y; neuropathy /neuromuscular toxi city (that is,events of encephalit is, 
peripheral motor and sensory  neuropathi es, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis) ; 
endocrinopathy  (that is,events of hypophysit is, adrenal insufficiency, hyper thyroidism,and 
hypothyroidism; type 1 diabetes mellitus ); dermatitis; nephritis; and pancreat itis (or labs 
suggestive of pancreat itis-increased serum lipase or serum amylase) ;other inflammatory  
responses that are rare with a potential immune -mediated eti ology include, but are not limited to, 
myocarditis, pericarditis, myositis/polymyositis, and uveitis.  Refer to Attachment 8 for details 
about and management of AESIs.
Guidelines for the management of immune -mediated, infusio n-related, and non -immune-related 
AEsare shown in Attachment 7 .
Adverse events (both nonserious and serious) associated with study drugsmay represent an 
immune-related etiology, which may  be based on the mechanism of act ion of study drugsleading 
to Tcell activation and proliferat ion.  These irAEs may occur shortly  after the first dose or 
several mo nths after the last dose of treatment.  Potential irAEs include immune -mediated 
enterocolit is, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies.  Patients should be monitored for signs 
and symptoms of irAEs.  In the absence of an alternat iveetiology (for example , infection or 
progressive disease ), signs or symptom s of enterocolit is, dermatitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, 
myocarditis, myopathy/polymy opathy and endocrinopathy  should be considered immune related.  
Refer to Attachment 7 forsupportive care guidelines for immune -mediated reactions, including 
use of corticosteroids.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 68
LY3022855Based on observations fro m clinical trials wit h LY3022855, pati entsreceiving study treatment
should be closely monitored for signs of hepat ic functionimpairment (for example, increases in 
transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase [ LDH], bilirubin, coagulat ion disorders) and creatine 
kinaseincreases.
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylact ic reactions must be immediately available, and 
study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The study  site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitat ion teams and equipment in addit ion to the ability to 
admit patients to an intensive care unit if necessary.   RefertoAttachment 7 for management of 
infusion-related AEs.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 69
LY30228557.3.Method of Assignment to Treatment
7.3.1.Part A:  Dose Escalation (Phase 1 a)
A patient who meetsall criteria for enrollment will be assigned (by the sponsor) to receive study
treatment.  Before each patient’s enrollment into t he study, an eligibilit y check must be 
conducted between the invest igational site and the Lillyclinical research personnel to confirm 
that each patient meets all enrollment criteria.   Upon confirmat ion of eligibilit y, the sponsorwill 
confirm the dose and identification number assignment a nd cohort for each patient.
If investigators have eligible pat ients who have consented concurrent ly, more than 3patients 
may be assigned to a particular dose level provided that accrual has no t ceased due to excessive 
toxicity.  This enrollment procedure is allowed because of the advanced disease state of this 
patient popul ation and the screening involved in defining eligibilit y.  Assigning more than 
3patients to a particular dose level shouldbe approved by  the sponsorfollowing discussio ns 
with the invest igators.
7.3.2.Part B:  Disease -Specific Expansion (Phase 1b)
A patientwho meets all criteriafor enrollment will be assigned (by the sponsor) to a treatment 
cohort, based on the patient’sdiagnosis at baseline .
7.4.Blinding
This is an open -label study .
7.5.Concomitant Therapy
All concomitant medications should be recorded throughout the patient’s participat ion in the 
study.  The principal investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication 
taken from the time of screening until the end o f the clinical phase of the study  (final study  visit).  
Appropriate documentation for all forms of premedicat ions, supportive care, and co ncomitant 
medications, including herbal preparat ions,must be captured on the case report form (eCRF).
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 70
LY30228557.5.1.Excluded Concomitant Therapy
Other than the study  treatment to whi ch the pati ent is assigned (Section 7.2)and any required 
contracepti ve(Section6.1.1),
no other chemotherapy , immunother apy, cancer-related biologic or
hormone therapy , herbal preparationintended to treat cancer, or experimental drugs will be 
permitted while the patient ison this study. Palliative radiotherapy may be allowedafter 
consultation wit h the sponsor.  Disease progression requiring other forms of ant itumor therapy 
will necessitate discont inuation of the study treatment .
The following are al so not permitted during the study:
Immunosuppressive medications including, but not limited to systemic corticosteroi ds at 
doses not exceeding 10 mg/day  of prednisone or equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, 
and tumor necrosi s factor (TNF)-α blockers.
oUse of immunosuppressive medicat ions for the management of invest igational 
product-related AEs or in patients with contrast allergies is permitted .
oUse of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids is permitted.
oA temporary period of steroids will be permitted for different indicat ions, at the 
discretion of the principal investigator (for example , chronic obstructive 
pulmonarydisease, radi ation, nausea, etc).
Live attenuated vaccines within 30 days of Cycle 1, Day 1 dosing (that is, 30 days pri or 
to the first dose of study treatment, during study treatment,and for 30 days 
postdiscont inuation of study treatment).
oInactivated vaccines, such as the injectable influenza vaccine, are permitted.
7.5.2.Permitted Concomitant Therapy
Concurrent use of hormones for noncancer -related condi tions (insulin for diabetes, hormone 
replacement therapy ) is permitted .
Patients shoul d receive concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary by the 
investigator to provide adequate prophylact ic or supportive care ,including acetaminophen or 
diphenhydramine, antibiotics,nutritional support, growth factor support (except granulocy te 
colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] or granulocy te macrophage co lony-stimulating factor 
[GM-CSF]), or therapy  for correction of metabo lic disorders, optimal symptom control, and pain 
management .  If clinically indicated at any t ime durin g the study , erythropoietin and transfusions 
(packed red blood cells, who le blood, platelets, or plasma) may be used according to American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)guidelines (Ri zzo et al. 2010).
Refer to Section 7.2.1.1for informat ion regarding premedicat ion for IRRs.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 71
LY30228557.6.Treatment Compliance
Study treatmentwill be administered I.V.at the investigational site, under the direct ion of the 
investigator.  As a result, a patient’s co mpliance wit h study drug administration is ensured.  
Patients shoul d attend scheduled clinic visit s and must comply  with study criteria under thei r 
control. Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded on the eCRF.
7.6.1.Evaluable Patients
Patients in Part A who receive alldoses of study treatment for Cycle 1 (DLT -evaluation period) 
will be considered evaluable for the assessment of a dose le vel,provided it can be documented 
whether the patient did or did not experience a DLT within 28 days o f Cycle1, Day 1.
Conversely , any patient in Part A who is discont inued from the study before completing one
cycleof study treatment will be deemed none valuable for assessment of a dose level, unless they  
experience a DLT prior to withdrawal.   Nonevaluable pat ients may be replaced to ensure that 
enough pat ientscomplete onecycle of therapy at each dose l evelfor Part A, unless accrual to 
that cohort has stopped due to a DLT .
Patients who are not evaluable for PKbut who complete onecycle of therapy may be replaced 
upon consultation with the invest igator(s) and the sponsor’s CRP/CRS to ensure adequate PK 
data, unless accrual to that cohort has stopped due to a DLT.
Note that the concept of “evaluable” (and , thus, replacement of patients) does not apply to 
patients in Part B.

LY30228558.Safety, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacody namic, and 
Efficacy Data Collection
8.1.Safety Evaluations
The safety and tolerability of LY3022855, durvalumab, and tremelimumab have been assessed in 
nonclinical toxicology  studies,clinical studies, and the results from these studies are detailed in 
the IBs.  This Phase 1a/1bstudy contains detailed safet y monitoring that will permit init ial 
characteri zation of the safet y profile of the combinati on of LY3022855 plusdurvalumab or 
LY3022855 plustremelimumab .  Study procedures and their t iming, including co llection of 
blood sam ples, are described in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ) .
Standard laboratory  tests, including chemistry, hematology , coagulation,and urinalysis panels, 
will be performed.  A urine or serumpregnancy test (based on instituti onal standards) will be 
administered if applicable.  Other clinical laboratory tests will also be co llected.  Attachment 2
lists the specific tests that will be performed for this study .
8.1.1.Safety Data Collection and Review
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered into thi s 
study and for alerting Lillyor its designee to any  event that seem s unusual, even if this event 
may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient .
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of the patient during the study.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt h care option,
AEs that are serious , considered related to study treatment or the study,or that caused the patient 
to discont inue study treatment before complet ing the study . The patient should be fo llowed until 
the event is resolved, the event is no longer considered drug
related, the event becomes stable or 
returns to baseline, a new treatment is init iated for the patient, or the patient dies or is lost to 
follow-up.  Freque ncy of AEand SAEfollow-up evaluat ion is left to the discret ion of the 
investigator.
The timing of all safet y evaluations is shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1) .  
TableJSCC.4presents a summary  of AE and SAE reporting guidelines.   TableJSCC.4also 
shows which database or system is used to store AE and SAE data .
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 73
LY30228558.1.2.Adverse Events
Lillyhas standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requirements that m ay be less stringent.  A clinical study  AE is any untoward medical occurrence 
in a patient or clinical invest igation patientadministered a pharmaceut ical product and which 
does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship wi th this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore be any  
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal la boratory finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated with the use of m edicinal (invest igational) product, whether or not 
related to the medicinal (invest igational) product.   Any clinically  significant findings from labs, 
vital signs measurements, a nd so on that occur should also be reported to Lillyor its designee as 
an AE.  Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies because the purpose of the clinical 
study is to establish drug effect.
The invest igator, monitor, and sponsorwill review the collected data regularly for evidence of 
AEs.  All pat ients will be assessed routinely for AEs as outlined in the study  schedule.  All AEs 
observed will be graded using CTCAE v4.0.
The NCI-CTCAE v4.0 will serve as the reference document fo r choosing appropriate 
terminology for, and grading the severit y of, all AEs and other symptom s. All AEs observed 
will be graded using CTCAE v4.0.  Any minor version of CTCAE v4.0 (for example, versio n 
4.03) may be used for thi s study.  Minor CTCAE v4.0 u pdates from the NCI will not necessitate 
a protocol amendment. For AEs without matching termino logy within the NCI -CTCAE v4.0
criteria, the investigator will be responsible for selecting the appropriate sy stem organ class and 
assessing severit ygrade based on the intensit y of the event.   Note that both CTCAE term (actual 
or coded) and severit y grade must be selected by  study site personnel  and collected on the eCRF.  
This collection is in addit ion to verbat im text used to describe the AE.
In addition to collecting the AE verbat im, the CTCAE term, and the CTCAE severit y grade, AE 
verbatim text will also be mapped by the sponsoror designee to corresponding termino logy 
within the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA )dictionary.
For all enroll ed patients, study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each 
patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptoms of the 
disease under treatment in the study .  While the pati ent is on study , site personne l will record any  
change in these preexist ing condit ion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any  AEs.  In addit ion,
all AEs related to protocol  procedures are reported to Lillyor designee.
If a patient ’s treatment is discont inued as a result of an AE, study  site personnel  must clearly 
report to Lillyor its designeevia eCRF the ci rcumstances and data leading to discont inuation of 
treatment.
Investigators will be instructed to report to Lillyor its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure andstudy drugvia eCRF.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 74
LY3022855The invest igator decides whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as either related to 
disease, to the study  medication, study procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.  
To assess the relat ionship of the AE to the study  drug, the fo llowing termino logies are defined:
Related:  a direct cause and effe ct relationship between the study  treatment and 
the AE is likely.
Possibly related :  a cause and effect relat ionship between the study  treatment and 
the AE has not been demonstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not 
impossible.
Unrelated:  without questi on, the AE i s definitely not associ ated with the study  
treatment.
As per Lilly’s standard operating procedures ,all “related” and “possibly related” AEs and SAEs 
will be defined as related to study  drug.
8.1.2.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AEduring thi s study that resul ts inone of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion (except for study  drug 
administration)
a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant di sability/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason.
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be consid ered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they  
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse events due to disease progression, including d eath, shoul d not be reported unless 
the investigatordeems them to be possibly related to the study  drug.
Study site personnel  must alert Lillyor its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator 
awareness o f the event via a sponsor-approved method.   If alertsareissued via telephone , they
are to be immediately fo llowed with official notification on study -specific SAE forms.  This 24-
hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE 
information.
If an invest igator becom es aware of SAEs occurring after the patient’s participation in the trial 
has ended, and the invest igator believes that the SAE is related to a protocol procedure or study 
drug, the investigator should report the SAEs to the sponsorand the SAEs will be entered in the
Lilly Safety  System.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 75
LY3022855Information on SAEsexpected in the study  population independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  the sponsorin aggregate periodically during the course of the trial may be 
found in the IB.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
Planned hospi talizations or elective procedures for underlying preexisting condit ions that are 
already recorded in the patient’s m edical history  at the time of study enrollment shoul d not be 
considered SAEs.  Hospitalizat ion or prolongat ion of hospitalization wit hout a precipitat ing 
clinical AE(for example , for the administrati on of study treatmentor other protocol -required 
procedure)should not be considered SAEs.
8.1.2.2. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting
Data on SAEs that occur before the end of trial will be stored in the col lection database and the 
Lilly Safety System.
8.1.2.2.1. Prior to Administration of Study Drug(s)
During screening, all AEs and SAEs (regardless of relatedness to protocol procedures) are 
collected (by the site, in the source docum ent) after the patient has signed the ICF.  For pati ents 
who do not enroll in the trial (that is, have not received at leas t onedose of study drug[s]), only 
AEs and SAEs related to protocol procedures are required to be collected (captured on the eCRF, 
and, in the case of an SAE, on the SAE form) .
8.1.2.2.2. While onStudy Treatment
All AEs and SAEs, regardless of relatedness to study  drug(s), or protocol procedures, occurring 
while the patient is receiving study  drug must be collected (captured on the eCRF; in the case of 
an SAE, also on the SAE form) and reported to Lillyor its designee.  A patient is considered to 
be receiving study  drug (that is, “on study  treatment”) from the date of the first dose of study  
drug until the date the pati ent and investigator agree thatthe patient will no longer continue to 
receivestudy treatment.
8.1.2.2.3. During the 30 -Day and 90-Day Follow-Up Visits
All AEs and SAEs , regardless of relatedness to study  drug(s) or protocol procedures, occurring 
during the 30-Day and 90-Day Follow-Up visits(Visits 801and 802) must be collected (captured 
on the eCRF; in the case of an SAE, also on the SAE form) and reported to Lillyor its designee .  
The 30-Day Follow-Up visit (Visit 801)beginsthe day after the patient and investigator agree 
that the patient will no longer cont inue to receive study  treatment.  The durati on of thisfollow-up 
visit is 30 days (±7days).  Atthe end of the 30-Day Follow-Up visit, the pati ent will be required 
to have specific safet y assessments ( Attachment 1) .  If it is deemed to be in the best interest of 
the patient to start a new anticancer treatment prior to the scheduled end of the fo llow-up visit, 
the duration of the visit may be shortened. In this case, the fo llow-up assessments should be 
completed pri or to the init iation of the new therapy.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 76
LY3022855The 90-Day Follow-Up visit (Visit 802, only for durvalumab and tremelimumab safet y) occurs
90 days (±7 days) after the patient and invest igator agree t hat the patient will no longer continue 
to receive study  treatment.  Refer to Attachment 1 for specific safet y assessments to be 
conducted duringthe 90-Day Follow-Up visit.
Following the safet y assessments thatmark the end of the follow-up visits ( 30-Day Follow-Up 
visit[Visit 801], for LY3022855, durvalumab, and tremelimumab safet y, and 90-Day Follow-Up 
visit [Visit 802], only  for durvalumab and tr emelimumab safet y), the patient will be discont inued 
from the study, unless there is an ongo ing AE or SAE that is possibly related to study drug.  In 
this instance, the patient should continue to be followedby extending theduration of the follow-
up visit until the event is resolved, the event is no longer considered to be drug related, the event 
becomes stable or returns to baseline, a new treatment is init iated for the patient, or the patient 
dies or is lost to foll ow-up.
After the follow-up visits (30-Day Follow-Up visit [Visit 801], for LY3022855, durvalumab, and 
tremelimumab safety , and 90-Day Follow-Up visit [Visit 802], only for durvalumab and 
tremelimumab safety ),AEsare not required to be reported unless the invest igator feels the AEs 
were related to either study  drugor a protocol procedure. If an investigator becomes aware of an 
SAEbelieved to be related to protocol procedures or study  drug(at this point, the patient is no 
longer on the study ), theinvestigator should report the SAE to the sponsor, and the SAE will be 
entered in the Lilly Safety System.
Refer to TableJSCC.4for AE and SAE reporting guidelines during continued access and Section 
6.2.2for additional details on continued access, including the Continued Access Treatment 
Period (Visits 501-5XX) and Continued Access Follow -Up(Visits 901and 902).
8.1.2.3. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are SAEsthat are not listed in the
DCSIorin theIB and that the invest igator ident ifies as related to study drug or procedure.  The 
United States 21 CFR 312.32, the European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the 
associated detailed guidances or national regulatory  requirements in parti cipating countries 
require the reporting of SUSARs.  Lillyhas procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo bal regulatory  regulationsand the 
associated detailed guidances.
8.1.2.4. Summary of AE/SAE Reporting Guidelines
The AE and SAE reporting guidelines are summarized in TableJSCC.4; recommendations for 
reporting SAEs are presented in Attachment 4.

8.1.2.5. Pregnancy , including Maternal and Paternal Exposure
Although generally not an AE, cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal
exposures to study drugs and through 180 days after the decision is made to discontinue study  
treatmentshould be reported as SAEs, within 24 hours. Additionally, congenital
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as
SAEs. Elective terminat ions without complications shoul d not be handled as AEs.
Patients who becom e pregnant during the study  period must immediately  discontinue study
treatment but will not be discontinued ( withdrawn)from the study.
Data on fetal outcome, including spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormalit y occurring fro m the date of the first dose of 
study drug through 180 days after the decisio n is made to discontinue study treatment should be 
followed up and documented even if the pat ient was discontinued ( withdrawn)from the study.
Pregnancy itself, or pregnancy  of a patient’s partner, i s regarded as an AE only if an invest igator
considers that study  treatment may have interfered wi th the effect iveness of a contraceptive
medication.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 79
LY3022855The sponsor will endeavor to collect fo llow-up inform ation on such pregnancies ,provided the
partner of the study  patient providesconsent.
Male patients must refrain fro m sperm donation from screening through 180 days after the 
decision is made to discontinue study  treatment.
8.1.3.Overdose
An overdose is defined as an occurrence in which a patient receiv es a higher dose of study drug 
than the dose that patient was assigned, as specified in this protocol.
Any overdose of LY3022855, durvalumab, or tremelimumab , with or without associ ated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported immediately to the sponsor.If the overdose results in an 
AE, the AEmust also be recorded as an AE. Overdose does not automat ically make an AE
serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious (for example ,death or 
hospitalization),the event is serious and must be recorded and reported as an SAE.
There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose of LY3022855, durvalumab, 
and/or tremelimumab .
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.
8.1.4.Other Safety Measures
8.1.4.1. Electrocardiogram
For each patient, a local 12-lead digital ECG will be collected according to the Study  Schedule 
(Attachment 1).  Patientsmust be supine for approximately  5 to 10 minutes before ECG 
collection and remain supine but awake during ECG collect ion.
At Screening, a triplicateECG will be obtained , on which QTcF must be <470 m illiseconds
(calculated fro m one ECG using Fridericia’s Co rrection Formula and confirmed wit h 2 
additional ECGs).  Thereafter, single ECGs will be obtained.  In case of clinically significant 
ECG abnormalit ies, including a QTcF value >470 milliseconds , 2additional 12-lead ECGs 
should be obtained over a brief per iod (for example , 30 minutes) to confirm the finding.
Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times,when deemed clinically necessary .  
Collection of more ECGs (more replicates) than expected at a particular time point is allowed to 
ensure high -quality records.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician ( the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patientis still present, to determine whether the patientmeets entry  criteria at the rel evant visit(s) 
and for immediate patientmanagement, should any clinically relevant findings be identified.
If a clinically significant quantitative or qualitat ive change fro m baseline is identified after 
enrollment, the investigator will assess the patientfor symptom s (for example , palpitations, near 
syncope, syncope) to determine whether the patientcan continue in the study .  The invest igator 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 80
LY3022855or qualified designee is responsible for determ ining if any  change in patientmanagement i s 
needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluat ion.
8.1.4.2. Multigated Acquisition Scan or Echocardiogram
At Screening, a multigated acquisit ion (MUGA) scan or an echocardiogram will be performed 
for eachpatient as an eligibilit y assessment of LVEF (Section 6.1.2).  An LVEF evaluation will 
also be made at addit ional time points during the study , as clinically indicated.  Refer to the 
Study Schedule (Attachment 1 )for details about the timi ng of this assessment.
8.1.5.Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP /CRS will monitor safet y data throughout the course of the study . 
Representatives from Lilly Glo bal Patient Safety will specifically  monitor SAEs.  Lillywill 
review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by company standard operating procedures.
If a study  patient experiences elevated ALT ≥
5 ×ULN and elevated TB≥2 ×ULN, 
clinical and laboratory  monitoring shoul d be initiated by the invest igator.
For patients entering the study  with ALT ≥3 × ULN, monitoring should be triggered at 
ALT ≥2 ×baseline.
Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  
test abnorm alities.  To ensure patient safety  and comply  with regulatory  guidance, the 
investigator is to consult with the LillyCRP/CRS regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended
clinical informat ion and follow-up laboratory  tests (seeAttachment 3).
Refer to Attachment 8 for details about AESIs.
Refer to Attachment 7 for additional details on Toxicology management guidelines.
8.1.6.Complaint Handling
Lillycollects complaints on study  drugs used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of 
study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate process and product improvements.
Complaints related to concomitant drugs are reported directly to the manufacturers of those 
drugs in accordance with the package insert.
The invest igator or his/her designee is respon sible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the complaint reported and any associated 
AEsusing the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose
faxing the completed complaint form within 24 hours to Lillyor its designee.
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for invest igation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.

Attachment 1lists the schedule for sample collect ions in this study , including those for PK, 
pharmacodynamics, and immunoge nicity.
Attachment 2lists the clinical laboratory tests that wi ll be perform ed for this study .
8.2.1.Samples for Study Qualification and Health Monitorin g
Blood, tissue,and urinesampleswill be co llected to determine whether patients meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Standard laboratory  tests, including hematology  and urinalysis panels, will be performed and
analyzed by a local laboratory . Chemistry  panels will be performed and analyzed centrally.   
Enrollment decisions may be based upon chemistry  results performed at alocal laboratory ; 
however, a sample must be sent to the central laboratory . These central chemistry  laboratory  
results will be used for subsequent safet y analyses. In the event of minor discrepancies between 
local and central laboratory  results, the invest igator may use the local results for treatment 
decisions, and the central laboratory  results will remain part of the safet ydatabase. 
Discrepancies between local and central results that may have an impact on treatment decisions 
will not be considered protocol vio lations.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory  safety report.
Samples collected for specified laboratory  tests will  be destroy ed within 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tes ts run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory  certificati on standards.
8.2.2.Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements
(Pharmacokinetics )
At the visits and times specified in the Study Schedule(Attachment 1 ), venous blood samp les 
will be co llected to determine the serum concentratio ns of LY3022855, durvalumab ,and
tremelimumab (depending on treatment received) .  A maximum of 5samples may be drawnat 
additional time points during the study  if warranted and agreed upon between both the 
investigator and the sponsor . Instructions for the collect ion and handling of blood samples will 
be provided by  the sponsor.  The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sampling will 
be recorded.
These samples will be analyzed at a laboratory  designated by  the sponsor.  Serum concentrations 
of LY3022855 will be assayed using a validated enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
method.
The PKsamples will be stored at a facilit y designated by the sponsor.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 82
LY3022855The remaining plasma from the samples collected for PKmay be pooled and used for 
exploratory  metabolism work as deemed appropriate.
Bioanalytical samples collected to m easure invest igationalproduct concentration and 
metabolism and/or protein binding, will be retained for a maximum o f 2 years following last 
patient visit for the study .
8.2.3.Samples for Pharmacogenetics
There is growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribution, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease 
etiology,and/or the molecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where local 
regulations and ERBs allo w, a blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenet ic analysis.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observat ion of unusual response, the pharmacogenetic 
biomarker samples may  be genotyped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic 
association with response to study  drug(s). These investigations may be limited to a focused 
candidate gene study  or, if appropri ate, genom e-wide analysis may be performed to identify 
regions of the genome associated with the variability  observed in drug response. The 
pharmacogenet ic biomarker samples will be used only for investigations related to disease and 
drug or class o f drugs under study  in the context of this clinical program.  They  will notbe used 
for broad expl oratory unspecified disease or population genet ic analysis.
The samples will be coded with the patient number and stored at a facilit y selected by  the 
sponsor for up to a maximum of 15 years after the last patient visit for the study .  The sam ples 
and any data generated from  them can be linked back to the patient only by investigator site 
personnel.  The duration allows the sponsorto respond to regulatory requests related to the study  
drugs.
Samples will be destroyed according to a p rocess consistent with local regulat ion.
8.2.4.Samples for Pharmacodynamic and Tailoring Biomarker s
Collection of samples for other biomarker research is also part of this study .  Bloodand tissue
samples will be co llected.
Required samples for bi omarker research to be collected from all pat ients in this study  are the 
following:
blood sam ples (plasma, who le blood,and serum) (refer toSections 8.2.3and 8.2.4.1).
pretreatm ent and on-treatment(6-8 weeks after starting study treatment) tumor tissue 
(newly biopsied) (all cohorts of Part A and the ovarian cancer cohort only of Part B)
(refer to Sec tion 8.2.4.2).  If clinically feasible, the biopsies should be taken from the 
same lesion.
an archived tumor sample (following the most recent sy stemic treatm ent), if not restricted 
by local regulations(Part B NSCLC cohortonly).
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 83
LY3022855Optional samples for bi omarker research that should be collected from pat ients in the study  
where possible are the fo llowing:
on-treatment tumor tissue(Part B NSCLCcohortonly).
Samples may be stored at a facilit y selected by  the sponsor for up to amaximum of 15 y ears 
after thelast patient visit for the study.
Sample collect ion including blood (whole blood, serum ,and plasma) and tumor tissue will occur
at specified time po ints as indicated in Attachment 1.  These samples are also described in the 
following sect ions.
It is possible that bi omarker data for patients in the study  havealready been generated from 
samples that were collected and analyzed prior to enro lling in this trial. This may include data 
generated fro m genetic analyses. If available, these data may be requested fro m medical records 
for use in the research describe d in the fo llowing secti ons.
8.2.4.1. Blood Samples
Pharmacodynamic assessments are planned to be tested from baseline over time for changes in
biomarkers that may include , but not be limited to ,circulating levels of CSF-1, sPD-L1, IL-34, 
and monocytemarkers.
In addition, blood samples(EDTA plasma, whol e blood,and serum) will be co llected and may 
be used for research on the drug targets, disease process, immune funct ioning, pathways 
associated with cancer, m echanism sof action of LY3022855, durvalumab, andtremelimumab , 
and/or research methods or in validat ing diagnostic tools or assay(s) related to cancer.   The 
analyses o f these samples may include, but arenot limited to ,testing at baselineand changes
over time in immune cell subsets , cytokines, metabolites, and molecular markers to document the 
immunomodulatory activity of treatment in pat ients with LY3022855 in co mbination with 
durvalumab or tremelimumab. These bio markersmay becompared with observed clinical
outcomes to study  drug(s). Blood will be collected at times specified in Attachment 1 .
Samples may be stored at a facilit y selected by  the sponsor for up to a maximum of 15 y ears 
after the last patient visit for the study .
8.2.4.2. Tumor Tissue Samples
Tissue collect ion will be require d for biomarker research and enrol
lment into the study  for 
patients in Part A(all cohorts) and Part B. For patients enrolled in Part A (all cohorts) and 
PartB (ovarian cancer cohort only) of the study, tissue will be required for PD-L1 biomarker and 
other exploratory  analysis fro m a newly obtained core or excisio nal biopsy  of a tumor lesion 
(should be taken only  after study eligibility is confirmed) or from a recent biopsy defined by 
3yearssince last docum ented progressi on of disease. For the NSCLC cohort, archived t issue 
should be submi ttedform a recent bi opsy defined by  3 years old and this biopsy fo llows the 
most recent sy stemic therapy . If such an archived biopsy sample is not available, a new biopsy 
must be obtained for the patient to be eligi ble to parti cipate in study . For all cohorts, new 
archived tissue will be obtained only if not restricted by local regulat ions.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 84
LY3022855In addition, an on-treatment biopsy is required if any accessible lesio ns remain for Part A (all 
cohorts) and Part B (ovarian ca ncer cohort only).   If clinically feasible, the biopsies should be 
taken from the same lesion.  For patients enrolled to NSCLC cohort of Part B, the on-treatment
biopsy is optional .
Sites mustconfirm the availab ility of adequate tumor tissue forthe newbiopsy fro mthesite’s
pathologylaboratory or adequate archived tumor tissue .Pretreatment formalin -fixed paraffin -
embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue should be submitted in a who le block.
In addition to the biops ies and biomarker samples discussed in Sections 8.2.4.1and  8.2.4.2,
patients may be asked to undergo collection of an addit ional biopsy specimen and blood sample 
after treatm ent with study drug(s)has been initiated, including potentially after disease 
progression.  Such addit ional biopsies are optional and should be perform ed only if clinically 
feasible.If these addit ional samples are requested, they  will be used to further investigate 
biomarkersthat may explain treatm ent response and resistance mechanisms.
Details for the handling and shipping of the tumor tissue will be provide d by the sponsorin a 
separate document. The tissue samples will be obtained using appropriate method. Tumor tissue 
should be submi tted as a newly acquired excisio nal or core needle (minimum 18 gauge) biopsy 
in formalin. A minimum of 3-4core biopsies ,using an18-gauge core needle ,isrecommended
during each biopsy procedure . Cytological or fine-needle aspirat ion specimens anddecalcified 
boneare not acceptable. Due diligence should be used to ensure that tumor specimen (not 
normal adjacent or tum ormargins) is provided. Pathology  reports accompanying the tissue may 
also berequested.
Tissue samples will be examined for bio markers that may include, but are not limited to the drug 
targets, disease process, immune cells/immune functioning within the d isease state, and cancer -
related condi tions, pathways associated with cancer and study  drugs, mechanism sof action of 
LY3022855, durvalumab or tremelimumab ,and/or research methods or in validat ing diagnost ic 
tools or assays.
Tumor samples may also be analyzed to explore potential gene signature(s) associated with 
response or resistance to LY3022855 in combinat ion therapy .In addition, sequencing of 
deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA)and/or immunohistochemistry  may be perform ed on these tissue 
samples to eval uate expansi on in clonal T cell populat ions and changes in immune cell 
infiltration, activation, modulation, and microenvironment ,and changes in stromal and tumor 
biology in response to study  treatment.  The results of this analysis may be correlated with
clinical outcomedata.
The samples will be coded with the patient number and stored at a facilit y selected by  the 
sponsor for up to a maximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study .  The sam ples 
and any data generated from  them can be link ed back to the patient only by investigator site 
personnel.  The duration allows the sponsorto respond to regulatory requests related to the study  
drug.
Samples will be destroyed according to a process consistent with local regulation.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 85
LY30228558.2.5.Samples for Immunogenicity Research
Blood samples for immunogen icity testing will  be collected to determine ant ibody production 
against study drug(s) .  Immunogenicit y will be assessed by  a validated assay  designed to detect 
antidrug antibodies (ADAs)in the presence o f study drug(s) .  Antibodies may be further 
characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit y to neutralize the activit y of study drug(s).
Samples may be stored at a facilit y selected by  the sponsor for up to a maximum of 15 years 
following last patient visit for the study,to enable further analysis o f immune responses to study 
drug(s).  The duration allows the sponsorto respond to regulatory requests related to study 
drug(s).
8.3.Efficacy Evaluations
A secondary  objective of the study  is to docum ent any antitumor activit y.  Refer to Attachment 1
for details regarding the timing of specific efficacy measures.
Each patient will be assessed by  one or m ore of the fo llowing radi ographictests for tum or 
measurement:
Computed tom ography (CT) scan
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) .
Each patient’s full extent of disease will also be assessed with:
Tumor measurement by  RECIST 1.1 (Ei senhauer et al. 2009)
Evaluation of tumor markers, if indicated
Evaluation of performance status (refer to the ECOG scale, Attachment 5 )
.
In rare circumstances, historical radio graphicexaminationsfor RECIST cri teria that are 
performedmorethan 28 days pri or to the first dose may  be used, but thi s decision must be 
discussed wi th the sponsorand documented in writ ing.
To confirm object ive responses, all lesio ns should be radio graphically assessed, and the same 
radiographicmethod used for the init ial response determinat ion should be repeated at least 8
weeksfollowing the init ial observation of an objective response, using the sample method that 
was used at baseline.  Ifa patient is discontinued from the study , repeat radi ographicassessments 
may be omitted if clear clinical signs of progressive disease (symptom atic deterioration) are 
present.  At the conclusio n of the study ,radiographicimages may be requested for central 
review.

LY302285510.Data Analyses
10.1.General Considerations
Upto approximately 118patients (78[Part A] + 40 [PartB])may be enrolled in this mult icenter, 
nonrando mized, open -label Phase 1 a/1bstudy of LY3022855.
The sample size for Part A will be determined primarily by the incidence of DLTs prior to 
establishing the MTDs in Part A. The anticipated sample size for Part A ranges fro m 
approximately  12to 36patientsin thecombination of LY3022855 plus durvalumab ,and 
approximately  12 to 42patients in the co mbination of LY 3022855 plus tremelimumab . 
Nonevaluable patients, as defined in Section 7.6.1, will be replaced to ensure enough patients are 
enrolled in Part A.
In each cohort of Part B, approximately  20 patients will be enrolled. The sample size of Part B 
has been selected to allow adequate assessment of safety and tolerabilit y of LY3022855 in 
combination with durvalumab at the recommended dose level and can provide adequate 
precision for the estimated incidence rate of the fo llowing quanti ties of interest: (1)patients 
having a spe cified AE,or (2) patients showing a response (PR/CR) to treatment. Example po int 
estimates of incidence rates and corresponding 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) are 
summarized in TableJSCC.5.  The values are provided as a reference for estimat ion,rather than 
a basis of any decisio n criteria. The RP2D may be revised based on the safet y data obtained in 
Part B (Iasonos and O’Quigley 2013).

LY3022855Safety and efficacy  analyses will be conducted on all patients who have received at least one 
dose of the study  treatment(s), re gardless of whether they are deemed evaluable for the 
assessment of a dose level.   Statistical analysis of this study  will be the responsibilit y of Eli Lilly 
and Company.
The interpretation of the study  results will be the responsibilit y of the invest igator with the 
sponsor’s CRP/CRS,PK scient ist and statist ician.  The sponsor’s CRP/CRSand statistician will 
also be responsible for the appropriate conduct of an internal re view for both the final study  
report and any  study-related material to be authorized by  Lillyfor publicat ion.The analyses for 
this study will be descript ive; no pvalues will be calculated. Data analyses will be provided by 
cohort and treatment ,whenever appropri ate. For continuous variables, summary statist ics will 
include number of patients, mean, median, standard deviat ion, minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical endpo ints will be summarized using number of patie ntsandpercentages .Missing 
data will no t be imputed.
Exploratory analyses of the data not described in Sections 10.2through 10.9will be conducted as 
deemed appropri ate.
A detailed description o f data analyses will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan 
document for this study .
10.2.Patient Disposition
All patient discontinuations will be documented, and the extent of each pat ient’s participat ion in 
the study will be reported.  If known, a reason for their discont inuation will be given.
10.3.Patient Characteristics
Patient characterist ics will include a summary and listing of the fo llowing:
patient demographics
baseline disease characteristics
prior disease-related therapies
concomitant medicat ions.
Other patient characterist ics will be summarized as deemed appropriate.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 91
LY302285510.4.Safety Analyses
All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug(s)will be evaluated for safet y and 
toxicity.  Adverse event term s and severit y grades will be assigned by  the invest igator using 
CTCAE, v4.0.
Safety analyses will include summaries of the fo llowing:
AEs, including severit y and possible rel ationship to study  drug
dose adjustments
laboratory  values
vital signs
DLTs at each dose level
ECG readings
LVEF evaluat ion.
10.4.1.Immunogenicity Analyses
Immunogenicity data will be summarized , and correl ation to drug le vel (each drug), activit y,and 
safety will be assessed, as appropriate, respectively .  The measures that will be analyzed include 
baseline presence and level o f ADA, treatment -emergent ADA, levels of neutralizing ADA, and 
incidence and levels of ADA relate d to IRRs.
10.5.Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Pharmacokinet ic analyses will be conducted on patients who have received at least one dose of 
the study drug and have had samples collected.  Pharmacokinet ic parameter estimates for 
LY3022855 , durvalumab,and tremelimumab will be calculated by standard nonco mpartmental 
methods of analysis. The primary parameters for analysis will be maximum concentration (C max) 
and area under the plasma concentrati on-time curve ( AUC; AUC from t ime zero to last 
measurable plasma concentration [ AUC0-tlast] and AUC from  time zero to infinit y [AUC0-∞]) of 
each of the study drugs.  Other noncom partmental parameters, such as time of half -life (t1/2), 
apparent cl earance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distribut ion (V/F) for each study drug may be 
reported.  Addit ional exploratory analyses will be performed if warranted by  data and other 
validated PKsoftware programs (for example, NONMEM) may  be used if appropriate and 
approved by  Global Pharmacokinetic management.  The versio n of any software used for the 
analysis will be documented and the program will meet the Lilly requirements of so ftware 
validation.
Pharmacokinet ic parameter estimates will be evaluated to delineate the effects of dose 
proportionality, target-mediated drug disp osition, and drug accumulat ion.Log-transformed C max
and AUC est imates will be assessed to estimate ratios of geo metric means and the corresponding 
90% CIs. The potential effect of durvalumab -mediated PD-L1 inhibit ion and/or tremelimumab -
mediated CTLA-4inhibition on the exposure of LY3022855, and the effect of LY3022855 -
mediated CSF-1Rinhibition on the exposure of tremelimumab and/or durvalumab will be 
assessed using historical mo notherapy  exposure data for each of the 3 studydrugs.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 92
LY302285510.6.Pharmacodynamic An alyses
Characterized profiles of available longitudinal bio markers for estimable patients will be created 
and analyzed. Pattern recognit ion analysis may be applied forthe pharmacodynamic bio markers 
that indicate the evidence o f drug engagement. Those include,but are not limited to, circulating 
levels of CSF-1, IL-34, and monocyte markers.
10.7.Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Pharmacokinet ic/pharmacodynamic analyses for LY3022855 may  be conducted as deemed 
necessary  by Global PK/PD m anagement. These analyses may  include, but are not limited to, 
establishing relat ionships (or lack of) between exposure and pharmacodynamic bio markers that 
were explored or confirmed in pharmacodynamic analyses ( refer to Secti on 10.6) .
10.8.Efficacy
Tumorresponse data , according to RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) ,will be tabulated by 
cohorts. Particularly, the antitumor effect will be summarized by best overal l response,
including the overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR ; CR+PR+SD ). A 
patient is considered to have a tumor response if they  achieve a confirmed CR or PR .The ORR 
is estimated by the proportion of enrolled pat ients who have a best overall response o fconfirmed 
CR orPR.The DCR is est imated by the proportion of enrolled pat ients who have a best overall 
response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable di sease. A 95% exact CI will be constructed 
to determine the level o f precision of the ORRand DCR.  Time-to-event variables such as 
progression -free survival (PFS), time to response, duration of response,and overall survival (OS) 
will be tabulated if appropriate .  The Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958) will be 
used to estimate the survival curves, medians, and survival rates at specified t ime points ,if 
applicable.
Uponcompletionof each Part B cohort, an analysis of safety , PK, pharmacodynamics , 
biomarkers, and efficacy may occur,once all pat ients have completed 4 cy cles of study  therapy 
or discontinued from the study .
Any cohort-specificanalyses may  be combined if they are expected to occur within 
approximately  a month, and theanalyses may also be co mbined with the ongoing trial -level 
safety review or annual safet y review for annual safet y update reporting.
10.9.Tailoring Biomarker Analyses
If applicable, e fficacy measures may be summarized descript ively within subgroups of patients . 
Exploratory analyses m ay be applied to correlate the baseline bio markers with clinical outcome. 
If applicable, a subset of potential predict ive biomarkers associat ing with interpretable clinical 
benefit may be further examined wit h biological evidence.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase1 Oncology Protocol Page 93
LY302285510.10. Interim Analyses
Because this is a dose -finding study , data will be reviewed on a cohort -by-cohort basis during the 
study, until the MTD saredetermined for each combinat ion.  The purpose of these cohort -by-
cohort reviews is to evaluate the safet y data ateach dose level and determine if a DLT has been 
observed that would suggest MTD has been met or exceeded.  The investigators and the Lilly
study teamwill make the determinat ion regarding dose escalat ion based upon their review o f the 
safety and tolerabilit y data as described in this protocol.
Safety and/or PKdata will be reviewed during the study  if needed for dose escalat ion,
modifications to the dose -escalation strategy ,or other design elements.
In Part A, a fter all patients who are deemed evaluable for the assessment of dose levels complete 
the DLT-evaluation period or the MTD is determined, an interim safet y and PKanalysis may be 
conducted for each combinat ion for planningnext studi es.
If it is deemed tha t enough data areobtained to assess the primary  and secondary  objectives, a 
clinical study  report maybe writtenbefore the last patient visit for the study .  In this case, all 
data until the data cutoff date will be used for the analysis o f safety, efficacy, PK,and 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers.  After the data cutoff date , all data defined in the protocol will 
continue to be collected fro m patients on treatm ent, to be listed and summarized in an updated 
clinical study  report.  However, summary tables containing the data collected after the data
cutoff date will not be created ; these data may be reported separately and the analyses on all 
patients,including these data ,may not necessarily be perform ed.

The equation was reported to perform better and wit h less bias than the MDRD Study  equation,

Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -Mediated, Infusion -Related, and 
NonImmune-Mediated Reactions (Combination Therapy with LY3022855 and Durvalumab or LY3022855 and Tremelimumab) 
General Considerations
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be made to 
manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity of treatment -emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for the following conditions:
Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalen t) within 12 weeks after last dose of study drug/study 
regimen
Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE 
following resumption of dosing
Grade1No dose modification
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to 
Grade ≤1.
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4.
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper.
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions:
1.The event stabilizes and is controlled.
2.The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement.
3.Doses of prednisone a re at ≤10mg/day or equivalent.
Grade 3 Depending on the individual toxicity, study drug/study regimen It is recommended that management of immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) follows 
the guidelines presented in this table:
−It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism 
could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not noted specifically in these 
guidelines.
−Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or laboratory indicators of such 
events) are noted in these guidelines or not, patients should be thoroughly 
evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology ( e.g.,disease progression, 
concomitant medications, an d infections )to a possible immune -mediated event. In 
the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such events should be managed as if 
they wereimmune related. General recommendations follow.
−Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low-grade (Grade 1 or 
2, unless otherwise specified) events.
−For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) events, 
promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.
−Some events with high likelihood for morbidi ty and/or mortality –e.g., 
myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the 
guidelines –should implement high-dose IV corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 
at 2 to 4mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if clinical suspicio n is high 
and/or there has been clinical confirmation. Consider, as necessary, discussing 
with the study physician, and promptly pursue specialist consultation.
−If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of taper), 
increase the co rticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [ eg,up to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day PO or 
IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume 
corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28 days of taper).
−More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibi tors (eg,infliximab) (also 
refer to the individual sections of the imAEsfor specific type of 
immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to systemic 
steroids. Progression to use of more potent immunosuppressives should proceed 
morerapidly in events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality –e.g., 
myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the

may be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines 
below.
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen.
Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptoma tic amylase or lipase levels, hold study drug/study 
regimen, and if complete work up shows no evidence of pancreatitis, study 
drug/study regimen may be continued or resumed.
Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinued in Grade 3 
events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality –e.g., myocarditis, or 
other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines. 
Similarly, consider whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or 
mortality –e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently 
noted in the guidelines –when they do not rapidly improve to Grade <1 upon 
treatment with systemic steroids and following full taper .
Note:There are some exceptions to permanent discontinuation of study drug for 
Grade 4 events (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus).guidelines –when these events are not responding to systemic steroids.
−With long -term steroid a nd other immunosuppressive use, consider need for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.
−Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for Grade 3/Grade 4 
inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor response ( eg,inflammatory 
reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph nodes). Continuation of study 
drug/study regimen in this situation should be based upon a benefit /risk analysis 
for that patient.

version4.03)Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Pneumonitis/Interstitial 
Lung Disease (ILD )Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade :
−Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or ILD 
(new onset or worsening shortness of breath or cough). Patients 
should be evaluated with imaging and pulmonary function tests, 
including other diagnostic procedures as described below.
−Initial work -up may includ e clinical evaluation, monitoring of 
oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), 
laboratory work -up, and high -resolution CT scan.
Grade 1
(asymptomatic, clinical 
or diagnostic 
observations only; 
intervention not 
indicated)No dose modificatio ns required. 
However, consider holding study 
drug/study regimen dose as clinically 
appropriate and during diagnostic work -
up for other etiologies.For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only):
−Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and laboratory 
work-up and then as clinically indicated.
−Consider Pulmonary and Infectious disease consult.
Grade 2
(symptomatic; medical 
intervention indicated; 
limiting instrumental 
ADL)Hold study drug/study regi men dose 
until Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.
If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.
If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate study 
drug/study regimen will be based 
upon treating physician’s clinical 
judgment and a fter completion of 
steroid taper.For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):
−Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospitalization.
−Promptly start systemic steroids ( eg,prednisone 1 to 
2mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent).
−Reimage as clinically indicated.
−If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup should 
be considered and prompt treatment with IV methylprednisolone 
2 to 4mg/kg/day started
−If still no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
methylprednisoloneat 2 to 4mg/kg/day, promptly start 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(eg,infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label for 
general guidance before using infliximab.
−Once the patient is improving, gradually tap er steroids over ≥28 
days and consider prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, or anti -
PJP treatment (refer to current NCCN guidelines for treatment of 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 138
LY3022855cancer-related infections [Category 2B recommendation])a
−Consider pulmonary and infectious disease consul t.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with study physician.
Grade 3 or 4
(Grade 3: severe 
symptoms; limiting 
self-care ADL; oxygen 
indicated)
(Grade 4: life -
threatening respiratory 
compromise; urgent 
intervention indicated 
[eg,tracheostomy or 
intubation])Permanently discontinue study 
drug/study regimen.For Grade 3 or 4 (severe or new symptoms, new/worsening hypoxia, 
life-threatening):
−Promptly initiate empiric IV methylprednisolone 1 to 
4mg/kg/day or equivalent.
−Obtain Pulmo nary and Infectious disease consult; consider, as 
necessary, discussing with study physician.
−Hospitalize the patient.
−Supportive care ( eg,oxygen).
−If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup should 
be considered and prompt treatment with addi tional 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(eg,infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks’ dose) started. Caution: 
rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label for general guidance 
before using infliximab.
−Once the patientis improving, gradually t aper steroids over ≥28 
days and consider prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, and, in 
particular, anti -PJP treatment (refer to current NCCN guidelines 
for treatment of cancer -related infections [Category 2B 
recommendation]).a
Diarrhea/Colitis Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Monitor for symptoms that may be related to 
diarrhea/enterocolitis (abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in 
bowel habits such as increased frequency over baseline or blood 
in stool) or related to bowel perforation (such as sepsis, 
peritoneal signs, and ileus).
−Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology ( eg,disease progression, other medications, 
or infections), including testing for clostridium difficile toxin, 
etc.
−Steroids should be consi dered in the absence of clear alternative 
etiology, even for low -grade events, in order to prevent potential 
progression to higher grade event.
−Use analgesics carefully; they can mask symptoms of 
perforation and peritonitis.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 139
LY3022855Grade 1
(Diarrhea: stool 
frequency of <4 over 
baseline per day)
(Colitis:
asymptomatic; clinical 
or diagnostic 
observations only)No dose modifications. For Grade 1:
−Monitor closely for worsening symptoms.
−Consider symptomatic treatment, including hydration, 
electrolyte replacement, dietary changes ( eg,American Dietetic 
Association colitis diet), and loperamide. Use probiotics as per 
treating physician’s clinical judgment.
Grade 2
(Diarrhea: stool 
frequency of 4 to 6 
over baseline per day) 
(Colitis: abdominal 
pain; mucus or bloo d
in stool)Hold study drug/study regimen until 
resolution to Grade ≤1
If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.
If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then study drug/study regimen can 
be resumed after completion of 
steroid taper.For Grade 2:
−Consider symptomatic treatment, including hydration, 
electrolyte replacement, dietary changes (eg, American Dietetic 
Association colitis diet), and loperamide and/or budesonide.
−Promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.
−If event is no t responsive within 3 to 5 days or worsens despite 
prednisone at 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent, GI consult 
should be obtained for consideration of further workup, such as 
imaging and/or colonoscopy, to confirm colitis and rule out 
perforation, and p rompt treatment with IV methylprednisolone 2

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes
(such as Guillain -Barre and Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients may 
unpredictably experience acute decompensations that can result 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 149
LY3022855myasthenia gravis)in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care 
should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a 
more sever e outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly 
progressive weakness, and signs of respiratory insufficiency or 
autonomic instability.
−Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology 
(eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndrom es or 
medications). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune -
mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly 
challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the 
multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its 
treatments ) throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of 
prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low 
threshold to obtain a neurological consult.
−Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (eg, electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “re petitive stimulation” if 
myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon suspicion 
of such conditions and may be best facilitated by means of a 
neurology consultation.
−It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary 
treatment of G uillain-Barre is not typically considered effective. 
Patients requiring treatment should be started with IV IG and 
followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive to IV IG.
Grade 1 No dose modifications. For Grade 1:
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Care should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel symptoms 
of a potential decompensation as described above.
−Obtain a neurology consult.
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose 
until resolution to Grade ≤1.
Permanently discontinue study 
drug/study regimen if it does not resolve 
to Grade ≤1 within 30 days or if there 
are signs of respiratory insufficiency or 
autonomic instability.For Grade 2:
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Care should be tak en to monitor patients for sentinel symptoms 
of a potential decompensation as described above.
−Obtain a neurology consult
−Sensory neuropathy/neuropathic pain may be managed by 
appropriate medications ( eg, gabapentin or duloxetine).
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS:
oSteroids may be successfully used to treat myasthenia 
gravis. It is important to consider that steroid therapy 
(especially with high doses) may result in transient 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 150
LY3022855worsening of myasthenia and should typically be 
administered in a monitored setting under su pervision 
of a consulting neurologist.
oPatients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates 
for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV IG. Such 
decisions are best made in consultation with a 
neurologist, taking into account the unique needs of 
each patient.
oIf myasthenia gravis -like neurotoxicity is present, 
consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition to 
steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also serve to 
reinforce the diagnosis.
GUILLAIN -BARRE:
oIt is important to consider here that the use of steroids 
as the primary treatment of Guillain -Barre is not 
typically considered effective.
oPatients requiring treatment should be started with IV

Myocarditis Any Grade General Guidance
Discontinue drug permanently if biopsy -
proven immune -mediated myocarditis.For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated myocarditis is 
important, particularly in patients with baseline cardiopulmonary 
disease and reduced cardiac function.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myocarditis (new 
onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, 
peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung 
toxicities, simulta neously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary 
toxicity as well as other causes (eg , pulmonary embolism, 
congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial effusion). A 
Cardiology consultation should be obtained early, with prompt 
assessment of whether and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, 
including any other diagnostic procedures.
−Initial workup should include clinical evaluation, BNP, cardiac 
enzymes, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), monitoring of 
oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
additional laboratory workup as indicated. Spiral CT or cardiac 
MRI can complement ECHO to assess wall motion

Myositis/Polymyositis 
(“Poly/myositis”)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of poly/myositis. 
Typically, muscle weakness/pain occurs in proximal muscles 
including upper arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck and back, but 
rarely affects the extremities including hands and finger s; also 
difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing can occur and 
progress rapidly. Increased general feelings of tiredness and 
fatigue may occur, and there can be new -onset falling, difficulty 
getting up from a fall, and trouble climbing stairs, stand ing up 
from a seated position, and/or reaching up.
−If poly/myositis is suspected, a Neurology consultation should 
be obtained early, with prompt guidance on diagnostic 
procedures. Myocarditis may co -occur with poly/myositis; refer 
to guidance under Myocarditis. Given breathing complications, 
refer to guidance under Pneumonitis/ILD. 
Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) 
autoimmune disorder, consider Rheumatology consultation.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Initial workup should include clinical evaluation, creatine

sedimentation rate or C -reactive protein level , urine myoglobin, 
and additional laboratory workup as indicated, including a 
number of possible r heumatological/antibody tests (i.e., consider 
whether a rheumatologist consultation is indicated and could 
guide need for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti -
smooth muscle , antisynthetase [such as anti -Jo-1], and/or signal -
recognition particle antibodies). Confirmatory testing may 
include electromyography, nerve conduction studies, MRI of the 
muscles, and/or a muscle biopsy. Consider barium swallow for 
evaluation of dysphagia or dysphonia .
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule ou t any alternative etiology 
(eg, disease progression, other medications, or infections).

LY3022855Attachment 8. Protocol JSCC Durvalumab and 
Tremelimumab AESIs
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scient ific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the investigational product and may  require close monitoring and rapi d 
communicat ion by the invest igator to the sponsor. An AESI may be seri ous or nonseri ous.The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance o f these events in order to characterize and 
understand them in associat ion with the use of this investigat ional product.
AESIs for durvalumab and tremelimumab include but are not limited to events with a potential 
inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism  and which m ay require more frequent m onitoring 
and/or intervent ions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy . 
These AESIs are being clo sely monitored in clinical studies wit h durvalumab monotherapy  and 
combination therapy. An immune-related adverse event (irAE) is defined as an adverse event 
(AE) that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism o f action andwhere there i s no clear alternate eti ology. Serologic, immuno logic, and 
histologic (biopsy) data, as appropri ate, shoul d be used to support an irAE diagnosis. 
Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infect ious, metabolic, toxin, or ot her 
etiologic causes of the irAE. 
If the investigator has any quest ions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the investigator should 
promptly contact the study physician.
AESIs observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab include:
•Diarrhea / Colitis
•Pneumonitis/ ILD (interstit ial lung disease)
•ALT/AST increases / hepat itis / hepatotoxicit y
•Neuropathy  / neurom uscular toxicit y (i.e. events of encephalit is, peripheral motor and 
sensory neuropathi es, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis)
•Endocrinopathy  (i.e. events of hypophysit is, hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, 
diabetes insipidus, ty pe I diabetes m ellitusand hyper -and hypothy roidism)
•Rash / Dermatitis
•Nephritis/ Blood creatinine increases
•Pancreatitis (or labs suggestive of pancreatit is -increased serum lipase, increased serum 
amylase)
•Other inflammatory  responses that are rare with a po tential immune-mediated etiology 
include, but are not limited to, myocardit is, pericardit is, myositis/polymyositis,and 
uveitis.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 159
LY3022855Further informat ion on these risks (eg ,presenting symptoms) can be found in the current version 
of the durvalumab and tremelimumab IBs.   For durvalumab and tremelimumab, AESIs will 
comprise the following:
Pneumonitis
AEs of pneu monitis are also of interest, as pneumonit is has been observed with use of ant i-PD-1 
mAbs (but not with ant i-PD-L1 mAbs).  Init ial work-up should include a high -resolution CT 
scan, ruling out infect ion, and pulse oximetry .  Pulmonary consultation is highlyrecommended.
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated events including pneumo nitis 
are outlined in Sect ion 7.2.4.
Infusion r eactions
AEs of infusio n reactions (also known as infusio n
-related reacti ons [IRRs] ) are of special interest 
and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring fro m the start of 
investigat ional product infusion up to 48 hours after the infusion start time.  For all infusio n 
reactions, if they qualify as SAEs,they should be reported as SAEs as described in Section 
8.1.2.1.
Hypersensitivity r eactions
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as IRRshave been reported with ant i-PD-L1 and ant i-PD-1 
therapy (Brahmer et al. 2012 ).  As with the administration of any forei gn protein and/or other 
biologic agents, reactions fo llowing the infusio n of mAbs can be caused by various mechanisms, 
including acute anaphylact ic (IgE-mediated) and anaphylactoid react ions against the mAbs and 
serum sickness.  Acute allergic reactions ma y occur, m ay be severe, and m ay result in death.  
Acute allergic reactions may include hypotensio n, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi ratory failure, 
urticaria, pruri tus, angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, 
fatigue, headache, h ypertensio n, myalgia, vo miting, and unresponsiveness.
Guidelines for m anagement of patients with hypersensit ivity (including anaphylactic reaction) 
and IRRsare outlined in Section 7.2.4.
Hepatic function abnormalities (hepatotoxicity)
Hepatic function abnormalit y is defined as any  increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 ×ULN 
and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent findings are 
those that derive fro m a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of 
each other.  Follow -up investi gations and inqui ries will be init iated prompt ly by the 
investigat ional site to determine whether the findi ngs are reproducible and/or whether there is 
objective evidence that clearly supports causation by a disease ( for example , cholelithiasis and 
bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational 
product.
Guidelines for management of patients with hepatic function abnormalit y are outlined in Section 
7.2.4.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 160
LY3022855Gastrointestinal disorders
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commonly observed treatment -emergent SAE when tremelimumab is 
used as monotherapy .  In rare cases, col on perforatio n may occur that requires surgery  
(colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly  managed.
Guidelines on management of diarrhea and colit is in patients receiving study treatmentare 
provided in Section 7.2.4.
Endocrine disorders
Immune
-mediated endocrinopathies include hypophysit is, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper -and 
hypothyroidism.  Guidelines for the management of pat ients with immune-mediated endocrine 
events are provided in Section 7.2.4.
Pancreatic disorders
Immune
-mediated pancreat itis includes autoimmune pancreat itis, and lipase and amylase 
elevation.  Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated pancreatic 
disorders are provi ded in Section 7.2.4.
Neurotoxicity
Immune
-mediated nervous system events include encephalit is, peripheral motor and s ensory 
neuropathi es, Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis.  Guidelines for the management of patients 
with immune-mediated neurotoxic events are provided in Section 7.2.4.
Nephritis
Consult with Nephrologist.  Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be related to changes in 
renal funct ion (eg,routine urinalysis, elevated serum blood urea nitrogen [ BUN]and creatinine, 
decreased creat inine clearance , electrolyte imbalance, decrease in urine output, proteinuria, etc) .
Patients shoul d be thoroughly  evaluated to rul e out any alternative eti ol
ogy (eg, disease 
progression, infect ions,etc).
Steroids should be consi dered in the absence of clear alternat iveetiology even for l ow grade 
events (Grade 2), in order to prevent potential pro gression to higher grade event.
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated neurotoxic events are 
provided in Section 7.2.4.

LY3022855Immune-related adverse events
Based on the mechanism o f action of durvalumab and tremelimumab leading to Tcellactivation 
and proliferat ion, there is a possibilit y of observing i rAEs during the conduct of this study .  
Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen wit h the use of ipilimumab, BMS -936558 (ant i-PD-
1 mAb), and BMS -936559 (anti -PD-L1 mAb) and may include immune -mediated enterocolit is, 
dermatitis, hepatitis (hepatotoxicit y), pneumonitis, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi et al. 2010, 
Brahmer et al. 2012, Topalian et al. 2012 ).  These AEs are inflammatory  in nature and can affect 
any organ.  With anti -PD-L1 and anti -CTLA-4 combinat ion therapy, the occurrence of 
overlapping or increasing cumulat ive toxicit ies that include irAEs could potentially  occur at 
higher frequencies than wit h either durvalumab or tremelimumab mo notherapy .  Patients shoul d 
be monitored for si gns and symptom s of irAEs.  Inthe absence of an alternate etio logy (for 
example, infection or PD), an immune -related etiology should be considered for signs or 
symptoms of enterocolit is, dermatitis, pneumo nitis, hepatit is, and endocrinopathy.  In addit ion to 
the dose modification guidelines provided in Section 7.2.4, it is recommended that irAEs are 
managed according to the general treatment guidelines outlined for ipilimumab (We ber et al. 
2012).  These guidelines reco mmend the fo llowing:
•Patients shoul d be evaluated to i dentify any alternative etio logy.
•In the absence of a clear alternat ive etiology, all events of an inflammatory  nature shoul d 
be considered immune related.
•Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low -grade events.
•Systemic corti costeroids should be considered for a persistent low -grade event or for a 
severe event.
•More potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroi ds (for example , infliximab or mycopheno late).
If the investigator has any quest ions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the investigator should 
immediately  contact the study physician.
Myocarditis
A variety of clinical presentations, diagnost ic evidence (laboratory , imaging, histopathology ), 
and result ing diagnoses have been described in cases of my ocarditis in the literature for other 
immune checkpo int inhibitors, including heart failure, brady -and tachyarrhyt hmias, and acute 
coronary syndrome-like presentations wit hout evidence of ischemia.  Investigators should be 
aware of such rare, but severe immune -mediated adverse events including myo carditis with its 
presenting signs/symptoms (eg, decreased eject ion fraction, arrhythmias, in parti cular 
occurrences of atrioventricular block).
Investigators should adhere to the Toxicit y Managem ent Guidelines by  performing a thorough 
evaluation to rule out alternative eti ologies and init iating prompt treatment with steroids and 
modification of study drug/dose regimen depending on the severit y of the event.
Guidelines for the management of patients with myocarditisare provided in Attachment 7.

Updated informat ion about tumor biopsy samples to make it consistent across sections .
Updated treatment delay criteria to provide consistency across the protocol.
6.1.1Inclusion Criteria
Patients may be included in the study  if they meet all of the following criteria during screening 
prior to first dose of study  drug.
(Note:  If a specificcohort is not i ndicatedfor a criterion,the criterion applies to all pat ients.)
[1]Must have histological or cy tological evidence of a diagnosis o f cancer that is
not amenable to curative therapy .
[2]Part B (all cohorts):  Must have a ty pe of malignancy  that is being studi ed, as 
listed in the fo llowing:
[a]LY3022855 and durvalumab (MEDI4736) combination cohorts
[i] NSCLC that has relapsed or is refractory  (definitions below) to 
immune checkpo int inhibitor therapy  and has progressed through no 
more than 3 lines of therapy  (one line m ust have been a platinum -
containing regimen).
Relapsed:  Fo llowing initial clinical benefit (that is, complete 
response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD] on 
any scan), patients must have documented radiographic disease 
progression while receiving therapy  with an immune 
checkpoint inhibitor.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 167
LY3022855Refractory :  Patients must have docum ented radi ographic 
disease progressi on ≤16 weeks after the start of treatment with 
an immunecheckpoint inhibitor , with no evidence of clinical 
benefit (that is, CR, PR, or SD on any scan) while receiving 
therapy.
a.Patients must not have a known activat ing mutation of the EGFR
or ALKgene.  If a site uses algorithmic testing that has eliminated 
the possibilit y of EGFR or ALK gene mutations, no specific 
testing for mutations in these genes is required.
b.Patients could have received only  one prior immune checkpo int 
therapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4, or a single regimen 
combining anti -PD-1/PD-L1 with an anti-CTLA-4).
[ii] Ovarian cancer (epi thelial ovarian cancer, fallopi an tube cancer, or 
primary peritoneal cancer) that has been treated with no more than 
3lines of therapy (with or withou t platinum).
[3]Part A (all cohorts) and Part B (ovarian cancer cohort only):  Must be willing 
to undergo pretreatment and on -treatment core needl e or excisional tumor 
biopsies. For patient in NSCLC Part B cohort, if newly obtained samples 
cannot be obta ined such as in cases of inaccessibility  or patient safety  
concern, an archived tumor sample will be requested if not restricted by  local 
regulations.  The archived tumor sample must fo llow most recent systemic 
treatment.  If no archived specimen since the most recent systemic treatment 
is available, and a new biopsy  is not medically  feasible, the patient should not 
be enrolled in the clinical trial. (Note:  An archived tumor sample will be 
requested, if not restricted by  local regul ations, for each pat ient in NSCLC 
Part B cohort).
7.2.1.1. LY3022855
Eligiblepatients will receive LY3022855 as an I.V. infusio n administered over a minimum 
duration of 30 minutes and a maximum durat ion of 4 hours, based on the known safety  and 
stability of the prepared drug. The infusion rate should not exceed 25 mg/minute. Suggested 
infusion times are as fo llows:
90 minutes for the first infusio n; if noinfusion-related reacti on(IRR)is observed, 
decrease the infusio n time to 60 minutes for the second infusio n
60 minutes for the second infusio n; if no IRR is observed, decrease the infusion t ime to 
30 minutes for the third infusion
30 minutes for the third and subsequent infusio ns
If, at any time, a pati ent experiences an IRR, the infusio n time should not be decreased.  
Premedication is not recommended to be administered prior to the first infusio n ofLY3022855 .  
However, if the pat ient experiences a Grade 1 or 2 IRR, premedication must be provided prior to 
any subsequent doses of LY3022855 .The choice of premedicat ion is to be made after 
discussion and agreement between the invest igatorand sponsor .  In such cases (Grade 1 or 2 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 168
LY3022855IRRs), administration of steroids should be avoided, if possible.   If an IRR Grade ≤2 occurs 
during or after LY3022855 administration and the pat ient’s condition allows it, treatment with 
durvalumab or tremelimumab will proceed as planned.  Patients experiencing an IRR Grade ≥3 
will be permanent ly discont inued from study treatment.
LY3022855 may be administered up to 3 day s AFTER the scheduled dosi ng date and up to 4
days BEFORE the next scheduled dosing date to accommodate for patient vacat ions, holidays, 
inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances .  If, at any time, a dose is to be 
administered bey ondthe 3-day window, that dose is to be skipped.  A maximum o f 28days 
between administered doses is allowed for delays due to adverse events .
7.2.1.2. Durvalumab
Patients are to receive durvalu mabI.V. on Days 1 and 15 of every cycle.  Durvalumab may be 
administered up to 3 days AFTER the schedu led dosing date.  If, at any  time, a dose is 
administered bey ond the 3-day window, that dose is considered a dose delay.  A maximum delay  
of 28days between administered doses is allowed (for dose delay  in case of immune -related AE 
please refer to Secti on 7.2.4.1) .  Note that a maximum of 12 months/26 doses of durvalumab 
treatment is permitted .
7.2.1.3. Tremelimumab
Patients are to receive t remelimumab I.V. on Day  1 of every cycle for thefirst 6 doses
(Cycles1-6).  Starting with Cycle 7 (4 weeks after Dose 6 [Week 25]),tremelimumab will be 
dosed once every 3 cycles (12 weeks), that is, on Day 1 of Cycles 7, 10, 13, and so on, un til 
disease progressi on.
Tremelimumab may  be administered u p to 3 days AFTER the scheduled dosing date.  If, at any 
time, a dose is administered beyo nd the 3-day window, that dose i s considered a dose delay .  A 
delay of up to 28 days between administered doses is allowed for Cycles 1 through 6, and up to 
60 days between doses for Cycles 7 and bey ond.
7.2.4.1.Dose Delays for Adverse Events
Study treatment may be held for a m aximum of28 days; see except ion for an immune -related 
AE below.   If appropriate, and in the opinio n of the invest igator and upon agreement with the 
sponsor, study  treatment may resume upon resol ution of clinically  significant AEs to baseline or 
improvement to Grade <2.  If AEsdo not resolve to baseline or improve to Grade <2 within 28 
daysfollowing the last administered dose, study  treatment should bepermanently discont inued 
and the patient should be discont inued from the trial.   If treatment is held, the day  of treatment 
should continue as if no drug interruption h as occurred.  For example, if study  drug is held on D6 
of a cycle and AEs have reso lved by D10 (4days later), the study  drugs shoul d be resum ed per 
the original schedule,  If the original schedule results in a study  drug being held for >28 day s, the 
studydrug may not be  resumed.  One or both study  drugs may be held, resumed, or 
discontinued.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 169
LY3022855If the AE is an immune related AE as outlined in Attachment 7and if the treatment management 
guidelines outlined in Attachment 7are followed and docum ented in the patient’s medical 
record, treatment may be held for >28 days to allo w taper of high dose steroids. Treatment may 
resume in this setting only  upon resol ution of immune AEs to baseline or improvement to Grade 
<2, and only  if deemed clinically appropriate by  the treating physician and agreed to by  the 
sponsor.  If steroids cannot be tapered as outlined in Attachment 7 , and/or AEs do not resolve to 
<Grade 2, the patient may not be resumed on study treatment.
For the purposes of documentation,the investigator must assess if the toxicit y is considered at 
least possibly related to study  treatment (that is, the combinat ion regimen) and if the AE is 
considered to be immune related .Investigators are encouraged to consult the sponsor for 
additional guidance .
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 170
LY3022855ForAEsthat are considered at least possibly related to study  treatment,the following dose 
adjustment guidance may  be applied:
Treat each of the toxicit ies with maximum supportive care (including ho lding the study  
drug[s] suspected of causing the toxicit y whererequired).
If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, considerat ion should be given to 
continuing the same dose of study  drugs along with appropriate continuing supportive 
care.
All dose modificat ions should be documented with clear reasoning and docum entation of 
the approach taken.
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which study  drugs shoul d be perm anently 
discontinue d(refer toAttachment 7).
Following the first dose of study drugs, subsequent administration of study  drugs can be 
modified based on toxicit ies observed (refer to Attachment 7).
7.2.4.1.1. Specific Adverse Events
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)observed with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab 
include colitis; pneumonitis; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT)/AST increases;
hepatitis/hepatotoxicit y; neuropathy /neuromuscular toxi city (that is,events of encephalit is, 
peripheral motor and sensory  neuropathi es, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis) ; 
endocrinopathy  (that is,events of hypophysit is, adrenal insufficien cy, hyperthyroidism,and 
hypothyroidism; type 1 diabetes mellitus ); dermatitis; nephritis; and pancreat itis (or labs 
suggestive of pancreat itis-increased serum lipase or serum amylase) ;other inflammatory  
responses that are rare with a potential immune -mediated etiology include, but are not limited to, 
myocarditis, pericarditis, myositis/polymyositis, and uveitis.  Refer to Attachment 8 for details 
about and management of AESIs.
Guidelines for the management of immune -mediated, infusio n-related, and non -immune-related 
AEs are shown in Attachment 7 .
Adverse events (both nonserious and serious) associated with study drugsmay represent an 
immune-related etiology, which may  be based on the mechanism of act ion of study  drugs leading 
to Tcell activation and proliferat ion.  These irAEs may occur shortly  after the first dose or 
several mo nths after the last dose of treatment.  Potential irAEs include immune -mediated 
enterocolit is, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies.  Patients should be monitored for signs 
and symptoms of irAEs.  In the absence of an alternat iveetiology (for example , infection or 
progressive disease ), signs or symptom s of enterocolit is, dermatitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, 
myocarditis, myopathy/polymy opathy,and endocrinopathy  should be considered immune
related.  Refer to Attachment 7 for supportive care guidelines for immune -mediated reactions, 
including use of cortico steroids.
8.2.4.2. Tumor Tissue Samples
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 171
LY3022855Tissue collection will be required for bio marker research and enrollment into the study for 
patients in Part A (all cohorts) and Part B(ovarian cancer cohort only) .  For patients enrolled in 
Part A (all cohorts) and Part B (ovarian cancer cohort only) of the study, tissue will be required
for PD-L1 biomarker and other exploratory  analysis from a newly obtained core or excisio nal 
biopsy of a tumor lesio n (should be taken only after study  eligibility is confirmed) or from a 
recent biopsy defined by  3 yearssince last documented progression of disease will be required .  
For the NSCLC cohort, archived tissue should be submitted form a recent biopsy  defined by 3 
years old and this biopsy fo llows the most recent systemic therapy . If such an archived biopsy 
sample is not available, a new biopsy  must be obtained for the patient to be eligible to participate 
in study. For all cohorts, new archived tissue will be obtained only if not restricted by  local 
regulations.
In addition, an on-treatmentstudybiopsy is requi red if any  accessible l esions remain for Part A 
(all cohorts) and Part B (ovarian cancer cohort only).  If clinically feasible, the biopsies should 
be taken fro m the same lesion.  Pretreatment and/or on -treatment tumor tissue biopsies are 
optional for all Part B cohorts, except the ovarian cancer cohort, for which these biopsies are 
mandatory .  Sites should confirm the availabilit y of adequate tumor tissue with the site’s 
pathology laboratory .  For patients enrolled to NSCLC cohort of Part B, the on-treatment biopsy 
is optionalfor whom newly obtained samples cannot be obtained such as in cases of 
inaccessibilit y or patient safety concern, an archived specimen fo llowing most recent systemic 
treatment should be submitted if not restricted by  local regulations.
Sites mustconfirm the availabilit y of adequate tumor tissue forthe new biopsy  fromthe site’s 
pathology laboratory or adequate archived tumor tissue .Pretreatment formalin -fixed paraffin -
embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue should be submitted in a who le block.

Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -Mediated, Infusion -Related, and 
NonImmune-Mediated Reactions (Combination Therapy with LY3022855 and Durvalumab or LY3022855 and Tremelimumab) 
General Considerations
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be made to 
manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity of treatment -emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for the following conditions:
Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks after last dose of study drug/study 
regimen
Recurrence of a previously experienc ed Grade 3 treatment -related AE 
following resumption of dosing
Grade1No dose modification
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to 
Grade ≤1.
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4.
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper.
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions:
4.The event stabilizes and is controlled.
5.The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement.
6.Doses of prednisone are at ≤10mg/day or equivalent.
Grade 3 Depending on the individual toxicity, study drug/study regimen 
may be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines 
below.It is recommended that management of irAEsimmune-mediated adverse events (imAEs)
follows the guidelines presented in this table:
−It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism 
could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not noted specifically in these 
guidelines.
−Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or laboratory indicators of such 
events) are noted in these guidelines or not, patients should be th oroughly 
evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology ( eg,disease progression, concomitant 
medications, and infections ).to a possible immune -mediated event. In the absence 
of a clear alternative etiology, all such events should be considered 
potentiallymanaged as if they were immune related. General recommendations 
follow.
−Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low -grade (Grade 1 or 
2, unless otherwise specified) events.
−For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) events, 
promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.
−Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality –e.g., 
myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the 
guidelines –should implement high-dose IV corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 
at 2 to 4mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if clinical suspicion is high 
and/or there has been clinical confirmation. Consider, as necessary, discussing 
with the study physician , and promptly pursue specialist consultation.
−If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of taper), 
increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [ eg,up to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day PO or 
IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improve ment of symptoms, then resume 
corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28 days of taper).
−More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors ( eg,infliximab) (also 
refer to the individual sections of the irAEimAEsfor specific type of 
immunosuppressiv e) should be considered for events not responding to systemic 
steroids. Progression to use of more potent immunosuppressives should proceed 
more rapidly in events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality –e.g., 
myocarditis, or other similar ev ents even if they are not currently noted in the 
guidelines –when these events are not responding to systemic steroids.
−With long -term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider need for

General Considerations
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen.
Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels, hold study drug/study 
regimen, and if complete work up shows no evidence of pancreatitis, study 
drug/study regimen may be continued or resumed.
Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinued in Grade 3 
events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality –e.g., myocarditis, or 
other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines. 
Similarly, consider whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or 
mortality –e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events eve n if they are not currently 
noted in the guidelines –when they do not rapidly improve to Grade <1 upon 
treatment with systemic steroids and following full taper .
Note: There are some exceptions to permanent discontinuation of study drug for 
Grade 4 events (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus).Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.
−Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for Grade 3/Grade 4 
inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor response ( eg,inflammatory 
reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph nodes). Continuation of study 
drug/study regimen in this situation should be based upon a benefit /risk analysis 
for that patient.

diarrhea/enterocolitis (abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in 
bowel habits such as increased frequency over baseline or blood 
in stool) or related to bowel perforation (such as sepsis, 
peritoneal signs, and ileus).
−Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology ( eg,disease progression, other medications, 
or infections), including testing for clostridium difficile toxin, 
etc.
−Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative 
etiology, even for low -grade events, in order to prevent potential

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes
(such as Guillain -Barre and 
myasthenia gravis)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients m ay 
unpredictably experience acute decompensations that can result 
in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care 
should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a 
more severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly 
progressive weakness, and signs of respiratory insufficiency or 
autonomic instability.
−Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology 
(eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes or 
medications). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune -
mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly 
challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the 
multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its 
treatments) throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of 
prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low 
threshold to obtain a neurological consult.
−Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (eg, electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 196
LY3022855myasthenia is suspected ) are routinely indicated upon suspicion 
of such conditions and may be best facilitated by means of a 
neurology consultation.
−It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary 
treatment of Guillain -Barre is not typically considered effective. 
Patients requiring treatment should be started with IV IG and 
followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive to IV IG.
Grade 1 No dose modifications. For Grade 1:
−DiscussConsider, as necessary, discussing with the study 
physician.
−Care should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel symptoms 
of a potential decompensation as described above.
−Obtain a neurology consult unless the symptoms are very minor 
and stable. .
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose

−Care should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel symptoms 
of a potential decompensation as described above.
−Obtain a neurology consult
−Sensory neuropathy/neuropathic pain may be managed by 
appropriate medications ( eg, gabapentin or duloxetine).
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS:
oSteroids may be successfully used to treat myasthenia 
gravis. It is important to consider that steroid therapy 
(especially with high doses) may result in transient 
worsening of myasthenia and should typically be 
administered in a monitored setting under supervision 
of a consulting neurologist.
oPatients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates 
for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV IG. Such 
decisions are best made in consultation with a 
neurologist, taking into account the unique needs of 
each patient.
oIf myasthenia gravis -like neurotoxicity is present, 
consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition to 
steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also serve to 
reinforce the diagnosis.

Myocarditis Any Grade General Guidance
Discontinue drug permanently if biopsy -
proven immune -mediated myocarditis.For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated myocarditis is 
important, particularly in patients with baseline cardiopulmonary 
disease and reduced cardiac function.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myocarditis (new 
onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, 
peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung 
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 198
LY3022855toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary 
toxicity as well as other causes (eg, pulmonary embolism, 
congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial effusion). A 
Cardiology consultation should be obtained early, with prompt 
assessment o f whether and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, 
including any other diagnostic procedures.
−Initial workup should include clinical evaluation, BNP, cardiac 
enzymes, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), monitoring of 
oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exert ion), and 
additional laboratory workup as indicated. Spiral CT or cardiac 
MRI can complement ECHO to assess wall motion 
abnormalities when needed.
−Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e g, disease progression, other medications, 
or infections)
Grade 1
(asymptomatic with 
laboratory (e.g., BNP) 
or cardiac imaging 
abnormalities )No dose modifications required unless 
clinical suspicion is high, in which case 
hold study drug/study regimen dose 
during diagnostic workup for other 
etiologies. If study drug/study regimen 
is held, resume after complete resolution 
to Grade 0.For Grade 1 (no definitive findings):
-Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, BNP, cardiac enzymes, ECG, ECHO, pulse oximet ry 
(resting and exertion), and laboratory workup as clinically 
indicated.
-Consider using steroids if clinical suspicion is high.

to Grade 0, then the decision to 
reinitiate study drug/study regimen 
will be based upon treating 
physician’s clinical judgment and 
after completion of steroid tape r. If 
toxicity does not rapidly improve, 
permanently discontinue study 
drug/study regimen.
If Grade 3 -4, permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen.For Grade s2to 4:
−Monitor symptoms daily, hospitalize.
−Promptly start IV methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day or 
equivalent after Cardiology consultation has determined whether 
and when to complete diagnostic procedures including a cardiac 
biopsy.
−Supportive care (eg, oxygen).
−If no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(eg,infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label for 
general guidance before using infliximab.
−Once the patient i s improving, gradually taper steroids over ≥28

Myositis/Polymyositi s 
(“Poly/myositis”)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of poly/myositis. 
Typically, muscle weakness/pain occurs in proximal muscles 
including upper arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck and back, but 
rarely affects the extremities including hands and fingers; also 
difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing can occur and 
progress rapidly. Increased general feelings of tiredness and 
fatigue may occur, and there can be new -onset falling, difficulty 
getting up from a fall, and trouble climbing stairs, standing up 
from a seated position, and/or reaching up.
−If poly/myositis is suspected, a Neurology consultation should 
be obtained early, with prompt guidance on diagnostic 
procedures. Myocarditis may co -occur with poly/myositis; refer 
to guidance under Myocarditis. Given breathing complications, 
refer to guidance under Pneumonitis/ILD. 
Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) 
autoimmune disorder, consider Rheumatology consultation.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Initial workup should include clinical evaluation, creatine 
kinase, aldolase, LDH, BUN/creatinine, e rythrocyte 
sedimentation rate or C -reactive protein level , urine myoglobin, 
and additional laboratory wor kup as indicated, including a 
number of possible r heumatologica l/antibody tests (i e, consider 
whether a rheumatologist consultation is indicated and could 
guide need for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti -
smooth muscle, antisynthetase [such as a nti-Jo-1], and/or signal -
recognition particle antibodies). Confirmatory testing may 
include electromyography, nerve conduction studies, MRI of the 
muscles, and/or a muscle biopsy. Consider barium swallow for 
evaluation of dysphagia or dysphonia .

LY3022855Attachment 8. Protocol JSCC Durvalumab and Tremelimumab AESIs
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of s cientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the investigational product and may  require close monitoring and rapi d 
communicat ion by the invest igator to the sponsor. An AESI may be serious or nonserious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance o f these events in order to characterize and 
understand them in associat ion with the use of this investigat ional product.
AESIs for durvalumab and tremelimumab include but are not limited to events with a potential 
inflammatory  or immune-mediated mechanism  and which m ay require more frequent m onitoring 
and/or intervent ions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy . 
These AESIs are being clo sely monitored in clinical  studies with durvalumab monotherapy  and
combination therapy. An immune-related adverse event (irAE) is defined as an adverse event 
(AE) that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism o f action and where there i s no clear alternate eti ology. Serologic , immunol ogic, and 
histologic (biopsy) data, as appropri ate, shoul d be used to support an irAE diagnosis. 
Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infect ious, metabolic, toxin, or other 
etiologic causes of the irAE. 
If the investigator has any quest ions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the investigator should 
promptly contact the study physician.
AESIs observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab include:
•Diarrhea / Colitis
•Pneumonitis/ ILD (interstit ial lung disease)
•ALT/AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicit y
•Neuropathy  / neurom uscular toxicit y (i.e. events of encephalit is, peripheral motor and 
sensory neuropathi es, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis)
•Endocrinopathy  (i.e. events of hypophysit is, hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, 
diabetes insipidus, ty pe I diabetes m ellitusand hyper -and hypothy roidism)
•Rash / Dermatitis
•Nephritis/ Blood creatinine increases
•Pancreatitis (or labs suggestive of pancreatit is -increased serum lipase, increased serum 
amylase)
•Other inflammatory responses that are rare with a potential immune -mediated etiology  
include, but are not limited to, myocardit is, pericardit is, myositis/polymyositis,and 
uveitis.
Further informat ion on these risks (eg ,presenting symptoms) can be found in the current vers ion 
of the durvalumab and tremelimumab IBs.   For durvalumab and tremelimumab, AESIs will 
comprise the following:
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 206
LY3022855Pneumonitis
AEs of pneumo nitis are also of interest, as pneumonit is has been observed with use of ant i-PD-1 
mAbs (but not with ant i-PD-L1 mAbs) .  Initial work-up should include a high -resolution CT 
scan, ruling out infect ion, and pulse oximetry .  Pulmonary consultation is highly recommended.
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated events including pneumo nitis 
are outlined i n Section 7.2.4.
Infusion reactions
AEs of infusio n reactions (also known as infusio n-related reacti ons [IRRs] ) are of special interest 
and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring fro m the start of 
investigat ional product infusion up to 48 hours after the infusio n start time.  For all infusio n 
reactions, if they qualify as SAEs ,they should be reported as SAEs as described in Section 
8.1.2.1.
Hypersensitivity r eactions
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as IRRshave been reported with anti-PD-L1 and ant i-PD-1 
therapy (Brahmer et al. 2012).  As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other 
biologic agents, reactions fo llowing the infusio n of mAbs can be caused by various mechanisms, 
including acute anaphylact ic (IgE-mediated) and anaphylactoid react ions against the mAbs and 
serum sickness.  Acute allergic reactions may occur, may  be severe, and m ay result in death.  
Acute allergic reactions may include hypotensio n, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi ratory failure, 
urticaria, pru ritus, angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, 
fatigue, headache, hypertensio n, myalgia, vo miting, and unresponsiveness.
Guidelines for m anagement of patients with hypersensit ivity (including anaphylactic reaction) 
and IRRsare outlined in Sect ion 7.2.4.
Hepatic function abnormalities (hepatotoxicity)
Hepatic function abnormalit y is defined as any  increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 ×ULN 
and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent findings are 
those that derive fro m a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of 
each other.  Follow -up investi gations and inqui ries will be init iated prompt ly by the 
investigat ional site to determine whether the findi ngs are reproducible and/or whether there is 
objective evidence that clearly supports causation by a disease ( for example , cholelithiasis and 
bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational 
product.
Guidelines for management of patients with hepatic function abnormalit y are outlined in Sect ion 
7.2.4.
I5F-MC-JSCC(c) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 207
LY3022855Gastrointestinal disorders
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commo nly observed treatment -emergent SAE when tremelimumab is 
used as monotherapy .  In rare cases, col on perforation may occur that requi res surgery  
(colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly  managed.
Guidelines on management of diarrhea and colit is in patients receiving study treatmentare 
provided in Sect ion 7.2.4.
Endocrine disorders
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies include hypophysit is, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper -and 
hypothyroidism.  Guidelines for the management of pat ients with immune-mediated endocrine 
events are provided in Section 7.2.4.
Pancreatic disorders
Immune-mediated pancreat itis includes autoimmune pancreat itis, and lipase and amylase 
elevation.  Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated pancreat ic 
disorders are provi ded in Sect ion 7.2.4.
Neurotoxicity
Immune-mediated nervous syste m events include encephalit is, peripheral motor and sensory  
neuropathi es, Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis.  Guidelines for the management of patients 
with immune-mediated neurotoxic events are provided in Section 7.2.4.
Nephritis
Consult with Nephrol ogist.  Moni tor for signs and symptoms that m ay be related to changes in 
renal funct ion (eg,routine urinalysis, elevated serum blood urea nitrogen [ BUN]and creatinine, 
decreased creat inine clearance, electrolyte imbalance, decrease in urine output, prote inuria, etc) .
Patients shoul d be thoroughly  evaluated to rul e out any alternative eti ology (eg, disease 
progression, infect ions,etc).
Steroids should be consi dered in the absence of clear alternat ive etiology even for l ow grade 
events (Grade 2), in order to prevent potential pro gression to higher grade event.
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated neurotoxic events are 
provided in Section 7.2.4.

LY3022855Immune-related adverse events
Based on the mechanism o f action of durvalumab and tremelimumab leading to Tcellactivation 
and proliferat ion, there is a possibilit y of observing i rAEs during the conduct of this study .  
Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen wit h the use of ipilim umab, BMS -936558 (ant i-PD-
1 mAb), and BMS -936559 (anti -PD-L1 mAb) and may include immune -mediated enterocolit is, 
dermatitis, hepatitis (hepatotoxicit y), pneumonitis, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi et al. 2010, 
Brahmer et al. 2012, Topalian et al. 2012 ).  TheseAEs are inflammatory  in nature and can affect 
any organ.  With anti -PD-L1 and anti -CTLA-4 combinat ion therapy, the occurrence of 
overlapping or increasing cumulat ive toxicit ies that include irAEs could potentially  occur at 
higher frequencies than wit h either durvalumab or tremelimumab mo notherapy .  Patients shoul d 
be monitored for si gns and symptom s of irAEs.  In the absence of an alternate etio logy (for 
example, infection or PD), an immune -related etiology should be considered for signs or 
symptoms of ent erocolitis, dermatitis, pneumo nitis, hepatit is, and endocrinopathy.  In addit ion to 
the dose modification guidelines provided in Section 7.2.4, it is recommended that irAEs are 
managed according to the general treatment guidelines outlined for ipilimumab (Weber et al. 
2012).  These guidelines reco mmend the fo llowing:
•Patients shoul d be evaluated to i dentify any alternative etio logy.
•In the absence of a clear alternat ive etiology, all events of an inflammatory  nature shoul d 
be considered immune related.
•Symptomatic and topi cal therapy shoul d be considered for low -grade events.
•Systemic corti costeroids should be considered for a persistent low -grade event or for a 
severe event.
•More potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroi ds (for example , infliximab or mycopheno late).
If the investigator has any quest ions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the investigator should 
immediately  contact the study physician.
Myocarditis
A variety of clinical presentations, diagnost ic evidence (laboratory , imaging, histopathology ), 
and result ing diagnoses have been described in cases of my ocarditis in the literature for other 
immune checkpo int inhibitors, including heart failure, brady -and tachyarrhyt hmias, and acute 
coronary syndrome-like presentations wit hout evidence of ischemia.  Investigators should be 
aware of such rare, but severe immune -mediated adverse events including myo carditis with its 
presenting signs/symptoms (eg, decreased eject ion fraction, arrhythmias, in parti cular 
occurrences of atrioventricular block).
Investigators should adhere to the Toxicit y Managem ent Guidelines by  performing a thorough 
evaluation to rule out alternative eti ologies and init iating prompt treatment with steroids and 
modification of study drug/dose regimen depending on the severit y of the event.
Guidelines for the management of patients with my ocarditis are provi ded in Attachment 7.

2 Objective  
 
Urinary retention is a common complication following anorectal surgery and is thought to be 
multifactorial. Some researchers explain post -operative urinary retention as a consequence of 
long acting analgesics which dampen the ability for bladder fullness1. Others point to irritation to 
pelvic nerves that function with micturition thus blunting pain evoked reflexes2,3. Modifiable 
factors that have been found to play a role in contributing to post -operative urinary retention 
include the use of intravenous fluids over one liter during surgery, and administration of local 
analgesics. Local analgesics provide significant acute pain relief, but contribute to the theory of blunted pain reflexes.  Inadequate pain control increases likelihood of urinary retention through 
inability of perineal relaxation. A balance must be maintained between adequate pain control 
and interfering with the micturition reflex. Non- modifiable risk factors include age, female sex, 
the presence of diabetes mellitus, and specific surgical procedure
4. 
 
Complications of post -operative urinary retention include an increase in urinary tract infections, 
hospital readmission, damage to detrusor contractility, and for the elderly increased confusion 
and delirium5. The rate of urinary retention post anorectal surgery is between 16- 20%. The 
incidence of urinary retention following high- risk ambulatory surgery is stated to be 5%. The 
objective of this study is to assess if not requiring patients to spontaneous void prior to 
discharge from the post -anesthesia care unit (PACU) will result in shorter lengths of stay in the 
post-anesthesia care unit without increasing hospital readmissions or emergency room visits.  
 Background & Research Significance  
 
Spontaneous void is a discharge criteria from post anesthesia care units given the potential need for bladder catheterization and prolonged hospitalization for urinary retention. Research 
evaluating required spontaneous void following ambulatory anorectal surgery is lacking. 
Research has been conducted on patients requiring spinal and epidural anesthesia which demonstrated that requiring spontaneous voiding post -operation is unnecessary and delays 
discharge times 
4. Previous research regarding post -operative urinary management of anorectal 
procedures classified them as ‘high- risk’ with other procedures5. Researchers have sought to 
address potential risk factors for urinary retention and discuss restriction of pre -operative, 
perioperative fluid, and adequate pain control to decrease the incidence1,2,6,7. Determining 
factors that specifically guide discharge for patients undergoing anorectal surgery and the 
necessity of post -operative void, however, has not been previously evaluated.  
 
Currently the protocol at The Ohio State University Hospital requires voiding spontaneously 
prior to discharge from the PACU, but operations performed at The Ohio State University 
Hospital East do not require a spontaneous void prior to discharge. A recent IRB approved 
study conducted by our group examined if requiring a spontaneous void prior to discharge 
affects emergency room visits and readmission rates. We conducted a retrospective review of 
ambulatory anorectal surgeries performed at the two locations. One of these locations required 
the ability to void spontaneously as a prerequisite for discharge after ambulatory anorectal surgeries (spontaneous void group) whereas the other location did not maintain this requirement

3 and patients were discharged once they were deemed ready (no void group). Our research 
concluded that patients can be safely discharged without voiding after anorectal procedures without increasing the risk of ED visits or readmissions. Furthermore, a requirement to 
spontaneously void before discharge significantly prolongs PACU stays. Thus, we propose to 
compare PACU discharge times between patients requiring a spontaneous void to those patients not requiring a spontaneous void.  
 
Hypothesis:  
Ability to void spontaneously after anorectal procedures does not result in reduced 
readmissions, emergency room visits and post op complications.  
 Primary Objectives : 
1. To compare readmission and complications rates between patients who are required to void post anorectal surgeries to those who are sent home without voiding 
spontaneously.  
2. To compare the rates of emergency room visit between patients who are required to void 
post anorectal surgeries to those who are sent home without voiding spontaneously.  
 Secondary Objectives:  
1. To compare PACU times for patients  who are required to void post anorectal surgeries 
to those who are sent home without voiding spontaneously.  
2. To compare total hospital costs for  patients who are required to void post anorectal 
surgeries to those who are sent home without voiding spontaneously.  
 
Study Plan and Procedures This study will be a prospective clinical trial, in which 100 anorectal  surgery patients will be 
randomly assigned to a control (spontaneous void) or experimental (no void) group. 
Randomization will be done using the free software provided by www.randomizer.org. “Spontaneous void” group will include 50 patients who will required to void spontaneously after 
anorectal surgeries. On the other hand “no void” group will be 50 patients who will be 
discharged home from the PACU once they meet ambulatory surgery center discharge criteria per hospital guidelines. Patients requiring anorectal surgeries will be consented to take part in 
the study during the preoperative outpatient office visit . A post op phone call will be made by 
designated study personnel to participants on post -op day 30  using a study questionnaire to 
assess re -admission and emergency room visits .  
 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Age 18- 80 years old  
2. Patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy, fistulotomy or anal condyloma excision.

Power is the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. N1 and N2 are the number of items sampled from each population.  
μ1 and μ2 are the assumed population means for power and sample size calculations.  
μ1 - μ2 is the difference between population means at which power and sample size 
calculations are made.  
σ1 and σ2 are the assumed population standard deviations for groups 1 and 2, respectively.  
Alpha is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis. 
Beta is the probability of accepting a false null hypothesis.

6 Summary Statements  
Group sample sizes of 50 and 50 are needed to achieve 80.000% power to reject the null 
hypothesis of equal means when the population mean difference is μ1 - μ2 = 210.0 - 129.1 = 
80.9 with standard deviations of 100.0 for group 1 and 175.0 for group 2, and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.050 using a two- sided two- sample unequal- variance t -test.  
 For other categorical variables, such as readmission rates, frequencies will be summarized.

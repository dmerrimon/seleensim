30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 336. INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic 
liver disease in the world today. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the more 
advanced form of NAFLD, is defined as  the presence of hepatic steatosis and 
inflammation with hepatocy te injury (ballooning), with or without fibrosis.1NASH is 
associated with increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular-, liver-, and cancer-related deaths.
Currently, there are no approved drugs for th e treatment of NASH. With the increasing 
prevalence of obesity and obesity-related di seases, NASH could soon become the leading 
indication for liver transplantation and the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC).
2 There is an urgent need to devel op safe and effective therapies for NASH .3
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a nonmitogenic hormone that is an important 
regulator of energy metabolism .4 FGF21 is a member of a hormone-like subgroup within 
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) superfa mily. Like other members of this subfamily 
(i.e., FGF19 and FGF23), FGF21 has low binding affinity for heparin, which allows for 
transport into the circulation and subsequent action at distant sites. High-affinity binding 
of FGF21 to FGF receptors (FGF-Rs) occurs only in the presence of the FGF-R co-
/g85/g72/g70/g72/g83/g87/g82/g85/g15 /g533-/g46/g79/g82/g87/g75/g82/g30 /g87/g75/g72 /g85/g72/g86/g87/g85/g76/g70 /g87/g72/g71 /g72/g91/g83/g85/g72/g86/g86/g76/g82/g81 /g83/g68/g87/g87/g72/g85/g81 /g82/g73 /g533-Klotho defines the target tissues 
for FGF21 activity. FGF-/g53/g86 /g68/g81/g71 /g533-Klotho are co-l ocalized in liver, pancreas and adipose 
tissue, which are responsible for glucose and fat metabolism.5Notably, in contrast to 
FGF19, FGF21 does not signal through FGF-/g53/g23/g18/g533-Klotho6and, therefore, is not 
mitogenic, nor does it regulat e bile acid metabolism.  
FGF21 is most abundantly produced in the liv er, where it reduces lipogenesis and glucose 
production and enhances  fatty acid oxidation.7 In adipose tissue, FGF21 promotes 
glucose uptake and stimulates secretion of adiponectin, an adipokine with insulin-
sensitizing, anti-steatotic, anti-in flammatory, and anti-fibrotic activities. Initial studies in 
mouse models and primates suggested that  FGF21 administration increased energy 
expenditure, promoted fat u tilization and reduced body weight and hepatic steatosis in 
high fat diet-induced obese mice, and improved lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, and glycemia in obese, diabetic rhesus monkeys .
8,9Increases in adiponectin and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reductions in levels  of triglycerides (TGs), low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and insulin have  also been reported in a human clinical 
study with a FGF21 analog .10Beneficial changes in circulating factors can be used as 
biomarkers of FGF21 activity, and they sugge st that FGF21 mimetics could be attractive 
candidates for the treatment of NASH and its metabolic complications. 
Serum concentrations of FGF21 are increa sed in human patients with NAFLD or NASH 
as well as the methionine- and cholin e-deficient (MCD) mouse model of NASH.11,12,13
FGF21 administration to FGF21 knock-out mice, however, has been shown to reverse 
excessive liver fat accumulation and fi brosis in the mouse MCD NASH model .13These 
data are consistent with the hypothesis that  up-regulation of FGF21 seen in human NASH 
patients or wild-type mice on the MCD diet  may be an insufficient compensatory

serum concentrations may ameliorate the steatosis and fibrosis associated with NASH.
6.1 Background 
BMS-986036, also known by the generic name pegbelfermin, is a PEGylated FGF21 
analog with potent FGF21 signaling activity. BMS-986036 is a slightly modified version 
of human FGF21, where the glutamine amino acid at position 108 has been replaced by a 
novel para- acetylphenylalanine residue with a linear 30-kDa polyethyl ene glycol (PEG) 
attached to improve the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the molecule and a methionine residue has been added to the amino-terminus of the protein to enable expression in Escherichia coli. Preclinical and clinical studies with BMS-986036 suggest 
that BMS-986036 is safe and well tolerated, and that it has the ability to increase 
adiponectin, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce liver fat, reduce liver injury, reduce fibrosis, and improve plasma lipid profiles, making it an attractive candidate for the treatment of patients with NASH who have advanced fibrosis. 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochur e (IB) for more details on BMS-986036. 
6.1.1 Nonclinical Studies
The effects of BMS-986036 tr eatment have been evalua ted in both prevention and 
therapeutic intervention studies in a mous e model of NASH, in which mice develop a 
fatty liver at 5 weeks of age, NASH at 7 week s of age, and liver fibrosis at 9 weeks of 
age.
14,15
/g120In the prevention study, 5-week old mice treated with BMS-986036 had 
significantly reduced body weight, liver  weight, liver-to-body weight ratio, 
plasma TGs, and liver TGs. BMS-986036 al so significantly decreased histological 
evidence of hepatic perturbations (NAFLD Activity Score, comprising 
assessments of steatosis, lobular infl ammation, and hepatocy te ballooning) and 
significantly reduced fibrosis, demonstra ting an anti-fibrotic effect of BMS-
986036. Consistent with this observed an ti-fibrotic effect, BMS-986036 treatment 
reduced hepatic expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP- 1) and type 1 collagen. 
/g120In the therapeutic intervention study, 9-week old mice treated with BMS-986036 had statistically significant decreases in liver-to-body weight ratio, blood glucose, 
plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver lipid content (TG and cholesterol), as well as histological evidence of he patic steatosis, hepa tocyte ballooning, 
lobular inflammation, and fibrosis. 
BMS-986036 was not genotoxic and had no ad verse effects on cardiovascular, 
respiratory, and/or central nervous system s in rats, dogs, and/or cynomolgus monkeys. 
BMS-986036 was neither embryo-le thal nor teratogenic in definitive rat or rabbit 
embryo-fetal development studies. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats a nd sexually mature monkeys up to 6 months in 
duration, BMS-986036, administered once daily (QD), was clini cally well tolerated and

metabolic parameters). Effects on bone (decre ases in bone mass, size, mineralization, and 
strength, as well as changes in formation/ resorption biomarkers) were observed, and 
these were attributed to pharmacologically  mediated body weight loss/reductions and 
slower overall growth except at the highest dose tested in monkeys (1 mg/kg/day; 19 /g117
area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] multiple). 
Expected PEGylated peptide-related effects (injection site inflammation and minimal to 
moderate tissue vacuolation)  were also observed. There was also no indication that 
PEG-related vacuolation was associated with  any apparent degene rative or functional 
consequences in any cells or tissues, and fi ndings were reversible, except for choroid 
/g83/g79/g72/g91/g88/g86 /g89/g68/g70/g88/g82/g79/g68/g87/g76/g82/g81 /g76/g81 /g80/g82/g81/g78/g72/g92/g86 /g68/g87 /g71/g82/g86/g72/g86 /g149  0.75 mg/kg/day (C-terminal intact 
BMS-986036 AUC multiple of 8 /g117). PEG-related findings were consistent with an 
adaptive response associated with PEG clea rance and were not considered adverse.
Most of the observed effects in both studies did not substantially progress with extended 
duration of dosing and were generally reversible. 
The no-observed-adverse-effect level AUC e xposure multiples for C-terminal intact 
BMS-986036 was 0.8 /g117(males) and 2 /g117(females) in rats and 2/g117  in monkeys relative to the 
highest planned dose of 40-mg once weekly (QW) in this study. Refer to the IB for more details on these studies.
6.1.2 Clinical Studies
In the first-in-human study (Study MB130001), BMS-986036 was administered by 
subcutaneous (SC) injection in single and multiple doses for up to 14 days to 72 obese, nondiabetic, healthy adult volunteers .
16C-terminal intact BMS-986036, the active 
polypeptide, displayed a hal f-life of approximately 20 - 24 hours and demonstrated a 
generally linear PK with 2-fold to 3-fold accumulation following QD dosing. Following single dose administration in the range of 1 mg to 60 mg, the drug was slowly absorbed 
from the SC injection site (abdomen) into the systemic circulation, with median time to 
maximum concentration ranging from 24 to 33 hours. Following a single weekly dose of 
21 mg, the time to maximum concentration wa s like that of single doses. BMS-986036 in 
doses of up to 30 mg QD for up to 14 days was well tolerated and safe; adverse events 
(AEs) were mild and showed no dose-ordered trends. In the multiple-dosing panels, BMS-986036 increased adiponectin levels in  a dose-dependent fashion. Adiponectin 
increased by 41.7% in the BMS-986036 30 mg QD group; in contrast, it decreased by 28.5% in the placebo group. Adiponectin has been  shown to inhibit he patic stellate cell 
proliferation and hepatic  fibrosis in vitro,
17and higher levels of adiponectin have been 
shown to correlate with improvements in fibrosis, as well as steatosis and inflammation.18
It is therefore likely that an increase in adiponectin in response to BMS-986036 would have beneficial anti-steatotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects in NASH patients. BMS-986036 also impr oved insulin sensitivity, promoted favorable lipid 
changes (decreased TGs, apolipoprotein B, and LDL cholesterol), and reduced body weight compared to placebo.

Clinical Protocol 
BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin) Study MB130-068
30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 36BMS-986036 was also studied in two Phase 2 studies. Study MB130002 was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple-dose study in 
obese participants with type 2 diabetes me llitus (T2DM). Over 90% of participants had 
evidence of underlying fatty liver, based upon the fatty liver index. In this study, 
participants self-administe red BMS-986036 or placebo, SC, for 12 weeks according to 
one of the following dosing regimens : BMS-986036 (1, 5, or 20 mg QD), BMS-986036 
(20 mg QW), or placebo (QD). A total of 96 participants received at least 1 dose of BMS-986036. BMS-986036 treatment improved insulin sensitivity, adiponectin, fasting TGs, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, a polipoprotein C3, and N-terminal type 3 
collagen propeptide (PRO-C3) (a  biomarker for type 3 colla gen formation, and hence, 
potentially, fibrosis). Dose-dep endent increases in adiponectin were observed in all 
BMS-986036 dose groups. Meaningful changes in body weight were not observed.
19
Study MB130045 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlle d, parallel-group, 
multiple-dose study conducted in  participants with biops y-confirmed NASH who had 
stage 1-3 fibrosis according to the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) scoring 
system. In this study, participants self-administered BMS-986036 or placebo, SC, for 16 weeks according to one of the following dosing regimens: BMS-986036 (10 mg QD), BMS-986036 (20 mg QW), placebo (QD). A total of 50 participants received at least 1 
dose of BMS-986036 in the study.
20Treatment with BMS-986036 for 16 weeks resulted 
in statistically significant reductions in he patic fat fraction (as measured by magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI]), decreases in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (markers of liver injury), increases in adiponectin, and improvements in lipid profiles. Importantly, treatment with BMS-986036 was associated with improvement in fibrosis, 
as determined by decreases in magnetic reso nance elastography (MRE ) (an assessment of 
liver stiffness) and decreases in serum PRO-C3. In particular, BMS-986036 treatment 
was associated with an increase in the propor tion of patients with at least a 15% decrease 
in MRE-assessed liver s tiffness, a reduction that has been previously associated with an 
improvement in liver fibrosis, as observed on liver biopsy .

6.2 Study Rationale 
The current study is designed to confirm and extend the results observed in the Phase 1 
and 2a studies with BMS-986036. Specifically, this study aims to demonstrate in 
participants with NASH and stage 3 liver fibrosis, the efficacy of BMS-986036 using 
histological and noninvasive endpoints, and the safety of BMS-986036 as assessed by AEs, lab results and bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring. 
The protocol was planned to randomize ap proximately 160 partic ipants to 1 of 4 
treatment groups (approximately 40 participants per gr oup). This protocol amendment 
(Version 4.0) reflects that, upon close of enro llment, 197 participants were randomized to 
treatment (approximately 49 participants  per group). The increased number of 
randomized participants occurred following: 1)  unexpectedly high enrollment rate in the

failure rate for subjects entered in the final month of enrollment. 
Based on the unmet medical need for patients, the benefit/risk assessment discussed in 
Section  6.3, and the strict safety monitoring of all participants, the potential clinical 
benefit outweighs the risks for those who have  chosen to participate in this study. No 
additional revisions are required in Section 9due to the increased number of randomized 
participants.
6.2.1 Scientific Ration ale for Study Design
Complete details of the study design are provided in Section  8.1.
Participants having a confirme d diagnosis of NASH with stage 3 liver fibrosis will be 
enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ra ndomized, parallel-group 
study to demonstrate the effi cacy and safety of BMS-986036. 
NASH patients with stage 3 liver fibrosis ha ve a high unmet medical need for approved 
therapies and compared to NASH patients with earlier stages of fibrosis, they are more 
likely to have a favorable benefit/risk profile for trea tment with BMS-986036. Compared 
to NASH patients with stage 1-2 fibrosis, NA SH patients with stage 3 fibrosis have 
worsened clinical outcomes and disease-specific mortality.22,23,24Moreover, the risk of 
liver-related mortality increases exponentia lly with each increase in fibrosis stage.25
Demonstration of an improveme nt in fibrosis should be highly predictive of clinical 
benefit.
NASH grade will be assessed by liver biopsy hi stology. Fibrosis stage will be assessed by 
liver histology as well as a number of noninvasi ve measures. In addition, PRO-C3 levels 
in participants will be measured during the course of the study in order to collect more 
data on its potential as a pharm acodynamic (PD) biomarker of fibrosis. The correlation of 
baseline PRO-C3 levels with  response to BMS-986036 will also  be assesse d. Markers of 
liver injury, metabolic improvements, and other liver-related outcomes will also be examined. Safety, including hematology and blood chemistr y results, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), and other potential sa fety issues (e.g., gastrointestinal AEs, immunogenicity, 
injection reactions, and e ffects on bone), will be monitored throughout the study. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) prof iling of BMS-986036 will be perfo rmed on all participants 
based upon trough sampling prior to dosing at each visit.  
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be base d on the independent histological 
evaluation of liver biopsy at 24 weeks  a timepoint at which meaningful clinical benefits in fibrosis and NASH disease activity are ex pected in the selected patient population 
treated with BMS-986036.

BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin) Study MB130-068
30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 38The design and dose selection of future Ph ase 3 studies with BMS-986036 will be based 
upon the totality of the efficacy, safety a nd PK analyses from this study and from 
MB130-069, a Phase 2 study of BMS-986036 in  participants with NASH and 
compensated cirrhosis. 
6.2.2 Justification for Dose and Regimen  
In the present study, weekly SC adminis tration of BMS-986036 (10, 20 or 40 mg, or 
placebo) will be evaluated for efficacy and safety. Careful examination of the Phase 1 
and Phase 2a data, along with insights gl eaned from nonclinical studies in animals, 
support these dosing regimens. 
In Study MB130045, BMS-986036 dosed as 10 mg QD or 20 mg QW SC for 16 weeks in 
NASH participants consistently improved multiple biomarkers associated with steatosis, liver injury, and fibrosis. In addition to si gnificantly decreasing hepatic fat fraction in 
NASH participants at both doses, improveme nt relative to placebo was observed for 
several biomarkers such as serum PRO-C 3, liver stiffness (as measured by MRE), 
adiponectin, hepatic transaminases, and seru m lipids. At 16 weeks, the 10 mg QD dose 
produced effects that were comparable to, albeit modestly higher than, the 20 mg QW 
dose for several biomarkers (MRI, PR O-C3, LDL choleste rol, and hepatic 
transaminases).  
In addition to data from NASH patients in Study MB130-045, PK and PD data from 2 
other randomized, and place bo-controlled studies of BMS-986036 in obese healthy 
volunteers (MB130-001) and obese T2DM par ticipants (MB130002) were also included 
and analyzed using population PK-PD analyses.Population PK-PD models we re developed that descri bed the PK-PD relationship 
between BMS-986036 and several PD responses ac ross these studies, such as increase in 
adiponectin, reduction of hepa tic fat fraction (MRI), reduc tion of TGs, LDL, and HDL, 
reduction of liver inflammation, as eviden ced by reduction of elevated ALT, and 
reduction of fibrosis, as noted by improve ments in PRO-C3, MRE, and adiponectin. 
Direct or indirect response PK -PD models were used to desc ribe the relationship between 
PK and PD. These models were then used to predict biomarker responses at various 
candidate weekly dosi ng regimens of BMS-986036.
16,19,20
Given that only modestly higher PD responses were observed with 10 mg QD dosing 
relative to the 20 mg QW dose in Study MB130-045, and the consideration that a once-weekly SC dosing regimen is likely to be more acceptable to participants than a daily dosing regimen and therefore be associat ed with better compliance, 3 weekly doses 
were identified -i.e., 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg QW, that are expected to achieve 
clinically meaningful responses for key biomarkers of NASH, and can be administered in up to 2 injections. Model-predicted percent change from Baseline in key biomarkers for typical NASH study participants are noted in Table 4 below.

The safety and PK of 20 mg QW and 40 mg QW dosing regime ns for 3 weekly doses has 
been recently characterized in a Phase 1 st udy in obese healthy Ja panese participants. 
Preliminary results show that  exposure is generally dose proportional between 20 mg and 
40 mg QW, and the 40 mg QW dose was safe  and well tolerated (refer to IB for 
additional details). The 40 mg QW dose is  hypothesized to provide increased efficacy 
compared to that of the 20 mg QW dos e, but with lower overall BMS-986036 exposure 
than that of the 10 mg QD dose. Additionally, compared to 10 mg QD, the 40 mg QW 
dose is expected to provide a higher margin relative to the exposure associated with nonclinical bone-related AEs, and it also provides a lower burden of PEG. Evaluation of the 10 mg QW and 40 mg QW dose regimens is expected to facilitate a more complete evaluation of the dose-response profile of BMS-986036. 
6.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
6.3.1 Summary of Potential Benefits
In obese participants with T2DM (many of whom had underlying fa tty liver), treatment 
with BMS-986036 for 12 weeks improved several metabolic factors (i nsulin sensitivity, 
adiponectin, and serum lipids) and led to a re duction in PRO-C3. In participants with 
NASH, treatment with BMS-986036 for 16 week s resulted in statistically significant 
reductions in hepatic fat frac tion (measured by MRI), decreases in hepatic transaminases 
(markers of liver injury), significant increas es in adiponectin, significant reductions in 
PRO-C3, reductions in liver stiffness (meas ured by MRE), and improvements in lipid 
profiles.
Thus, clinical data suggest that BMS- 986036 has the ability to increase adiponectin, 
improve insulin sensitivity, reduce liver fat, reduce liver injury, reduce fibrosis and 
improve plasma lipid profiles,  making it an attractive candi date for the treatment of 
patients with NASH who have advanced fibros is. Together, these data support further 
development of BMS-986036 for the treatment of patients with NASH with advanced fibrosis.

dyspepsia, frequent bowel m ovements, upper abdominal pa in, vomiting, and abdominal 
pain. When they occurred, th ese AEs were of generally mild  or moderate intensity; none 
of these AEs were of severe intensit y. There were no discontinuations due to 
gastrointestinal AEs.
A total of 69 events of diarrhea, nausea, frequent bowel movements, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, and abdominal pain upper were repor ted in participants on both placebo and 
BMS-986036 treated arms. Among the 69 events, 55 events were reported in participants 
treated with BMS-986036 and 14 events were reported in placebo group: 
/g120Among the 55 events, there were 3 events for which AE duration was not available for calculation. Therefore, event duration was calculated for 52 events.
/g120The majority (80.7% [42/52]) of the events were of mild severity  (Grade 1), were 
judged by the investigator to be not related, were resolved in a mean of 6 weeks, 
and did not require  any treatment. 
/g120A smaller percentage (19.2% [10/52]) of the events were of moderate severity; 8 of the moderate grade events (5 events of diarrhea and 1 event each of abdominal 
pain, vomiting, and frequent bowel movement s) did not require any treatment and 
were resolved quickly (within a mean of 8.7 days). These events were reported as not related by the investigator, except  for frequent bowel movements. The 
remaining moderate severity events (2 events of nausea; 1 related and 1 not related) required treatme nt and were resolved in a mean of 31 days. 
At this time, these events are not expl ained by the known biological mechanism of 
PEG-FGF21. Of note, there was no evidence of gastrointestinal AEs in nonclinical models with BMS-986036.  
6.3.2.2 Immunogenicity 
BMS-986036 is a modified version of human  FGF21 and has the potential to be 
immunogenic; however, the potential safety lia bility of antibody formation in humans is 
considered to be low. Most human protei n therapeutics can induce a rapid and strong 
anti-drug antibody (ADA) response in animals, although the presence of ADAs in these 
species does not necessarily pred ict immunogenicity in humans.  
In the Phase 1 study MB130001, 3 of 72 participants (4%), who received any dose of BMS-986036, developed antibodies to FGF 21 and BMS-986036 by the end of the study. 
An initial assay titer increase was observed, followed by stabilization or decrease in 
titers, during additional post- study immunogenicity testing over the next 6 months. No 
participant had persistent positive functional neutralizi ng ADAs during the Follow-Up 
Period, although one participant tested positive at 2 nonconsecutive time points. Plasma 
exposure of BMS-986036 in these 3 participants did not differ from that of other treated participants during the period in which the concentration was dete ctable. Immunogenicity 
was not associated with an increased incidence of overall AEs or  immunogenicity-related 
AEs, such as rash or fever, or with altered PK or PD effects.

they were not associated with immune-related AEs or injection site reactions. BMS-986036 exposures were similar in par ticipants with ADAs compared with 
participants without ADAs. During the Fo llow-Up Period, antibody titers were observed

6.3.2.3 Injection Reactions
Injection site reactions have been monito red in completed and ongoing studies using the 
Draize scale, which rates erythema and edema at the injection site on a scale ranging 
from “none” to “severe.” In Phase 1 and Phas e 2a studies, injection-related AEs were 
generally mild, transient, resolved wit hout intervention, and did not lead to 
discontinuation. 
In the single ascending dose portion of  Study MB130001, 2 participants (5.6%) who 
received BMS-986036 and 0 participants in th e placebo group developed injection site 
erythema. In the multiple ascending dose portion of the study, the proportion of 
participants who developed erythema was well balanced between treatment groups 
(BMS-986036 at any dose versus pl acebo). Eleven participants  developed injection site 
erythema (8 participants [22.2%] acro ss all BMS-986036 groups a nd 3 participants 
[25.0%] in the placebo group). No particip ants developed injection site edema. 
In Study MB130002, injection site er ythema and/or injection site  edema were reported in 
4 of 96 participants (4.2%) who received BMS-986036 and in 1 of 24 participants (4.2%) who received placebo. One injection site re action (20 mg QD) was of severe intensity, 
and the remaining 3 injection site reactions were rated as mild in intensity. Concurrent ADAs were present in 1 participant (10 mg QD) of the 5 participants with injection site 
erythema and/or edema.
In Study MB130045, injection site erythema wa s reported in 3 (4.0%) participants, and 
injection site edema was reported in 1 (1.3%) participant. All AEs of injection site 
erythema and injection site edema were mild or moderate in intensity. Concurrent ADAs were present in 2 participants (20 mg QW and 10 mg QD) of the 3 participants with

30 January  2020 BMS Confidential 426.3.2.4 Effects on Bone 
In the multiple ascending dose porti on of Study MB130001, conducted in healthy 
participants, all dose panels had a decrease in bone formation markers (bone-specific 
alkaline phosphatase [BSA P] and N-terminal propeptide- of type 1 procollagen [P1NP])
that was reversible after administrati on of BMS-986036 had ende d. The bone marker 
values remained within the normal reference range in all participants, and the percent 
decrease from Baseline did not differ between treated participants and the pooled placebo 
group. Similarly, there was no significant chan ge in bone resorption markers in any 
BMS-986036-treated participants compared to the pooled placebo group. 
Analyses from Phase 2 studies (MB130002 a nd MB130045) in participants with T2DM 
and in participants with NASH suggest th at BMD, as measured by bone densitometry, 
was not affected by 12 or 16 weeks of dosing with BMS-986036. There were no 
meaningful differences in population mean BMD change fr om Baseline at the end of 
dosing or at 6-months follow-up. 
Additionally, in both studies, BMS-986036 ha d no clinically meaningful impact on 
biomarkers of bone turnover (BSAP, P1NP, or C-terminal telopeptides type I collagen
[CTX-1]) during 12 or 16 weeks of treatment. 
Overall, the results from Phase 1 and Phas e 2a studies have demonstrated that 
BMS-986036 was clinically well tolerated in obese  participants, in obese participants 
with T2DM, and in participants with NASH with stage 1-3 liver fibrosis and has an 
acceptable safety profile to support continued clinical development.
6.3.3 Safety Monitoring 
Safety monitoring will be in place during the entire study allowing early detection of any 
safety signals. Pa rticipants will undergo safety evalua tions at each clinic visit and the 
investigator will conduct a t horough safety evaluation before  dosing. Safety assessments 
will be regularly performed and will include assessments for AEs, focused symptom-
directed physical examinations , and laboratory measurements. 
Study res ults will be monitored by an independent DMC. The scope of responsibility for 
the DMC  will be comprised of safety monitoring by masked treatment group howev er, 
the DMC  may request treatment c odes and/or efficacy summaries if indicated for 
safety/be nefit assessment (see Appendix 1).
In additio n to the DMC, the sponsor (blinded to  treatment assignm ent) will monitor 
safety. A ll reported AEs will be assessed, including events of special interest for 
BMS-98 6036 (see Section  8.5.3.7). The sponsor has developed a list of events of spe cial 
interest f or the BMS-986036 program based on th e known biologic class effects, the  
mechanis m of action, and data from unblinded clinical studies. These will include 
injection site reactions, gastrointestinal even ts, and bone-related events. Additionally,

8.1 Overall Study Design 
This will be a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group 
study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of BMS-986036 in the treatment of 
participants with NASH and stage 3 liver fibr osis. The procedures and assessments to be 
conducted at each study visit are outlined in the Schedules of Activities tables (Table 1 ,
Table 2 , and Table 3 in Section 1) pr ovided at the beginning of this protocol.  
A schematic of th e study design is in Figure 1 (Screening to Week 52/Post-Treatment 
Follow-up [PTFU]) and Figure 2 (follow-up visits after the Week 52/PTFU Visit) below.
The study will consist of 4 periods: 
/g120A Screening Period of up to 8 weeks in dur ation (this period may be extended to a 
total of up to 12 weeks upon discussion with the medical monitor) 
/g120A 48-week, Double-Blind Treatment Period, during whic h the participants will 
receive blinded study medication (BMS-986036 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg QW or matching placebo QW)
/g120A 4-week PTFU Period
/g120A Follow-Up Period of up to 14 months (1  month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) 
after the Week 52/PTFU Visit for the coll ection of an additional dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) assessment (in all participants), samples for potential 
immunogenicity testing (in all participants) as well as plasma and serum for 
biomarkers (in all participants) at 6 m onths (± 14 days) after the Week 52/PTFU 
visit. Subsequent visits at 9, 12, and 14 months after the Week 52 or PTFU visit
will be performed in participants for whom Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up Visits are required. See Section  8.5.3.6
At the end of the Screening Period, participants meeting a ll inclusion and no exclusion 
criteria will enter the Double-Blind Treatment Period.
Participants will be enrolled and randomized via interactive response technology (IRT) to 
receive BMS-986036 10 mg QW, BMS-986036 20 mg QW, BMS-986036 40 mg QW or matching placebo QW in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. A liver biopsy will be performed during the Screening Period (if necessary) and at We ek 24 in all participants. A total of 
approximately 160 pa rticipants was planned to be rando mized (40 participants per arm). 
The final number of participants randomi zed was 197 participants (see Section 6.2). 
Arm 1: BMS-986036 (10 mg QW) 
Arm 2: BMS-986036 (20 mg QW)

further stratified.
The number of participants with NAS of < 4 will not exceed 15% of the total number of 
randomized participants. Randomized participants will receive thei r assigned double-blind study medication for a 
total of 48 weekly doses. The treatment will be administered by SC injection of 2 pre-
filled syringes of study medica tion in the abdomen according to their assigned treatment 
arm (see Section 8.4.2). During the Double-Blind Treatment Period ( Table 2 in Section 
1), participants will be eval uated for safety and efficacy every 4 weeks (±5 days) through 
Week 24 and every 8 weeks (±5 days) after Week 24 through Week 48.  
Participants will then return at Week 52 (± 5 days) for a PTFU Visit. Participants who 
discontinue study medication earlier than Week 48 will have an Early Termination (ET) Visit at the time of study medication disconti nuation and will return for a PTFU Visit 4 
weeks (±5 days) after the ET Visit.
Participants will return 6 months (± 14 days) (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) 
after the Week 52/PTFU Visit for DXA to a ssess BMD and for collection of samples for 
potential immunogenicity testing as well as serum and plasma biomarker samples (see 
Table 3 in Section 1). Participants may need to  return at 9 months, 12 months, and 14 
months (± 14 days) (1 month is defined as  4 calendar weeks) after the Week 52/PTFU 
Visit if required for immunogenicity testing, as described in Section  8.5.3.6 (see Table 3

2. Physical limitations related to  fitting into the bore of the magnet or weigh t greater than 
that allowable by the imaging  instrument 
3. Participants with a pacemaker, epicardial pacemaker wires, MRI-incompatible cardiac 
valve prostheses, MRI-incompatible vascular clips less than 2 months old, or 
MRI-incompatible aneurysm clips of any age 
4. Participants with MRI-incompatible cochlear implants5. Participants with spinal nerve stimulators6. Participants with a nondetachable infusion pump 7. Participants with known me tallic fragments in the body 
8. Employment history that involves exposure to welding 9. Participants who have sh rapnel anywhere in their body 
The above list should not be used as a substitute  for local clinical st andards of care. The 
ultimate decision to perform any scan should rest with the site radiologist, the investigator, and the standard set by the IRB/EC and local institution. 
If imaging is contraindicated for a participant, but the participant is otherwise eligible for the 
study, the participant may still participate in the study.
8.3.5 History: Medical, Surgical, Diet, and Exercise
Medical and surgical history will be collected during Screening and updated on Day 1. 
Medical history should be comp lete and comprehensive, incl uding any history of alcohol, 
marijuana, and caffeine use. Surgical history should include all gastroin testinal and endocrine 
surgical procedures in the participant’s lifetime and all other surgical procedures that occurred in the previous 5 years. Medical history will also include a fall risk assessment

8.3.6 Dietary and Lifestyle Counseling
During Screening, after receiving the signed ICF, sites will provide all pa rticipants with the 
following dietary and lif estyle counseling: 
/g120Reduce body weight (if obese or overw eight) through diet and exercise 
/g120Follow a balanced diet
/g120Increase physical activity
/g120Avoid alcohol as much as possible. Howeve r, if alcohol is consumed, do not consume 
/g116 30 g/day (males) or /g116  20 g/day (females) of alcohol during the study. This is equal 
to approximately 2 alcoholic drinks per day for ma les, and approximately 1.5 
alcoholic drinks per day for females. One alcoholic drink is equal to 12 ounces (355 
mL) of 5% ABV beer, 5 ounces (148 mL) of 12% ABV wine, or 1.5 ounces (44.4 
mL) of 40% ABV distilled spirits
8.3.7 Concomitant Medic ation Restrictions
Anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-dyslipidemic medications are allowed if participants have been on stable dosing regimens for at least 3 months (12 weeks) (6 weeks for statins) prior to and during the Screening Period. The in vestigator may contact the medical monitor 
regarding the stability of a participant's re gimen when determining eligibility for study 
participation.
During study treatment, partic ipants should refrain from using cannabinoid products.

8.3.8 Screen Failures and Rescreening
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to take part in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of  screen failure information is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of screen failure  participants, to meet the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporti ng Trials (CONSORT) publishing re quirements, and to respond to 
queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes date of consent, 
demography, screen failure de tails, eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs (SAEs). 
8.3.8.1 Retesting During S creening 
Laboratory parameters and/ or assessments that are included in the Screening procedures 
(Table 1 in Section 1) may be repeated during the Screening Period in an effort to find all 
possible qualified participants. Consultation with the medical monitor may be needed to identify whether repeat test ing of any particular parame ter is clinically relevant.
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be 
assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current clinical state.
8.3.8.2 Rescreening
This study will permit the rescreening of a participant who has discontinued the study as a 
pre-treatment failure (i.e., the participant ha s not been randomized/has not been treated). 
Consultation with the medical monitor may be needed to identify whether rescreening is 
clinically relevant. If rescreened, the participant must sign a new ICF.
In the event that histologic evaluation of th e biopsy of an otherwis e qualified participant

8.4 Treatment
Study medication is defined as any investigational treatment(s),  marketed product(s), placebo 
or medical device intended to be administere d to a study participant according to the study 
randomization or tr eatment allocation.
Each study medication must be liste d as either an IP or non-IP.
Study treatment includes both IP and non-IP and can consist of the following: 
/g120All products, active or placebo, being tested or  used as a comparator in a clinical 
study 
/g120Study required premedication 
/g120Other drugs administered as part of the study that are critical to claims of efficacy 
(e.g., background therapy, rescue medications) 
/g120If specific criteria are required for tr eatment in a given phase of the study 
(e.g., extension phase), provide de tailed criteria in this section 
/g120Diagnostic agents: (such as glucose for gl ucose challenge) given as part of the 
protocol requirements must also be in cluded in the dosing data collection. 
An IP, also known as investigational medicina l product in some regions, is defined as a 
pharmaceutical form of an active substance or pla cebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study, including products already with  a marketing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about  the authorized form. 
Study medication includes both BMS-986036 and placebo and is described in Table 5 below. 
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be 
considered as non-IPs.

8.4.2 Study Medication AdministrationParticipants should be instructed to make every effort to administer study medication on 
the same day each week at approximately the same time of day. Each weekly administration will consist of 2 SC injections.
On Day 1 and at the Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, and 40 Visits, study medication will be 
self-administered by the participant or administered by their designee at the study site as part 
of the participant’s scheduled study visits. At those visits, study medication dosing 
should be held until all study-related assessments, including participant questionnaires, vital signs, ECG, AE evaluation, physical examinations, and laboratory sample collection (including trough [predose] PK) have been completed.  
 
 If a study visit occurs on a day 
that is not a planned dosing day, the participan t should continue to administer the medication 
on the planned dosing day; all st udy-related assessments will continue to be performed at the 
planned study visit (in-clinic administration of study drug would not occur).  
 
 
Study medication is blinded and is  supplied in a pre-filled syri nge. Each participant will be 
dispensed a treatment kit containing 2 smaller boxes (for each weekly administration). Each smaller box will contain 1 pre -filled syringe of the medica tion. Both syringes will be 
administered in the abdominal area at diffe rent locations per training guidelines. Study 
medication will be assigned by the IRT system.

applicable) prior to the first administration. At a minimum, the first administration should be 
done by the participant under the supervision of qualified site pers onnel. Training may be 
repeated as necessary at any study visit at th e discretion of the inve stigator to maintain 
treatment compliance. When injections are admin istered at the site during study visits, site 
staff may observe the injection to ensure prop er technique is being employed. Participants 
will be required to capture the date, time, and location of each  injection on the supplied study 
medication administration card.
Specific instructions for study medication adminis tration as well as training materials for 
participants (or caregivers, if applicable) are in the Pharmacy Manual.
8.4.3 Method of Treatment Assignment
After receiving the signed ICF but before any other study-related procedures are performed, 
the investigative site will access the enrollment option of the IRT system for assignment of a 
participant number (including pa rticipants not subsequently randomized or treated). This 
number is assigned sequentially by the system and will be unique across all sites. If a potential participant is rescreened, a new identification number will be used.
Randomization will be  conducted in the following manner: 
/g120Eligible participants will be  randomized by the IRT using a prespecified schedule in a 
double-blind manner to 10 mg BM S-986036, 20 mg BMS-986036, 40 mg BMS-986036, 
or placebo arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio based on the stratification factors specified in 
Section 8.1
/g120The IRT will provide study medication kit num bers that contain the appropriate study 
medication (BMS-986036 or placebo) for dispensation to that participant 
At subsequent study visits as listed in the Schedule of Activities (Section  1), the investigator 
or designee will access the IRT to receive the corresponding kit numbers assigned to the 
participant for the purpose of  dispensing study medication.  
8.4.4 Blinding of Study Medication 
8.4.4.1 Maintaining the Blind
Blinded treatment assignments will be managed using the IRT. All syringes and syringe 
contents (BMS-986036 10 mg/mL, BMS-986036 20 mg /mL, and placebo) are identical in 
appearance. Investigative site staff, sponsor and designee personnel, and participants and their families will remain bli nded to treatment assignmen ts. Study medication will be 
administered in a double-dummy ma nner as described in Section  8.4.2 in order to maintain 
the blind. 
Sponsor and designee personnel may be unblinded once all partic ipants have completed the 
Week 52/PTFU Visit and all data  have been collected through that time point to facilitate 
analyses. Designated sponsor staff may be unblinded (obtain the rando mization codes) prior 
to database lock to facilitate the bioanalytical analysis  of PK samples and immunogenicity. A

external central bioanalytical laboratory) will be unblinded to  (may obtain) the randomized 
treatment assignments in orde r to minimize unnecessary bioanaly tical analysis of samples. 
8.4.4.2 Circumstances for Unblinding 
In the event of a medical emergency or pr egnancy in an indivi dual participant where 
knowledge of the study medication is critical to the participan t’s medical management, the 
blind for that participant may be broken by the investigator. Th e participant’s safety takes 
priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatment  assignment should be 
unblinded. 
Before breaking the blind of an individual pa rticipant's treatment, the investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary (i.e., that it will alter the participant’s 
immediate management). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to the IP, the problem may be properly managed by assu ming that the participant is 
receiving active product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with th e medical monitor, but the inve stigator always has ultimate 
authority for the decision to unblind. The actua l TASK of unblinding can be delegated by the 
investigator to a designee assigned the task on the Delegati on of Authority. The principal 
investigator or appointed designee should onl y call in for emergency unblinding AFTER the 
decision to unblind the partic ipant has been documented. 
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT system. In case of an emergency, the investigator  has unrestricted access to randomization 
information via IRT and is capable of break ing the blind through the IRT system without 
prior approval from the sponsor. After the unb linding, the investigator shall notify the 
medical monitor and/or study director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT Manual. Participant and unblinded treatme nt information and the reason 
for the blind being broken must be recorded on the appropriate study status page of the 
eCRF.
In cases of accidental unblinding, the site should contact the medical monitor and ensure 
every attempt is made to preserve the b lind. Any request to unblind a participant for 
nonemergency purposes should be disc ussed with the medical monitor. 
8.4.5 Study Medication Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability 
The IP should be stored in a secure area accordin g to local regulations. It is the responsibility 
of the investigator to ensure that IP is dispensed only to study participants. The IP must be 
dispensed only from official study sites by au thorized personnel according to local 
regulations. 
The product should be stored in a refrigerator (2 /g113C through 8 /g113C [35.6 /g113F through 46.4/g113F]) and 
protected from light. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of th e study medication 
arise, the study medication should not be dispensed, and the sponsor should be contacted 
immediately.

8.4.6 Dose Modification 
8.4.6.1 Modification of Dose 
No dose reductions or modifica tions are allowed. If a participant interrupts treatment due to 
an AE, study medication may be  restarted after consultation with the medical monitor.
8.4.6.2 Dose Interruption
If a participant has abnormal la boratory test result(s) and/or clinical AE(s) that, in the 
judgment of the investigator, could place the participant at risk, study medication 
administration should be interrupted, and the i nvestigator should notify the medical monitor. 
Participants may receive further study medication when the AE or abnormal laboratory 
finding is resolved.
8.4.6.3 Missed Doses
If a participant misses a dose according to the pr otocol-outlined schedule, the participant (or 
caregiver, as applicable) should administer the dose as soon as possible and continue on the 
original schedule with the exception that 2 doses of medication should not be administered 
less than 48 hours apart. 
8.4.7 Treatment Compliance
Study medication compliance will be monito red periodically using standard drug 
accountability procedures. Drug accountability will be reviewed by th e site study st aff at each 
visit to confirm treatment compliance. If a participant misses 2 consecutive doses (not related 
to an AE/SAE), site staff will discuss discrepanc ies with the participant at each on-treatment 
study visit and counsel the participant of the importance of compliance with the assigned regimen. Participants and/or caregivers (as applicable) may be re-trained in study medication 
administration, if necessary to  address study medication complia nce issues. If the participant 
misses 2 more consecutive doses during the study , the investigator should consult with the 
medical monitor to determine the appropriate course of action for the continued treatment of 
the participant, which may include withdrawal of study medication.

approved or investigational, will be recorded on the eCRF. 
Prior medications are defined as  medications taken prior to the first dose of study medication 
and discontinued before the first dose of study medication. Concomita nt medications are 
defined as any medication ta ken after the first dose of study medication until the Week 
52/PTFU Visit. Concomitant medications (e .g., prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal) 
should be administered during the study only if they are prescribed for treatment of specific 
clinical events.
Restrictions and prohibitions on prior and concomitant medications are described in 
Section 8.3.7.
8.4.9 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the end of the study, the sponsor will not continue to provide sponsor-supplied study 
medication to participants/inve stigators unless the sponsor chooses to extend the study. The 
investigator should ensure that each participant receives appropriate standard of care to treat 
the condition under study. 
The sponsor reserves the right to terminat e access to sponsor-supplied study medication if 
any of the following occur: a) the study is termin ated due to safety concerns or other reasons; 
b) the development of BMS-986036 for treatment of NASH or othe r indications is terminated 
for other reasons, including but not limited to lack  of efficacy and/or  not meeting the study 
objectives; c) the participant can obtain medi cation from a government-sponsored or private 
health program. In all cases, the s ponsor will follow local regulations. 
8.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables 
Study procedures and timing are summa rized in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section  1). 
Waivers or exemptions from prot ocol-required evaluations are not al lowed. 
8.5.1 Efficacy Assessments 
Every effort must be made to ensure that the same evaluator(s) complete the assessment for 
each participant. If the evaluator(s) is unable to complete the evaluation, then a qualified 
individual with overlapping e xperience may perform the eval uation. Documentation of who 
performed the evaluation is to be recorded  in source documents. Assessments should be 
performed at approximately the same time of day throughout the duration of the study. 
Baseline assessments must be performed prior to dosing with study medication. Procedures 
not specified in the protocol that are part of standard care ma y be performed if they do not 
interfere with study procedures; a ny data arising from such proc edures are not to be reported 
in the eCRF.
All efficacy assessments will be completed prior to study medication administration.
Participant questionnaires will be administ ered electronically, and information gathered
electronically (i.e., electronic patient-reported outcome) will serve as the source documentwhere possible.

8.5.1.1 Liver Biopsy 
A liver biopsy will be performed during Screening if no liver biopsy specimen collected 
within 6 months (26 weeks) prior to inform ed consent is available and readable by the 
Central Pathologist.
The on-treatment liver biopsy should be perform ed within ± 7 days of the Week 24 Visit. 
However, if a biopsy cannot be scheduled w ithin the window specified above, the biopsy 
should be performed as close to schedule as possible. For participants prematurely discontinuing study medication, liv er biopsy will be performed 
at ET Visit if the participant has completed at least Week 20 and has not had a Week 24 
biopsy. If a participant discontinues study pa rticipation prior to Week 20 they should 
consider having a liver biopsy at ET. 
Histological assessment of the tissue samp le will be conducted by a blinded Central 
Pathologist. The central reader will be a medi cal doctor, board certif ied in pathology, with 
experience in liver pathology in a clinical study setting.  The on-treatment liver biopsy re sults will remain blinded to site personnel until after the 
study database is locked; incidental findings of potential clinical rele vance (as determined by 
the medical monitor) from the central pathologist will be provided to the investigator. Any incidental findings of potentia l clinical relevance that are not directly associated with the 
objectives of the study should be evaluated and handled by the investigator per the site’s
standard of care and clinical judgment. 
Liver tissue should be collect ed using a 16 gauge (or larg er) cutting needle (e.g., Bard, 
Microvasive, or TruCut) whenever possibl e. Use of suction needles (e.g., Menghini, 
Jamshedi, or Klatskin) are allowed, but may cause fragmentation of fi brotic specimens and 
impede the evaluation of fibrosis, and should therefore be avoided, if possible. At least 2 cm 
length of tissue should be obtained. 
Additional details on the acqui sition, quality requirements, hi stological preparation, and 
shipping of histological samples are in th e Central Laboratory Ma nual and the Central 
Pathology Manual. Histological Scoring

Morphometric Analysis of CPA and Fat Percentage in Stained Tissue 
There is considerable intra- and inter-individual variation of hepatopa thologist assessment of 
fibrosis stage on liver biopsy. Assessmen t of CPA is a method by which the amount 
(percentage) of collagen in stained tissue sec tions is analyzed using morphometric image 
analysis. This allows for a quantitative assessment of fibrosis. Percentage of fat in stained 
tissue sections is also analyzed using mo rphometric image analys is. These morphometric 
assessments will be performed by a blinded Central Pathologist. Additional details on these morphometric assessments are in  the Central Pathology Manual. 
Assessment of NASH and Fibrosis Using Digital Pathology
Liver biopsy samples will be evaluated using digital pathology, which may include automated 
techniques .28

Magnetic Resonanc e Elastography 
MRE is a noninvasive medical ima ging technique that measures the stiffness of soft ti ssues 
by introducing shear waves and imaging their propagation using MRI. In NASH patie nts, 
MRE is reproducible,32and it has a higher interobserver agreement for staging fibrosi s 
compared to histopathology.33Additionally, an improvement in MRE has been associ ated 
with an improvement in liver fi brosis, as observed on liver biopsy.32,33
Images will be collected by the site and submitted to a central imaging vendor for eva luation. 
Sites should be traine d and qualified before collecting study images. 
Detailed instructions on the c onduct of the MRE, and the acqui sition and submission of MRE 
data to the central imaging vendor will be provided in the Imaging Manual. 
The on-treatment MRE results w ill remain blinded to site personnel until after the study

associated with the objectives of the st udy should be evaluated and handled by the 
investigator per the site’s standard  of care and clinical judgment. 
For participants prematurely discontinuing study medication prior to Week 24, MRE should 
be conducted at the ET Visit if the date of discontinuation is more than 4 weeks from the date 
of the previous MRE. For participants pr ematurely discontinuing study medication after 
Week 24, MRE should be conducted at the ET Visit if the date of disc ontinuation is more 
than 8 weeks from the date of the previous MRE.

HRQoL questionnaires will be completed el ectronically by the pa rticipant and data 
transferred as source. Due to potential bias , the questions should not be read to the 
participant. Participan t questionnaires will be assessed at  specific visits throughout the study. 
See Section 1 for details.  
The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire (see  Appendix 6 ) is a general quality-of-life instrument that 
consists of 2 components, health state descrip tion and evaluation. The h ealth state description 
component measures mobility, self-care, usual activitie s, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. Participants will rate their level of impairment in each dimension using a 
3-level scale. In the evaluation component, par ticipants evaluate their overall health status 
using a visual analog scale. 
The SF-36 questionnaire (see Appendix 5)  is a commonly used patient-reported outcome 
instrument used to assess quality of life. The SF-36 is a 36-question instrument, which 
assesses 8 health concepts: 1) limitations in physical activities becau se of health problems; 2) 
limitations in social activities because of physi cal or emotional problems; 3) limitations in 
usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5)  general mental 
health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions.

The CLDQ-NAFLD questionnaire29(seeAppendix 7) is a disease-specific quality-of-life 
instrument for nonalcoholic fatty liver diseas e and NASH. The CLDQ-NAFLD consists of 36 
items in 6 domains: abdominal symptoms, ac tivity, emotional functi on, fatigue, systemic 
symptoms, and worry. Each item is on a Likert scale with 1 representing the most impairment 
and 7 representing the least impairment. 
The questionnaires should be administered prior to dosing and before any other study 
assessments are conducted.
8.5.2 Exploratory Biomarkers 
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of exploratory biomarkers as described in 
Table 8 in Section 8.5.4. Exploratory biomarkers will include the collection of serum, 
plasma,  and whole blood, which will be used to assess markers of fibrosis and 
associated diseases and pathwa ys (including cardiovascular disease, inflammation, diabetes, 
and liver disease as well as kidney disease and bone). Work ma y also include studies on the 
FGF21 pathway and mechanism of action as well as pathways impacted by BMS-986036. 
The goal is to better understand NASH and associ ated diseases/syndromes  and the effects of

Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Acti vities 
(Section 1). All urgent safety concerns must be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if  the participant should continue or disc ontinue 
treatment.
Safety will be assessed using incidence of all AEs; the incidence of SAEs; the i ncidence of 
AEs leading to withdrawal of study medi cation; the incidence of AEs of specia l interest, 
immunogenicity, laboratory data, ECG monitoring, physical examinations, and  monitoring of 
BMD via DXA.
8.5.3.1 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 8.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, s urrogate, or 
the participant’s legally authorized representative).

and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to the sponsor designee within 24 
hours of awareness of the event and in accord ance with SAE reporting procedures described 
inAppendix 8.
The study medication will be permanently disc ontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose 
tapering if necessary for partic ipant safety). Please call the sponsor medical monitor within 
24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. 
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and 
neonatal outcome and, where a pplicable, offspring information must be reported on the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form ( Appendix 2).
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partne r of a male study partic ipant should be reported 
to sponsor or designee during at least 5 half- lives after product administration (5 days) plus 
30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a tota l of 35 days after the end of the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period. In order for the sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partner, the female  partner must sign an ICF for disclosure of 
this information. Information on this pre gnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE 
eCRF page or SAE eCRF page, as appropriate. Paper forms are to be used only in the event 
that the electronic syst em is not functioning.

/g120Any laboratory test result a bnormality that required the participant to have study 
medication discontinue d or interrupted 
/g120Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clin ical rather than laboratory term would be used 
by the reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potentia l DILI event. All occurrences of potential 
DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Appendix 8 for reporting 
details). Repeat laboratory testin g may be performed locally , and the results should be 
promptly communicated to the investigator site.
For the purpose of evaluating a potential DILI, th e Baseline value is defined as the mean of 
the test results from analysis of sample s collected during Screening and on Day 1.

30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 79Note that the evaluation processes below do not replace SAE reporting per defined criteria in 
Appendix 8.
Evaluation of Participants with New Elevations of Aminotransferases and/or Total Bilirubin
Repeat laboratory testing (including ALT, AST, fractionated bilirubin a nd alkaline phosphatase) 
and physical examination s hould be performed within 48-72 hours when:
/g120Participants with normal Baseline aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) values 
develop elevations greater than 3×  the ULN based upon the central lab, or
/g120Participants with elevated Baseline aminotransferase values experience additional 
increases greater than 2× the Baseline (with concomitant elevations of total bilirubin > 
2× ULN) AND ALT and/or AST is > 200 U/L. 
If the new elevations in aminotransferases persist and the participant is symptomatic, then the drug should be discontinued, and the participant should be evaluated for other causes of liver injury or disease. The medical monitor should be contacted within 48-72 hours.
If the participant is asymptomatic, the participan t should be placed under “close observation”, 
defined as physical examination and laboratory evaluation 2-3 times per week.  If close observation is not possible, study medication should be discontinued . The frequency 
of retesting can decrease to once a week or  less if abnor malities stabilize or the study 
medication has been discontinued and the participant is asymptomatic.  
Discontinuation or Temporary In terruption of Study Medication 
In addition to the reasons for discontinuati on described above, study medication should be 
discontinued or tem porarily interrupted if either of the 2 following scenarios occur: 
1)Aminotransferases (ALT and/or AST) > 2× Baseline and aminotransferases > 3× ULN and
either:
i. the increase is accompanied by a concomitant increase in total bilirubin to > 2×
Baseline OR the INR concomitantly increases by > 0.2;
OR
ii. there are concomitant signs and symptoms of new-onset fatigue, nausea,
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (> 5%).
2) Total bilirubin increases to > 2×ULN AND: 
i there are concomitant signs and symptoms of new-onset fatigue nausea,
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever,  rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (> 5%)

30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 80If the above rule is met, a potential DILI wo rk up for competing etiologies (e.g., alcohol 
use, viral hepatitis, biliary obs truction, autoimmune liver dis ease) must be performed, and
a complete liver profile including INR mu st be repeated within 48-72 hours. The medical 
monitor should be contacted within 48-72 hours. Study medication can be restarted only 
if an alternative etiology is definitively identif ied and liver tests (aminotransferases, total 
bilirubin and/or INR) have returned to Baseline.
Other Safety Considerations 
Any significant worsening noted during interim or  final physical exams, ECGs, or any other 
potential safety assessments required or not required by protoc ol should also be recorded as a 
nonserious AE or SAE, as a ppropriate, and reported accordi ngly. ECGs will be read and 
interpreted at the site or by a local reader.
8.5.3.2 Overdose 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a 
product that is considered both excessive a nd medically important. All occurrences of 
overdose must be reported as SAEs (see  Appendix 8).
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should do the following: 
1. Contact the medical monitor immediately
2. Closely monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities for 14 days 
after the overdose
3. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis with in 4 days from the date of the last dose of 
study medication if requested by the medi cal monitor (determined on a case-by-case 
basis)
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the 
eCRF
8.5.3.3 Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations may be performed by a Doctor of Medici ne (MD) or equivalent, or 
someone who is authorized to perform the ex aminations by training a nd has been delegated 
this task by the principal investigator.  
Full examinations a nd abbreviated exam inations will be performed as specified in the

Documentation of who performed the examina tion is to be recorded in source notes. 
8.5.3.4 Vital Signs
Schedules for vital sign collection are provided in Section  1. Vital signs will include heart 
rate, respiratory rate, sitting SBP and DBP (to be taken after at least 5 minutes sitting at rest), 
and oral temperature.
8.5.3.5 Electrocardiograms
Twelve-lead ECGs should be collected at similar times during Baseline and on-treatment 
visits. ECGs may be collected at any time pr ior to study medication dosing or PK sample 
collection. ECGs should be recorded after the participant has been supine for at least 5 
minutes. ECG parameters, including QTcF, will be collected on the eCRF.
If a participant has a QTcF > 480 msec during the Screening Period, it should be confirmed 
by repeat ECG 30-60 minutes after the initial ECG. If the QTcF is confirmed to be 
> 480 msec, the participant should not be allowed to participate in the study. 
If a participant has a QTcF>480 msec at an on -treatment visit, it s hould be confirmed by 
repeat ECG 30-60 minutes after the initial ECG. If the QTcF is confirmed to be >480 msec, 
the medical monitor should be contacted. 
8.5.3.6 Immunogenicity 
Throughout the study, the potential for immunogeni city of BMS-986036 will be monitored as 
indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1). In participants that experience 
immunogenicity, neutralizing activity and exposure-efficacy re lationship will be assessed for 
evidence of a clinical impact on safety and efficacy.
Immunogenicity Assessment Methodology 
Participants will be monitored for an tibodies to BMS-986036 (drug) using an ADA 
homogenous bridge assay with el ectrochemical luminescence det ection. Samples will first be 
screened for potential positive anti-BMS-986036 re sponses. Then, the samples with positive 
anti-BMS-986036 responses will be  confirmed for specificity  using an immunodepletion 
format with BMS-986036 and nonPEGylated dr ug. The reactivity of confirmed positive 
responses will be characterized as “BMS-986036”  (specific to the FGF21 region) or “PEG” 
(specific to the PEGylated region) based on the immunodepletion specificity. Additionally, 
samples with confirme d positive responses will be titrated to determine the relative positive 
response. Participants will also be monitored for antibodies to FGF21 using recombinant Met-FGF21 in 
a homogenous bridge assay with electrochemi cal luminescence detection. Samples will first 
be screened for potential positive anti-FGF21 responses. Then the samples with positive antiFGF21 responses will be confirmed for speci ficity using an immunodepletion format with 
wild-type sequence FGF21. Samp les with confirmed positive an ti-FGF21 responses will be 
titrated to determine the relative positive response.

Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up
All participants will ha ve samples collected for immunogenicity  at 6 months (± 14 days) after 
the Week 52/PTFU Visit. Samples collected from participants may not be analyzed if: 1) participant is not on active drug, 2) participant is  negative for anti-drug and/or anti-FGF21 
antibody titers at the Week 52/PTFU Visit, or 3) participant has ev idence of stable or 
decreasing antibody titers for 2 visits prior to the 6-month posttreatment visit.
Participants with positive anti-drug and/or anti-FGF21 antibodies at the Week 52/PTFU Visit 
and without 2 consecutive stable  or decreasing antibody titers will be followed for up to 14 
months after the Week 52/PTFU Visit (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) until antibody titers decrease for 2 consecutive visits (t hese additional visits will be conducted at 
approximately 9 months and 12 months after the Week 52/PTFU Visit). The sponsor or 
designee will inform the clinical site if a participant needs to re turn for immunogenicity 
follow up beyond 6 months. If, at 12 months afte r the Week 52/PTFU Visit, a participant has 
an increasing titer (compared to the previous titer), an additional follow-up visit will be performed at approximately 14 months (1 mont h is defined as 4 calendar weeks) after the 
Week 52/PTFU Visit; at this visit, anti-drug a nd anti-FGF21 antibodies, as well as additional 
laboratory assessments (basic  metabolic panel, hemoglobi n A1c ), 
will be collected.
Participants who discontinue from the study prior to the Week 48 Visit will be offered 
additional Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up Visits, as above. For these participants, 
prior immunogenicity results will be used to determine whethe r the participant should be 
offered Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up  Visits beyond the 6-month posttreatment 
assessment. Additional Long- Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up Visits should occur 
approximately 9, 12, and 14 months, if applicable (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) 
after their last study visit.
Refer to the decision tree in Appendix 10 for more details regarding Long-Term 
Immunogenicity Follow-Up Visits.

8.5.3.8 Bone Safety by DXA 
Potential effects of BMS-986036 on BMD will be evaluated by DXA scans of the hip 
(including femoral neck) and spine that will be  performed during the Screening Period and at 
the Week 48 Visit (or ET, if applicable) as indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1). 
Participants will return for a follow-up DXA assessment 6 months (1 month is defined as 4 
calendar weeks) after the Week 52/PTFU Visit. DXA may be performed within a window of ±7 days of the scheduled Week 48 (or ET, if applicable) Visit and within a window of ±14 
days of the scheduled 6-month follow-up vi sit. DXA scans will be evaluated by central 
reading. Acquisition guidelines, instructions on calibration and the handling and submission of DXA scans are included in the Imaging Laborat ory Manual. Note that at least one of the 
requested anatomic sites (hip [including femoral neck] or sp ine) must be evaluable for 
participants to be eligib le for the study (See Section 8.3.2).
For participants prematurely discontinuing study medication DXA scan s should be conducted 
at the ET Visit only if the participant has completed at least the Week 16 Visit. If a participant has not completed at least Week  16, the follow-up DXA scan at 6 months after 
PTFU Visit should also not be performed. 
8.5.4 Laboratory Assessments 
Participants should not administe r study medication on the days of clinic visits until after all 
laboratory samples have been collected (see Table 8 below). Blood samples will be collected 
according to the schedule in Section 1. In addition, a number of hematology and blood 
chemistry values collected as part of the safety laboratory assessments will also be used to 
determine FIB4 index, APRI, and NAFLD Fibros is Scores according to the schedule in 
Section 1.
Safety (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinal ysis), efficacy, and exploratory laboratory 
assessments to be conducted during the study are listed in Table 8 below. The schedule for 
collection of samples for each assessment is in Section 1. Laboratory assessments will be 
conducted by central or specia lty laboratories. Additiona l details on the collection, 
processing, and submission of samples for laboratory assessments are in the Study 
Laboratory Manual. If clinically  indicated, repeat laboratory te sting may be performed at a 
local lab.
Investigators must document their review of  each laboratory safety report. A central 
laboratory will perform the safety analyses and will provide reference ranges for these tests. 
Results of clinical laboratory tests performed during Screening must be available prior to 
dosing. 
In addition to those detailed assessments outlined in Table 8 below, serum, plasma and urine 
may be assayed for exploratory markers associated with liver, fibrosis,  or

/g55/g75/g72 /g83/g85/g76/g80/g68/g85/g92 /g72/g73/g73/g76/g70/g68/g70/g92 /g72/g81/g71/g83/g82/g76/g81/g87 /g76/g86 /g87/g75/g72 /g83/g85/g82/g83/g82/g85 /g87/g76/g82/g81 /g82/g73 /g83/g68/g85/g87/g76/g70/g76/g83/g68/g81/g87/g86 /g90/g75/g82 /g68 /g70/g75/g76/g72/g89/g72 /g68 /g149/g20-stage 
improvement (as defined by NASH CRN Fibrosis Score) in fibr osis without worsening of 
NASH or NASH improvement (as defined by NAFL D Activity Score) with no worsening of 
fibrosis at Week 24, as determined by liver biopsy. 
It is planned to randomize approximately 160 participants to 1 of the 4 treatment groups 
(approximately 40 pa rticipants per group), BMS- 986036 10 mg QW, BMS-986036 20 mg 
QW, BMS-986036 40 mg QW or matching placebo QW in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. 
A Cochran-Armitage trend test of  proportions, with an estimated response rate of 15% for the 
primary endpoint for placebo and res ponse rates for BMS-986036 10 mg QW, BMS-986036 
20 mg QW, and BMS-986036 40 mg QW of 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, would 
provide at least 80% power at a 1-/g86/g76/g71/g72/g71 /g302 /g19/g17/g19/g24 (based on the original sample size estimate 
of 160 participants). The fi nal sample size was 197 pa rticipants (see Section 6.2).
9.2 Populations for Analyses 
The following populations are defi ned for analysis purposes:  
Population Description
Enrolled All participants who sign informed consent.
Randomized All participants who are randomized, analyzed as per 
randomized treatment. 
Modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT)All participants who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of study medication, analy zed according to randomized 
treatment. All primary efficacy  analyses will be conducted 
using this population. 
As treated (Safety) All participants who are randomized and receive at least 1 
dose of study medication, analy zed according to treatment 
actually received. This population will be essen tially same as 
the mITT unless a participant received an incorrect treatment, 
i.e., a treatment different from what he/she was randomized to. 
All safety analyses will be conducted using this population. 
9.3 Stratification
Randomization of participants will be stratified by country  (non-Japan versus Japan). 
Participants in countries othe r than Japan will be stratifie d at randomization according to 
/g55/g21/g39/g48 /g86/g87/g68/g87/g88/g86 /g11/g92/g72/g86 /g89/g72/g85/g86/g88/g86 /g81/g82/g12 /g68/g81/g71 /g49/g36/g54 /g11/g148 /g24 /g89/g72/g85/g86/g88/g86 /g33 /g24/g12/g17 /g45/g68/g83/g68/g81 /g72/g86/g72 /g83/g68/g85/g87/g76/g70/g76/g83/g68/g81/g87/g86 /g90/g76/g79/g79 /g81/g82/g87 /g69/g72

9.5.2.3 Methods for Handling Treatment Discon tinuations and Other Causes of Missing 
Data
Participants who prematurely di scontinue study medication will be  expected to complete an 
ET Visit and must continue to be followed for follow-up visits/procedures per the Schedule of 
Activities (e.g., Week 52/PTFU) (see Section 1).
Primary efficacy analyses will include all data that are collected on a participant during the 
study even after treatment discontinuation. All ef ficacy analyses will be performed with the 
mITT population, analyzed according to randomized treatment. 
Additional details for handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP. 
9.5.3 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be performed using the As Treated population. For analysis, all 
treatment-emergent (i.e., occurring after the firs t dose of study medica tion) AEs, SAEs, and 
AEs of special interest will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, and 
treatment. Vital signs , immunogenicity, BMD, and laboratory data will be summarized by 
treatment. ECG abnorma lities, physical examination abnor malities, if pres ent, will be 
summarized.
Responses of anti-BMS-986036 antibodies and anti-FGF21 antibodies will be listed and 
tabulated by treatment and study day. The re lationship between immunogenicity and PK 
and/or PD may be explored. 
9.5.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Trough BMS-986036 serum concentrati ons (in all participants at all visits)  
 
 will be summarized by 
treatment and visit.
The PK data obtained in this study may be co mbined with data from other studies of BMS-
986036 to develop a population PK/P K-PD model. This model will be used to evaluate the 
effects of intrinsic and extrinsic (if applicable) covariates (e.g., immunogenicity and renal 
function) on the PK of BMS-986036 and to determine measures of  individual exposure (such 
as peak, trough, and time-avera ged concentration following a single dose) of BMS-986036. 
Model determined exposur es will be used for exposure-response analyses of se lected efficacy 
and safety endpoints, as appropriate. Details of the pla nned population PK and exposure-
response analyses will be covered in a separate pharmacometric analysis plan and the results 
of the population PK and E-R analyses presente d in a pharmacometric report, separate from

The term ‘participant’ is intended to refer to a person who has consented to participate in the 
clinical research study.
Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
Good Clinical Practice
This study will be conducted in accordance with: 
/g120GCP guidelines 
/g120as defined by ICH guidance 
/g120in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 
2001/20/EC 
/g120United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title  21, Part 50 (21CFR50)  
/g120applicable local requirements
The study will be conducted in compliance w ith the protocol. The protocol and any 
amendments and the participant informed c onsent will receive appr oval/favorable opinion by 
IRB/EC, and regulatory authorities according to ap plicable local regulations prior to initiation 
of the study. All potential serious breaches must be repo rted to sponsor or designee immediately. A 
serious breach is a breach of the conditions a nd principles of GCP in connection with the 
study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the pa rticipants of the study or the scientific value of the study. 
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by edu cation, training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.This study will not use the services of study pe rsonnel where sanctions have been invoked or 
where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, 
debarment).
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opinion from the IRB/EC for the protocol, cons ent form, participant recruitment materials 
(e.g., advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to participants. The investigator or sponsor should also provide the IRB/EC with a copy of the IB or product 
labeling information to be provided to particip ants and any updates.  
The investigator, sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/EC with reports, updates and 
other information (e.g., expedite d safety reports, amendments , and administrative letters) 
according to regulatory requirements or institution procedures.

BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin) Study MB130-068
30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 103Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions
The investigator should not imple ment any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approva l/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/EC (and 
if applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) to study participants.  
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
prior to obtaining relevant approval/favorable opinion(s) the deviation or change will be submitted, as soon as possible to: 
/g120IRB/EC
/g120Regulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by lo cal regulations (per national requirements) 
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB/EC(s) and if applicable, also by local hea lth authority must be sent to the sponsor. 
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB/EC(s) for review and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be  used to obtain consent from 
participants currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) the 
new form must be used to obtain consent from new participants prior to enrollment. 
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB/EC(s).
Financial Disclosure
Investigators and subinvestigator s will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations  to allow the sponsor to submit complete and 
accurate financial certification or  disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 y ear after completion of the study. 
Informed Consent Process
Investigators must ensure that participants ar e clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to 
participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to participants, their legally acceptable 
representatives (as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant 
volunteers to participate.  
The sponsor or designee will provide the inves tigator with an appropr iate (i.e., global or 
local) sample ICF which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP, and applicable

origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Investigators must:
/g120Provide a copy of the ICF and written inform ation about the study in the language in 
which the participant is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language 
must be nontechnical and easily understood 
/g120Allow time necessary for partic ipant or participant’s legally  acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study 
/g120Obtain an ICF signed and personally dated by the participant or the participant’s legally 
acceptable representative and by the pers on who conducted the informed consent 
discussion.  
/g120Obtain the IRB/EC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written ICF and any other information to be provided to  the participants, prior to the beginning of the study, and 
after any revisions are completed for new information 
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, and the participant subse quently becomes capable of making and 
communicating his or her informed consent dur ing the study, consent must additionally be 
obtained from the participant. 
Revise the ICF whenever important new informati on becomes available that is relevant to the 
participant’s consent. The investigator, or a person designa ted by the investigator, should 
fully inform the participant or the participan t’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant’s willingness to continue particip ation in the study. This communication should 
be documented.  
The confidentiality of records that could identif y participants must be protected, respecting 
the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable  to regulatory requirements, the participants’ 
signed ICF and, in the United States, the partic ipants’ signed Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act Authorization.

have direct access to participant records. 
Participants unable to give their written consent (e.g., those with  stroke or severe dementia) 
may only be enrolled in the study with the consen t of a legally acceptable representative. The 
participant must also be informed about the natu re of the study to the extent compatible with 
his or her understanding, and shoul d this participant become capable, he or she should 
personally sign and date the consent form as  soon as possible. The explicit wish of a 
participant who is unable to give his or her wr itten consent, but who is capable of forming an 
opinion and assessing information to  refuse participation in, or  to be withdrawn from, the
clinical study at any time should be  considered by the investigator. 
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study participants are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of  science and society. 
Source Documents
The investigator is responsibl e for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, and attributable, whether the data  are hand-written on paper or 
entered electronically. If source data are creat ed (first entered), modified, maintained, 
archived, retrieved, or transmitted electronically  via computerized systems (and/or any other 
kind of electronic devices) as part of regulated clinical st udy activities, such systems must be 
compliant with all applicable laws and regulations governing us e of electronic records and/or 
electronic signatures. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic 
medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs), AE track ing/reporting, protocol-r equired assessments, 
and/or drug accountability records. 
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform 
regulated activities, such paper records should be  certified copies. A ce rtified copy consists 
of a copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy having all of th e same attributes and info rmation as the original.  
Study Medication Records
The study personnel will account for all study medi cations dispensed to and returned from 
the participant. Study site pers onnel will account for all unused study medications at the site, 
and unused study medication will be  destroyed at the site or returned to the sponsor or 
designee for appropriate destruction, depending on circumstances. Records for study medications (whether supplied by the sponsor, its  vendors, or the site) must substantiate 
study medication integrity and traceability from receipt, preparation, administration, and 
through destruction or return. Records will be reconciled with  existing study medication by a 
study monitor prior to destruction of the product.  Certificates of dest ruction should be signed 
and will be included in the Trial Master File. Records must be made available for review at the request of sponsor/designee or a health authority.

Case Report Forms
An investigator is required to prepare and ma intain adequate and a ccurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and othe r data pertinent to the investigation on each 
individual treated or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from 
source documents and reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source documents or 
the discrepancies must be expl ained. Additional clinical information may be collected and 
analyzed in an effort to e nhance understanding of product sa fety. eCRFs may be requested 
for AEs and/or laboratory abnor malities that are reported or identified during the course of 
the study. 
For sites using the sponsor or designee electr onic data capture (EDC) tool, eCRFs will be 
prepared for all data collection fields with th e exclusion of data collection associated with 
pregnancy, which will be  reported on the Pregnancy Surve illance Form. Spaces may be left

Monitoring
The sponsor or designee represen tatives will review da ta centrally to iden tify potential issues 
to determine a schedule of on-site visits  for targeted review of study records. 
Representatives of the sponsor or designee must  be allowed to visit all study site locations 
periodically to assess the data  quality and study integrity. On site, they will review study 
records and directly compare them with source  documents, discuss the conduct of the study 
with the investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable. Certain eCRF pages 
and/or electronic files may serve as the source documents. 
In addition, the study may be evaluated by the sponsor or designee internal auditors and 
government inspectors who must be allowed ac cess to case report forms, source documents, 
other study files, and study facilities. The sponsor audit reports will be kept confidential. The investigator must notify the sponsor promp tly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory 
authorities, and promptly forwar d copies of inspection reports  to sponsor or designee.  
Records Retention
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must retain all study records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified by the sponsor or designee, whichever is 
longer. The investigator (or head of the study site  in Japan) must contact the sponsor prior to 
destroying any records associated with the study. 
The sponsor or designee will notify the investigator  (or head of the study site in Japan) when 
the study records are no longer needed. If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon desi gnee (e.g., another investigator, study site,

/g16Documented bilateral salpingectomy
/g16Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site pe rsonnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or  medical history interview. 
/g120Postmenopausal female/g16A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 
45 years in the absence of other biologi cal or physiological causes. In addition, 
females under the age of 55 years must ha ve a serum follicle stimulating hormone 
(FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause. 
Note:  Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have 
artificially suppre ssed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a 
physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout periods  below are suggested guidelines and the 
investigators should use their judgment in checking serum FSH levels.  
/g1201 week minimum for vaginal hormona l products (rings, creams, gels) 
/g1204 week minimum for transdermal products 
/g1208 week minimum for oral products 
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as l ong as 6 months. If the serum 
FSH level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time dur ing the washout period, the woman can be 
considered postmenopausal.

Potential
At minimum, one of the highly effective  methods of contraception listed below is required 
during study duration and until th e end of relevant systemic  exposure, as defined in 
Section 8.3.1.
Local laws and regulations may require use of  alternative and/or additional contraception 
methods (e.g., one highly effectiv e method plus another method). 
Contraceptive Methods Classified as Highly Effective

/g120Vasectomized  partner  
A vasectomized partner is a hi ghly effective contraception met hod provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WO CBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
/g120Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered  a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercou rse during the entire period of ri sk associated with the study 
medication. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferre d and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
/g120It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
/g120WOCBPs who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests.  
/g120Acceptable alternate methods of highly effec tive contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP chooses to forego complete abstinence.

a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptiv e methods for participants participating in clinical 
studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be suscep tible to interac tion with the study medication, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissi ble only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IP and other st udy medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, 
alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine  hormone releasing systems are acceptabl e methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when horm one exposures from intraute rine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness

Diagnostic Criteria for Psychoactive Substance 
Dependence
A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or 
distress as manifested by 3 (or more) of the fo llowing, occurring at a ny time in the same 12-
month period: 
1. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: 
a) A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or 
desired effect,
b) Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. 
2. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: 
a) The characteristic withdrawal  syndrome for the substance, 
b) The same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal 
symptoms. 
3. The substance is often taken in larger am ounts or over a longer period than was intended.
4. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use. 
5. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g., visiting 
multiple doctors or driving long distances),  use the substance (e.g., chain-smoking) or 
recover from its effects.
6. Important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced 
because of substance use.
7. The substance use is continued despite know ledge of having a persistent or recurring 
physical or psychological problem that is lik ely to have been caused or exacerbated by 
the substance (e.g., current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine-induced 
depression, or continued drinki ng despite recognition that an  ulcer was made worse by 
alcohol consumption.) 
Criteria for Severity of Psychoactive Substance Dependence:
Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of t hose required to make the diagnosis, and the 
symptoms result in no more than mild impairment in occupational functioning or in usual 
social activities or relationships with others.
Moderate: Symptoms or functional impairment between “mild” and “severe”. 
Severe: Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptoms 
markedly interfere with occupational functioning or with usual social activities or 
relationships with others. 
In Partial Remission: During the past 6 months, some use of the substance and some symptoms 
of dependence.

30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 133Appendix 8 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events: Definitions 
and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-Up 
and Reporting
Adverse Events
Adverse Event Definition:
An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing 
medical condition in a clinical investigation participant after initia tion of study medication 
(BMS-986036 or placebo) and that does not necessa rily have a causal re lationship with this 
treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study 
medication, whether or not consider ed related to the study medication. 
Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an ev ent which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of  existing hospitalization (see 
NOTE below)
NOTE: 
The following hospitalizations are not consider ed SAEs in sponsor clinical studies:  
/g120A visit to the emergency room or other hos pital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an im portant medical or life-threatening event) 
/g120Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
/g120Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
/g120Routine health assessment requiring admission for Baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g., routine colonoscopy) 
/g120Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documenta tion is required in these cases 
/g120Admission encountered for another life circum stance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hosp italization but, based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgmen t, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [e.g., 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the ot her serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above); examples of such events include, but  are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic  bronchospasm; blood dyscr asias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potentia l DILI event. All occurrences of potential 
DILIs, meeting the defined criteri a, must be reported as SAEs.
Potential DILI is defined as:
/g120ALT or AST > 3×ULN
AND
/g120Total bilirubin > 2×ULN, without initial findings of  cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase) 
AND
/g120No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT or AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limite d to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing 
chronic or acute liver disease, or the ad ministration of other drug(s) known to be 
hepatotoxic 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via the study medication is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and poten tial DILI are not always serious by 
regulatory definition, these events  must be handled as SAEs. 
Evaluating AEs and SAEs
Assessment of Intensity
The intensity of AEs is determined by a physician and will use the following level:
/g120Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
/g120Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities

30 January 2020 BMS Confidential 135/g120Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an even; and both AEs a nd SAEs can be assessed as severe.
Assessment of Causality
The causal relationship to study medication is  determined by a physician and should be 
used to assess all AEs. The causal rela tionship can be one of the following: 
Related: There is a reasonable causal rela tionship between study medication administration 
and the AE. 
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study medication 
administration and the AE.  
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
Follow-Up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study me dication or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE re port must be updated a nd submitted within 
24 hours to the sponsor (or designee) using th e same procedure used for transmitting the 
initial SAE report.All SAEs must be followed to  resolution or stabilization. 
Reporting of SAEs to Sponsor or Designee
SAEs, whether related or not related to study medication, and pregnancies must be 
reported to  Drug Safety within 24 hours of awareness of the event.
SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form. For studies capturing SAEs through 
EDC, electronic submission is the required method for reporting. In the event the 
electronic system is unavailabl e for transmission, paper forms must be used and submitted 
immediately. When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.
Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pr egnancy Surveillance Form and transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:

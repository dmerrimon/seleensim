4 A. Study Purpose  and Rationale  
HIV infection remains a significant public health problem especially among men who have sex 
with men  (MSM).  While  MSM  account  for only about  2% of the U.S. population1, they are the risk 
group  most affected  by HIV, constituting  56% of persons  living  with HIV.2  Much  of the increased  
incidence  in HIV has been  reported  among  young  MSM  (YMSM)  and is linked  to high-risk sexual  
behavior.3 Disparities  in HIV incidence exist among racial and ethnic minority groups and a re 
particularly pervasive among younger MSM.4 
At the same time, there remains a dearth of evidence -based HIV prevention interventions for 
diverse YMSM. To address this need, our study, in response to RFA -MD-15-012, leverages mobile 
technology and MyPEEPS, an existing theory -driven, multi -ethnic, group -level, evidence -based 
intervention for dive rse YMSM.5 MyPEEPS (R34MH079707; PI: Garofalo) is a manualized curriculum 
developed by members  of our proposed  Investigative  team  comprised  of 6 modules  focusing  on key 
intermediate  social and  personal  factors,  including  knowledge  (e.g.,  correct  way to use a condom),  
self-efficacy  for safer  sex, interpersonal communication skills and behavioral skills (Appendix A). 
MyPEEPS was tested with 101 diverse  (23%  White,  39% Black,  27% Latino,  12% other)  YMSM,  ages  
16-20 and demonstrated  evidence of  feasibility,  acceptability,  and preliminary  efficacy  in reducing  
sexual  risk behaviors.5 As such,  MyPEEPS is an ideal choice for use in  this RFA as it is one of very 
few interventions in the  literature targeted for diverse YMSM including those under 18 years of age.  
Long -term sustainability  of face-to face,  group -level behavioral  interventions,  such  as MyPEEPS,  
have been problematic for dissemination in at -risk populations, particularly among  young racial and 
ethnic minority groups. In the initial MyPEEPS pilot trial, participants reported that a key difficulty with 
the intervention  was the travel  distance  to access  the group -based  intervention.5 In response  to this 
challenge, we propose to translate MyPEEPS from a face -to-face, group -based curriculum to a 
mobile responsive driven web -based platform, accessible by smartphone or other web -enabled 
devices, to increase accessibility and scalability for dive rse YMSM. The ubiquitous nature of mobile 
phones in daily life , especially  among  13-18 year olds,6 has created  opportunities  for health  
interventions  in a portable  format with enhanced privacy. mHealth approaches to HIV prevention 
intervention have demonstrated great promise to address sexual risk behaviors, promote sexual 
health and to optimize reach to those whose circumstances will not all ow for in person attendance. 
By leveraging mobile technology, the proposed MyPEEPS Mobile intervention will deliver an HIV 
behavioral intervention to diverse YMSM to: 1) reach high -risk YMSM  at a relatively  low cost,7-9 2) 
engage  YMSM  where  they meet  sex partners,10 and 3) enable YMSM to participate privately on a 
computer, tablet, or Smartphone on their own schedule, as opposed to in a structured setting.11 
Using  a participatory  approach,  our study  will incorporate  user-centered  design  in the translation  
of the MyPEEPS intervention onto  a mobile platform. MyPEEPS was tested with older adolescents 
(16-18 year olds)  and prior to the availability  of non-occupational  post-exposure  prophylaxis  (nPEP)  
and pre-exposure prophylaxis  (PrEP);  therefore,  in addition  to the mobile  adaptation,  we will update  
the intervention  content in Aim 1. MyPEEPS Mobile will be delivered through YMSM avatars (e.g., 
caricature or graphic identity), on  a mobile  platform,  whose  profiles  and problems  are based  on the 
formative  research  of the original  pilot trial  as well as the formative  work  proposed  herein,  and who 
manage  their sexual  health  against  a backdrop of personal, family -based, and relational challenges. 
MyPEEPS Mobile will be tested in an RCT with racially and ethnically diverse HIV -negative or 
unknown statu s YMSM aged 13 -18 at four sites: Birmingham  (AL),  Chicago,  New York City, and 
Seattle.  Building  upon  our teams’  extensive  experience  in HIV  prevention, mHealth, behavioral 
interventions, and randomized controlled trials,12-41 the specific aims are to : 
1) Ensure  acceptability  of MyPEEPS  across  diverse  groups  and translate  the MyPEEPS  intervention  
into a  mobile -based intervention for diverse YMSM (13 -18 years).  
2) Pilot test MyPEEPS  Mobile  in a sample  of 40 YMSM  (10 at each  study  site).  
3) Conduct  a randomized  2-group  (intervention,  control)  multi -site trial, with randomization  to two 
groups at  each  site, to evaluate  the efficacy  of MyPEEPS  Mobile  in reducing  male -male  sexual  risk 
behaviors. Our primary ou tcomes will be: total number of sex partners and condomless anal sex 
partners, frequencies  for condomless  anal sex acts,  anal sex with and without  condoms  under the  
5 influence  of alcohol/drugs,  nPEP and PrEP (if FDA - approved for this age group) use and sel f-
reported HIV/STI testing.  
The proposed MyPEEPS Mobile intervention is a novel and evidence -driven intervention using 
mobile technology  to deliver  HIV prevention  information  specifically  developed  for at-risk YMSM.  This 
will be the first  study  to test the efficacy  of a scaled -up, mobile  version  of an existing  HIV prevention  
intervention  originally developed for, designed by, and piloted for, a diverse group of YMSM. If 
efficacious, this behavioral  HIV prevention  mobile  intervention  supports  widespread  dissemination.  
In Summary , this application is significant because: 1) YMSM are at very high risk for acquiring 
HIV, compared  to older  MSM;  2) HIV disproportionately  affects  racial  and ethnic  minority  MSM,  though  
no HIV prevention initiatives have addressed di verse racial and ethnic minority YMSM; 3) MyPEEPS 
pilot data demonstrate evidence of feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in reducing 
sexual risk behaviors.  4) eHealth interventions show efficacy in adult MSM but have not been 
developed for  or tested in adolescents; 5) given the ubiquity and convenience of mobile technology, 
mobile platforms are well - suited to support behavioral interventions and health promotion targeting 
young populations; and 6) based on the  aforementioned significance p oints on the need to conduct 
HIV prevention with YMSM,  and after careful  review  of the original content of MyPEEPS, we believe 
that it is ideally suited for adaptation to a mobile  platform . mHealth interventions for HIV risk reduction 
may be efficacious fo r youth, in general, and high risk  populations  more  specifically,42 and presents  a 
unique  opportunity  to reach  YMSM  organically,  as part of their everyday lives, with their personal 
devices and to disseminate inform ation quickly and broadly.  
 
A.1. Study Design 
Overview. The proposed study is a multisite, mobile technology intervention of 900 HIV -negative or 
unknown status YMSM aged 13 -18 from four U.S. cities (NYC, Chicago, Birmingham (AL), Seattle: 
RFA requirement t o include participants from different US regions ). Participants will be recruited both 
online and offline through social and sexual networking websites and apps, and through local CBOs, 
health centers, schools, and local events. The proposed study will tra nslate an existing manualized 
group -based intervention, MyPEEPS, onto a mobile platform. Consistent with the design of the original 
MyPEEPS  pilot,  avatars  will guide  participants  through  the intervention  components  over a 3-month  
period. Our Primary Outcom es for this study will be: total number of sex partners and condomless 
anal sex partners,  frequencies  for condomless  anal sex acts,  anal sex  with and without  condoms 
under the influence of alcohol/drugs, nPEP and PrEP (if FDA  approved for this age group) use and 
self-reported HIV/STI testing.  
 
A.1.2. Study Sites .  
Each of our sites has the experience and capacity to recruit the specified number of participants for 
this study. Our study sites have strong links to YMSM who are most affected and at -risk for H IV, 
demonstrating their ability to successfully recruit the target number of participants.43-45 We have  
partnered with local scholars in HIV prevention research as well as community based organizations 
that have  experience  in providing  services  to YMSM  (RFA  requirement  for relevant  stakeholders) . 
These  local collaborations will allow us to meet our sample size requirements for the multi -site RCT, 
including adequate recruitment of racial/ethnic subgroups for analysis,  and maximize generalizability 
to practice. A brief  snapshot  of each  of the  geographic  locations  is presented  below.  Further  details  
about  each  site are included in the Facilities and Resources Section, subcontracts, letters of support 
from each site, and biosketches.  
New York City (NYC) (Northeast)  (Schnall,  PI). Approximately  8.5 million  people  live in the 5 
boroughs of NYC, with 1.4 million people living in the Bronx, 1.6 million in Manhattan and 2.6 million 
in Brooklyn. The  racial/  ethnic  breakdown  across all 5 boroughs  is: 44% White,  25.5%  Black,  0.7%  
American  Indian/ Alaskan Native and 12.7% Asian, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.51 
In 2013, there were 117,618 persons living with HIV in NYC. Of these, 43,940 were infected through 
male to m ale sexual contact. Among those infected through male to male sex, the racial/ ethnic 
breakdown is: 30.4% Black, 37.5% White, 28.4% Latino, 2.5%  Asian/  Pacific  Islander,  and 0.2%  
6 American  Indian  and Alaskan  Native.46 We have a number of sites within NYC from where we will be 
recruiting. First, we have partnered with Callen - Lorde Community Health Center (CLCHC; see letter 
of support and subcontract), located across 3 clinical sites and 2 administrative sites in lower 
Manhattan and the Bronx. Its main clinical site is a 27,000 -square  foot, six- story  building  that is an 
ADA-compliant,  fully licensed  New York State  Department of Health Article 28 Diagnostic and 
Treatment Center. In 2002, CLCHC was also designated a Federally Qualified Health  Center.  
Dr. Asa Radix will be leading the recruitment efforts at CLCHC. Of note, CLCHC has a location in the 
Bronx  which is the hardest  hit area of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic  in the country.  The Bronx  is one of the 
most  underserved and poorest areas in the US with 38% of its residents living below the poverty 
line.47 The Bronx has the highest HIV infection rate and death rate from HIV and is higher than in the 
rest of NYC. In fact, nearly 1 in 4 Bronx residents find out they are HIV -positive, find out the same 
day that they have AIDS.48 The Health  Outreach  to Teens  (HOTT)  Program  is the adolescent  
medici ne program  at CLCHC. Since 1989, The  HOTT program has offered a vital link to health care 
and related services for LGBT and questioning youth.  In 2015,  the HOTT  program  had 1415  active  
patients  between  13 and 24 years  of age. Currently there are 157 male p atients, ages 13 -18 years, 
registered in HOTT. This age group is racially and ethnically  diverse;  37% African  American,  29% 
white,  12% multiracial,  6% Asian,  22% unreported;  34% Hispanic. The majority of HIV -negative youth 
at CLCHC are at risk for HIV and STIs. 30 -40% engages in exchange of sex for money or shelter. 
Approximately 70% of HOTT clients use one or more illicit substances, e.g. heroin, crystal 
methamphetamine, cocaine or marijuana. Psychosocial issues facing the target population include: 
homele ssness or unstable housing; history of violence or abuse; mental illnesses (such as 
depression, suicidal  ideation,  feelings  of isolation  and inadequacy);  alcohol/drug  abuse;  unsafe  sex; 
and involvement with the criminal justice system.  
In addition to CLCHC , we have partnered with other community -based organizations and 
healthcare organizations  in NYC.  These  include:  APICHA,  serving  mainly  Asian  and Pacific  Islander  
MSM,  the LGBT Center in lower Manhattan, Ali Forney providing services for homeless YMSM, the  
NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 8 STD Clinics, and Broome Street Academy (a high 
school for students with histories of homelessness/unstable housing, and foster care) (See Letters of 
Support).  
Chicago, IL (Midwest) (Garofalo, MPI) .There are ap proximately 5.2 million people living in Cook 
County with 2.7 million persons living in Chicago. The racial/ethnic breakdown of persons living in 
Chicago is: 45% White,  32.9% Black, 0.5% American Indian/ Alaskan Native and 0.5% Asian.49 The 
2013 rate of HIV infection diagnoses  in Chicago  (40.4  per 100,000)  is approximately  2.5 times  higher  
than the national  rate, and the prevalence  rate for Chicago  (827.9/100,000)  is nearly  3 times  the 
national  rate. In 2013,  22,346  persons in  Chicago  were  living  with HIV. Of those  13,292  were  infected  
through  male  sex with male.  Among  those infected through male to male sex, the racial/ ethnic 
breakdown is: 38.6% Black, 35.5% White, 19.3% Latino,  1.2%  Asian/  Pacific  Islander,  and <1% 
American  Indian  and Alaskan  Native.50 Our main  recruitment  site will be through The Center for 
Gender, Sexuality and HIV Prevention at Lurie Children’s within the Division  of Adolescent  Medicine,  
directed  by Dr. Garofalo.  Additionally,  we will advertise  the study  to the entire hospital system in the 
Chicago area to recruit younger adolescent YMSM and collaborate with community  partners  who serve  
very YMSM,  ages  18 and younger  in both schools  and community -based  environments, including Peer 
Health Exchange, The Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Heath, the Illinois Safe  Schools  Alliance,  and the 
Broadway  Youth  Center  of Howard  Brown  Health  Center  (See  Letters  of Support).  
Birmingham, AL (South) (Mugavero, Site PI) . There are approximately 212,000 people living in 
Birmingham,  AL. The racial/ ethnic breakdown of persons living in Birmingham is: 22.3% White, 73.4% 
Black, 0.2% American Indian/ Alaskan Native and 1.0% Asian. During 2013, over half (55%) of the 
newly diagno sed cases and 43% of the prevalent cases reported male -to-male sexual activity as the 
primary risk factor for infection. The rate of HIV diagnosis among Black males is 6.8 times higher than 
White males in this geographic area .51 We have partnered with Birmingham AIDS Outreach (BAO), a 
community based organization that has a number of innovative efforts to engage and provide service 
7 for high -risk YMSM, such as the Youth Advisory Council, the Unicorn Pizza Club and the Magic City 
Acceptance Center. In addition, Advocates for Youth, a national advocacy and service organization 
that does extensive HIV prevention work with YMSM will use grassroots n etworks specifically working 
with AIDS Alabama in Birmingham to assist with recruitment at this site. The UAB CFAR (Co -Director 
Mugavero) will also be assisting  with recruitment  efforts.  The UAB CFAR  has successfully  recruited  
from this study  population  in and BAO, along with the Alabama Department of Public Health, with Dr. 
Mugavero serving as site PI at UAB.  
Seattle, WA (West) (Pearson, Site PI).  There are approximately 2 million people living in Kings 
County with about  670,000  persons  living  in the City of Seattle.  The racial/  ethnic  breakdown  of persons  
living  in Seattle  is: 69.5%  White,  7.9%  Black,  0.8%  American  Indian/  Alaskan  Native  and 13.8%  Asian.52  
In 2015, there were  4,764  persons  living  with HIV in Seattle  and 7,205  persons  living  with HIV in all of 
Kings  County  (including Seattl e). Of those living with HIV, 67% were infected through male to male 
sexual contact. Among those infected, the racial/ ethnic breakdown is: 61% White, 19% Black, 13% 
Latino, 4% Asian, 1% Native American/ Alaskan Native and <1% Pacific Islander/ Native Hawa iian.53 
Seattle’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender  and queer  (LGBTQ)  youth  are disproportionately  affected  
by homele ssness  with 22% of King County homeless people ages 12 -25 are LGBTQ,54 making Seattle 
an important site for recruiting homeless YMSM.  Our main  recruitment  sites will be through  the 
following  community  based  organizations:  Lambert  House, Chief Seattle Club, Gay City and Seattle 
Children’s Hospital (see letters of support). Dr. David Breland (consultant) will also assist with 
recruitment efforts. He is an adolescent medicine physician at Seattle Children's - the largest 
adolescent medicine program in the city and on the Board of Directors of local  Seattle organizations 
serving the proposed target populations - thus well -poised to assist Co -I Pearson with  recruitment 
activities  in Seattl e. The UW  CFAR  Community Action  Board  will also  be involved  in this project and will 
provide support for building additional collaborations between Drs. Pearson, Breland and community 
members and community -based organizations.  
       Importantly,  the Seatt le site is supported  by the Indigenous  Wellness  Research  Institute  National  
Center of Excellence (IWRI NCE). In 2005, IWRI ( www.iwri.org ) was established under the UW ’s 
Global Health Initiative  with the mandate  to nurture,  develop,  and advance  a universit y-wide 
interdisciplinary  indigenous research institute for health and health disparities research, knowledge 
sharing, and research capacity building with indigenous populations. IWRI NCE has an outstanding 
reputation among tribes and tribal organizations. For example, IW RI NCE partnered with the 
National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), a leading organization for tribal policy development 
and advocacy at the federal level representing over 250 federally -recognized tribes. Native 
community support is ev ident in all of our research and training initiatives.  
In summary , our study  sites have  been  funded  by the CDC,  SAMSHA,  HRSA,  NIH, private,  local 
and State funding sources. The on -site investigators have led projects and have recruited from racially 
and et hnically diverse YMSM communities. We have established formal partnerships with our 
community  based  partners  and academic  sites,  which  demonstrates  our commitment  to working  
together,  our shared  vision for  improving the risk behaviors and health outcomes i n YMSM from 
diverse communities of color . To ensure  a smooth  collaboration,  research  team  and CBO  partners  
from each  site will participate  in an in person meeting in Year 1 of the study. The meeting will include 
a review of the current MyPEEPS intervention  (See Aim 1) to identify areas in need of cultural adaption 
to ensure that MyPEEPS Mobile is acceptable across racial/ethnic groups. The meeting will follow 
with research team on monthly web -ex meetings or more frequent if needed. Each year, Drs. Schnall 
or Garofalo will travel to the other study locations (Seattle or Birmingham).  
 
A.2. Adaption of the MyPEEPS intervention to a mobile platform .  
Our goal in this project is to update and translate  the current  MyPEEPS  intervention  content  into a 
mobile  delive red intervention  via a web app. The current MyPEEPS content, components and how it 
will be adapted is included in Appendix A. Table 1 is also  a sample  of the current  content  and how it 
will be adapted  to a mobile  platform.  Each  of the sessions from the ori ginal MyPEEPS will be converted 
into a module which will be comprised of a number of components  to operationalize  the existing  
MyPEEPS  curriculum.  To illustrate  MyPEEPS  Mobile  will include didactic content, interactive quizzes, 
8 graphical reports, videos, c hecklists, and to do list tools. The home screen  of MyPEEPS  Mobile  will 
have  a menu  of the 6 modules  that will need  to be completed  in consecutive order. We estimate that 
each module will take 60 -90 minutes to complete. Participants do not need to complete  a module in a 
single sitting.

We have  partnered  with Little  Green  Software  (LGS)  to create  the mobile  platform  via a modular  system. 
The modular system55 will allow us to modify the intervention content after initial deployment as future 
efficacious behavioral intervention components are identified. As technology is rapidly changing, it is 
important to use a  flexible development environment so  that rapid changes can be made to the 
intervention content at a relatively  low cost.  Our mobile  system  will be developed  as a web-app. Using  
responsive  web design,  the conventional  web site is viewable  on small  screens  and works  well with touch  
screens.  On a smartphone, a web -app appears and functions very similarly to a native app to the end -
user. A web -app allows for media content that could not  be included  in a native  app and is flexible  for 
use across  multiple  devices.   
Summary  of Mobile Adaptation.  After careful  review of the  existing MyPEEPS  curriculum we 
believe it to be ideally suited for mobile adaptation. The mobile intervention will simulate a group - 
based  “feel” including  “mock” participants and comparison of participant responses to those of ot her 
YMSM.
9  Figure  1. Screenshot  of MyPEEPS  Mobile  Module  #4. Activity:  The ABCs  of Feelings  
 
 
The learning activities in each session will be adapted to mobile format, using automated responses, 
drop-down menus, videos and games to engage the participant  in the learning activities. Consistent 
with the original curriculum, the mobile Much like the current group - based in -person version of 
MyPEEPS, these characters will present scenarios to open each session and end with a “cliff 
hanger” to engage participa nts and motivate participation in the next  session.  The team  at LGS has 
worked  with members  of our investigative  team,  (Drs.  Schnall,  Kuhns, Hidalgo) to develop the vision 
for the technical components of this intervention (see Appendix A for examples  of mobile adaptation  
approaches  for activities  in each  module  and sample  screenshots).  A team of software engineers and 
project managers at  LGS will perform the software development that will be required for this study. 
LGS is uniquely qualified to build the te chnical components of the system. We anticipate  that 
MyPEEPS  Mobile  will be novel,  innovative,  scientifically  sound,  scalable,  translatable,  and highly  
acceptable;  thus,  it is likely  to have  a strong  public  health  impact.   
 
A.3. Participant inclusion and e xclusion criteria for all Aims .  
To participate  in any aspect  of the study,  participants  must  be: between 13 and 18 years of age; self -
identify as male , non -binary, and/or genderqueer ; male sex assigned at birth; understand and read 
English; live  in the US and its territories ; own or have access to a mobile device (e.g. smartphone or 
tablet) ; self-report ed attraction to males and/or a history of sexual activity or interest to engage in 
sexual activity with other males in the next 12 months;  and self-report  HIV-negative  or unknown  
status.  
We carefully considered the inclusion of transgender youth or YMSM that identify along the 
transfeminine  spectrum  but decided  against  it based  upon  our extensive  clinical  and research  
experience with  this population.  The underlying  mechanisms  of risk that lead to the acquisition  of HIV 
are considerably different for transgender youth in comparison to the YMSM age 13 -18 that this RFA 
seeks to target.56 As one example, the literature on HIV acquisition and risk among young transgender 
women suggests that engagement in commercial sexual acts is a leading factor for the acquisition of 
HIV. In one study, young transgender women ages 16 -24 with a history of engagement of commercial 
sex had a 23% prevalence of  HIV versus  6% among  those  without  a history  of commercial  sex 

10 engagement.  This risk factor  is far less prevalent among YMSM. More to the point, the construct of 
commercial sex for transgender youth is complex in that it may affirm a gende r identity for youth who 
often have difficulty identifying sexual or romantic  partners  as well as providing  strong  financial  
incentives  (particularly  for condomless  anal sex) for a population of young people who face extreme 
degrees of economic marginaliza tion.57 Simply stated, YMSM  ages  13-18 do not experience  the same  
social  forces.  As such,  we do not believe  MyPEEPS  Mobile (or any behavioral intervention) can be 
adequately culturally responsive to the HIV prevention needs of both adolescent YMSM and young  
transgender  women  or those  who ident ify along  the trans -feminine  spectrum.58-61 
Participant  exclusion  criteria. Males  are ineligible  to participate  in the trial if: 1) they are HIV 
positive; 2) investigators determine that participation may be detrime ntal to the participant or to the 
study (e.g., severe cognitive deficit); or 3) they participated in the pilot phase of the project.  
 
B. Study Aims  
 
B.1. Specific Aim 1: Using qualitative methodology and usability assessments, update and 
translate the MyPEEP S intervention into MyPEEPS Mobile for diverse YMSM.  
MyPEEPS was built on considerable formative work with multi - ethnic groups (R34MH079707; 
PI:Garofalo). Pilot findings have been peer  reviewed and published.62 We will continue to honor 
cultural difference while identifying common themes, concerns, and HIV risk and protective fact ors 
expand MyPEEPS and ensure its’ acceptably as a multi -ethnic intervention. This will be done through 
reviews and continual feedback by our expert panels’ and though focus groups from our end -users. 
This formative work focuses on translating the MyPEEPS intervention onto a mobile platform.  
The goal of this Aim is to translate the information from the current curriculum into an interactive 
mobile app  which  will include  the following  components:  games,  True/False  and multiple  choice  
quizzes,  videos. Using  a community -based  participatory  approach,  we will create  the user interface  
for MyPEEPS  Mobile through participatory design sessions and usability evaluations. Schnall and 
Pearson have successfully used  participatory  design  sessions  in developing  mHealth  interventions  for 
culturally  diverse  groups.16,17,19 
Purpose:  The goal of this panel  is to validate  language,  images,  formatting/visual  cues,  and examples  
and reach censuses on common concerns, risk and protective fac tors. 
Procedures:  At the start of our study,  we will hold a 1 day virtual  meeting  with the research  team  to 
review the curriculum, highlight areas where panel members’ feedback will be most beneficial, and to 
review project timeline and deliverables. Two w eeks after the virtual meeting, we will hold a 2 day in 
person and community leader expert panel members listed in Table 2. Experts or Co -Is who are not 
able to travel for the in -person meeting will participate via WebEx.

Through engagement with our scientist and community leader expert panel members we will identify 
language, images, formatting/visual cues, and examples in the current MyPEEPS curriculum that 
require cultural  consideration  for each  racial/ethnic  group.  We will work  with members  to incorporate  
diverse  views and reach censuses on common concerns, risk and protective factors, while providing 
a succinct mobile app respectful of cultural diversities. Dr. Schnall will facilitate the review of the 
MyPEEPS curriculum, assisted by Dr. Garofalo. The curriculum will be displayed on a screen, and 
each section read and discussed. Questions will probe for appropriateness, specific examples for a 
younger group and content to ensure that it is relevan t to local conditions including: rural populations, 
American Indians, Pacific Islanders, African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans. As a multi -
ethnic intervention particular feedback will be elicited by end users and experts with expertise 
targeting Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indian and Alaskan Native MSM, as they were not 
represented in the MyPEEPS pilot. Dr. Pearson  who has considerable  expertise  working  with these  
populations  of YMSM  will take notes  inserting changes  directly  into the curriculum  viewed  on the 
screen,  supplemented  by note-taking  by study  support staff and audio -recorded. This allows us to 
confirm meaning, make revisions as necessary, and reach consensus with the group. Dr. Garofalo 
will also monitor for cultural differential s, probe for further discussion  on feasible  ways  forward  and to 
ensure  that it meets  the current  HIV prevention  guidelines.  As a final step, we will send out the final 
version of the MyPEEPS content to the expert panel to review after the meeting and retur n any 
comments or additional edits within 2 weeks.  
The MyPEEPS Mobile system will be developed in English only. Despite the inclusion of a 
diverse population,  recent  census  data showed  that among  15 to 19 years  old, 83% of those  who 
spoke  Spanish and 81% o f those who spoke a language other than Spanish spoke English “very 
well,’ and among 5 -14 year olds,  English  “very  well’.  These  numbers  suggest  that >80%  of our 
target  population  who speak  a language other than English are still able to speak English very well. 
After the Expert panel meeting, revisions will be incorporated into the MyPEEPS curriculum and 
then we will conduct regional in -depth interviews with YMSM to obtain their feedback.  
B.1.2. In-Depth Interviews  with YMSM 
Purpose  1: The goal of these  in-depth  interviews  is to work  with YMSM  to design  the user interface  so 
that MyPEEPS Mobile will be usable for our intended end -users.  
interface  so that prototypes  can be created  at the end of the design  sessions.  
Recruitment:  For this component of the study , we will recruit up to 20 YMSM from each of our sites 
(New York, Chicago, Birmingham, and Seattle). We will recruit YMSM through flyers (Appendix C) 
and information cards, and through referrals from local agencies, organizations, and other study 
participa nts. Sample: We will conduct individual in -depth interviews.  Using purposive sampling, we 
anticipate that a total  of 40 participants  will be an adequate  number  of participants  to reach  saturation  
based  on our earlier studies  focusing  on similar  topics.32 Proce dures:  Participants  will receive  $25 as 
a token  of appreciation for  their time during  the 90 minute  in-depth  interview.  Food  appropriate  for time 
of day will be served  during the interview. As in our previous work development of technology for HIV 
preventi on and management,17,30,32,63 all interviews  will be audio -recorded.  The interviewer  will take 
notes.  If the participant  is unable  to visit  the study  team  in person,  interviews  may be conducted  via 
phone  or Skype.  In this instance,  a verbal phone assent will be collected. We will first explain the 
12 purpose of the project as well as the existing MyPEEPS intervention. We will ask structured questions 
related to areas of content that need further development or updating from the original MyPEEPS 
curriculum  as well as functionality and dosing: 1) Over  what  time period  would  you complete  a 
module?  2) How long do you want  to spend  using  MyPEEPS Mobile each day, week? 3) At what time 
of day are you most likely to use  MyPEEPS?  4) To inform  recruitment  for our trial, we will ask what  
websites  and apps  potential  participants use. Following  these  questions,  we will ask each  group  to 
sketch  a user interface  of the desired  mobile  app. Participants  will be asked  to describe  the 
organ ization  of the content  and features  and the desired  “look” of the user interface they would want 
to see in an app. After participants share their ideas, we will ask probing  questions  to stimulate  
discussion  about  the content,  features,  and interface  design . Participants will also be asked to identify 
platform requirements and navigational features.  
Transcription:  All design  sessions  recordings  will be transcribed  verbatim  through  a transcription  
company. Any identifiers will be deleted from the audio and re moved from the transcript. Data 
Analysis: The study team  will meet  and review  transcripts  and notes.  Drs. Schnall  and Hidalgo17,21,62 -64  
who both have  experience in qualitative analysis will work with two research assistants to code the 
transcripts. Field notes and transcripts will be analyzed by the researchers using NVivo™ (QSR 
International, Victoria, Australia) software.  Participants’ statements will be captured using memoing 
and then sorted into the categories of interest. Open  coding  will be used  to develop  initial  data 
categories.  Some  codes  will be derived  from the questions included  in the interview  and other  codes  
will emerge  from themes  and patterns  identified  in the narratives. An initial set of codes wil l be 
independently generated by two coders. Codes will then be compared and synthesized to result in 
shared coding categories and sub -categories, all with definitions, inclusion and exclusion  criteria,  and 
examples.  Coders  will discuss  discrepancies  until they reach  consensus.  The study team  will also 
develop  a set of use cases  based  on the end-users  plans  for use of MyPEEPS.  A use case is  a list of 
steps,  typically  defining  interactions  between  an end-user and a system  to achieve  a goal.65 The study 
team will meet and review transcripts, notes, and drawings from the second focus group session and 
create a paper prototype of the sy stem to give to our development team at Little Green Software 
(LGS). Scientific Rigor: The team will adhere to qualitative research processes to ensure the 
credibility, confirmability,  dependability  and transferability  of the qualitative  data from these  analyses.  
To support  the credibility of the data, we will conduct peer debriefing. We will also use “member 
checks,” i.e., sharing of initial data interpretations with participants to ensure accurate interpretations. 
Triangulation of findings, along with ref lexivity, will enhance the confirmability of the interpretations. 
The investigators will carefully record an audit trail and keep extensive field notes to facilitate 
transferability of study findings into other contexts.  
 
B.1.3. Development of mobile deliv ery technology.  
Following the in -depth interviews, we will develop mock - ups of a MyPEEPS Mobile with our partners 
at LGS. The mockup will have partial functionality of Garofalo and Hidalgo to develop the vision for the 
technical components of this interv ention. A team of software engineers and project managers at LGS 
will perform the software development and the text messaging platform that will be required for this 
study. LGS is uniquely qualified to build the technical components of the MyPEEPS Mobile s ystem. 
The Columbia University team will have a dashboard to monitor the delivery of the MyPEEPS Mobile 
intervention. MyPEEPS Mobile will be novel, innovative, scientifically sound, scalable, translatable and 
likely to have a strong public health impact, a s detailed in the Innovation section.  
 
B.1.4. Refinement of the MyPEEPS Mobile user interface.  
Following the development of MyPEEPS Mobile, we will conduct Usability Evaluations.  
Usability  Testing.  The goal of usability  evaluation  is to improve  the design  and increase  the 
likelihood of  technology  acceptance.  We will evaluate  the user interface  and system  functions  of 
the MyPEEPS Mobile  System  developed  at LGS and assess  whether  they are consistent  with the 
end-users’  needs. We  will conduct  two types  of usability assessments:  A) Heuristic  Evaluation  and 
B) End-User  Usability Testing.  
13 B.1.4.a Heuristic  Evaluation.  
Sample: Five informaticians with training in human -computer interaction and who have published in 
the field  of informatics  will be recruited  as usability experts.  Nielsen  recommends  using  three  to five 
evaluators since  one gains little additional information by using larger numbers.66 We will recruit them 
through direct contact  from the Informatics  Departments  at Columbia  University  and Weill  Cornell  
Medical  College,  both of which have large cadres of informatics researchers. Procedures:  The 
usability experts will be provided with a Beta version of the MyPEEPS Mobile Intervention. Similar to 
procedures that we have used in our prior  work,31,39,67,68 each  usability  expert  will be asked  to evaluate  
the system  using  the Heuristic  Evaluation Checklist (Appendix B) and to think -aloud while performing 
the usability testing.69 The process will be recorded using Morae software™ (Techsmith Corporation,  
Okemos, MI).70 Participants will be asked to  say aloud what they are thinking, seeing and trying to do 
while they are performing the tasks required for the scenarios. If a participant is silent for a  long time, 
the researcher will remind them to think out loud. When a user finds errors or the resear chers finds 
critical incidents that are characterized by comments, silence, or looks of puzzlement, the researcher 
will record the users’ activities. Recording the users’ interactions and vocalizations provides 
additional feedback that can highlight proble ms that would not be identified with static screen shots.71 
Instrument: Nielsen72 proposed a list of ten recommended heuristics for  a usable  interface  design.  
Bright  et al.73 developed  a Heuristic  Evaluation  Checklist  based  on Nielsen’s ten heuristics.69 Each 
heuristic will be evaluated by one or more items and the overall severity of the identified heuristic 
violations will be rated. Data Analysis: The frequencies of usability issues will be calculated  according  
to the heuristic  principles  adapted  from Nielsen’s  checklist.  Mean  severity  scores  will be  calculated  for 
each  heuristic  principle.  Evaluators’  comments  about  usability  problems  on the evaluation form and the 
Morae recording will be grouped and content analyzed according to the usability factors of Nielsen’s  
heuristics.74 Based  upon  the findings  of the heuristic  evaluation,  the user interface  of the website and 
the messaging system will be refined by LGS.  
 
B.1.4.b. End -User Usability Testing.   
We will conduct usability testing with YMSM to identify violations of usability principles and any 
potential obstacle to their effecti ve use of the MyPEEPS Mobile system. This is an iterative process 
that involves testing the system and then using the results to change it to better meet users' needs.  
Sample: We will recruit 20 YMSM (13 -18 years) in NYC, Chicago, and Birmingham, AL to 
participate in the  formative  evaluation  of the prototype  user interface  screens.  In a study  
examining  benefits  of increased sample sizes in usability testing, researchers found that the 
minimum percentage of problems identified rose from 82% up to 95% when th e number of users 
was increased from 10 to 20.75 Procedures: Participants will use MyPEEPS Mobile in our usability 
lab. All participants will be provided  with scenarios and asked to complete tasks using MyPEEPS 
Mobile system on a laptop. While they are doing  the tasks,  their eye movements  and laptop  
screen  will be recorded  using  iMotions  eye tracking software  (i.e. Tobii  X2-30). During  each  task,  
the start and stop times  of tasks  will be also measured.  After completing the tasks, they will be 
asked to think aloud and verbalize their thoughts about the tasks they completed,  through  a replay  
of the screen  recordings.  Participant’s  reactions  and verbal  comments  will be video  and audio  
recorded.  As part of the usability  assessment,  participants  will complete  electronic  participants  
will be compensated  $40 for their time.  
Instrument: We will measure self -reported ease of use and usability with the Health Information 
Technology  (IT) Usability Evaluation Scale (Health -ITUES).76,77 This tool varies from most 
traditional measurement scales  in that it is designed to support customization at the item level to 
match the specific task/ expectation and health IT system while retaining standardization at the 
construct level. The  Health -ITUES  supports  evaluation  of three  levels  of task/expectation:  user-
system,  user-system -task, and  user-system -task environment.  Schnall  has published  on the 
usefulness  of the Health -ITUES  for eye tracking recordings of user sessions, transcriptions, notes, 
and the user surveys and mean task performance  time will be calculated.  Dr. Schnall  will search  for 
14 critical  incidents  which  will be characterized by comme nts, silence, and repetitive actions. Schnall 
will review these incidents in detail using iMotions eye tracking software. The incidents will be 
identified and the users’ written comments summarized. Content analysis, a technique for making 
replicative and valid inferences from data, will be performed by the research assistant under 
Schnall’s supervision. The comments will be categorized according to the positive characteristics, 
negative characteristics, and recommendations made by the end -users. Results fr om the 
standardized  surveys  will be analyzed  using  SPSS  (IBM,  Armonk,  NY) to calculate  the descriptive 
statistics to complement the findings from the usability assessment. Using the findings from these 
activities, we will refine MyPEEPS for use in the pilo t study (Aim 2) and the RCT (Aim 3).  
 
B.2. Specific  Aim 2: Pilot test MyPEEPS  Mobile in a sample of 40 YMSM (10 at each study site). 
Purpose : The goals of the pilot study are to: a) Gain direct feedback from participants about whether and to 
what degree th e MyPEEPS Mobile system worked as intended; b) Assess the acceptability of MyPEEPS  
Mobile  dosing  and content  across  diverse  YMSM;  and c) Observe  the flow of procedures, including 
assessment at baseline, retention efforts, data management, and follow -up ass essments.  
Study  Design : The pilot study  will be a 6 week  pre-posttest  design  with 40 MSM  across  4 sites. 
Recruitment : We will recruit a convenience sample using mixed approaches including both  active and 
passive recruitment methods described below. We will  also use snowball sampling, a nonprobability 
sampling technique where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their  friends,  to 
identify  additional  participants  until the desired  number  is recruited,  as our study  team has completed in 
their previous work (See Table 4). Each man approached will be given a project information card or 
flyer that provides contact info for the study site and basic information regarding the  study.  Study  team  
members  will complete  the pre-screening  form for active recruitment  in outreach (via REDCap or paper 
form if no WiFi available) (Appendix C).  
Participants may also complete the pre -screening form online via REDCap. Potential participants will 
be given information about the general nature of the study trial,  the time involved (number of visits 
and approximate length of time: 1.5 -2 hour survey completion at baseline and 6 -week follow -up). We 
will be compensating participants for time and travel: $35 for baseline visit, and $45 for 6 -week visit, 
+ $25 per modul e completed  ($25 x 3 modules  = $75 max)  = $155  total max compensation.  The visit 
compensation is graduated and consistent with payments in prior studies.  
 
B.2.1.  Pilot Study Cohort:  
We plan to recruit 10 participants from each site (Birmingham (AL), Chica go, NYC, Seattle) by posting 
flyers at our local partner sites (See letters of Support). We may also use online recruitment including 
posting on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and/or Grindr.  
 
B.2.2. Screening :  
Upon arrival at the enro llment visit and prior to written informed consent procedures (described 
below), all individuals will be screened for eligibility in a private location. This will confirm  that the 
participant  walking  in is the same  as the participant  screened  and scheduled  when  recruited,  and to  
re-assure  eligibility  for participation  in the study.  They  will provide  verbal  informed  consent  to 
participate in a brief screening interview also as described above. Individuals who screen eligible will 
then complete written inform ed consent procedures. Those who do not screen eligible will be 
informed and thanked for their  time.   
 
B.2.3. Written Informed  Consent  Process  for Study Participation.   
We will use written  informed consent/assent procedures for enrolling YMSM into the pilo t study . At the 
first visit, participants will be  handed  an informed  consent  form and the study  staff will read 
the form to them.  To ensure  study  procedures.  The informed  consent  form provides  details  of the 
study  procedures,  risks,  benefits,  site contact  information,  and the nature  of confidentiality  and 
voluntary  participation.  The consent  process  also covers information on the  trial timeline, task 
15 involved, and compensation for time as outlined in the Screening section above. Before a participant 
signs t he informed consent form, staff will answer any questions. Participants will be given a copy of 
the informed consent form for their records.  
 
B.2.4. Secure Web -based Baseline Assessment .  
After providing written consent, the participant will complete the b aseline assessment on a computer 
or tablet in a private location. The baseline assessment consists of a ~1.5 -hour web -based survey 
with demographic and outcome measures listed in Table 3 (Appendix B). These measures have all 
been previously used and tested  in studies with adolescents and YMSM and were tested in our the 
MyPEEPS pilot study.5 We are using a web -based survey software package (Qualtrics). Benefits to 
Qualtrics78 include  data being  captured  directly  in electronic  format  and interactive  data capture  checks,  
beneficial in a large multi -site trial as it will allow for secure and consistent data capture across sites. 
Qualtrics is a web -based system that provides an intuitive interface, audit trails, and automated export  
and is free  through  Columbia  University.  Staff at each  site will sign-in to the secure  web-based  data 
collection survey tool, provide the participant with preliminary instruction on its use, and will remain 
easily accessible during  survey completion to address any technical problems or to answer questions 
participants may have.  Staff may periodically check in with the participant to inquire about any 
difficulties  that may arise  in completing  the survey,  breaks  and snacks  will also be provided.  However, 
to ensure privacy , the staff person will not directly observe  the full proces s of completing the survey 
unless requested by the participant.  
 
B.2.5. Intervention  Delivery.   
Participants  will have  6 weeks  to complete  the MyPEEPS  Mobile  modules.  The research  assistants  at 
each  site will monitor  the progress  of their participants.  Study staff will have access to a dashboard which will 
only list the study participants at their site and monitor module completion. In addition, participants will 
receive weekly text messages and/or e -mails (participants will select) to remind them to comp lete the 
MyPEEPS module. If 2 weeks have passed and a participant has not  completed  any modules  then study  
staff will call participants  to remind  them  to complete  their modules. After  consenting  to participate  in the 
study  and completing  the baseline  surve ys, the research  assistant  at each  site will download  the MyPEEPS  
Mobile  app to the participants’  smartphone  and give the participant a username  and password. Each 
module is estimated to take about 60 -90 minutes.  Study  participants  can log in at their conv enience  and will 
not be able to access  the next module until  the previous  module  has been  completed.  Participants  cannot  do 
more  than 2 modules/week  and will receive a token of appreciation for completing each module. Each 
participant will have a login and  password and to prevent his parents from being able to login to the 
application and view its content. The benefit of reducing sexual risk behaviors in our study population 
outweighs the potential harm of parents overseeing their child’s use of the MyPEEPS  application.  After 
logging into the MyPEEPS Mobile, participants will be guided through the curriculum by Phillip aka “P”. 
MyPEEPS avatars represent “regular guys” like the study participants who will walk the participants through 
the curriculum. At the s tart of each module, a MyPEEPS character will present his Peeps  Problems.  In the 
pilot,  there  were  4 MyPEEPS  characters  (Figure  4) who were  
designed  based  upon  the social  realities  of YMSM based on our 
formative work. They include: Art (Artemio) has a girl friend who 
doesn't know that when Art says he's with "the guys", he's really 
"with" guys. Art uses the pull out method when having sex with  his 
girlfriend  and only uses  condoms  with guys,  since  he believes that 
"only gay people get AIDS." Philip  (a.k.a. "P ") recently came out as  
Bi to his close  friends,  and is looking  to meet  guys  to hang  out with. 
Philip isn't out to his family and most of his friends because he 
knows they will not accept him. Nico is completely out and proud, 
but sometimes  struggles  with feeling  like he’s juggling  between  two 
races. He loves dude/bros (White, preppy, frat types). Tommy lives 
with an older  guy who helped  him get on his feet when  he first came  
to the city. Though Tommy is healthy and lives in a great Figure 4. MyPEEPS characters  

16 neighborhood, he’s not h appy. His boyfriend’s jealousy keeps Tommy from meeting other guys his age. A 
scenario from the life of one of the Peeps lives will be presented  at the beginning  of each  module.  A sample  
scenarios  is: A couple  that comes  into my restaurant pretty often ask ed me if I wanted to have a three -way 
with them. I would have sex with her AND him, but I’m not sure how I feel about doing it at the same time. 
Am I missing the opportunity of a lifetime? Should I do it?  As part of our formative work in this application, 
we will add additional characters from other racial/ethnic minority groups.  MyPEEPS  Mobile  will have  a 
menu  of the 3 modules  that will need  to be completed  in consecutive  order. We  estimate  that each  
module  will take 60-90 minutes  to complete.  Participants  do not need  to complete a module in a single 
sitting.  
 
B.2.6.Secure Web -based Follow -Up Assessment.  
After 6 weeks, the site staff will meet with the participants to complete a follow -up assessment which will 
include the primary and secondary outcome asse ssments that we plan to use in the full trial (Appendix 
B). To complement the quantitative assessment, we will conduct in - person debriefing interviews with 
participants following the assessment. Prior to the debriefing interview, participants will be able  to 
review the MyPEEPS Mobile modules on their phones or a tablet at the site. During the interview, staff 
will review each module with the participant and ask followup questions pertaining to relevance, self -
efficacy, comprehension, and technical difficul ties in understanding the topic areas. The interviews will 
be recorded and transcribed verbatim through a transcription company. Any identifiers will be deleted 
from the audio and removed from the transcript. The goal is to collect critiques of the materia l, content, 
delivery methods, and to identify subject matter that should be included to enhance relevance and 
efficacy. We will also ask participants to make suggestions for improving MyPEEPS Mobile and to note 
which features they liked and disliked. Lesso ns learned from the pilot study will include if there are 
changes needed to how frequently we send text messages, changes to our outcome measurement 
tools, and training on how to use MyPEEPS Mobile and best practices for recruitment and retention. 
The proc edures for the full trial will be modified as necessary based on the pilot findings.  
 
B.2.7. Young Adult Pilot: Pilot Test MyPEEPS with 19 -25 year old MSM (n=10 at each of 2 sites: 
NYC & Chicago)  
We will pilot the MyPEEPS  Mobile  app with young  adults  ages  19-25. 
 
Sample: We will recruit 20 YMSM (19 -25) in NYC (n=10) and Chicago (n=10) to participate in the 
pilot testing  of the MyPEEPS  App. Participants  will be recruited  using  flyers  and online  posts.  
Participants  will be screened to determine eligibility.  
 
Procedures: Participants will complete all 21 activities within the MyPEEPS app in -person at the study 
visit. Participants will also complete an electronic survey via Qualtrics following the testing of the app. 
Participants  will also answer  interview  quest ions about  the app, which  will be audio  recorded.  The visit 
will take  approximately  3-4 hours  and participants  will be compensated  $125  for their time.  The audio  
recording will be transcribed, and any identifiable information removed.  
 
B.2.8. Multi-site Focus Groups: Conduct Eight Sessions with Female Assigned at Birth (FAB) 
Trans Masculine & Gender Non -Conforming Youth, 13 -18 Years Old, to Assess the Relevance  
and Adaptability of MyPEEPS Mobile  
Objective : We will conduct multi -site focus groups with femal e assigned at birth (FAB) adolescents 
who identify as female -to-male (FTM) and along the trans masculine spectrum or as FAB gender 
nonconforming, ages 13 -18, in order to assess the relevance of the MyPEEPS Mobile app and better 
understand how the app would  need to be adapted for this population.  
Sample: We will conduct eight multi -site focus group sessions with up to 60 trans masculine and 
gender nonconforming youth, approximately 6 -12 participants per group. We will conduct 1 focus 
group in Birmingham, 2 i n Chicago, 4 in NYC, and 1 in Seattle. Participants will be drawn from the 
group of youth who  screened  through  our MyPEEPS  Mobile  RCT,  but were  ineligible  because  they 
17 indicated  female  sex assigned at birth. We will also flyer to recruit the rest of the st udy sample if we 
cannot enroll enough individuals using the MyPEEPS Mobile RCT screener. Participants will be 
screened online through REDCap  or over the phone  using  a pre-enrollment  screening  form by the 
research  staff to determine  birth; 1) identifying as  female  to male (FTM), transgender man/male, 
trans masculine, or FAB gender nonconforming/non -binary; 2) understand and read English; 3) live 
in the US; 4) have smartphone; 5) self  report sexual interest in non  transgender (cisgender) men and 
has either ki ssed non -transgender (cisgender)  man or thinks  they will have  having  sexual  activity  with 
a non-transgender  (cisgender)  man in the  next year;  6) and self-report  HIV negative  or unknown  
status.  Participant  exclusion  criteria  includes:  1) younger  than 13 or older  than 18 years  of age; 2) 
male  sex assigned  at birth;  3) identifying  as (cisgender) to a smartphone or tablet; 4) are living with 
HIV; 5) investigators determine that participation may be detrimental to the participant or to the study 
(e.g., severe co gnitive deficit).  
 
Procedures : Following completion of the electronic informed assent/consent process, participants will 
be asked to: 1) complete the 21 activities within the MyPEEPS Mobile app in -person using their 
phones or tablets provided at the site before the survey 2) complete an electronic survey via Qualtrics 
after completing the MyPEEPS Mobile app but before the focus group session; and at the end, 3) 
partake in a focus group session which will be 1 -1.5 hrs in length and audio recorded. The PIs, who 
have conducted focus groups for a number of studies in the past, and their research team members, 
will convene groups with study participants and act as facilitators .30,31,63,67 The focus group guide will 
includ e questions pertaining to the relevance, self -efficacy, comprehension, and technical difficulties 
in understanding the topic areas of MyPEEPS Mobile app. Furthermore, the guide will be informed 
by the feedback and commentary from members of our investigati ve team who have extensive clinical 
and research experience working with transgender youth. Some of the sample focus group questions 
include: 1) ‘Thinking back about the information you learned from the MyPEEPS app, how would you 
apply this  information/les sons/activities  in your own life?’;  2) ‘How  do the MyPEEPS  activities  reflect  
your beliefs, norms,  values?’;  ‘In what  ways  do you think  this app would  be relevant  or irrelevant  for 
young  trans  and non -binary adolescents ages 13 -18?’; 4) ‘How would you chan ge the app to make it 
relevant to young During the focus groups, participants will be able to refer their notes taken while 
they completed MyPEEPS  Mobile  activities.  We will also ask participants  to make  suggestions  for 
improving  MyPEEPS Mobile  and to note which  features  they liked and disliked.  The goal is to collect  
critiques  of the material, content,  delivery  methods,  and to identify  subject  matter  that should  be 
included  to enhance  relevance and adaptability.  In length,  all research  activities  related  to the focus  
groups  are expected  to take approximately  4-5 hours. Participants will be compensated $150 as a 
token of appreciation for their time.  
 
The team  will adhere  to qualitative  processes  to ensure  the credibility,  conformability,  and 
dependability, a nd transferability  of the qualitative  data from theses  analyses.  To support  the 
credibility  of the data,  we will  conduct  peer debriefing  and triangulate  findings  across  multiple  data 
sources  (surveys,  focus  group data). In addition, we will use “member che cks,” i.e., sharing of initial 
data interpretations with participants, to ensure accurate interpretations. Triangulation of findings, 
along with reflexivity, will enhance  the confirmability  of the interpretations.  The investigators  will 
carefully  record  an audit  trail and keep extensive field notes to facilitate transferability of study 
findings into other contexts (Guba, 1981). Each  focus  group  audio  recording  will transcribed  and 
any identifiable  information  removed.  Transcripts will be analyzed independe ntly for content by 
research team members in these methods.  
 
Data  Analysis : Field notes and transcripts will be analyzed by the researchers. Participants’ 
statements will  be captured  using  memoing  and then sorted  into descriptive  thematic  categories.  
These  activities  will result in a greater understanding of relevance, adaptability, and development of 
MyPEEPS Mobile with FAB trans masculine and gender non -conforming adolescents, 13 -18 years 
18 of age. 
 
B.2.9. Pilot test a MyPEEPS  Art Contest to Involve Native and Indigenous  Youth in the 
Design of MyPEEPS Mobile recruitment material.  
 
Objective : The MyPEEPS Art Contest will use a community participatory approach to involve 
American Indian  and Alaskan Native youth in the MyPEEPS Mobile  project  recruitment  materia l. 
The contest  will be used  to select  four pieces  of original  art that will become the basis of 
additional recruitment materials for the project.  
 
Procedures : 
• We will use existing recruitment channels in order to aid in advertisement of the contest: (a) 
Tribal health organizations; (b) Indigenous community organizations; (c) Community members 
who support Indigenous youth; (d) Other youth serving community organizations; (e) Social 
media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, etc.) The MyPEEPS Art Contest flye r (attached to 
the protocol) will be used for all advertisement of the contest. People and organizations 
contacted by the MyPEEPS staff will be asked to display the flyer or share the flyer’s information 
within their own networks. The flyer will be adapted  to for digital display and distribution in social 
media platforms. Promotion of the contest will last three months,  during which time any youth 
artist who meets the eligibility criteria may submit and electronic version of their artwork through 
the REDCap  website hosted at the University of Washington. Once the three -month period is 
complete, there will be a one -month voting period prior to the selection of the winning pieces.  
• For the art submission process, we plan to use the University of Washington’s RE DCap system 
to capture contestant entries. In REDCap, contestants will have the ability to respond to the 
eligibility questions,  enter  their contact  information  and submit  an electronic  copy  (.PDF,  
.PNG,  .JPEG,  or .GIF files) of their artwork (REDCap quest ions attached to the protocol). It 
was determined that an electronic art submission during the three -month contest period is the 
simplest way to ensure there are low -to-no barriers in youth accessing the contest. Electronic 
versions of original drawings, p aintings, mixed media, and digital art will be accepted.  
• Art Contest Eligibility:  To be eligible, contestants must meet the following criteria: (a) Be 
between the ages of 13 -18; (b) Self -identify as American Indian, Alaska Native, Native 
Hawaiian or from a nother Indigenous community  
• Selection of Art Contest winners includes a two -phased approach to selecting four winning art 
pieces: (1) Phase One – Open Voting: use a popular -voting method to select the top ten art 
pieces from all those submitted at the clos ure of the advertising/submission period. Once the 
submission period  is over,  we will upload  the submitted  art pieces  to REDCap  to track  voting  and 
rankings  of the art pieces. The link will be shared with the same contacts and communication 
channels used t o advertise the art contest and will be available for one month for voting. At the 
end of the voting period, the top ten selected pieces will be brought to a MyPEEPS judging 
panel who will determine the final four winners;  
(2) Phase Two – Panel Judging (Se lection of the four winners) The MyPEEPS judging panel 
will consist of members of  MyPEEPS project staff, coordinators & investigators, as appropriate. 
The MyPEEPS judging panel will  select  and rank the top four submissions.  The judging  criteria  is 
as follows: (a) The art work  fits with  the overall  contest  theme:  Native  sexual  minority  youth  
empowerment;  (b) the appropriateness of the art work: no overt sexual images are used and content 
reflects the contest participant target age range (13 -18 years); (c) th e art work incorporations key 
aspects of the MyPEEPS study which are as follows: male  identified health, youth, identity, culture 
and technology. The top four winning artists will be notified via email or phone that their art work 
has been selected and wil l be asked to complete  an ownership  agreement  form (see Media  Release  
Form  attached  to the protocol)  that will grant ownership to the MyPEEPS Mobile Project / Columbia 
University, University of Washington and its assignees and licensees to use their submit ted art work 
19 and name. Once the ownership agreement form is signed, we will publicly announce the four 
winners.  
• Only contestants whose art is selected as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th place will be provided a monetary 
compensation. No additional compensation will be provided to contestants who do not place.  
The dollar  amounts  for winning  are per piece  of art, not per person.  If a single  piece  of art was 
submitted by more than one person (a group piece), only one prize amount will be rewarded. 
The identified prize a mounts are as follows: (a) first place - $500; (b) second place: $250; (c) 
third & fourth place:  $125/each. Once selected, the MyPEEPS staff will provide each winner 
with the appropriate monetary compensation and pay to ship the original pieces from the 
contestant to the University of Washington.  
 
C. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a randomized 2 -group multi -site RCT to evaluate the efficacy of 
MyPEEPS Mobile intervention to reduce HIV risk behaviors in 900 YMSM at 4 study sites.  
 
C.1. Overview of the Study Design.   
The purpose of the multi-site RCT is to test the efficacy of MyPEEPS Mobile as compared to 
delayed intervention arm. In comparison to a traditional 2 -arm RCT, our study design includes an  
intervention and delayed intervention group with multiple post - tests in the case of the intervention 
group and multiple pre -tests in the delayed intervention group. Using the proposed design, we have 
larger statistical power to detect a difference in intervention effects and we can compare between  
 
 
 
the intervention,  since we have additional data points we have additional power to detect significant 
differences between both the intervention and delayed intervention group as well as a pre -posttest 
difference  within  groups.  The multiple  data points  that we will collect  from our delayed  intervention  
group before  exposure  to the intervention  will allow  us to control  for selection -history.  This is 
particularly  relevant for  in the case  of a mobile  intervention  since  the mobile  app marketplace  is rapidly  
evolving  and changing  and so a new HIV prevention app may enter and/or leave the marketplace 
during our study. We will be able to control for this historical bias with our study design. While we 
have systems in place during our randomization to control for assignment bias, thi s threat to validity 
can still exist. Since both groups will receive the intervention, there is a mitigated risk for assignment 
bias.90 Finally, we will be able to assess the 3 and 6 month effect of the intervention. The intervention 
outcomes are based on the content of the MyPEEPS  Mobile  intervention  and match  those  from the 
MyPEEPS  pilot.  The study  design,  assessments, and intervention delivery time points are delineated 
Figure 5. Study design timeline, assessment points and intervention delivery time points  
20 in Figure 5. The trial includes screening, baseline assessment, a 3 month MyPEEPS Mob ile 
intervention and 3 and 6 -month follow -up assessments. Recruitment for the study trial will last 
approximately 2.5 years.  Participants will be able to attend the baseline visit in person or can set up 
a video chat (eg. skype, zoom, facetime call) throug h which we will verify participants identity and 
then we will send them a link to the e -consent form, baseline survey and login for the app.  
 
C.2.Sampling  approach  to successfully  enroll YMSM participants  in this national  project.  
We will  recruit 900 part icipants. We will no longer be limiting our participants to these study sites  
and have  expanded  to include  study  participants  from across  the US. Using  active  and passive 
recruitment methods, the on -site project  coordinator at each site will oversee and pa rticipate in 
recruitment efforts. The study staff hired through this project, on -site coordinator and the peer -to-
peer networking efforts at each site will be used to recruit study participants. Each of our sites have 
previously participated in recruitment  efforts for projects similar to the one proposed here and will be 
able to successfully recruit the study sample for this project.  Our study  participants  will all have  face-
to-face contact  with our study  staff as a means  to verify participants’ identity.  In order to accomplish 
this using an online sample, we will verify participants’ identity using video conferencing (i.e. Zoom).  
Note : As per the RFA,  we will ensure  that we have  an adequate  number  of participants  in each  age 
group (e.g., 13 year olds) to co nduct valid sub -group analyses. Based on our power analysis, we will 
recruit at least 70 participants in each age.  
 
C.3. Procedures for Maximizing Research Integrity.  
To Maintain Blind Assessment, we will collect data through electronic surveys on tablet computers. 
Interviewers will remain in the room to ensure comprehension. Electronic survey completion offers 
several advantages: (1) It yields more accurate responses than face -to-face interviews about 
sensitive topics. (2) Participant can complete measure s at their own pace. (3) Questions are 
answered privately increasing anonymity. (4) The interview structure permits  skipping  follow -up 
questions  when  the stem  is answered  negatively.  (5) Computer  delivery  ensures uniform 
administration. Procedures for  Maxi mizing Retention. We will use multiple strategies to reduce 
attrition.79,80 At baseline and follow up interviews, we will update contact information and encourage 
ongoing communication. We will offer multiple remind ers via text, email or calls, based on participants’ 
preference. To ensure follow -up assessments can be conducted for those who move, we will provide 
access  to the assessment  via link into a secure  server,  where  data is encrypted  at entry  and no 
identifier s are collected.  
 
C.4. Description  of study population.   
The study  population  will consist  of a diverse  group  of YMSM  who live  across  the US. Each  site will 
recruit  an ethnically  and racially  diverse  sample  to include  Blacks/African Americans,  
Hispanics/La tinos,  American  Indians/Alaska  Natives,  Asian  Americans,  Native  Hawaiians  and Other 
Pacific Islanders. We will also recruit “special populations” as described in our letters of support 
including: homeless youth and substance users. Race/ethnicity as well a s these other special study 
populations (homeless or unstably housed, foster care, substance use) will be monitored throughout 
the study and recruitment will be adjusted and targeted with the intent of recruiting enough 
participants from each designated US  health disparity population in sufficient numbers to conduct 
valid subgroup analyses.  
 
C.5.Sample Size and Power Calculation . 
We estimated the statistical power for the primary outcome of: number of condomless anal sex acts 
with male partners during the p ast 3 months (count outcome) based on the data from the MyPEEPS 
pilot study (R34MH079707). We estimated the statistical power for  two scenarios:  (1) to examine  
overall  effect  with total subjects;  and (2) to conduct  stratified  analysis  to examine the effect s in some 
subgroups (such as by sex and/or for some racial/ethnicity subgroups). The following assumptions are 
used for the power estimation: (1) an 80% retention rate, at a single follow -up assessment for each 
21 study arm;  (2) a conservative and high intra -cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.8, (3) mean number of 
unprotected anal sex  acts with male  partner  partners  with whom  a condom  was not used  during  the past 3 
months  at the baseline is 1.2,5 (4) all power estimations a re based on α=0.05 and 2 -sided tests.  
Findings  from our MyPEEPS  pilot study  indicate  that the post-intervention  number  of condomless  anal 
sex acts  during  the past 6 weeks  decreased  by 63%,  or a relative  risk (RR)  of 0.37.5 However,  the 
large  effect was not statistically significant. Because the estimated effect size of the intervention was 
unreliable, instead, we  use RR=0.73, one standard error over the estimated RR of 0.37, as the effect 
size for the examination  of overall  effect  of intervention  for total sample.  This would  provide  a 
conservative  estimation of  minimum  sample  size need.  For the subgroup  analyses,  we use the effect  
size of RR=0.37.  To examine overall  effect  with total subjects,  we expect  that the post-intervention  
number  of unprotected  anal sex acts 27% (i.e., RR=0.73). We will have 97% power to detect such 
difference for the total sample size of 700. To  test absolute  relative  difference  (the equivalent  margin)  
of <10%  for the outcome  with n=700.  Second ly, for the stratified analyses, we will have  92% power to 
detect a relative risk of 0.37 in subgroups with sample size of 70. As per the RFA, we will have 
adequately powered comparisons that can be done separately for racial/ethnic groups, age (by year), 
geographic region (Northeast, South, Midwest and West),  and socioeconomic  status.  In order  to 
achieve  this, each  subgroup  will need  to have  about  10% of the total subjects. For example, we 
anticipate recruiting 70 American Indians across all sites so that we will have enough power to detect 
a significant effect of the MyPEEPS Mobile intervention (See Planned Enrollment Table). To test 
whether the intervention is effective during the follow -up period, we will have 61% power to detect an 
absolute relative dif ference (the equivalent margin) of <10% or 95% power to detect  an absolute  
relative  difference  of <15%  for the outcome  with n=70.  However,  we will increase  target enrollment to 
n=900 to provide a better possibility of reaching the above indicated sample si zes for each subgroup.  
 
C.6.Sampling Approach.  
Our multi -site RCT sample will be a convenience sample through active recruitment  at other  venues  
including  CBOs,  schools  and through  social  networking  sites.  We considered other sampling options 
such as “onl ine only” that might have for instance allowed for the recruitment of a “national” sample - 
but in our experience this type of recruitment would have proven very challenging particularly  in 
reaching  racial  ethnic  minority  youth  in sufficient  numbers.  As such we believed  a multi -site RCT 
grounded in 4 geographically distinct center was the best approach to take for testing the proposed 
mobile intervention.  We will enhance our recruitment method to include recruitment through social 
networking  sites utilizing  a “national”  sample  as social  networking  sites extend  to individuals  outside  
the 4 main city -centers and we are therefore able to recruit an ethnically and racially diverse sample 
of YMSM.  
 
C.7.Recruitment Approach.  
We have successfully used these recrui tment strategies in the past with YMSM  in the cities  selected  
for this project.  Dr. Hirshfield  will provide  guidance/input  on the development of the online recruitment 
procedures as well as implement the day -to-day interaction with our online partners duri ng the 
recruitment period. In addition, PHS staff will facilitate communication between the study team and 
online vendors/partners based in the four recruitment cities.  
 
C.7.a. Recruitment Venues.  
Planned offline and online recruitment venues include the following: Community Outreach : Peer 
outreach staff will directly approach and recruit potential participants from local  beaches,  parks,  
gyms,  coffee  houses,  clubs,  house  balls,  and social  establishments  that cater  to or are frequented 
by YMSM in the four c ities. In community venues that cater to YMSM, trained, staff will approach 
potential participants, describe the study, and obtain oral consent or assent to screen for eligibility.  
 
Community  Presentations : Across  sites,  study  staff will attend  and/or  make  presentations  about  the 
22 study at  selected  activities  and social  events  sponsored  by our community  partners.  When  making  
presentations at  selected  events,  the recruiter  making  the presentation  will provide  a brief background  
on the study,  and invite  all po tential participants  who are interested to speak to one of the study 
recruiters. With permission from local high schools, we will conduct community presentations and 
provide study flyers; thus far, we have letters from Broome Street Academy and Peer Health  
Exchange. We will also seek approval to present at LGBT events sponsored by programs such as 
Planned Parenthood.  
 
Department  of Health  Clinics,  Medical  Clinics,  and FQHCs : The study  sites have  strong  ties to the 
public health community and will be able to  advertise for the study in various clinics that serve the 
target population. Specifically, Columbia University and PHS will be able to advertise via flyers for 
the NYC study site at  Columbia  University  Medical  Center,  as well as NYC  DOHMH  STD and HIV 
clinics (please  see Letters of Support),  and APICHA  which  serves  racially/ethnically  diverse  MSM  with 
an emphasis  on Asian  and Pacific Islanders  (See  Letter  of Support).  Chicago  is equally  well-
connected  to health  clinics  and youth  resources such as the Peer H ealth Exchange (e.g. Chicago 
public schools), the Broadway Youth Center of Howard Brown Health, Illinois Safe Schools Alliance, 
Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, TPAN, BYC, Northwestern on Belmont, U of C Medical, South 
Side Health Center, and VIDA/SI DA. The Alabama site will  recruit  from their main  CBO  in 
Birmingham,  Birmingham  AIDS  Outreach,  through  Advocates  for Youth  Birmingham. Seattle has 
strong relationships with Harborview public clinic and STI/HIV clinic, and Gay City community 
LGBTQ center.  
Newspaper  Advertisements:  We will advertise  the study  through  the placement  of ads in a variety  of 
free newspapers widely distributed throughout cities across the four study sites.  
 
Craigslist  Advertisements:  We will post free daily ads on Craigslist  
 
Socia l and Sexual Networking Web sites and apps : We will recruit participants online through various 
websites and apps including but not limited to Instagram and Snapchat which are frequented by youth. 
We will now include  ads that will target the entire US and not limited to our 4 local study sites. We will 
target and recruit study participants through Facebook, which allows targeting of individuals down to 
age 13. For Facebook,  we will use psychographic  targeting  (in-depth,  publicly  available  consumer  data 
such  as interests, city) to advertise only to potentially eligible individuals across the US.  
 
Blogs  and YouTube : We will approach  bloggers  to advertise  for the study  on sites like: 
ShadeRoom.com or LoveBScott, and will buy ad space on YouTube for the channels  with ‘famous 
YouTubers’ that resonate with our target populations.  
 
Media Sites: The study will set up an Instagram profile to promote the study and we will also advertise 
through outlets like Tumbler, Periscope, and Snapchat.  
 
CBOs/ASOs NYC Email Blast : PHS’s Contracting and Management Services division has served as 
the "Master Contractor" for NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) -funded Ryan 
White Part  A programs.  On behalf  of the NYC  DOHMH,  PHS currently  administers  $105  million,  
represen ting >150 CBOs and ASOs, hospitals, clinics, and mental health clinics. In past studies, PHS 
has contacted the NYC CBOs and ASOs ( via a confidential email list ) that receive Ryan White HIV 
prevention and treatment funding to freely advertise for NYC studie s using study -approved flyers and 
brochures, and proposes to do so for this study.  
 
Dedicated  Study  Website: This site will present basic  content about the  study  and contain  a secure  
link (via REDCap) for participants to indicate their interest in particip ation.  Participants who leave 
23 their contact  information  via the website  will be contacted  by study  staff to be screened  for eligibility.  
Eligibility screening will only be done over the phone, online, or in person, not via email or text 
message.  
 
Online St udy promotion via Social Networking Sites: The study will establish and monitor social 
networking accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat) that will run during the study 
recruitment period and will promote the study among users who are 13 -18.99 years  old (based on 
social networking profile information). Study staff will post daily mass media content relevant to 
YMSM as well as intermittent study promotion content, and create paid advertisement campaigns 
promoting the social networking accounts. Study -specific promotional content will consist of IRB -
approved language. All user private  messages  or comments  related  to study  participation  will be 
addressed  by the study  staff through the use of IRB -approved scripts that provide study screening 
instructions.  No pornographic content or material suitable for adults aged 18 and over will be 
posted.  
 
C.7.b. Potential Problems/Alternative Solutions Regarding Recruitment:  
Consistent with the multiprong recruitment approach designed to reduce recruitment bias,81 we will 
employ the aforementioned  recruitment  methods.  To ward  off potential  recruitment  problems,  our 
team  will carefully monitor each approach to prevent recruitment problems. This will involve weekly 
review of recr uitment data with recruitment staff to assess efforts. In this way, recruitment will be a 
dynamic process and will reach the proposed diverse group of YMSM.  
 
C.8. Online Study Procedures  
We plan to enroll  900 13-18 year old male  youth  across  the U.S..  We will recruit  potential  participants  
using both online social networking and sexual networking websites (e.g., Facebook, Grindr, 
BlackGayChat, Scruff, and new sites identified by pilot participants in Aim 2). Social networking and 
sexual networking sites  are accessible  to individuals  across  the US and do not require  individuals  to 
live in a particular  city to access the information within.  We will recruit through these networks using 
an open platform which will allow  us to reach  potential  participants  from all 50 states  and not limit us 
to a particular  city/state.  Utilizing these open access platforms will allow us to expand the range of 
participants we can reach.  Potential participants who click on an online survey banner advertisement 
will automatically be l inked to the study landing page on REDCap that contains a consent form. 
Potential participants will be required to read the informed consent document before indicating 
whether or not they consent; this will be encouraged by requiring participants to scroll  through the 
entire consent before they can choose to consent to the study. During the informed consent process, 
the minimal risks, the anonymous and voluntary nature of participation, and the fact that participants 
can stop their participation at any time  are described. Clicking the consent button will indicate that 
the participant has read  the consent form and agrees to participate. A button to allow participants to 
print the consent form for their records will be located at the end of the consent form do cument. We 
will provide our email and phone number contacts on the consent form in case  participants  have  
further  questions  about  the study.  Potential  participants  can exit the website  at any time by closing 
their browser. Consent or lack thereof will be d ocumented in the electronic database by the stored 
variable indicating consent or lack of consent.  
Although Federal regulation requires that researchers obtain written informed consent for research 
on human  subjects,  under  45 CFR 46.117(c)  written  consent  can be waived  for research  that involves  
minimal risk to participants and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required 
outside of the research context. This research meets that criterion. We propose an alternative 
approach where pa rticipants click a button, signifying that they have read the informed consent page 
and agree to participate  in the study.  An advantage  of internet -based  studies  is that the consent  form 
is available  for the subject to review and/or print at any time. This  strategy complies with the 
requirement of 46.117(c) that participants are given a written statement describing the research and 
24 risks. We have used these procedures without a known adverse event in 6 previous Internet studies, 
enrolling thousands of parti cipants online.  
 
Once online consent is provided, potential participants will complete a brief online screener survey 
(provided in English) to determine study eligibility. Potential participants will have the option to 
complete the online survey on their c omputer, Smartphone, or tablet. If ineligible, the individual will 
be automatically routed to a webpage that thanks them for their time and states that they are not 
eligible at this  time.  The webpage  will contain  links to national  and local prevention  resources,  such  
as HIVtest.org, CDC.gov, and http://www.teenhealthandwellness.com/static/hotlines.  
 
C.8.1. Eligibility screening.  
Potential participants will either call, text or email th e project via the project phone  number  or email  
address;  or, if contact  information  is gathered  at the recruitment  venue,  be called, texted or emailed 
by project staff. Screening will be conducted over the phone, online, or in person for walk -ins; 
screenin g will not be conducted by email. Each potential participant will be screened for eligibility  
using  the full screening  instrument.  If a parent  is present  at the time of potential  study  recruitment or 
enrollment, such activities would only take place in a p rivate location away from their parents. At the 
same  time,  the risk of negative  parental  involvement  is mitigated  if a parent  is at the health  visit with 
their child at a community health center such as Callen Lorde Community Health Center, as they 
are hea lthcare and related services providers targeted to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender 
communities. If a parent is accompanying a child to a visit at a community health center with this 
focus, it is likely that the parents are already aware of their ch ild’s sexual health practices.  
 
The following verbal script is a guide to describe the screening process and privacy issues, as outlined  
in Appendix  C: "Hi. I work  with [e.g. Callen -Lorde  Community  Health  Center]  on a research  study 
called  MyPEEPS  Mobile.  Have  I reached  <insert  name>?  The study  will involve  (number  of 
appointments  questions. It will only take a minute or two. Some of the questions are personal. Your 
involvement is voluntary, your responses will be kept private, and you can refuse to answer a question 
or stop at any time. Information we gather from you will not identify you individually. Are you 
interested?” The full screening  will only take a few minutes  (Appendix  C). If a potential  participant  is 
screened  and found  eligible and  willing  to participate  then he will voluntarily  provide  written  informed  
consent.  Contact  information  will be destroyed if youth decline study participation; however, a count 
of ineligibles and declines (active and passive) will be maintained. Secured information abou t those 
who participated in the pilot phase will be referenced during trial enrollment in order to verify that they 
indeed did not participate in the pilot. If it is determined during trial enrollment that a young person 
participated in the  pilot, they wil l be deemed ineligible to be in the trial and cordially told so.  
 
C.8.1.a. Secondary  Screening  to Confirm  Eligibility  
Participant eligibility will be confirmed in person prior to obtaining informed assent/consent.  For 
participants  who are enrolled  online,  we will also use a form of video  conferencing  (eg. Zoom,  etc) so 
that participants can show an ID and verify their identity.  
 
C.8.2. Informed  assent/consent.   
Upon  arrival  at the enrollment  visit we will collect  written  informed  consent (18 year olds) (ass ent for 
13-17 year olds) for enrolling men into the study trial (See Protection of Human Subjects and Inclusion 
of Children).  The informed consent form provides details of the study procedures, risks, benefits, site 
contact information, and the nature of c onfidentiality and voluntary participation. The consent process 
also covers information on the trial and compensation for time. A baseline visit will be conducted 
involving a behavioral assessment (see questionnaires in Appendix A). The baseline assessment  is 
expected  to last approximately  1.5-2 hours  and participants  will be given  $25 as a token  of 
appreciation  for their time.  YMSM  will then be randomized  to the intervention  or delayed  intervention  
25 arm. 
 
C.8.3. Randomization to intervention and delayed int ervention study arms.  
Using the randomization approach described below, there will be random or minimally biased 
assignment of subjects to study  arms.  to We will use block randomization for this study,82 stratified 
by site and each category of study participants  with have  randomly  permutated  blocks  to reduce  
opportunities  for selection  bias we will use a variable permuted randomization block design where 
the block size itself is randomly selected (i.e., blocks of four to eight). The advantage of the 
permuted block design is that treatment assignment is predetermined before the trial begins  and 
then assignment remains static throughout the course of the trial.83 Blinding and random assignment 
will be maintained through continuous supervisio n by key members  of the research  team.  All staff,  
and participants  will be kept blinded  to outcome  measurements during data collection.84 This 
technique will maintain complete randomness of the assignment of a subject to a particular group. 
Participants will be randomized based on the use of computer -gener ated random numbers at 
baseline.  
The randomization database will be stored on a password protected computer at Columbia 
University and will only be accessible to Dr. Schnall and the project manager at Columbia University 
to avoid the possibility  of the study sites subverting  randomization  as has been  noted  in previous  
studies.85 Following completion of the informed consent and baseline assessment, participants will 
be randomly assigned to one of the two trial arms using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed 
envelopes containing the intervention assignment, which the staff member op ens at the moment of 
randomization.83 This will minimize  the biased  assignment  of study  subjects  which  meets  the PRS 
Efficacy  Criteria  for Best Evidence Risk Reduction  Individual  Level  -Tier 1.86 This will ensure  against  
accidental  bias and produce  comparable groups  in all respects  except  the intervention  each  group  
received.87 If the study  participant  is randomized to the intervention arm, they will have access to t he 
MyPEEPS Mobile for the next three months. Participants  randomized  to the delayed  intervention  arm 
will not have  access  to MyPEEPS  Mobile  and will be asked to complete their surveys every 3 months 
and will be provided access to the app at 9 months.  
Participants in both groups will complete a  baseline assessment (Appendix B) at time 0. Through our  
system,  we will be able to monitor  when  participants  login  to MyPEEPS  Mobile,  time spent  on each  
module and whether they are actively using the intervention or j ust logged in.  
 
For participants  enrolled  online,  once  they are consented,  we will then email  them  the baseline  
survey through  Qualtrics  and send  them  a login  in to the app if they are in the intervention  group.  
If they have not logged into the app within 24 hours after enrollment, we will call them to follow 
up. 
 
C.9. Overview of data collection time points.  
We will conduct simultaneous assessments for both intervention arms at three -month intervals 
starting with a common baseline through six -month postin tervention follow -up (Figure 5). We will also 
collect an immediate post -intervention assessment for Best Evidence Risk Reduction Individual Level 
-Tier 1.86  
Follow -up visits will be scheduled within a target window of 2 weeks before to 2 weeks after 
based on participant availability and site capacity; visits may be scheduled approximately one week 
before or up to about four weeks after the target follow -up date. Timing of foll ow-up visits is 
scheduled to allow site flexibility  while  still scheduling  follow -up visits  within  a reasonable  time span.  
If an individual  misses  one of the follow -up visits (e.g., 6 month  visit for intervention group), then we 
will still attempt to colle ct their 9 month visit data. Every effort will be made  by staff to ensure that 
participants are assessed in follow -up visits within, first, the target window, and second, the 
acceptable window. After consultation with the Co -I, the PI will decide how best to handle the 
situation for the individual participant and point in time that he contacted. For example, if a 
26 participant was out of the country during the 3 -month window and eventually calls the site at the 5 -
month point, the on -site study coordinator wil l consult with Drs. Schnall or Garofalo.  
We will also review  participant’s  medical  records,  if available,  for care relating  to sexual  health  
such  as HIV/STI testing and results, PrEP use, and risk factors starting from study enrollment 
onward.  
 
C.10. Design Considerations.  
The study team thought carefully about our design considerations regarding  the collection  of 
biological  specimens  for either  HIV or other  related  STIs,  but decided  against it  for two reasons:  (1) 
from our experience  in the field,  we believe the incidence  and prevalence  rates of both HIV and STIs 
will be relatively low in this young age group, making testing not particularly helpful for either main 
or secondary outcomes, and (2) in certain geographic regions, such as the South, that adding  a 
specimen collection might make it more difficult to obtain a waiver of parental consent for 
participation in this research, which we believe is of paramount importance. In addition, given that 
HIV/STI  testing  will be addressed  in MyPEEPS  Mobile  interven tion, and is an outcome  of interest,  we 
will not provide HIV/STI testing for study participants. Instead all study participants will be provided 
access to HIV/STI testing resources at the study endpoint. Importantly, participants are expected to 
continue n ormal healthcare activities during the course of the study and will be offered HIV/STI 
testing referral information.  
In addition to HIV/STI testing referral information, if during the course of participation, study 
staff identifies any young person who scr eens for moderate/high levels of substance use or mental 
health problems, they will be referred to local providers of care as well as to the TREVOR hotline if 
appropriate. Study staff will use screening instruments that are used commonly in adolescent prim ary 
care. If a young person  reports  abuse  either  sexual  or otherwise,  we will screen  for imminent  risk and 
make  a report  of the abuse  according  to state -specific  rules.  We will do a “well-being”  de-briefing  with 
all participants  at the end of each visit. I f they report being upset, we will screen for imminent risk of 
suicidality. We will not ask specifically about criminal behavior, e.g., stealing, vandalism, etc.

C.11. Study Outcomes.  
Our outcome measures have been used in our MyPEEPS pilot study with Y MSM  (R34MH079707;  
PI: Garofalo).  We have 4 levels of outcomes:  primary,  secondary,  intermediate and program 
evaluation. A detailed list of outcome measures within each category and the time points when they 
will be collected is listed in Table 3. We also d etail the primary and intermediate outcome measures 
below.  
C.11.a. Primary Outcome  Measures.   
Male -male  sexual  risk in the prior 3-month  period  will be evaluated  at all-time points using the AIDS -
Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA) adapted for YMSM.90-92 Variables of interest include: Our primary 
outcomes will be: total number of sex partners and condomless anal sex partners, frequencies  for 
condomless  anal sex acts,  anal sex with and without  condoms  under  the influence of alcohol/drugs, 
nPEP and PrEP (if FDA -approved for this age group) use and self -reported HIV/STI testing.  
 
C.11.b. Secondary Outcomes.  
Measures  are related  to behavioral  intention.  In the case of our study,  the secondary outcome measures 
will focus on i ntent to reduce the male -male sexual risk behaviors outlined above.  
 
C.11.c. Intermediate Outcome Measures.  
Behavior change is moderated and mediated by intermediate personal and social factors including 
knowledge (e.g., how to use a condom), self -efficac y, and inter -personal communication skills.97  
Internalized h omophobia  has also been  associated with sexual risk behavior in YMSM.98 This study 
is not powered for tests of moderation  and mediation,  nonetheless  the purpose  of the inclusion  of 
these  factors  is to measure  the impact  of the intervention  on them  as intermediate  targets  given  their 
potential  role in behavior change.   
Self-efficacy for safer sex and situational temptation for unsafe sex. The 10 -item scale93 (α= 0.72) 
was used to assess self -efficacy in practicing condom use and sa fer sex communication with a 
partner. A sample item is “ If I didn't  want  to have  sex with my partner,  I would  be able to say ‘no.’” 
Condom errors. The 12 -item Questionnaire94 was adapted to reflect a 6 -week recall period (α= .60). 
A sample question is “ When you used condoms during the last 6 weeks, how often was the condom 
put on the wrong side up so that it had to be flipped over? ” 
Demographic  characteristics.  Sociodemographic  data of study  participants  will be collected  at 
baseline, including  age, race/ethnicity,  sexual  orientation,  highest  level of education,  and housing  
status.  We will also collect dating behavior, health literacy, depression , substance use, HIV 
knowledge, i nternalized homonegativity, and  technology use data.98-101 
We have selected our outcome measures based on our past work and specifically our 
successful MyPEEPS pilot trial. If NIMHD seeks to harmonize the outcomes a cross all of the U01 
projects then we will work with the agency to include other measures or adapt our existing 
measures.  
 
C.12. COVID-19 Measures.  
The investigative  team  decided  to temporarily  attach  a COVID -19 related  block of questions to 
the MyPEEPS R CT 3 -, 6-, 9-, and 12 -month follow -up surveys to assess the impacts of  the 
outbreak.  The question  block  will be temporarily  attached  at the end of all the follow  up surveys 
for the next 3 months,  i.e, through  the end of August.  That should  result  in gettin g everyone  who 
28 hasn’t completed  the study  at their next visit. If COVID  impacts  continue  through  fall of 2020,  the 
investigative team will reassess the need to continue the deployment of this survey block 
beyond the initial timeframe (end of August). The p urpose of this assessment is to better 
understand the impact of COVID -19 on the current  RCT study  outcomes  specifically  as it relates  
to sexual  risk behaviors,  PrEP use and HIV/STI testing. The block will include 27 questions 
concerning: MROS3; Shelter in Place/Stay at Home Orders and Voluntary Self -Quarantine; 
HIV/Testing During COVID -19 Outbreak; PrEP  Use and Refill  Access  During  COVID -19 
Outbreak;  Risk Behaviors  During  COVID -19 Outbreak.  
 
C.13. Sound Retention  Efforts.  
Participants  will be asked  at the end of the screening  what  would  be the best way for us to remind 
them of the appointment (voice phone, text, e -mail). We will explain to participants that  in all cases  a 
clear  boundary  exists  between  the research  project  and agency  staff that prevents  the sharing of 
information we learn about them during the research study with anyone at the agency. Participant 
retention during the intervention will be enhanced in several ways. First, participants will be 
compensated  $25 for their time to complete  the basel ine assessment,  up to $100  for completing  all of 
the MyPEEPS modules, and additional compensation for completing each of the follow -up 
assessments. Participants  will be compensated  $30 for completing  the 3 month  survey,  $35 for 
completing  the 6 month  participants  will be compensated  $45 for completion  of the 12 month  survey.  In 
addition,  at each  followup visit (3, 6, 9 and 12 months), participants will be asked to update their 
locator information.  
Contact (phone calls, text, email or note as preferred by th e participant) will be made by the site 
study staff prior to the follow -up visit to confirm or reschedule an appointment. The discrete contact 
will thank the participants for being in the program, remind them of the date and time of their next 
follow -up ap pointment and note the telephone number that can be called if rescheduling is necessary. 
Participants who do not respond and cannot be located during the acceptable window period are 
coded as a missed assessment and contact will continue for the next asses sment. We will contact 
participant until they expresses the desire to be dropped from the study. If a participant moves away 
from the original project conducted or arrangements will be made to transfer their contact information 
to a different site. These e xtensive procedures will be used to promote participant attendance at the 
follow -up visits and has been shown  to be successful  in previous  intervention  trials.102 Using  the 
following  sound  retention  efforts  as well as reimbursement  for completion  of surveys,  we are confident  
that we will retain  at least  80% of our study  sample at a single follow -up assessment for each study  
arm.86 We hav e methods in place to maximize intervention completion including: 1) gaming 
components of our intervention, 2) monetary compensation for completion of intervention modules, 
and 3) automated electronic (e -mail/ text) reminders.  
C.14. Statistical  Procedures:  
All multivariate analyses will be preceded by standard descriptive bivariate analyses to describe key 
variables and relationships among key variables. These analyses will include means, frequency 
tables, histograms, and examination of distributions. All s tatistical tests will be two -sided tests with 
the level of significance at  0.05 (PRS Efficacy  Criteria  for Best  Evidence  Risk Reduction  Individual 
Level  –Tier 1).86 Outcomes: This study will examine whether the intervention will (1) reduce the 
number of sex partners, number of anal sex partner with who m a condom was not used, etc.;  and 
(2) increase  the proportion  of anal sex with condom  use, etc. We will also examine whether th e 
intervention will (3) be still effective (i.e., the outcomes are not getting worse) during 3 and 6 months 
follow up period. Primary Outcomes: There are two types of primary outcome variables  in this study:  
(1) counts,  (i.e., number  of sex partners,  numbe r of anal sex partners with who m a condom was not 
used, etc.) and (2) binary/binomial - percentages, (i.e. percentage of anal sex acts) (Table 3 – 
outcome  variables). We assume that all count outcome variables follow Poisson or negative binomial 
(NB) distr ibution, 𝑦~𝑃𝑜𝑖(𝜆) or 𝑦~𝑁𝐵(𝜆,𝜅), and all percentage outcomes follow binomial distribution, 
𝑦~𝑏𝑖𝑛(𝑛,𝑝). Let the expected value of outcome, 𝐸(𝑦)=𝜑, so 𝜑=𝜆 for count outcomes and 𝜑=𝑝 
29 for percentage outcomes. We propose the following indiv idual growth model, a special case of 
generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), to analyze both count and percentage outcomes. The level 
of analysis will be assessed at each data point. For person 𝑖 and data assess wave 𝑊: 
ℎ(𝜑𝑖,𝑤)=𝛽𝑜𝑖+𝛽1𝑖𝐴𝑟𝑚+𝛽2𝑖𝑊+𝛽3𝑖𝐼+𝛽4𝑖𝐹𝑈+𝛽5𝑖𝑋, 
𝐵𝑖𝑗=𝜂𝑖0+𝜂𝑖1𝐶𝑂𝑉 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗,   𝑗=0,1,2,3,4,𝑎𝑛𝑑  5 
Where ℎ(.) is the link function for the GLMM. We will use log -links (Poisson or Negative Binomial 
regression) for count outcomes and logit-links (logistic regression) for percentage outcomes. 
𝜇𝑗𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑑~𝑁(0,𝜎𝑗2) are personal level random effects. Variables Arm, W, I, and FU are design variables. 
The codes for the design variables are presented in Table 4. Variable  Arm is the indicator  for 
intervention  arms  (0=intervention  arm and  1=delayed  intervention  arm);  variable  W is data assess  
wave  indicator  (0=baseline,  1=3 months,  2=6 months, etc.); variable I is the intervention indicator  
(0=pre - intervention, and 1=post -interventio n); 
variable FU is the indicator for follow up time 
period (1=3 month follow up, 2=6 month follow 
up, and  0=otherwise). Variable COV is a vector 
of personal level covariates at the baseline: it 
includes study site ( Birmingham, Chicago, New 
York, Seattle) , age, recruitment method (in -
person vs online) , primary race/ethnicity 
(Blacks/African  Americans,  Hispanics/Latinos,  
American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian  
Americans, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific 
Islanders), self -identified as gay/homosexual 
(bisexua l/other),  self-reported baseline HIV 
serostatus, etc.  Variable 𝑿𝑿 is a vector of time - dependent  covariates  assessed  at each  wave  of data 
for each subject, such as STD and HIV tests, knowledge of prevention messages, etc. This model will 
include both baseline personal level covariates as  well as personal -wave  level covariates  in order  to 
control for different types of potential confounders.  
      Regression parameter  𝛽3 is the mean value  change  for the outcome  variables  between  pre and 
post intervention,  is the main  outcome  measurement, and measures the impact of  the intervention on 
each  outcome  is the mean value change for the outcome variables between pre and post intervention, 
is the main outcome measurement, and measures the impact of the intervention on each outcome 
variable. For the Poisson or Negative Binom ial models, exp (𝛽3) is the ratio of mean counts (i.e., risk 
ratio) between post and pre intervention. For the logistic models, exp (𝛽3) is the odds ratio between 
post and pre intervention. Regression parameter 𝛽4 is the rate of mean value change for the o utcome 
values during the follow up period.  Therefor e, we will use superiority  tests instead of traditional 
comparative tests.  
 We propose a GLMM to analyze data. One of the main advantages of GLMM is to provide 
unbiased estimates when there are missing ou tcomes during the follow up period. For the missing 
values at the baseline  or partial baseline collected data, we will use a multiple imputation approach.131 
Models will also be  run on the raw, non-imputed  data.  Inferences  for the trial arm, wave,  and 
interaction  between  trial arm and  wave  did not differ  between  the analyses  of the raw and multiply  
imputed  data.  Rates  of reduction  will be calculated from population -averaged rates, which control for 
all other covariates in the multivariable model.  Models  will be calculated  using R , and model fit will be 
evaluated by diagnostic statistics and residual plots. Secondary Outcomes: We will use the proposed 
GLMM to analyze secondary outcomes with appropriate choice of link functions according to the 
outcomes. All a nalyses will be done on the final data set (baseline n=900).  
 
C.14.a. Missing data.  
Missing data may occur in the proposed study in several ways. First, missing data may  occur  due to 
item non-response.  When  missing  data is limited  to only a few items  on a measure,  we will prorate Table 4. Codes for design variables

30 total scores for a measure by taking an average score on the measure and multiplying it by the total 
number of items in the scale. Missing data can also occur from attrition due to missed assessments 
or dropout from the study. Pri or to performing any outcome analyses, we will evaluate the amount, 
reasons, and patterns of missing data. If the reason for missing data is not related to the outcome of 
interest, then the missing data are considered to be missing completely at random (MC AR) and  
complete  case  analysis  will still generate  unbiased  estimates.103 We will conduct  sensitivity  analyses 
to compare estimates of treatment effects with and without multiple imputation to assess the effect of 
missing data on statistical inference.  
 
C.15. MyPEEPS  Mobile RCT In-depth Interviews  
Selected participant s will be interviewed about the MyPEEPS Mobile RCT to better understand their 
overall experience using the MyPEEPS application and the study recruitment process.  
 
Recruitment: For the in -depth interviews, we will recruit up to 40 participants across the fo ur study 
sites (New  York,  Chicago,  Birmingham,  and Seattle),  10 participants  from each  study  site. We 
anticipate  that a total  of 40 participants  will be an adequate  number  of participants  to reach  saturation  
based  on our earlier studies focusing on similar  topics.32 Through a purposive sampling we will draw 
from a group of participants who agreed to be contacted for future studies and completed the 
MyPEEPS mobile RCT. Participants will be given information about the in -depth interview, the time 
involved (approx imate length of time: 1 -1.5 hour), and compensation ($30). The interview 
compensation is consistent with payments made in prior studies.  
 
Procedures: All in -depth interviews will be conducted with participants individually and recorded 
using an  online  platform (e.g. Zoom).  Before  the start of the interview,  the study  staff will first explain  
the purpose of  the project  and participants  will review  and sign a written  informed  assent/consent  in 
electrotonic  form. The informed assent/consent form provides detai ls of the study procedures, risks, 
benefits, site contact information,  and the nature  of confidentiality  and voluntary  participation.  The 
consent  process  also covers information on the timeline, task involved, and compensation for time. 
To ensure understan dability, the study staff will read the form to the participant and ask them to 
summarize their understanding of the study procedures. Before a participant signs the informed 
assent/consent form, staff will answer any questions. Participants will be given a copy of the 
informed assent/consent form for their records.  
 
Following  the completion  of the electronic  informed  assent/consent  process,  participants  will begin  
the indepth interview. We will ask structured questions pertaining to the participants’ over all 
experience with the MyPEEPS Mobile RCT and the recruitment process, and the relevance or 
impact of the MyPEEPS application to their lives. During the interview, we will also provide 
participants with a handout  listing  the MyPEEPS  activities  to help with recall.  The individual  in-
depth  guide  will include  the following questions  
 
1) Please describe your experience navigating, or moving through, the MyPEEPS app activities and

We will also ask probing  questions  to stimulate  discussion.  Furthermore,  the guide  will be informed  by 
the feedback and commentary from members of our investigative team who have extensive clinical 
and research  experience  working  with our study  population.  During  the interview,  the interviewer  will 
also take notes.  
Transcription:  All individual interview audio recording will be transcribed verbatim through a 
transcription  company.  Any identifiers  will be deleted  from the audio  and removed  from the 
transcript. The team wi ll adhere to qualitative processes to ensure the credibility, conformability, 
and dependability,  and transferability  of the qualitative  data from theses  analyses.  To support  the 
credibility use “member checks,” i.e., sharing of initial data interpretations  with participants, to 
ensure accurate interpretations. Triangulation  of findings,  along  with reflexivity,  will enhance  the 
confirmability  of the interpretations.  The investigators  will carefully  record  an audit  trail and keep  
extensive  field notes  to facilitate  transferability of study findings into other contexts (Guba, 1981). 
Transcripts will be analyzed independently for content by research team members in these 
methods.  
 
Data  Analysis:  The research  team  will adhere  to qualitative  research  processes  to ensure  the 
credibility, confirmability,  dependability  and transferability  of the qualitative  data from these  analyses.  
The study  team will meet and review transcripts and notes. Drs. Schnall and Hidalgo17,21,62 -64 who 
both have experience in qualitative analysis will work with two research team members to code the 
transcripts. Field notes and transcripts will be analyzed by the researchers using NVivo™ (QSR 
International, Victoria, Australia) software. Participants’ statements will be captured using memoing 
and then sorted into the categories of interest or descriptive thematic categories. Open coding will be 
used to develop initial data categories. Some  codes  will be derived  from the questions  included  in the 
intervi ew and other  codes  will emerge  from themes  and patterns  identified  in the narratives.  An initial  
set of codes  will be independently  generated  by two coders. Codes will then be compared and 
synthesized to result in shared coding categories and subcategories , all with definitions, inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, and examples. Coders will discuss discrepancies  until they reach  consensus.  
The research  team  will meet  and review  transcripts  and notes. The goal is to collect feedback about 
the participants’ over all experience with the MyPEEPS mobile RCT, technological difficulties, 
recruitment, and to identify subject matter that should be included to enhance the MyPEEPS mobile 
and recruitment process for future studies.  
 
D. Assess the feasibility of using In -home HIV tests for assessing HIV status in a sample of very 
YMSM by conducting follow -up testing with MyPEEPS RCT participants.  
Goals :Assess  the feasibility  of using  the HIV home  test for assessing  HIV status  in a sample  of very YMSM.   
 
Design Overview . In-home HIV testing will be conducted with MyPEEPS RCT participants 3 months 
following  their completion  of the trial. Participants  will complete  an in-home  HIV test and an online  
survey that includes questions about demographic characteristics, health literacy,  mental health and 
substance use, sexual risk behaviors, HIV testing history, and opinions regarding HIV testing.  
 
32 Recruitment.  We will recruit  participants  3 months  after they complete  the MyPEEPS  RCT.  
Participants will be contacted by study staff using t heir preferred method of communication to 
determine interest in the study. All participants within the recruitment timeframe (3 months post -
RCT) will be approached except those withdrawn from the trial. Participants who voluntarily disclose 
to study staff while  recruiting  that they tested  positive  for HIV (seroconverted)  when  they were  in the 
trial or since  their participation ended will not be recruited in the current study but will be offered 
resources to be linked to care, if not already linked.  
 
Sample.  Our sample  will include  participants  enrolled  into the trial (inclusive  of YMSM,  
Nonbinary  individuals, and YTGW [who transitioned during or after the study], aged 13 -21). 
 
Eligibility criteria. In addition to being a MyPEEPS RCT participant, we will also  include the following 
eligibility  criteria:  1) understand  the limitations  of the OraQuick  test (e.g.,  confirmatory  test is 
needed);  2) not having tested positive for HIV since enrollment in the trial.  
 
Study Enrollment.  Study participants will conduct an enrollment visit remotely to provide informed 
consent (+17) or assent (13 -16), enroll and complete provide an ‘Address Survey’ to provide a 
mailing address so study staff can send study materials needed for the baseline study visit. Remote 
informed consent  will be conducted via video conferencing such as Skype, Zoom, FaceTime using 
REDCap to collect e -consent or e -assent and answer participant questions for the Address Survey. 
Through the REDCap platform, participants will be able to securely download a cop y of the e -
consent or e -assent for their records. As part of the REDCap e -consent/e -assent platform, the 
electronic forms will be automatically archived and securely stored in REDCap. Prior to the 
enrollment visit, those providing informed assent will be a sked to have a parent or guardian provide 
e-consent to participate in the research.  Parents/guardians  will be able to provide  e-consent  through  
the REDCap  platform  and securely download a copy of the e -consent for their records. Those who 
secure parental/g uardian consent will be asked in the Address Survey to confirm their 
parent/guardian’s submitted consent and that they are aware of the materials that will be mailed to 
their home. All participants will complete an HIV Home Testing Understanding Assessment  with 
study staff to ensure participants fully comprehend how use the OraQuick rapid test prior to 
receiving it. Following enrollment, participants will be sent a study package with the following 
materials: an OraQuick in -home rapid HIV test kit, condoms, and study information listing the study 
team’s contact information. OraQuick tests will be sent via tracked shipping through FedEx. During 
the remote baseline visit, participants will join via video conferencing to complete an in - home HIV 
test and an onli ne survey that includes questions about demographic characteristics, health literacy, 
mental health and substance use, sexual risk behaviors including number of individuals they 
engaged in anal or oral sex with, condomless intercourse, as well as their HIV  testing history, and 
opinions regarding HIV testing. The baseline survey will also include questions on PEP/PrEP use 
and adherence, drug and alcohol use, and the HIV Risk Index. The survey will also ask questions to 
assess the impacts of the COVID -19 outb reak. Remote participants who test negative (non -
reactive) will receive the HIV prevention, PrEP assessment and referral information via a secure e -
email reviewed during the study visit video call.  Remote participants who receive a preliminary 
positive res ult will be linked to care. Remote in -home HIV testing at baseline will use the OraQuick 
in-home tests. Participants will be shown how to conduct the test via video conference call. If a 
participant is found to be preliminary positive (reactive) during the  baseline testing, they will be 
linked to care at a health clinic or hospital closest to them or a healthcare provider of their choice. If 
they are non -reactive, the study staff will wrap up the study visit. Study staff will record participant’s 
HIV test r esults in their own individual REDCap record.

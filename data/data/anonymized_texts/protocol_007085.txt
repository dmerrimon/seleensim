3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 T cell therapy for non-viral tumors 
From an immunotherapeutic perspective the model tumor antigen to target should be one 
that is exclusively and universally expressed on tumor cells in order to limit collateral damage, and ideally should be essential for the maintenance of  the oncogenic phenotype of the tumor. 
However, the majority of antigens do not meet these criteria since they are not neo-antigens uniquely present in malignant cells but rather antigens  that are also expressed in normal cells 
and against which peripheral blood T cells are tolerized or deleted. Tumor-specific antigens 
have nonetheless been identified, and these can be classified into 4 groups; 
(i) Unique antigens (eg. MUM1) result from single mutations that are tumor and 
patient specific and therefore are only expressed in neoplastic cells
1-3. They are 
often considered ideal for immunotherapy since tumor cells can be specifically 
targeted without destroying nearby normal tissue, and they may also be relatively 
strong antigens1-4. However, because they are also usually patient-specific, the 
identification of the mutated gene and then the generation of an individualized 
CTL product targeting the identified antigen is highly labor and cost intensive.  
(ii) The shared lineage-restricted antigens, expressed on tumor cells as well as their 
normal tissue of origin, such as the melanoma associated antigens MART, gp100 
or Melan-A. These antigens are also strongly immunostimulatory, equivalent almost to “weak” viral antigens, enabling the efficient and relatively simple generation and expansion of tumor-specific T cells from healthy donors and patients with minimal in vitro manipulation
5. However, T cell mediated destruction 
of normal melanocytes, for example, has res ulted in vitiligo as well as ocular and 
systemic autoimmunity in patients treated with melanoma-specific CTL or TILs6. 
(iii) Shared tumor-specific TAA (e.g. the cancer testis antigens [CTA] - MAGE, BAGE, 
GAGE, NY-ESO-1, SSX, PRAME) are expressed in multiple tumors including 
breast cancer but not in healthy organs7-11, with the exception of germ line tissues 
that are immune privileged and therefore not susceptible to T cell attack. Most CTAs have heterogeneous expression in cancer tissues and are frequently 
expressed in high-grade or late tumor stages, with expression often correlated 
with a worse prognosis. Furthermore, tumors expressing one CTA are also often found to express multiple CTAs, and several have been found to be targets of spontaneous humoral or cell-mediated immune responses
12-14. Thus, CTAs are 
particularly attractive as targets for tumor immunotherapy since reactive T cells 
can be produced on a large scale to provide broad-spectrum protection against a 
variety of tumors. CTAs have been targeted in both vaccine and T cell therapy 
protocols, with evidence of clinical efficacy15-21.

7 (iv) The last group of antigens are over expressed in many different tumors but 
expressed at low levels in healthy tissue (eg. hTERT, CEA and Survivin). T cells 
targeted to these antigens carry the risk of inducing collateral damage to normal tissues co-expressing the antigen (e.g. CEA and normal biliary epithelium), and there are limited clinical data available regarding the safety of targeting these antigens in vivo . However, Survivin- and CEA-spec ific T cells have been isolated 
from the peripheral blood of patients who have cleared their tumors, and increases in Survivin-specific T cells in  patients receiving oncolytic viruses have 
been reported, suggesting that they can have efficacy without toxicity in patients
22-
27.  
 
3.2  Clinical experience targeting non-viral TAAs 
 
3.2.1 Melanoma-targeted therapies 
T cell immunotherapies for non-viral tumor antigens have been described, with promising 
clinical results in some studies. Rosenberg and colleagues reported that infusion of 
melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) together with high-dose interleukin 2 (IL-2) produced clinical responses in approx. 35% of patients with metastatic melanoma 
28-
30. The specificity of the infused cells was not analyzed but it is likely that they targeted 
multiple epitopes/tumor associated antigens. More promising results were subsequently 
achieved using a modified treatment protocol which incorporated a lymphodepletion step 
prior to CTL infusion, in order to improve the expansion and persistence of adoptively-transferred cells. Ninety three  patients with metastatic melanoma refractory to standard 
therapies received immunodepleting chemotherapy -/+ total body irradiation followed by the 
adoptive transfer of highly selected, TIL-derived, tumor-reactive T cells and high-dose IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg  q 8h to tolerance). Fifty two of the 93 patients had objective clinical responses 
to treatment (39 PR, 12 CR), including regression of large bulky tumors
31,32. However, the 
collection of autologous TILs is not possible for most tumors. Furthermore the in vitro  
expansion of large numbers of tumor-specific T cells (>1010 CTL) is a complex and expensive 
procedure.  
 
To extend applicability and generate a more defined tumor-specific product with respect to 
specificity and function, a number of groups have investigated the clinical use of tumor-specific T cells isolated from peripheral blood and selectively activated and expanded ex vivo. Mitchell and colleagues used insect cells modified to express HLA-A2, CD80 and CD54 
and loaded with an HLA-A2-restricted epitope peptide derived from the melanoma-expressed 
tyrosinase antigen to repetitively stimulate and selectively expand tyrosinase peptide-specific 
T cells. Infusion of 5x10
8 cells (of which between 10-30% were tyrosinase-specific) to 10 
patients with tyrosinase-positive melanoma tumors was associated with clinical responses in two
33. Other groups have used dendritic cells (DCs) to activate a tumor-directed product. For 
example, Yee and colleagues generated CD8+ T cell clones specific for HLA-A2 peptides derived from MART1 and gp100 using peptide-l oaded autologous DCs as stimulators. Four 
infusions (3.3x10
9/m2/infusion) of the tumor-directed clones without and subsequently with 
low dose IL2 produced clinical benefit in 8 of 10 patients with metastatic melanoma and IL2 was found to be crucial for in vivo persistence
34. A follow-up study from the same group 
incorporating a pre-conditioning step with high dose cyclophosphamide +/- low or high dose IL2 was shown to further increase proliferation and persistence
35. However, the toxicities 
associated with pre-conditioning followed by T cells with high dose IL2 were found to be substantial and recruitment on this arm of the study was halted. Finally, MART1 was also targeted by Mackensen et al, who prepared tumor-directed T cell lines using HLA-A2 peptide-

Version 1.1 8/12/2016           Version 2.0 3/20/2017        Version 3.1 7/24/2017         Version 4.0 12/03/2018 
8 loaded DCs to stimulate selected CD8+ T cells. Eleven patients received at least 3 and up to 
10 infusions of specific CTLs (median 2.11 x 108 cells/infusion) with low dose IL2, with 
evidence of T cell homing to tumor sites detected and favorable clinical responses reported 
in 3 (1 complete, 1 partial, and 1 mixed response)36. 
 
Thus, while the generation and adoptive transfer of CD8+ melanoma peptide-specific T cells 
from peripheral blood has proven to be feasible, as in the TIL setting clinical benefit appears to be tightly linked with in vivo persistence, which has proven challenging. One potential strategy to overcome this obstacle may be to infuse CD8+ peptide-directed T cells with 
antigen-specific CD4+ T cell populations, which not only mediate tumor killing directly against 
HLA class II positive targets
37, but can support the survival and maintain the effector function 
of the transferred CD8+ T cells via the production of immunostimulatory cytokines and other signals upon antigen encounter. Perhaps a more general limitation of this peptide stimulation approach, however, is its limitation to individuals with a restricted HLA genotype due to the small number of class I-restricted epitopes used for T cell activation. Finally, one emerging 
concern is the potential for such a targeted therapy to evade the immune system as was 
reported by Mackensen et al who reported the evolution of MART1 negative tumors in 2 
patients infused with MART1-targeted CD8+ T cells
36. 
 
3.2.2 T cell therapy to prevent leukemic relapse 
Adoptive immunotherapy has also proven to be an effective strategy in preventing leukemic 
relapse in the post allogeneic HSCT setting. The first adoptive T cell transfer protocols were 
based on the premise that donor peripheral blood contained T cells that were able to mediate antitumor activity in vivo. Accordingly, unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have been extensively used to provide anti-tumor immunity
38. However, the efficacy of this 
approach is limited by the low frequency of tumor-specific T cells and the relatively high 
frequency of alloreactive T cells, resulting in frequent and severe GVHD. One strategy to 
enhance the “graft vs leukemia” effect without promoting GVHD is to selectively target tumor-expressed antigens using selectively-expanded T cell populations and clinically the antigens which have been targeted fall into two categories: (i) minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) expressed by leukemia progenitors, and  (ii) TAAs overexpressed by the leukemic 
cells with limited expression on normal cells.  
 
mHAgs are HLA-binding peptides derived from endogenous proteins in cells of the stem cell 
transplant recipient that differ from those of the donor due to genetic polymorphisms, thus 
representing a unique class of antigens that can only be targeted after allogeneic HSCT to 
promote both GVL and GVHD effects in vivo.
39 However, much of the current research in this 
area is focused on identifying and selectivel y targeting mHAgs expressed exclusively on 
malignant cells. Warren and colleagues recently evaluated the safety of adoptively transferring donor-derived CD8+ CTL clones recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens 
(mHAgs) preferentially expression on hematopoietic  cells to patients with relapse of acute 
leukemia after myeloablative allogeneic HSCT
40. The highest doses administered to each 
patient ranged from 2.25 x 109 - 6.6 x 109 cells. Pulmonary toxicity was seen in three of the 
seven treated patients, and was severe in one, and correlated with the level of expression of 
the mHAg-encoding genes in lung tissue. However, the administration of steroids coincided 
with a rapid reversal in pulmonary symptoms. Thus the associated toxicity could be rapidly 
and effectively controlled40. 
In both the autologous and donor-specific setting adoptive transfer approaches are being 
developed against a number of leukemia-associated antigens including Wilms Tumor Gene 1 (WT1), Proteinase 3 (Pr3), human neutrophil elastase (NE), melanoma associated antigen

9 A3 (MAGE-A3) and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME)13,14. Of these 
WT1 is perhaps the most extensively characterized with several groups having defined CD4+ 
and CD8+ epitope peptides, thus confirming the immunogenicity of this target. Its clinical relevance is evidenced by the fact that disease control or remission in several vaccine studies has been associated with the induction of WT1-specific T cells, and an increased frequency of circulating WT1-specific T cells post HSCT has been associated with sustained disease 
remission. Based on these and other studies, O’Reilly and colleagues have recently initiated 
a clinical trial of donor-derived WT1 peptide-specific T cells, activated using DCs loaded with an overlapping peptide library (15mers overl apping by 11 amino acids) spanning the entire 
sequence of the antigen, and infused as treatment of persistent minimal residual disease or recurrence of WT1+ AML, ALL, or MDS following allogeneic HSCT. In preliminary reports, T 
cell infusions at the lowest dose levels were reported to be safe, well tolerated, and 
associated with clinical benefit
41,42.  
 
3.3 Targeting EBV negative lymphomas using adoptive T cell transfer 
To target lymphoma we have developed a strategy  to target multiple tumor expressed 
antigens including PRAME, SSX2, MAGE-A4, NY-ESO-1 and Survivin.  
To date we have infused a total of 18 patients: 9 with Hodgkin lymphoma, 8 with aggressive 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1 with a compos ite lymphoma. Patients have received 2 
infusions of cells ranging from 0.5-2x107 multiTAA-T cells/m2 without adverse events. Of 11 
patients who were infused as adjuvant therapy all but 1 remain in remission (range 1-24 
months post-infusion). Seven patients have receiv ed multiTAA-specific T cells to treat active 
disease. Of these, 1 had transient disease stabilization followed by disease progression, 3 have stable disease 3-6 months post-multiTAA-specific T cells while the remaining 3 (all with 
HL) have had complete responses, as assessed by PET. Notably, since patients received no 
pre-infusion cytoreductive chemotherapy, these clinical responses can be attributed to the cells infused. Indeed, clinical benefit correlated with the detection of tumor-reactive T cells in patient peripheral blood post-infusion directed against both targeted antigens as well as non-targeted TAAs including MAGEA2B and MAGE C1, indicating antigen spreading. Thus, 
infusion of autologous multiTAA-targeted T cells directed to PRAME, SSX2, MAGEA4, NY-
ESO-1 and Survivin has been safe and provided clinical benefit to patients with lymphomas. 
 Additionally, we have administered these multi-antigen-targeted T cell lines to patients with 
multiple myeloma (n=5) and a spectrum of solid tumors including squamous cell carcinoma, 
lung cancer and osteosarcoma (n=4).  
 
3.4 Extending our approach to treat breast cancer 
Given our demonstration that (i) targeting NY-ESO-1, PRAME, MAGE-A4, SSX2 and 
Survivin simultaneously is feasible and safe, and (ii) these antigens are expressed in different 
stages of breast cancer including triple-negative breast cancer
7-11, we now propose to 
administer multiTAA-specific CTLs to patients with breast cancer. The CTL generation protocol will be identical to that used in our lymphoma study. In the current phase II study, we propose testing the safety and antitumor activity of these multiTAA-specific cells in 
patients with a breast cancer diagnosis at a fixed dose of 2x10
7 cells/m2.  
 
3.5 Potential adverse events  
Although no toxicity has been associated with CTL infusion in patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we will actively look for evidence of potential side effects such as:

in patients who received T cells43 or bispecfic T-cell engagers44. The majority of CRS have 
been reported after the infusion of CAR T cells45-47, but CRS can also occur after the infusion 
of conventional antigen-specific T cells48 or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes49. Patients will be

5.1 Blood procurement for CTL and antigen-presenting cell (APC) generation 
Generation of tumor-specific CTL lines requires the generation of several different 
components from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The CTL line will be derived 
from patient peripheral blood T cells, by stimulation with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) pulsed with pepmixes spanning the tumor-associated antigens SSX2, MAGEA4, Survivin, PRAME, and NY-ESO-1. The initial stimulation will be performed in the presence of the Th1/pro-proliferative cytokines interleukin (IL) 7, IL-12, IL-15, and IL6 and cells will be 
expanded in the presence of IL-2 or IL15. The APCs used to stimulate and expand the tumor-
specific T cells will be dendritic cells derived from patient mononuclear cells.  
 
For CTL generation, we will either use: 
* a mononuclear cell-apheresis collection procedure (for patients with ALCs <500) or  
* a maximum blood draw of 390 ml total, obtained in 1-3 draws over a 2 month period for 
CTL generation, testing for infectious viruses and HLA typing. PBMC will be separated from 
whole blood using ficoll gradients. T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) can be 
prepared from fresh or cryopreserved PBMC. 
 To initiate tumor-specific CTL lines we will ma ke DCs by culture of PBMC-derived monocytes 
with cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-4) followed by maturation with a standard DC maturation cocktail 
(IL-1 , IL6, TNF  and PGE1). These mature DCs will be pulsed for 30-60 mins with a 
mastermix of pepmixes spanning the target antigens PRAME, SSX2, MAGEA4, NY-ESO-1 
and Survivin. For dilution 1ul of each pepmix (200ng/peptide) will be added to 200ul Cell 
Genix/RPMI media and 50-100ul will be used to pulse the DCs ( ≤5x10e6 DCs - 50ul; >5x10e6 
DCs - 100ul). Subsequently the DCs will be washed once and used to stimulate PBMC-
derived T cells in the presence of a T cell activating cocktail, IL7, IL15, IL12 and IL6 at a responder:stimulator ratio of at least 10:1. For initiation, DCs will be prepared from about 
100mL of blood and the T cells will be derived from the monocyte-depleted PBMC fraction. 
 
To expand the tumor-specific T cells we will use pepmix-pulsed DCs for the second and 
subsequent stimulations and cells will be cultured in the presence of IL-2 or IL-15. At least 
100 x 10
6 mononuclear cells are required to generate the second batch of DCs.  
 
At the end of the culture period, CTLs will be cryopreserved and aliquots tested for 
phenotype, function, specificity, identity and sterility. The frequency of tumor-specific CTLs will be determined using intracellular cytokine staining, ELIspot assay, and HLA-peptide 
tetramers if available. Effector memory phenotype and T cell subsets will be analyzed by flow 
cytometry.   
 
Products that meet study specific release criteria, as detailed on the CofA, will be infused as 
per Section 5.2. 
 If a positive sterility testing result is reported after the product was infused, the FDA and other 
relevant parties would be notified as per manufacturing SOP B01.03.XX (Product Quality 
Assurance Program and Release and Return of Clinical GMP/GTP Products) and  clinical 
research SOP J02.06.XX (Serious Adverse Experience and Unanticipated Problem

14 Reporting). Our management of such a situation is further described in our SOP F05.09.XX 
(Management of Culture Positive Cell Therapy Products).  
 We will use pepmixes produced by JPT Technol ogies as an antigen source. These pepmixes 
are overlapping peptide libraries (15 mers overlapping by 11 amino acids) spanning the entire 
sequence of each of the antigens of interest as per our lymphoma (TACTAL) study.  
 
5.2 Administration and Monitoring 
 
Patients will be evaluated in the clinic and 2 fixed doses of CTL will be administered 4 weeks 
apart. Patients will be monitored for clinical toxicity by the CTEP NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria Scale (Version 4.X, See Section 13.3) with the exception of CRS toxicities that are 
related to T-cell infusions. CRS toxicities will be graded according to Appendix I. We will also analyze immunological parameters including phenotype and CTL frequencies by ELIspot and tetramer studies in patients who have HLA ty pes for which tetramers are available. This 
information will be used to determine the in vivo persistence of the infused product and whether multiTAA-specific T cells will be able to recruit the patient’s endogenous immune 
system as measured by epitope spreading.  Functional analyses (antigen-specific cytotoxicity 
and cytokine release) will be performed by chromium release assays and ELIspot/intracellular cytokine staining, respectively. The levels of serum cytokines before and following infusion will be compared. If needed, we will compare the infused product with the patient’s peripheral blood using TCR deep-sequencing. A time period of 6 weeks post the 2
nd 
infusion will constitute the time for clinical efficacy and safety monitoring. If patients have had a partial response or have stable disease they will be eligible to receive up to 6 further doses of CTLs, each of which will consist of the same cell dose or less (if there is not enough product 
available for the subject’s original dose) than their second infusion  
 
6.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of T cells specific for all 5 tumor associated 
antigens in a fixed dose study. 
 
6.1 Dose Levels  
 The patients will be treated 2 times 4 weeks apart at a fixed dose of 2x10
7 cells/m2. 
 
6.2 Dose Schedule 
 
This protocol is designed as a phase II fixed-dose study.  
 
Each patient will receive 2 injections at a fixed dose, 28 days apart, according to the 
following dose schedule: The expected volume of infusion will be 1 to 10 cc. 
 
Dose schedule:    
Day 0 2 x 107 cells/m2 
Day 28 2 x 107 cells/m2 
 
If patients have stable disease or a partial response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (see 8.4.1) at their 6 week evaluation after the 2nd cell dose, they will be eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of CTLs, At least one month

15 should have passed before each additional dose.. Each additional infusion will consist of 
the same cell number or less (if there is not enough product available for the subject’s original dose) than their second infusion. Patients will not be able to receive additional 
doses until the initial safety profile is completed at 6 weeks following the second infusion.  
 
6.3 Premedication 
 
Patients may be premedicated with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) up to 1mg/kg IV (max 50mg) 
and acetaminophen (Tylenol) 10mg/kg po (max 650mg), though this is not mandatory. 
 
6.4 Cell Administration:  
 
Tumor-specific T cells will be given by intravenous injection over 1-10 minutes through 
either a peripheral  or a central line. 
   
6.5 Monitoring 
Monitoring will be undertaken according to institutional standards for administration of blood products with the exception that the injection will be given by a physician. 
 
6.6 Supportive Care 
 Patients will receive supportive care for acute or chronic toxicity, including blood 
components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate. 
 
6.7 Treatment Center 
 
All treatments will be administered at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy in Houston 
Methodist Hospital. Patient follow up and regular care will be at the Breast Center at Baylor 
Clinic or Smith Clinic.  
 
6.8 Other Treatment 
 
Patients should not receive other treatment for their cancer between the first and second 
CTL doses or for at least 6 weeks post 2
nd CTL (for purposes of evaluation). If a patient 
receives other treatment for their cancer between the first and second CTL doses, that 
patient will be taken off treatment.  
 
7.0 PATIENT EVALUATION 
 
7.1 Follow up Interval 
Patients shall be seen in clinic prior to the first and second infusions and 
evaluated (seen in clinic or contacted by a research coordinator) at 1 -2 week intervals for up to six weeks after the 2
nd infusion and then at 3, 6, 9 
and 12 months (post 2nd infusion). We will then continue to follow patients 
clinically for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) to evaluate 
long-term disease responses. If persistence of cells is noted at the 12 month 
visit, additional follow-up will added. Additional visits will be obtained as 
clinically indicated or if the patient is having more than 2 infusions.

16 7.2 History and Physical Examination 
A complete history will be performed at pre-infusion, at week 2 post CTL #1, 
at Week 4/Day 0 (CTL infusion #2) and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 post CTL infusion 
#2, at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, then annually for up to 4 additional years for a total of 5 years follow-up.  Physical examinations will be conducted at pre-
infusion for CTL #1 and on days of subsequent CTL infusions. 
 
7.3 Other Studies  
 
7.3.1 The following investigations will be obtained at pre-infusion for CTL #1 
and on days of subsequent CTL infusions 
 
CBC and differential and Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP). 
 
7.3.2 Pregnancy testing is required on female patients of childbearing 
potential prior to CTL infusion #1. Pregnancy testing is not required 
prior to CTL infusion #2 for patients treated. 
 
7.3.3 Diagnostic imaging (CT scans, MRI, nuclear imaging) and/or blood 
tests (serum cytokines) to document measurable disease and 
response to therapy at pre-infusion and 6 weeks following the second 
infusion. The time may vary by 1-2 weeks due to scheduling issues and may be done earlier if clinically indicated. The choice of imaging will depend on what studies have been most informative in following the patient’s disease. If diagnostic imaging studies are performed at other times either during or after treatment on this study, that data will be collected and information gained will be used for this study.  
 
7.3.4 The following investigations will be obtained pre-infusion, and at 1, 2, 
4 weeks after the first infusion and then at 1, 2, 4, 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following the 2nd infusion. 20-40ml of peripheral blood will be collected in preservative-free heparin anticoagulant. This blood will be used for analysis of specificity of CTL response using HLA-peptide tetramer analysis and immune function assays including ELIspot, intracellular cytokine staining and cytotoxicity assays. Serum 
will be batched for analysis of blood cytokine levels. These studies will 
be done on patients on whom the appropriate reagents are available.  
 
7.3.5 If the patient has additional injections of cells after the first 2 infusions, 
the tests listed in 7.2.1 and 7.2.4 will also be obtained pre each 
infusion, and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks post each infusion. Follow up will then continue at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the last infusion. No study specific blood tests will be done af ter two years (if the patients have 
had additional injections) but we will continue to follow patients 
clinically once a year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-
up) to evaluate long term disease responses. 
 
7.3.6 Other Tissues: Should the patient undergo a tumor biopsy at any time 
while they are on study, a sample of this will be used to assess the 
tumor antigen expression profile.

8.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA 
 
 A 6-week period after the second infusion will constitute a course, which will be evaluated 
for critical toxicity, and a 6-week period after the second CTL infusion will be required for 
evaluation for antitumor activity. 
 
Patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria to determine clinical 
response. Evaluations of tumor size will be performed pre-infusion and 6 weeks after the second injection.  Additional imaging performed as part of standard clinical care will also be evaluated. All patients who receive CTL infusion and continue to be enrolled on the study will be evaluable for response. Patient long term overall and progression free survival will also be evaluated at 1 year and then annually for up to an additional 4 years (total of 5 years follow-up).  
 8.1 Definitions  
This study will use the RECIST 1.1 criteria  
   Definitions  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria 
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) Committee
51. 
Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST criteria.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or clinically using calipers. The invest igator will identify up to 5 measurable lesions 
to be followed for response. Serial measurements are to be done with CT or MRI. The same method of assessment is to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline and during follow-up. 
 Complete Response:   Disappearance of all target lesions 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started 
  
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 This is a phase II study evaluating the safety and clinical efficacy of multiTAA-specific CTLs 
administered in patients with breast cancer. All patients will receive 2 injections at a fixed 
dose, 28 days apart, of T cells specific for all 5 tumor associated antigens.

9.1 Study Design and Sample Size 
 
9.1.1 Sample Size  
 
The primary endpoint is clinical benefit rate at 6 weeks after the second dose. Clinical benefit 
rate is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients with complete response or partial response or stable disease for ≥10 weeks from the first infusion (6 weeks after the second 
infusion) according to the RECIST criteria (see Section 8.4.1). This study is designed to 
detect an increase in clinical benefit rate from 5% to 30%. A Simon’s two-stage optimal 
design will be employed to test the null hypothesis that clinical benefit rate is 5% vs. the alternative target rate of 30%. A sample of 9 evaluable patients will be accrued during the first stage. If none of these 9 patients shows clinical benefit at the analysis of the first stage, the study will be stopped early for lack of efficacy. If at least 1 patient shows clinical benefit, then a second stage will enroll additional evaluable patients. If we observe at least 3 clinical 
benefit responses out of the total of 17 evaluable patients enrolled into the study, we will 
consider further investigation is warranted. The proposed sample size is based on testing the above hypotheses with 90% power and 5% significance level. This design has 63% probability of stopping early and an expected sample size of 12 if the true clinical benefit rate is only 5%. Taking into account a 20% drop-out rate for non-evaluable patients, we propose to accrue a total of 22 patients.  
 
9.2 Data Analysis  
 
Safety and toxicity outcomes, and laboratory evaluations will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Information on the expansion, persistence and anti-tumor effects of the adoptively transferred tumor-specific CTL will be analyzed for the immunological parameters 
based on multimer analysis, intracellular cytokine staining and ELIspot assays to assess the 
frequency of cells secreting IFN  using the descriptive statistics such as mean, median, 
standard deviation at each time point. Comparison of diagnostic imaging studies from pre-
infusion to 6 weeks following the second infusion will be summarized. Frequencies, proportions and their 95% confidence intervals of clinical benefit responders (adjusted to 
account for the two-stage nature of the design) will be summarized overall. Overall survival 
and progression free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and 
summarized by median and 95% confidence interval. 
 
Growth curves of immune response over time within a patient will be generated to visualize 
general patterns of immune response. Pairwise comparisons will compare changes of these immunological parameters from pre-infusion to each time point of post-infusion measurements using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. Longitudinal analysis is employed to model repeatedly-measured immunol ogic parameters. This will allow us to 
model patterns of immune response per patient while allowing for varying intercepts and slopes for a patient. The normality assumption will be assessed and transformations to 
achieve approximate normality will be carried out if necessary.  
 
If a patient has stable disease or a partial re sponse as assessed by the RECIST criteria (see 
Section 8.4.1) after the first two infusions, they may receive up to 6 additional infusions at 
monthly intervals. We will collect data on the survival, immunological efficacy and anti-tumor activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte lines after these additional infusions so it may be compared 
with results obtained after the initial two infusions.

To obtain preliminary data on the clinical efficacy and safety monitoring, patients will be 
monitored for 6 weeks after the final injection for toxicity using standard NIH criteria. If a 
patient develops Grade III-IV toxicity attributable to the CTL infusions at any time during the 
extended dosing regimen, they will not be able to receive any more CTL infusions.   
 
9.3 Analysis Set  
 
Evaluable for response: Only patients who receive both infusions will be evaluable for 
response.  
 
Evaluable for adverse events: All patients who received the first infusion will be evaluable 
for adverse events.   
 
9.4 Stopping Rule 
 
If there are 2 patients with grade 4 events considered possibly related to the study drug, the 
study will be halted for review by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee and the FDA. 
  
10.0 MODIFIED FOLLOW-UP AND OFF STUDY CRITERIA  
 
10.1  Criteria for Modified Follow-Up 
The following criteria will result in the patient being ineligible for further treatment on 
the protocol, although response data will continue to be collected as applicable.  
 
 
10.1.1 Any patient who develops grade > III infusional and/or organ toxicity 
that is NOT (1) pre-existing, or (2) due to infection or (3) due to 
underlying malignancy and is considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug. In such patients, the toxicities will be followed until resolution or their off-study date. Although no toxicity 
has been associated with the infusion of this product in patients with 
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we will actively look for 
evidence of any adverse events, such  as cytokine release syndrome. 
 
10.1.2 Any patient who receives any other hematopoietic progenitor cell 
product.  In such patients, adverse event data collection will cease.  
 
10.1.3 Any patient who receives therapy for progression of their breast 
cancer.  In such patients, adverse event data collection will cease.  
 
 
10.1.4 Any patient who desires to withdraw from the study or if the physician 
feels that it is in the best interest of the patient, treatment will be 
discontinued.

CRS Grading Scale 
Grade Symptoms 
1  Symptoms are not life threatening and require symptomatic treatment 
only (e.g. fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgia, malaise)  
2  Symptoms require and respond to moderate intervention  
 Oxygen requirement <40% or hypot ension responsive to fluids or  
 low dose of one vasopressor or Grade 2 organ toxicity  
3  Symptoms require and respond to aggressive intervention  
 Oxygen requirement ≥ 40% or  
hypotension requiring high dose or multiple vasopressors or  
 Grade 3 organ toxicity or Grade 4 transaminitis  
4  Life-threatening symptoms 
 Requirements for ventilator support or  
Grade 4 organ toxicity (excluding transaminitis)  
5  Death

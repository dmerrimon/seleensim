Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 7 of 96 Statistical analyses:  Two separate a nalyses will be conducted, one for the double -masked 
phase (Day 1 through Week 48), and the second for the entire study 
(Day 1 through Week 240). For patients randomized to placebo, two 
baselines will be used, one at randomization (Visit 2, Day 1) and the 
other at first dose of open -label ataluren (Visit 4, 48 weeks) for the 
analyses outlined below.  
a) Analyses on the double -masked phase (Day 1 through Week 48).  
Both placebo and ataluren will be presented and comparison will be 
made through 48 weeks betwe en these two treatment groups. For the 
analyses of the double -masked phase, assessments at randomization 
(Visit 2 [Day 1]) will serve as baseline.  
b) Analyses of the entire study (Visit 2,  Day 1 through Week 240).  
Efficacy will be presented based on two different baselines for 
placebo, one baseline at randomization (Visit  2) and the other baseline 
at Week 48 when placebo subjects first take open -label ataluren. Three 
analysis groups will be  presented:  
1) ataluren (all  visits),  
2) placebo (all visits) with Visit 2 assessments serving as 
baseline, and  
3) combined groups with baseline at the first dose of ataluren 
(i.e., randomization -Visit 2 for ataluren patients and at the 
first dose of open -label ataluren (Visit 4, 48 wee ks) for 
placebo patients).  
Safety data for the entire study will be presented for the combined 
group for patients receiving ataluren.  
By-subject listings will be created for each eCRF module.  Summary 
tables for continuous varia bles will contain the foll owing statistics: N, 
mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, minimum, 
maximum, and 95% confidence interval (CIs), as appropriate.  
Summary tables for categorical variables will include N, percentage, 
and 95% CIs on the p ercentage.  Any CIs for pr oportions will be 
computed using normal approximation, if the number of the events is 
at least five.  Otherwise, CIs using an exact method will be provided.  
Graphical techniques will be used when such methods are appropriate 
and informative.  For safety s ummaries, CIs will not be presented, 
unless specified otherwise.  
Transformations of the data may be explored if warranted by the 
distribution of the data.  
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be two -sided at the 
0.05 level of significance.  
All analyses will be performed using SAS® (Version 9.0 or higher).

1.1 Introduction  
Congenital aniridia, a familial condition with autosomal dominant inheritance, is a bilateral, 
panocular disorder affecting the cornea, iris, intraocular pressure , lens, fovea, and optic nerve  
(Valenzuela 2004 , Netland 2011 , Hingorani 2012 , Chang 2014 ).  The vast majority of cases 
of aniridia are associated with  mutations in the paired box 6 ( PAX6) gene, which is located 
on chromosome 11p13 and regulates ocular development.  The phenotype is variable 
between and within families; however, affected individuals usually show little variability 
between the two eyes.  Individuals with aniridia characteris tically show absence of iris, 
nystagmus, impaired visual acuity (usually 20/100 to 20/200), and foveal hy poplasia. 
Aniridia mainly manifests in the eye, but there are additional characteristics of aniridia, 
including obesity  (Netland 2011 ) and impaired glucose tole rance and/or diabetes  (Wen 2009 ) 
as PAX6 regulates not only eye development but also islet cell developmen t (Yasuda 2002 ).  
PAX6 continues to be expressed through adulthood, contributing to maintenance of function 
in the eye and other tissues.  Individuals with isolated aniridia may show reduced olfaction 
and cognition, beh avioral problems, or developmental delay.  
Many of the trea tment methods used today for aniridia are ineffective.  Tinted or 
photochromic lenses may be used to reduce light sensitivity.  Surgical management of some 
of the visually disabling manifestations, such as cataract surgery or glaucoma shunt surgery, 
has provided improvement in eyesight visual acuity.  However, due to the structural defects, 
patients with aniridia  often experience post -operative complications, including aniridic 
fibrosis syndrome, which together with limbal stem cell deficiency leads to deco mpensation 
of the cornea or aniridia -related keratopathy.  The eyesight vision of most aniridia patients 
progressively declines to the point of legal blindness. Corneal disease may be treated with 
lubricants, mucolytics, or punctual occlusion.  Corneal tra nsplants, or keratoplasty, can be 
performed on patients with aniridia, but often produce only temporary vision improvements.  
The treatment of keratopathy associated with aniridia via amniotic membr ane transplant has 
proven to be only a temporary solution for aniridia patients suffering from moderate 
keratopathy.  In patients with severe keratopathy who exhibit limbal insufficiency, treatment 
involves limbus transplant of lumbar cells.  Self -transplants are excluded since aniridia 
usually affects both eyes,  therefore patients must receive allografts from compatible healthy 
relatives or cadavers and be treated with oral immunosuppression treatment post -transplant to 
alleviate the risk of rejection.  
Currently, there are no pharmacological approaches to the tre atment of aniridia.  There is a 
high unmet medical need for a safe, convenient treatment targeting the underlying cause of 
this orphan genetic disorder.  
Nonsense mutations are the cause of congenita l aniridia in ~40% of patients  (Tzoulaki 2005 ).  
Nonsense mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA) correspond to premature stop codons in 
messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA).  PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, NJ, USA, 
has discovered and developed ataluren, a no vel, orally available, small -molecule drug that 
promotes ribosomal readthrough of mRNA containing a premature stop codon.  Through this 
mechanism of action, ataluren has the potential to overcome the genetic defect in those 
patients for whom a nonsense mut ation causes aniridia . 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 19 of 96 Ataluren has demonstrated  readthrough activity in a wide range of preclinical models of 
nonsense mutation diseases, including nonsense mutation aniridia.  In P AX6Sey+/– mice with a 
nonsense mutation in the mouse P AX6 gene, ataluren t reatment during the postnatal period 
not only in hibited disease progression but also stably reversed corneal, lens, and retinal 
malformation defects and restored electrical and behavioral responses of the retina 
(Gregory Evans 2014 ).  Pharmacological activity of ataluren also has been documented in 
nonsense mu tation choroideremia  (Tracey-White 2014 ), nonsense mutation retinitis 
pigmentosa (Schwarz 2015 ), nonsense mutation Duchenn e muscular dystrophy (nmDMD)  
(Welch 2007 ), nonsense mutation cystic  fibrosis (nmCF) (Du 2008), and various other 
nonsense mutation genetic disorders.  In nonclinical neurological, respiratory, and 
cardiovascular safety pharmacology stu dies, ataluren ha s shown no adverse effects.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic assessments performed in vitro and in vivo have documented 
selective readthrough of premature stop codons without readthrough of normal stop codons.  
Toxicology studies in mice through  1 month, in rats  through 6 months, and in dogs through 
1 year have indicated acceptable tolerability and support dosing in subjects ≥ 2 years old . 
Phase 1 clinical trials in which 62 healthy volunteers (ages 18 to 30 years) were administered 
ataluren at doses ranging from a single dose of 3  mg/kg to 50 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days 
demonstrated that oral atalu ren can achieve target plasma concentrations associated with 
activity in preclinical testing.  Phase 2a studies in 77 subjects (ages 6 to 57 years) with nmCF 
receiving oral ataluren for periods of 14 days through 12 weeks demonstrated that oral 
ataluren is  generally well tolerated and can generate production of apically local ized 
epithelial cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR) protein.  Phase 2a 
studies in 38 subjects (ages 5 to 17 years) with nmDM D administered oral ataluren through 
28 days confirm the ataluren safety profile and demonstrated evidence of pharmacodynamic 
activity, with improvements in muscle expression of dystr ophin.  Phase 2b/3, 
placebo-controlled, 48 week studies in nmCF and nmDMD support the long -term safety of 
chronic ataluren administration and indicate that ataluren treatment is associated with clinical 
benefit (Bushby 2014 , Kerem 2014 ).  In July 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
conditionally approved ataluren for the treatment of nmDMD  and it has been subsequently 
renewed five times. 
1.2 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, stratified, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled 
study with a 4-week screening period, a 144-week treatment period, an optional 96 -week 
open label sub -study, and a 4-week post -treatment follow -up period (either stud y completion 
or early termination).  A minimum of 36 subjects with no nsense mutation aniridia who are 
≥2 years of age are planned for enrollment into this study at investigator sites in US and 
Canada. 
During the 4-week screening period, subjects will be as sessed for eligibility.  
Eligible subjects will enter the 144-week treatment period consisting of two stages: 
● Stage 1 (Weeks 1 to 48) during which subjects will receive either ataluren or 
placebo in a masked fashion; 
● Stage 2 (Weeks 49 to 144) during which s ubjects will receive open -label ataluren.  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 20 of 96 Eligible subjects will be r andomized in a masked 2:1 fashion to either ataluren or placebo.  
Randomizatio n will be stratified by age:  ≤ 10 years versus >10 years.  Masked study drug 
will be dosed three times a day (TID): 10 mg/kg in the morning, 10  mg/kg at midday, and 
20 mg/kg in the evening for 48 weeks.  Subjects (or parent/legal guardian) will record each  
dose on a diary card provided by PTC Therapeutics.   
After completion of the Stage 1 ( Week 48), subjects will be eligible for an additional 
96 weeks of open -label ataluren treatment.  Subjects w ho received ataluren during Stage 1 
will continue to receive ataluren; subjects who had been randomized to placebo will receive 
ataluren during Stage 2.  
There will be an optional sub -study at the end of the Stage 2 Open -Label Extension. Subjects 
will be ab le to consent to receive an additional 96 weeks of ataluren t reatment, return ing to 
the clinic every 24 weeks . The assessments to be conducted are outlined in the schedule of 
events.  Subjects that choose not to participate in the sub -study will be required to complete 
the Post-treatment follow-up visit at the end o f the Stage 2 Open -Label Extension . The start 
of the sub -study will require prior approval of a protocol amendment from applicable IRBs 
and will continue for 96 week s or until commercial availability of ataluren  for this indication , 
whichever is first,  or until a positive risk -benefit assessment in this indication is not 
demonstrated.  
After the subject’s last dose of ataluren, there will be a 4 -week post -treatment follow -up 
period.  Analyses of the double -masked phase will be conducted after the last subjec t has 
completed Week 96.

V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 21 of 96 2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Disease Indication  
Aniridia, a familial condition wit h autosomal dominant inheritance, is a bilateral panocular 
disorder affecting the cornea, iris, intraocular pressure , lens, fovea, and optic nerve.  Aniridia 
is caused by mutations in the PAX6 gene, which is located on chr omosome 11p13 and 
regulates ocular  development.  The phenotype is variable between and within families; 
however, affected individuals usually show little variability between the two eyes.  
Individuals with aniridia characteristically show absence of iris, nystagmus, impaired visual 
acuity (usually 20/100 to 20/200), and foveal hypoplasia.  Milder forms of aniridia with 
subtle iris architecture changes, good vision, and normal foveal structure do occur.  Other 
abnormalities include corneal changes, glaucoma,  cataract, lens subluxation, strab ismus, 
optic nerve coloboma and hypoplasia, and occasionally microphthalmia.  
Aniridia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations including nonsense 
mutations (premature stop codons), frameshift inserti ons and deletions, and splice muta tions 
in the PAX6 gene located on chromosome 11p13.  The PAX6 gene is a transcriptional 
regulator that is expressed in the iris tissue and other ocular tissues derived from neural crest 
cells. 
Reduction in visual acuity  (usually 20/100 –20/200), a universal  abnormality associated with 
aniridia, usually starts at birth and is caused by foveal hypoplasia or optic nerve hypoplasia.  
As the patient reaches adulthood visual acuity progressively declines due to the occurrence of 
cataracts, nystagmus, amblyopia, gl aucoma, and corneal keratopathy.  Most children with 
aniridia present at birth with an obvious iris or pupillary abnormality or in infancy with 
nystagmus (usually apparent by six weeks of age).  Congenital glaucoma rarely occurs in 
aniridia; in such cases,  a large corneal diameter and corneal edema may be the presenting 
findings.  Cataracts develop at a young age in 50 to 85% of aniridia patients usually prior to 
20 years of age.  
Ocular manifestations of aniridia are descri bed below:  
● Iris.  The most obvious  ocular abnormality is iris hypoplasia.  The severity varies 
from a nearly normal iris to almost complete iris absence in which a small stump 
of residual iris tissue is visible on gonioscopy, anterior segment optical coher ence 
tomography ( OCT), or ultrasou nd biomicroscopy.  In less extreme cases, the pupil 
size may be normal, but there may be loss of the iris surface architecture or 
presence of iris transillumination.  Other iris changes include partial iris defects 
(resembling a coloboma) or eccentric or m isshapen pupils and iris ectropion.  
● Lens.  Congenital lens opacities are common. Often there is persistent 
vascularization of the anterior lens capsule (tunica vasculosa lentis) or remnants of 
the pupillary membrane.  The lens opacities are rarely dense en ough to require lens 
extraction in infan cy, but visually significant lens opacities eventually develop in 
50% to 85% of affected individuals, often in the teens or early adulthood .

● Cornea.  Keratopathy (corneal degeneration) is a relatively late manifestation with 
multifactorial caus es including limbal stem cell abnormalit ies and abnormal 
wound healing occurring in approximately 80% of the eyes of aniridia patients and 
causes visual disturbances in 26% of eyes.  Changes vary from mild peripheral 
vascularization to pan -corneal vascular ization, opacification, and keratinizati on. 
● Fovea.  Foveal hypoplasia is usually (but not always) present.  Findings include 
reduced foveal reflex, macular hypopigmentation, and crossing of the usual foveal 
avascular zone by retinal vessels.  OCT images ca n clearly delineate the absence 
of normal foveal architecture.  
● Optic nerve .  Optic nerve hypoplasia ( i.e., the optic nerve head appears 
abnormally small) may occur in aniridia patients, as well as optic nerve coloboma.  
● Retina.  Retinal detachment may occur , probably as a consequence of a high 
myopia or previous intraocular surgery.  Very rarely, primary retinal 
manifestations such as an exudative vascular retinopathy or chorioretinal 
degeneration may occur.  
● Other ocular manifestations .  Affected individuals  may have significant 
refractive errors and may develop a secondary strabismus (squint, eye 
misalignment).  
Aniridia mainly manifests in the eye, but there are additional characteristics of 
aniridia, including effects on hearing and the central nervous syst em as well as 
obesity and glucose intole rance.  Systemic manifestations associated with aniridia 
are described below:  
● Central nervous system .  Individuals with isolated aniridia may show reduced 
olfaction and cognition, behavioral problems, or developmenta l delay. 
● Hearing.  Central auditory proc essing difficulties (from abnormal 
interhemispheric transfer) present in some individuals may cause hearing 
difficulties.  This finding is particularly important in the context of associated 
visual impairment.  
● Obesity.  Patients with aniridia are significa ntly more likely to be classified as 
overweight or obese compared with siblings without aniridia.  The high prevalence 
of obesity in aniridic patients may be related to endocrine pancreatic function, 
which is influen ced by PAX6 gene expression.  
● Glucose Int olerance.  PAX6 regulates not only eye development but also islet cell 
development.  In patients with aniridia, PAX6 mutations are associated with 
impaired glucose tolerance and/or diabetes.  

PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 23 of 96 Aniridia is diagnosed via  a clinical examination entailing slit l amp examination, fundoscopy, 
iris fluorescein angiography, OCT, and high -frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy.  Gene 
sequencing is performed to identify the disease -causing mutation.  
Many of the treatment methods used today for aniridia are ineffective.  Sur gical management 
of some of the visually disabling manifestations, such as cataract surgery or glaucoma shunt 
surgery, has provided improvement in eyesight.  However, due to the structural defects, 
aniridia patients often experience post -operative complica tions, including aniridic fibrosis 
syndrome, which leads to decompensation of the cornea or aniridia -related keratopathy.  The 
eyesight of most aniridia patients progressively declines to the point of legal blindness .  
Corneal transplants, or keratoplasty,  can be performed on patients with aniridia, but often 
produce only temporary vision improvements.  The treatment of keratopathy associated with 
aniridia via amniotic membrane transplant has proven to be only a tempo rary solution for 
aniridia patients suff ering from moderate keratopathy.  In patients with severe keratopathy 
who exhibit limbal insufficiency, treatment involves limbus tr ansplant of lumbar cells.  
Self-transplants are excluded since aniridia usually affe cts both eyes, therefore patients must 
receive allografts from compatible healthy relatives or cadavers and be treated with oral 
immunosuppression treatment post -transplant to alleviate the risk of rejection.  
2.2 Ataluren  
2.2.1 Therapeutic Rationale  
Among the severa l types of disease -causing mutations, a nonsense mutation is an alteration 
in one of the nucleotides of DNA that, when copied to mRNA, is interpreted as a stop signal 
by the ribosomal cellular translational machinery.  The presence of such a premature stop  
signal within the protein -coding region  of the mRNA for PAX6 tells the ribosomes to halt 
production of the protein before the full -length protein is completed.  The resulting truncated 
PAX6 is too short to serve its necessary function and causes disease . 
Drugs with translation -modifying mechanisms of action, such as the aminoglycoside 
antibiotics ( e.g., gentamicin), can modulate the effects of nonsense mutations in experimental 
systems.  By binding to the ribosomes, such agents permit the ribosomes to rein terpret the  
nonsense mutation stop signal in mRNA such that they can move through the obstruction by 
inserting an amino acid and continuing the translation process to produce a full -length 
functional protein.  In experimental animal systems and in pilot cl inical stud ies in nmCF, 
treatment with high concentrations of gentamicin has restored production of functional CFTR 
(Clancy 2001 , Du 2002, Wilschanski 2003 ).  Similarly, preclinical and clinical studies in 
nmDMD have demonstrat ed gentamicin -induced restoration of dystrophin, the structural 
protein that is defectiv e in that disease  (Barton-Davis 1999 , Politano 2003 ).  Nonsense 
suppression also has been documented in a number of ocular disorders (Wang 2015 ).  
Current data suggest that the geometry of mRNA and associated initiation -termination 
proteins is critically different at a premature stop c odon than at a normal stop codon.  This 
may expla in why a drug can permit the ribosomes to selectively read through the premature 
stop codon, but will not allow the ribosomes to read through the normal stop codon at the end 
of the mRNA protein -coding regio n (Sachs 2000, Welch 2000 , Amrani 2004 ).  Because 
serious renal and otic toxicities, and the need for parenter al administration, preclude the 
long-term clinical use of gentamicin, there has been considerable interest in the identification 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI

V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 24 of 96 of safer and more conveniently administered, low -molecular -weight, synthetic compounds 
with the ability to promote readthrough of disease -causing nonsense mutations . 
PTC Therapeutics , Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company involved in the discovery and 
development of new therapies for genetic diseases.  PTC Therapeutics  has conducted a drug 
discovery program with the objective of fin ding and developing new agents that overcome 
the effects of n onsense mutations.  A high -throughput screening program identified sets of 
novel, non -aminoglycoside chemical structures that selectively induce ribosomal 
read-through of premature stop codons in  mRNA.  Chemical optimization, pharmacologic 
characterization , and toxicological evaluation led to identification of ataluren as an orally 
bioavailable, small molecule with potential clinical utility in treating genetic diso rders 
through induction of read -through of nonsense mutations and production of full -length, 
functional proteins (Welch 2007 , Du 2008, Gregory-Evans 2014 ).  In the subset of patients 
whose disease is mediated by a nonsense m utation, ataluren may offer an effective therapy 
by restoring critical protein production for aniridia and other disabling  and life-threatening 
genetic disorders . 
In July 2014, the EMA conditionally approved ataluren for the treatment of nmDMD  and it 
has been subsequently renewed five times . 
2.2.1.1 Chemical Description  
Ataluren is a new chemical entity with a chemical formula of C 15H9FN2O3 and a molecular 
weight of 284.2 Daltons.  Ataluren is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System C lass 2 
compound,  possessing low aqueous solubility (<31  
g/mL) but high permeability across 
gastrointestinal epithelium, consistent with its high oral  bioavailability.  The drug is 
manufactured and formulated under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and is 
provided as a vanilla -flavored, white to off -white granules for oral suspension.  
2.2.1.2 Nonclinical Studies  
Refer to the Ataluren Investigator Broc hure for a detailed presentation of efficacy 
pharmacology, safety pharmacology, toxicology, and pharmacokinetic ( PK) data from 
ataluren nonclinical studies.  A study of ataluren in a nonclinical model of aniridia is 
described below.  
Ataluren was evaluated in the small -eye mouse model of nonsense mutation aniridia 
(PAX6Sey+/-) (Gregory-Evans 2014 ).  Aniridia in the small eye mo use model is caused by a 
naturally occurring nonsense mutation in the mouse P AX6 gene. 
Treatment with ataluren caused an increase in the PAX6 protein by 90% in the corneal and 
retinal epithelium protein lysates compared to wild -type mice ( Figure 2) as measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .  A mouse model containing a splice -site mutation in 
PAX6 (PAX6Sey-1Neu) did not show a response to ataluren therapy, demonstrating that 
ataluren is specific to nonsense mutation -mediated disease.

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 25 of 96 Dramatic improvements in the eye morphology were observed in mice treated for 10 days by 
subcutaneous injection (30 mg/kg qd) compared to untreated mice.  Untreated nmP AX6 
mutant eyes at postnatal day 4 (P4) ( Figure 2, lower left panel) showed thickening of the 
cornea, the appearance of a lenticular stalk in which the underdeveloped lens was attached to 
the cornea, and thickening of the retina with abnormal in -folding at the ciliary margin and by 
P14 (Figure 2, lower middle panel) there is progressive in -folding of the retina and an 
abnormally small lens is observed.  In contrast, when ataluren was administered by 
subcutaneous injection at 30 mg/kg qd for 10 days (P4 to P14) retinal in -folding was 
prevented and the  size of the lens increased by 70% ( Figure 2, lower right panel).

Retinal sections from wild -type systemically -treated PAX6  mutant mice (30 mg/kg subcutaneous injection from 
P4-14) and untreated nmPAX6 mice, showing the photoreceptor inner segments (IS)  and outer segments (OS) 
are shorter in treated mice (n=6).  The outer nuclear layers (ONL) are more densely packed in the tre ated mice 
compared with those in the wild -type mice.  All the retinal layers in the untreated mice are thinner than normal .  
Dramatic improvements in the response to light as measured by electroretinograms were 
observed in mice treated for 46 days by subcu taneous injection (30 mg/kg qd) compared to 
untreated mice (Figure 4: compare Trace 2 [mutant untreated] to Trace 3 [subcutaneous 
administration 30 mg/kg daily P14-P60]).  Dramatic improvements were also observed in 
mice administered the topical formulations for 46 days ( Figure 4: compare Trace 4 
[1% ataluren twice a day  P14-P60] to Trace 2).

responses (n = 6). Si gnificance determined by 1 -way ANOVA with Tukey post -hoc tests *P<0.05; **P<0.01.).  
As shown above ( Figure 4), treatment  with ataluren resulted in increased response of the 
retina to light stimulation, demonstrating that the PAX6 protein produced was functional.  
The optokinetic tracking response was measured to determine changes in behavioral response 
mediated through the retina-brain circuitry as an approximation for visual acuity.  These 
results support the previou s observations that ataluren treatment improves the morphology of 
the eye and the response of the retina to light by demonstrating that PAX6 protein is 
produced and is functional as measured by optokinetic tracking.  
Taken together, these results demonstrat e that ataluren treatment of the nonsense mutation 
small eye enables readthrough of the nonsense codon in the P AX6 mRNA producing 
full-length functional PAX6 pr otein.  The increased PAX6 protein results in the reversal of 
the congenital ocular malformation  associated with the disease.  These results demonstrate 
that ataluren has the potential to be a promising treatment for the underlying cause of 
aniridia.

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 34 of 96 5 ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES  
5.1 Number of Subjects  
A minimum of 36 subjects with nons ense mutation aniridia who are ≥2 years of age will  be 
enrolled into this study at investigative sites in the US and Canada.  
5.2 Subject Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited from aniridia populations who receive care at or are referred to the 
investigational  site for evaluation .  The PI or sub-investigator will discuss the possibility of 
participation directly with study candidates and/or parent/legal guardian in the clinic and who 
may be appropriate subjects for the study . 
Subjects will be recruited for the sub-study from the parent study.  
5.3 Screening  
The investigator must inform each study candidate and/or parent/legal guardian of the nature 
of the study, explain the potential risks, and obtain written informed consent/assent from the 
study candidate and/or t he parent(s)/legal guardian (as r equired by local regulations) prior to 
performing any study related screening procedures.  Once written informed consent/assent 
has been obtained, screening procedures for determination of eligibility can be initiated . 
At the time the study candidate signs  the informed consent a site representative should access 
the Interactive Voice Response/Interactive Web Response (IVR/IWR) system to indicate that 
a candidate is being screened.  The caller will need to supply the IVR/IWR system with 
information, includin g the following : 
● Site number as previously assigned by PTC Therapeutics  
● Subject initials (as allowed by local regulations)  
● Subject date of birth (as allowed by local regulations)  
● Age 
● Date of Screening (Visit 1)  
● Documentatio n of the presence of a nonsense m utation in of the PAX6 gene  
● Subject body weight (in kilograms)  
The IVR/IWR will use this information to maintain a central screening log documenting that 
screening occurred.  The screening subject number must be used for su bject identification on 
all study related documents (electronic case report forms [eCRFs], clinic notes, laboratory 
samples, etc.).  Upon successful completion of the call and confirmation of all subject 
eligibility requirements, the subject may proceed to Baseline procedures.  
5.4 Randomization and Stratification  
The IVR/IWR system will register each subject with a unique subject identification number 
(a 3-digit site number followed by a 3-digit subject number [3-digit stratum number + 3 -digit 
randomization numb er]).  The subject ma y be enrolled and begin ataluren or placebo 
administration after confirmation of eligibility has been received from  the IVR/IWR system .

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 35 of 96 6 STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
6.1 Investigational Product  
6.1.1 Ataluren  
Masked ataluren (treatment through Week 48) as well as open -label ataluren (treatment from 
Week 49 to Week 144 and during the sub-study) will be provide d as granules for oral 
suspension with a white to off -white powder appearance .  The drug substance and drug 
product are manufactured under cGMP conditions.  The formulation includes matrix and 
suspending agents, surfactants, and various excipients that aid in the manufacturing process.  
The granules for oral suspension are packaged  in aluminum -foil, child -resistant sachets 
(packets) and supplied i n dose strengths containing 125, 250, or 1000 mg of the active drug 
substance.   For administration, the powder in the sachet may be mixed with water, fruit juice, 
fruit punch, or milk (skim , 1% fat, 2% fat, whole milk, chocolate milk, soy milk, or 
lactose-free milk), or semi -solid food (yogurt, pudding, or applesauce) . 
6.1.2 Placebo 
A white to off -white granule placebo formulation will be provided for oral suspension.  The 
placebo formulation has been manufactured under cGMP conditions.  The dry granules and 
the liquid suspension of the drug match the active formulation in appearance, odor, and taste.  
The placebo formulation contains excipients similar to those used in the active product.  The 
placebo is packaged in the same aluminum -foil, child -resistant sachets  using weights and 
volumes to match  each of the 125, 250, and 1000 mg dose strengths of active drug sachets.  
6.1.3 Packaging and Labeling  
Drug kits will be provided, each of which contains 90 sachets of one of the dose strengths 
(125, 250, or 1000 mg or matching  placebo).  Sachets and cartons will be color coded to 
indicate dosage strength (125 mg – yellow, 250 mg – pink, 1000 mg – blue). 
Each kit will have a unique kit ID number.  During Stage 1,  labeling for active drug and 
placebo will be identical.  Labels wi ll be provided in appropriate languages as required by 
each country in which the study is conducted.  The content of the labeling will be in 
accordance with local regulatory specifications and requirements.  
Open-label ataluren will be provided  during Stage  2 and during the sub -study. 
6.1.4 Study Drug Dispensing  
During the parent study  (masked Stage 1 and open -label Stage 2)  and the sub -study, dosing 
of ataluren will be based on milligrams of drug per kilogram of subject body weight and will 
be adjusted to allow f or dosing with up to 2 of the available sachet dose strengths (125  mg, 
250 mg, and/or 1000  mg).  The sachet dose strengths and number o f sachets to be taken per 
dose will be calculated and provided by the IVR/IWR system . 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 36 of 96 The clinic staff ( e.g., pharmacist or other qualified person) will be responsible for dispensing 
study drug according to the IVR/IWR system directions.  At the time of ra ndomization, the 
IVR/IWR system will provide the clinic staff with the subject randomization number and the 
kit ID number s designating the kits to be dispensed.  Multiple kits may be dispensed at a 
single visit (maximum of two different strengths) . 
The clinic staff ( e.g., pharmacist or other qualified person) will write the subject number on  
each kit that is dispensed.  A 180-day supply (2 kits each containing 90 sachets; 24 weeks + 
6 days) of study drug will be provided for each two 24-week study period s of Stage 1, the 
four 24-week study periods of Stage 2, and the four 24-week study periods during the sub -
study. 
Because of potential changes in subject body weight over time, at Week 24 (Visit 3) and 
every 24 weeks thereafter, a dose adjustment will be made based on the subject’s body 
weight at that visit.  Depending upon the magnitude of change in subject body weig ht since 
baseline, the number and strengths of sachets to be used by the subject may remain the same 
or may be adjusted . 
6.1.5 Return of Study Drug  
Subjects and/or parents/caregivers should return all remaining ataluren (all unused sachets) to 
the study site at each onsite  study visit.  The Study Drug Administration Record will serve as 
the source document for drug supply to the subjects and will document the return of any 
unused drug for compliance assessments . 
6.1.6 Storage and Stability  
Kits containing sachets of st udy drug wi ll be stored at controlled room temperature 
(~15 to 30°C).  The available stability data from representative samples support the use of the 
drug product for  48 months when stored at room temperature.  The stability of the clinical 
study samples or represen tative samples may be monitored, as appropriate, to support the 
clinical study . 
6.1.7 Study Drug Accountability  
Study personnel must ensure that all ataluren supplies are kept in a temperature -monitored, 
secure locked area with access limited to autho rized perso nnel.  Ataluren must not be used 
outside the context of this protocol.  Under no circumstances should the investigator or site 
personnel supply ataluren to other investigators or clinics or allow the ataluren supplies to be 
used other than as di rected by t his protocol.  
The investigator and/or the responsible site personnel must maintain accurate records of the 
receipt of all ataluren shipped by PTC  Therapeutics or its designee, including, but not limited 
to, the date received, lot number, amount received, a nd the disposition of all ataluren.  
Current dispensing records must also be maintained that include the subject’s assigned study 
number, date and amount of ataluren dispensed, and relevant lot and sachet numbers . 
Unused clinical supplies must b e destroyed  or returned to PTC  Therapeutics or its designee.  
Records documenting the date of study drug destruction or shipping, relevant sachet 
numbers, and amount shipped should be kept in the investigator site study file.

V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 37 of 96 6.1.8 Overdose Precautions  
For any subject expe riencing an overdose (administration of an ataluren dose >4  times the 
intended total daily dose level for this protocol [>160  mg/kg/day]), observation for any 
symptomatic side effects should be instituted, and vital signs an d biochemical and 
hematological parameters should be followed closely (consistent with the protocol or more 
frequently, as needed).  Appropriate supportive management to mitigate adverse effects 
should be initiated.  Pending the acquisition of sufficient h uman experience with the drug, 
use of gastric lavage or induction of emesis is not specifically recommended nor 
contraindicated . 
The PTC Therapeutics medical monitor or designee must be contacted if an overdose occurs, 
and the overdose must be reported as an adverse event ( AE) according to Section 9.1.1 (or as 
a serious adverse event  [SAE] if it meets the applicable criteria for an SAE in Section 9.1.2). 
6.1.9 Inadvertent Exposure and Spill Precautions  
Reference can be made to the Atalur en Investigator Brochure for current information on 
inadvertent exposures and spill precautions . 
6.2 Study Drug Treatment  
6.2.1 Stratification and Randomization  
After a subject has co mpleted the necessary screening assessments and has been confirmed to 
be eligible b y the investigator, the subject can be randomized into the study.  
During Stage 1, a minimum of 36 eligible subjects will be stratified by age group ( ≤10 years 
old versus >10 years old)  and then be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2  possible treatment 
assignments: 
• Ataluren (10, 10, 20  mg/kg) 
• Placebo 
The first dose of study drug will be administered in the clinic and the date and time of 
administration will be recorded.  At the end of each Stage, the last dose of study drug will be 
taken on the evening befor e the clinic visit ( i.e., the night before the Visit 4/Week 48 [end of 
Stage 1], the night before Visit 8 (EOS/ET)/Week 144 [end of Stage 2 ], and the night b efore 
Visit 12 (end of Sub -study)/Week 2 40). 
6.2.1.1 Masked Dosing 
During Stage 1, the identity of the trea tments will be concealed by the use of a placebo that is 
matched to the active drug in appearance, taste, odor, packaging, labeling, and schedule of 
administration.  Unmasking  will only occur in the case of subject emergencies before study 
completion and a t the conclusion of the study.  Except for emergency unmasking , individual 
subjects, subjects/caregivers, and site personnel will not be informed of the randomized 
treatment assignments until the implications of revealing such data for the overall ataluren  
clinical development program have been determined by PTC  Therapeutics.  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 38 of 96 Emergency unmasking should only occur after the PI deems the subject ’s emergency 
warrants the unmasking of  the treatment .  Unmasking of the treatment can only be performed 
by the PI in  the IVR/IWR system.  Unmasking instructions are provided in the IVR/IWR 
system instruction manual.  
6.2.1.2 Open-Label Dosing  
After completion of the Stage 1 ( Week 48), subjects will be eligible for an additional 
96 weeks of open -label ataluren treatment.  Subject s who received ataluren during Stage 1 
will continue to receive ataluren; subjects who had been randomized to placebo will receive 
ataluren during Stage 2. Upon completion of the parent study , subjects will be eligible to 
continue receiving open -label ataluren for an additional 96 weeks in the sub -study. 
6.2.2 Drug Administration Plan  
Study drug ( masked ataluren or placebo [during Stage 1] as well as open -label ataluren 
[during Stage 2  and the sub -study]) will be administered  TID.  The dose level to be 
administer ed is: 10 mg/kg in the morning, 10  mg/kg at midday, and 20  mg/kg in the evening.  
6.2.3 Schedule of Administration  
Throughout the study ( i.e., during the parent study  and the sub -study), study drug should be 
taken TID – the 1st dose (10  mg/kg) in the morning, the  2nd dose (10  mg/kg) at mid -day, and 
the 3rd dose (20  mg/kg) in the evening.  Intervals for dosing should be ~6 hours (±1 hour) 
between morning and  mid-day doses, ~6  hours (±1 hour) between mid -day and evening 
doses, and ~12  hours (±1  hour) between evening  doses and the morning dose on the next day.  
6.2.4 Instructions for Delays in Dosing  
Dosing delays should be handled as follows:  
• If dosing of ataluren is  delayed by ≤1 hour, the planned dose should be taken 
with no changes to the subsequent dose schedules . 
• If ataluren dosing is delayed by >1 hour but ≤4  hours, the planned dose should 
be taken; however, all future doses for that day should be shifted later by an 
approximately corresponding amount . 
• If ataluren dosing is delayed by 4 hours, the dose should not be t aken.  Ataluren 
administration may continue but the missed dose should not be taken , and the 
planned timing of subsequent study drug dosing s hould not be altered.  
6.2.5 Study Drug Preparation and Storage  
Once at the investigational site and/or with the subject/c aregiver, study drug sachets should 
be stored at room temperature, away from the reach of children until time of reconstitution 
and should on ly be opened at the time of dose preparation.  The full contents of the sachets 
should be mixe d with at least 30 mL  (1 ounce) of  liquid (water, milk, fruit juice, fruit punch) , 
or 3 tablespoons of se mi-solid food  (yogurt, pudding, or applesauce) . The prepa red dose 
should be mixed well before administration .  The amount of the liquid can be increased based 
on subject  preference. 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 39 of 96 Each prepared dose is best administered immediately after preparation.   The prepared dose 
should be discarded if not consumed within 24 hours of preparation (if kept refrigerated), or 
within 3 hours of preparation (if kept at room temperature).  
The clinic staff will instruct each subject or parent/caregiver on the specific nu mber of 
sachets to be taken from each kit for each dose and will provide detailed oral directions 
regarding drug preparation.  In addition, detailed written drug mixing and do sing instructions 
will be provided to the subject or parent/caregiver when drug s upplies are dispensed.  A copy 
of these instructions will be maintained in the  investigator site study file.  
6.3 Safety Monitoring and Ataluren Treatment Modification  
6.3.1 Laboratory A bnormalities and Adverse Events Requiring Evaluation and 
Potential Drug Interrupt ion/Modification  
Subjects must be monitored closely for adverse events or laboratory abnormalities during the 
course of the study.  
For adverse events or laboratory abnormaliti es, the investigator will use judgment in 
determining whether the event or abnorm ality is clinically significant, whether diagnostic 
evaluation is warranted, and whether potential interruption of study drug treatment is 
appropriate.  In general, life -threatening (Grade 4) or severe (Grade 3) adverse events or 
laboratory abnormalities s hould be considered clinically significant, although recurrent or 
persistent moderate events (Grade 2) may also be considered clinically significant in certain 
circumstances.  Reference should be made to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 for grading the severity of adverse events and laboratory 
abnormalities.  
6.3.2 Evaluation of Adverse Events or Laboratory Abnormalities  
The PTC Therapeutics medi cal monitor or designee should be notified of any adverse event 
or laboratory abn ormality that leads to dose interruption and should be apprised of ancillary 
laboratory or other diagnostic findings and the evolving data from any work -up of the initial 
abnormality. 
Clinical evaluations for potential hepatic and renal toxicities may incl ude the following:  
• Hepatic:  The medical history, hepatitis screening results, all clinical blood 
values (particularly serum bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase [GGT], 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] values), 
and all concomitant medications should be reviewed.  Depending upon changes 
observed, the recommended diagnostic workup may include more frequent 
monitoring or further evaluations for  viral hepatitis and immune disorders; tests 
for cholelithiasis; or abdominal ult rasound, computed tomography, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), or other imaging methods.  
• Renal:  The medical history, all clinical blood and urine renal values, serum 
electrolytes, medications, and potential pre - or post-renal conditions should be 
reviewed.  Depending upon the changes observed, recommended diagnostic 
workup may include further evaluations of blood or urine; tests of glomerular

tomography , MRI, or other imaging metho ds; and/or renal biopsy.  
6.3.3 Instructions for Resuming Study Drug Administration after an Interruption 
for Safety Concerns  
In deciding whether to re -institute study drug after a d ose interruption for any clinically 
significant safety concern, the investigator in consultation with PTC Therapeutics should 
consider factors such as the following:  
• Type and severity of the adverse event or laboratory abnormality  
• The potential causal rela tionship of study drug  
• The subject’s status in terms of aniridia and other health  conditions  
• The ability to monitor for recurrence of the event  
If further evaluation reveals that the adverse event that led to dose interruption was not 
related to the study drug, study drug may be restarted.  
If the subject experiences a recurrence of a p revious abnormality that led to study drug dose 
interruption or experiences the new occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event or 
laboratory abnormality, the investigator sho uld interrupt study drug and confer with the 
PTC Therapeutics medical monitor or designee regarding the potential need to discontinue 
study drug permanently.  
6.3.4 Instructions for Discontinuation of Study Drug Administration for Safety 
Concerns  
If after appropr iate consideration of study drug interruption/modification and consultation 
with the PTC  Therapeutics medical monitor or designee, it is not appropriate for a subject to 
continue with study treatment, then study drug should be permanently discontinued.  If  
permanent discontinuation of stu dy drug is the result of an SAE, then a follow -up SAE report 
form should be completed (see Section  9.7).  In the case of a treatment discontinuation due to 
an adverse event  that is not an SAE, t he PTC Therapeutics medical monitor or designee 
should be notified (see Section 10).  In addition, details regarding the reasons  for 
discontinuation and the adverse events leading to the discontinua tion should be recorded in 
the source documents and in the appropriate eCRF.  The End of Treatment Visit eCRF 
should be completed and appropriate follow -up (at ~4 weeks as per protocol o r until recovery 
from or stabilization of the adverse event, whichever comes last) should be instit uted

V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 41 of 96 7 CONCOMITANT AND SUPPORTIVE THERAPY  
7.1 Concomitant Medications  
Other than the study drug, any treatments (including prescription and non -prescription drugs,  
health foods, herbal remedies, self -prescribed drugs, street drug, tobacco products, or alcohol)  
taken by a subject from the screening period through the 4 -Week End of Treatment 
Follow-Up are considered concomitant medications.  Information regarding all concomitant 
medications will be collected and documented in the concomitant medication page of the 
eCRF. 
7.1.1 Treatment for Aniridia -Related Conditions  
Surgery for aniridia -related conditions ( e.g., glaucoma, cataract) during this study is 
permitted.  
Study subj ects may receive supportive care medications ( e.g., drops, lubricants) consistent 
with local best p ractices and guidelines.  The use of topical cyclosporine is permitted.  
7.1.2 Nephrotoxic Medications  
Renal abnormalities were observed in a Phase 3 trial evaluati ng ataluren in subjects  ≥6 years 
of age with nmCF who were receiving concomitant IV aminoglycosides  (as described in the 
Ataluren Investigator Brochure).  Caution should therefore be exercised during concomitant 
use of study drug and potentially nephrotoxi c agents. 
In subjects wh o require treatment for serious infections, investigators should substitute other 
antibiotics for systemic aminoglycosides when clinically appropriate.  If IV aminoglycosides 
or other nephrotoxic antibiotics ( e.g., vancomycin) are a dministered, study drug must be 
interrupted during the course of antibiotic therapy.  Subjects requiring IV aminoglycoside or 
vancomycin therapy should be closely monitored in an appropriate setting, such as a hospital.  
In subjects receiving such agents, antibiotic drug levels a nd serum creatinine and blood urea 
nitrogen  (BUN) should be monitored closely as follows:  
• Creatinine and BUN should be measured:  
○ Prior to initiating IV aminoglycoside or vancomycin therapy  
○ Within 24 to 48 hours of the first antibiot ic administration (and f urther 
antibiotic dosing should be based on these results)  
○ At least twice a week during the course of antibiotic treatment  
• Antibiotic trough levels should be measured:  
○ Within 24 to 48 hours of the first antibiotic administration (an d further 
antibiotic dos ing should be based on these results)  
○ At intervals during the course of antibiotic treatment.  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 42 of 96 7.1.3 Hydration  
Because of the potential risk of renal dysfunction during periods of dehydration in subjects 
receiving ataluren, it is importan t to encourage study sub jects to maintain adequate hydration 
throughout the study.  Subjects should be adequately hydrated prior to receiving any 
potentially nephrotoxic agents, and hydration status should be carefully monitored 
throughout the administrati on of any agent with nep hrotoxic characteristics.  Investigators 
should be particularly vigilant with subjects who are experiencing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
fever, or laboratory evidence of dehydration.  
7.1.4 Other Concomitant Medications  
To the extent possib le, administration of an y prescription or over -the-counter drug products 
other than study medication should be minimized during the study period.  Subjects should 
be discouraged from use of “health supplements” ( e.g., creatine, glutamine, coenzyme Q), 
herbal remedies, growth horm one, self-prescribed drugs, street drugs, tobacco products, or 
alcohol at any time during the study.  
If considered necessary for the subject’s well -being, drugs for concomitant medical 
conditions or for symptom management may be given at the discretion of the investigator.  
The decision to authorize the use of any other drug(s) should take into account subject safety, 
the medical need, the potential for drug interactions, the possibility for masking symptoms of 
a more relevant und erlying event, and whether use of a concomitant medication will 
compromise the outcome or integrity of the study.  
Subjects/caregivers should be instructed about the importance of informing the clinic staff of 
the use of any drugs or remedies (whether presc ribed, over -the-counter, or  illicit) before and 
during the course of the study.  Information regarding any concomitant drugs taken by a 
subject during the course of the study and the reason for use will be recorded in the source 
documents and in the concom itant medication eCRF. 
7.1.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes  
As the primary route of ataluren metabolism is via glucuronidation by 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 -9 (UGT1A9), clinically significant interactions between 
ataluren and co -administered dru gs metabolized by cytochrom e P450 enzymes (CYPs) are 
unlikely.  In particular, ataluren is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5, and does not have induction potential on the major CYP enzymes.  
In vitro, ataluren is a weak inhib itor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, but in vivo drug -drug 
interactions mediated by these enzymes are not expected according to the criteria described 
in the EMA guideline on the investigation of drug interactions  (EMA 2012 ).  As an added 
measure of safety, however, investigators should pay s pecific attention to use of drugs that 
are known substrates of these enzymes, p articularly when such drugs may have a low 
therapeutic index.  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 43 of 96 Drugs that are metabolized by CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 that have low therapeutics indices (in 
particular, paclitaxel for CY P2C8 and coumarin anticoagulants [ e.g., warfarin],  phenytoin, or 
tolbutamide fo r CYP2C9) may be of particular concern and subjects who require the use of 
these drugs will not be enrolled to the study.  Coumarin anticoagulants are cleared by 
CYP2C9 and incr eases in plasma concentrations of coumarin anticoagulants may result in 
serious clinical consequences.  For subjects who require anticoagulation during the study, use 
of an alternative form of anticoagulation ( e.g., fractionated heparin) should be consider ed.  
Phenytoin is metabolized by CYP2C9 and concomitant use with ataluren may b e of potential 
concern.  For subjects who require anticonvulsant therapy during the study, use of alternative 
anticonvulsant drugs should be considered.  The metabolism of losar tan to its active 
metabolite may, in part, be mediated by CYP2C9.  However, con comitant use of losartan and 
inhibitors of CYP2C9 have not been examined.  Because this drug does not have a narrow 
therapeutic window, the potential for mild to moderate change s in activity does not require a 
dose modification.  
7.1.6  Other Potential Drug Inter actions 
Based on in vitro studies, ataluren is a substrate of UGT1A9 and of breast cancer resistant 
protein (BCRP).  Coadministration with rifampin, a strong inducer of metaboli c enzymes, 
including UGT1A9 and CYP3A4, did not affect exposure of ataluren in healthy subjects.  No 
dose adjustment is required when ataluren is co -administered with UGT1A9 -inducing 
medications. Caution should be exercised when ataluren is co -administered  with drugs that 
are inhibitors of BCRP ( e.g., cyclosporine, eltrombopag, gefit inib), as these drugs may affect 
ataluren plasma concentrations , e.g.  Note: Topical cyclosporine therapy is permitted.  
In vitro data indicate that ataluren is an inhibitor of  organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 
organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) and organ ic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 
(OATP1B3).  Caution should be exercised when ataluren is co -administered with e.g. OAT1, 
OAT3, or OATP1B3 ( e.g., oseltamivir, acyclovir, ci profloxacin, captopril, furosemide, 
bumetanide, valsartan, pravastatin, rosuvas tatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin) because of the risk 
of increased plasma concentration of these drugs.  
The investigator is encouraged to consult the PTC medical monitor or designee with 
questions relating to specific drugs and their potential for interac tions with ataluren.  
7.2 Dietary Restrictions  
There are no specific dietary restrictions in the study.

8.3.15 MNREAD  
Standard MNREAD Acuity Charts will be used to assess Reading Acuity, Critica l Print Size, 
Maximum Reading Speed, and Reading Accessibility Index .   
Reading speed is a strong predictor of visual ability and vision -related quality of life for 
patients with vision loss (Hazel 2000 ). For this reason, reading performance has been used as 
an outcome measure in clinical trials for judging the effectiveness of treatments  
(Mahmood  2015). 
The Reading Accessibility Index summarize s an individual’s access to text over the range of 
print sizes found in everyday life. The Reading Accessibility Index relies on a simple 
calculation: averaging the readin g speed measured over the 10 largest print sizes on the 
MNREAD and normalizing it by t he mean value for a group of normally sighted young 
adults (Calabrese 2016 ). The Reading Accessibility Index  is a single -valued measure that 
depends on both the range of accessible print sizes for a subject, and the subject’s speed of 
reading within this range. Because the Reading Accessibility Index is normalized by the  
value for a group of normally sighted young adults (aged 18 –39 years), a Reading 
Accessibility Index of 1.0 represents normal performance for this age group. Values less than 
1.0 mean reduced accessibility to printed text within the range of print size en countered in 
daily life (Calabrese 2016 ).  
The MNREAD Acuity Charts  are continuous -text reading -acuity charts suitable for 
measuring reading acuity and reading speed of normal and low -vision patients.  The study 
manual should be referenced for detailed instructions.  
The reading level of the MNREAD Acuity  Charts is approximately 2nd to 3rd grade level. It 
is estimated that subjects around the age of 8 years or older wil l be able to complete this 
assessment. Any subject less than the age of 8 years old will not be required to have this 
study assessment admi nistered. 
Three charts will be utilized for the MNREAD testing; one chart will be used for OD, one 
chart for OS, and the third chart for OU. It is imperative that the charts used for the 
monocular and binocular testing be changed out to decrease the likeli hood of memorization 
of the text sentences by the subject.  
8.3.16 Slit-Lamp Examination and Macro Photography  
Slit lamp exam ination and macro photography will be performed on the lids, conjunctiva, 
limbus, cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous, and lens without pupi l dilation.  The Reading 
Center manual should be referenced for detailed instructions regarding macro photography.  

PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 62 of 96 Slit lamp examination (without pupil dilation) will be done for both eyes of the subjects for 
this study. Both the Haag -Streit and Zeiss slit  lamp biomicroscopes are acceptable for study 
use and it is at the Investigator’s discretion which manufacturer’s bra nd will be used during 
the study; however, the same slit lamp biomicroscope must be used for assessing the anterior 
segment for all subject s enrolled and for all study visits throughout the trial.  
It is recommended that the slit lamp examinations for an in dividual subject be performed by 
the same personnel  using the same slit lamp for each study visit.  
8.3.17 Fundus Examination and Photography  
Fundus examination and photography should  be performed after testing visual acuity, slit 
lamp examination and macro  photography. 
A fundus exam will be performed of the retina, macula, and chor oid.  The largest cup -to-disc 
ratio measured should be entered on to the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  The Reading 
Center manual should be referenced for detailed instructions reg arding fundus photography.  
8.3.18 Optical Coherence Tomography   
Optical Coherence Tomography will be performed.  The Reading Center manual should be 
referenced for detailed instructions.  
8.3.19 Humphrey Visual Field  
Vision field testing will be performed by a Duke certi fied study technician. Humphrey visual 
field will be assessed . The Reading Center manual should be referenced for detailed 
instructions.  
8.3.20 Ophthalmoscopy  
Ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus will be performed using an indirect binocular 
ophthalmoscope . The largest cup to disc ratio measured should be entered on to the eCRF for 
each eye.  Any abnormalities of the macula, vessels, periphery and disc are to be recorded. 
The study manual should be referen ced for detailed instructions.  
8.3.21 Best Corrected Visual A cuity (BCVA) and Refraction  
BCVA and refraction will be assessed usin g the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS).  
Refraction and testing of BCVA must be performed before the subject’s eyes are dilated and 
prior to fundus photography and OCT i maging. Manifest refraction must precede the BCVA 
testing. For this study , it is estimated that children at the age of 6  or older will be able to be 
tested with a subjective refraction and ETDRS charts.  
Age-appropriate alternative visual acuity chart (e.g ., LEA symbols) will be used for any 
subject under the age of 6; however, the same chart should be used throughout the duration 
of the study.   
The study manu al should be referenced for detailed instructions.

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 64 of 96 9 ADVERSE EVENT ASSESSME NTS 
9.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
9.1.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
(investigational medicinal product) in humans, whether or not it is considered related to the 
drug.  An adverse event can the refore be any unfavorable and unintended sign  (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease in a study subject who is administered 
study drug in this study . 
For this protocol, untoward medical occurrences that should be reported as advers e events 
include the following:  
● All adverse e vents that are suspected or are not suspected to be due to study drug . 
● Overdose (administration of a study drug dose >4 times the intended total daily 
dose level for this protocol [>160  mg/kg/day]) of study drug . 
● All reactions from medication misuse, abuse , withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity.  
● All reactions that result from medication errors or uses of the study drug outside 
what is described in the protocol.  
● Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worseni ng of a preexisting illness.  
● Injury or accide nts.  Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the 
injury or accident (a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) 
and the accident (fall) should be reported as two separate adverse events.  The 
outcome of the accident  (hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be recorded in 
source documents.  
● Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that 
require clinical intervention or further investigation ( beyond ordering a repeat 
[confirmatory] test) . 
● Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation 
(beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated with an 
already reported clinical event.  Laborato ry abnormalities associated with a clinical 
event (e.g., elevated liver enzymes in a subject with jaundice) should be captured 
in the source documents.  Laboratory abnormalities not requiring clinical 
intervention or further investigation will be captured as part of overall laboratory 
monitoring and should not be reported as adverse events.  
● A pre-existing condition ( e.g., allergic rhinitis) must be noted on the appropriate 
eCRF for Visit 1 but should not be reported as an adverse event unless the 
condition worsens, or episodes increase in frequency during the adverse event 
reporting period.  Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive 
procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as adverse events.  However, 
the medical condition for which the  procedure was performed should be reported if 
it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 65 of 96 event and the resulting appendectomy sho uld be recorded in the source documents.  
If a surgical procedure was planned prior to entry into the study, and the surgery is 
not performed because of a worsening of a baseline condition, this should not be 
reported as an adverse event.  Note that, as de scribed in Section 9.1.2, any 
inpatient hospitalization occurring as the consequence of an adverse event during 
the study period should be reported as an SAE . 
Each adverse event is to be classified as serious or non-serious by the investigator using 
medical and scientific judgment . 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an untoward medical occurrence or effect associated with the use of a study drug 
at any dose, reg ardless of whether it is considered to be related to th e study drug, which 
results in one of the following:  
• Death (i.e., all deaths on treatment or within 4  weeks after last study drug 
administration) , including deaths due to disease progression.  Any deat h occurring 
later than 4  weeks following the last dose need not be reported as an SAE unless it 
is a result of an event that started within the period covered by the on -study 
definition.  The reported adverse event should be the event that caused the death .  
In addition, any adverse event resulting in death th at occurs subsequent to the 
adverse event -reporting period and that the investigator assesses as possibly 
related to the study drug should also be reported as serious . 
• Life-threatening adverse event.  This is an event that, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, hypothetically 
might have caused death . 
• Inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ( e.g., 
excluding hospitalizations for administration of the study drug, procedures 
required by the study protocol, or aniridia -related diagnostic procedures; other 
planned hospitalizations; or hospitali zations related only to progression of 
disease).  Treat ments in the emergency room for procedures such as hydration 
that do not require admitting the subject to the hospital and observational 
durations in the emergency room for less than 24  hours are not c onsidered serious.  
• Persistent or significant disability  or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions, not related to aniridia.  
• Any other medically important event that the investigator or the sponsor judges to 
be serious or which is defined as serious by the regulator y agency in the local 
country.  Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a reaction is 
serious in other situations.  Important medical events that do not result in death, 
are not immedi ately life-threatening, and do not require hospitalizat ion may be 
considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
any of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronc hospasm requiring intensive treatment administration in an 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 66 of 96 emergency room or at home, newly diagnosed malignancy, or blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or  the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• A pregnancy resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus]).  
An event need not be reported as a SAE if it exclusively represents a  relapse or an expected 
change or progression of the ba seline aniridia.  This type of event need only to be reported as 
an adverse event . 
Note that any SAEs occurring after the end of the subject’s participation in the study should 
be reported to the spons or if the investigator becomes aware of them.  
9.1.3 Unexpecte d Adverse Events  
Unexpected  adverse events are defined as those events that were not previously reported with 
study drug as referenced in the most current investigator ’s brochure, or that are 
symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to a known toxi city but differ because of 
greater severity or specificity.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be 
unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the investigator ’s brochure only referred to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Si milarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (by  virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure 
only listed cerebral vascul ar accidents.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers 
to an adverse even t that is mentioned in the most current investigator ’s brochure as occurring 
with the class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the study 
drug but is not specifically mentioned as occurring with the medicinal product . 
For the purposes of considering expectedness, the ataluren investigator ’s brochure provides a 
summary of the safety profile of ataluren based on available clinical information ( also 
referred to as the  reference safety information).  
9.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Informat ion 
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously reported by the study subject or parent/guardian in case of a  child.  In 
addition, each study subject will be questioned about adverse events at eac h scheduled clinic 
visit after study drug administration or during any telephone contact with the subject or 
parent/guardian in case of a child.  The type of question as ked should be open -ended, e.g., 
“How has your child been feeling?”  or a similar type of  query. 
9.3 Adverse Event Recording  
All adverse events ( both serious and non -serious) that occur in subjects during the adverse 
event reporting period must be recorded, whet her or not the event is considered drug related.  
In addition, any known untoward event  that occurs subsequent to the adverse event reporting 
period that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the investigational drug/product 
should also be recor ded as an adverse event.  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 67 of 96 All adverse events are to be recorded in the source documents and on the eCRF using concise 
medical terminology; whenever possible terms contained in the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) should be employed.  In  addition, the following 
information should be recorded:  
● Indication of whether the even t is serious or non -serious (see Section 9.1.2) 
● Relationship to study drug ( see Section 9.4) 
● Severity of the event (s ee Section 9.5) 
● Onset date  
● Resolution date, or date of death 
● Action taken  
● Outcome of the event  
Classification of the event as serious or non -serious determines the reporting procedures to 
be followed . 
9.4 Describing Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
Based on the considerations outlined in  Table 4 the investigator should provi de an 
assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug, i.e., whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the adverse event.  
Table 4. Relationship of Study Drug to Adverse Event  
Relationship  Description  
Probable  A clinical event in which a relationship to the study drug seems probable because 
of such factors as consistency with known effects of the drug; a clear temporal 
association with the use of the drug; improv ement upon withdrawal of the drug; 
recurrence upon re -challenge with the drug; lack of alternati ve explanations for 
the event.  
Possible  A clinical event occurring coincident with administration of the study drug and 
which may or may not be explained  by co ncurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on drug withdrawal or re-challenge may be lacking.  
Unlikely  A clinical event with a temporal relationship to the study drug exposure that does 
not preclude causality but for which there is a clear  alternate cause that is more 
likely to have caused the adverse event than study drug.  Such alternatives 
include a concomitantly administered drug, the subject’s disease state, other 
medical conditions, or environmental factors.  
Unrelated  A clinic al even t, for which a relationship to the study drug seems improbable 
because of factors such as inconsistency with known effects of the study drug, 
lack of a temporal association with study drug administration, lack of association 
of the event with study drug wi thdrawal or re -challenge, and/or presence of 
alternative explanations for the event.  Alternative explanations might include a 
known relationship of the adverse event to a concomitant drug, medical history of 
a similar event, the subject’s disease s tate, o ther medical conditions, or 
environmental factors.

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 68 of 96 9.5 Grading of Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of adverse events will be graded using the CTCAE Version 4.0 (refer to the 
Study Manual ).  For each episode, the highest severity grade attained should b e reported.  
If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: 
Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening), or Grade 5 
(fatal) to describe the maximum intensity of  the adverse even t.  For purposes of consistency 
with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in Table 5. 
Table 5. Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
Grade Adjective  Description  
Grade 1  Mild Sign or sy mptom is present, but it is easily tolerated, is not expected 
to have a clinically significant effect on the subject’s overall health 
and well -being, does not interfere with the subject’s usual function, 
and is not likely to require medical attention  
Grad e 2 Moderate  Sign or symptom causes interference with usual activity or affects 
clinical status, and may require medical intervention  
Grade 3  Severe  Sign or s ymptom is incapacitating or significantly affects clinical 
status and likely requires medical int ervention and/or close follow up  
Grade 4  Life-threatening  Sign or symptom results in a potential threat to life  
Grade 5  Fatal  Sign or symptom results in death  
Note the distinction between the seriousness and the severity of an adverse event.  Severity i s 
a measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious reaction.  For 
example, a headache may be severe in intensity, but would not  be classified as serious unless 
it met one of the criteria for serious events listed in Section  9.2. 
9.6 Pregnancy  
PTC Therapeutics should be notified in the event that a female subject in the study becomes 
pregnant at any time after the subject’s first dose of study drug.  Any such pregnancy 
occurring on -study or within 60 days of the last administration of study drug  must be 
reported on  a Pregnancy Notification Form (see Study Manual for details).  This must be 
done whether or not an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy.  The information s ubmitted should include the anticipated date of birth or 
pregnancy termination . 
If possible, the investigator should follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and 
notify the PTC  Therapeutics medical monitor or designee of the outcome within 5 da ys or as 
specified below.  The investiga tor will provide this information as a follow up to the initial 
Pregnancy Notification Form via the Pregnancy Outcome Form (see the Study Manual for 
details). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for im mediate classification as an SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in 
an aborted fetus]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs, i.e., 
report the event to the PTC Thera peutics Safety Department or designee an d follow up by 
submission of appropriate adverse event eCRFs (see Section 9.8). 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 69 of 96 9.7 Follow-Up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
All adverse events should be followed up by the investigator until t hey are resolved, or the 
investigator assesses them as chronic or stable.  Follow -up of any SAE that is fatal or 
life-threatening should be provided within one additional calendar week.  The investigator 
should consider protocol gui delines and use his/her discretion in ordering additional tests as 
necessary to monitor the resolution of such events.  In the event of additional investigations, 
the PTC Therapeutics Safety Department or designee should be informed via e -mail or fax.  
A subject withdrawn from th e study because of an adverse event must be followed by the 
investigator until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to 
normal, or until progression has been stabilized.  Follow -up may need to continue a fter the 
subject has dis continued from the study, and additional investigations may be requested by 
the medical monitoring team . 
9.8 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The first day of adverse event reporting will coincide with the day the first dose of study drug 
is administered.  The a dverse event reporting period for this study ends with the 4 -week 
post-treatment follow -up visit (+7 days) after the end of study or end of treatment , except as 
described in Section 9.7.  In addition, SAEs occurr ing in a subject after the study period 
should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them.  
9.9 Investigator Site Adverse Event Reporting Require ments 
Classification of an event as serious or non -serious (see Section 9.1.2) determines the 
reporting procedures to be followed.  Investigator site reporting requirements for adverse 
events are summarized in  Table 6.

PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 70 of 96 For SAEs, in addition to completing the adverse event eCRF, the SAE report form must also 
be completed.  The SAE report form should be signed by the investigator; however, if the 
investigator is unable to sign at the time of the event or within 24  hours, the form should be 
signed by the clinical staff member reporting the SAE ( e.g., the study coordinator).  The SAE 
report form must be faxed or emailed to the PTC Therapeutics Safety Department or 
designee and to the site IRB/IEC (if required by local regulat ions) within 24  hours.  Follow -
up information to the SAE should be clearly documented as “follow up” in the SAE report 
form and must also be faxed or emailed to the same parties.  All follow up S AE report forms 
for the event must be signed by the investiga tor.  Any source documents ( e.g., progress notes, 
nurses’ notes, laboratory and diagnostic test results, discharge summaries) provided to the 
sponsor must be redacted so that the subject’s name, address, and other personal identifiers 
are obscured.  Only t he subject’s study number and initials are to be provided (in regions 
where the provision of such information is permitted).  The information in the adverse event 
eCRF and the SAE report form(s) must match or be reconciled.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same 
adverse event term should be used on both forms . 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of th e occurrence of an SAE 
immediately ( e.g., if a subject initia lly seeks treatment elsewhere  or if not brought to the 
attention of the investigator ), the investigator is to document his/her first awareness of the 
adverse event and report the event within 24 hours after learning of it . 
The PTC Therapeutics Safety Depar tment / designee contact information for reporting SAEs 
is provided below.  This information is also provided in the Study Manual and in the SAE 
report form .

9.10 PTC Therapeutics Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
As the sponsor of the study, PTC Therapeutics is responsible for reporting certain safety 
information, particularly SAEs and subject dea ths related to participation in the study, to 
each investigat or in an expedited manner.  If notification of an adverse event requiring 
expedited reporting to investigators is received, PTC Therapeutics or its designated 
representative will contact each inv estigator site participating in this study by e mail, fax, 
and/or overnight mail such that the investigator can promptly notify the site IRB/IEC per 
their local requirements.  The initial expedited safety report will be provided as required 
according to lo cal regulations ( e.g., within 15 days) after the earliest date PTC Therapeutics 
or an agent of PTC Therapeutics ( e.g., a site monitor) becomes aware of an adverse event.  
This awareness date is the date the regulatory reporting clock begins , and the date i s 
considered Day 0.

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 71 of 96 10 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
All subjects who receive study drug  should remain in the study whenever possible.  
However:  
• The subject has the right to withdraw consent and discontinue study drug at any 
time. 
• If the subject’s condition substant ially worsens after initiating study drug , the 
subject will be carefully evaluated by the investigator.  The subject will be 
withdrawn from treatment if continuing would place them at risk.  
• The investigator may withdraw t he subject from study drug , if, in the 
investigator’s clinical judgment, it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue . 
• If the subject becomes significantly noncompliant with study drug administration, 
study procedures, or study requirements.  In th is event, the subject should be 
withdrawn from study drug when the circumstances surrounding noncompliance 
increase risk to the subject or are anticipated to substantially compromise the 
interpretation of study results.  
• The subject may be withdrawn from th is study in circumstances where the  
masking is intentionally or accidentally broken.  
• This study may be discontinued by the relevant regulatory authority, IRB/EC, 
and/or PTC  Therapeutics at any time.  
The date study drug is discontinued and the reason for di scontinuation will be recorded in t he 
source documents and in the eCRF.  The PTC medical monitor (and designee) should be 
informed via e -mail of when a subject discontinues study drug.  
When study drug is discontinued (regardless of the reason), the investi gator is expected to 
capture all of  the evaluations required at the EOS/ET Visit and any additional evaluations 
should be completed that may be necessary to ensure that the subject is free of untoward 
effects.  The subject should be encouraged to seek appr opriate follow -up for any continuin g 
health problems . 
11 STATISTICS  
11.1 Sample Size  
The study is planned to enroll a minimum of 36 subjects with nonsense mutation aniridia 
who are ≥2 years of age.  This number of subjects should provide adequate information to 
evaluate the safety of ataluren in this population.  For a statistical hypothesis test for any 
efficacy endpoint, the study will have 60% power to detect an effect size ( i.e., standardized 
mean difference) of 0.85, or 80% power to detect an effect size of 1. 06, at the 0.05 
significance level ( two-sided).

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 72 of 96 11.2 Analysis Populations  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT ) Population / Safety Population : This population will include all 
randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Efficacy Analysis Populations : For each efficacy outcome measure, this population will 
include all subjects who have a baselin e value and at least 1 post -baseline value.  
11.3 General Statistical Considerations  
Two separate analyses will be conducted , one for the double -masked ph ase (Day 1 through 
Week 48), and the second for the entire study (Day 1 through Week 240) . For patients 
randomized to placebo, two baselines will be used, one at randomization (Visit 2, Day 1) and 
the other at first dose of open-label ataluren (Visit 4, 48  weeks) for the analyses outlined 
below.  
a) Analyses on the double -masked phase  (Day 1 through Week 48) .  
Both placebo and ataluren will be presented and comparison will be made through 48 weeks  
between these two treatment groups. For the analyses of the double -masked phase, 
assessments at randomization (Visit 2 [Day 1]) will serve as b aseline. 
b) Analyses of t he entire study (Visit 2, Day 1 through Week 240). 
Efficacy will be presented based on two different baselines for placebo,  one baseline at 
randomization  (Visit 2) and the other  baseline at Week 48 when placebo subjects first take  
open-label ataluren. Thre e analysis groups will be presented :  
1. ataluren (all visits) ,  
2. placebo (all visits)  with Visit 2 assessments serving as  baseline, and  
3. combined group s with baseline at the first dose of ataluren  (i.e., 
randomization  -Visit 2 for ataluren patients a nd at the first dose of open -label 
ataluren (Visit 4, 48 weeks) for placebo patients) .  
Safety data for the entire study will be presente d for the combined group for patients 
receiving ataluren .  
By-subject listings will be created for each eCRF module.  S ummary tables for continuous 
variables will contain the following statistics: N, mean, median, stan dard deviation, standard 
error, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval  (CIs), as appropriate.  Summary 
tables for categorical variables will include N , percentage, and 95% CIs on the percentage.  
Any CIs for proportions will be computed using normal approximation, if the n umber of the 
events is at least  five.  Otherwise, CIs using an exact method will be provided.  Graphical 
techniques will be used when  such methods are appropriate and informative.  For safety 
summaries, CIs will not be presented, unless specified otherwise.  
Transformations of the data may be explored if warranted b y the distribution of the data.  
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be two-sided at the 0.05 level of significance.  
All analyses will be performed using SAS® (Version 9.0 or higher).

categorical variables.   Summaries will be presented for the ITT population only.  
11.5.3 Medical History and Prior Medication  
Medical history and prior medication information will be summarized.  
11.6 Extent of Exposure  
The extent of exposure to ataluren treatment is defined as the last dose  date minus the first 
dose date + 1 day.  The frequency will be presented according to the duration ranges in each 
Stage (i.e., Stage 1 [double -masked dosing] or Stage 2 [open -label dosing]): <24 weeks, 
>24 to <48 weeks, >48 to <72 weeks, >72 to <96 weeks,  >96 to <120 weeks, >120 to 
<144 weeks, ≥144 to <168 weeks, ≥168 to <192 weeks, ≥192 to <216 weeks, and ≥216 to 
≥240 weeks.  The number r of subjects in each category as well as the mean duration 
(in days) will also be presented . 
11.6.1 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug compliance will be assessed by ana lysis of unused study drug reported.  This

All safety present ations will be based on the safety population and will be based only on data 
included in the analysis period of interest  
Adverse event and SAE summaries will also be presented for the following periods:  
● Through Week  48 (double -masked phase)  
● Through End of Treatment  (entire study, including the sub -study)  
Additional frequency tables summarizing the occurrence of adverse events and SAEs after 
the end of the analysis period of interest will also be provided.  All AEs and SAEs will be 
summarized by treatment a rm, as defined in Section 11.2.  Marked laboratory abnormalities 
will also be descriptively summarized.  No statistical tests will be performed for AEs or 
laboratory marked abnormalities.  
11.8.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events are record ed by the investigators on the Serious and Non -Serious Adverse 
Event page(s) of the eCRF.  All investigators are required to report the nature, the onset and 
resolution date, intensity, action taken, treatment required for event, and to express t heir 
opinion regarding the relationship between the AE and the study medication.  
Summary information (the number and percent of subjects by treatment) will be tabulated 
for: 
● Treatment -emergent adverse events, including clinical and laboratory adverse 
events 
● Treatmen t-emergent and treatment -related adverse events  
● Treatment -emergent adverse events by severity  
● SAEs 
● Adverse events leading to discontinuation  
● Ocular adverse events  
Summaries will be presented by System Organ Classes and Preferred Terms.  The 
frequencies of  adverse events displayed will be the crude rates that represent the number of 
subjects experiencing adverse events divided by the total number of subjects.  
11.8.2 Laboratory Parameters  
Changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline (last measuremen t prior to entering the 
study at Visit 2, and, in addition, for placebo subjects last measurement prior to receiving 
open-label ataluren at Visit  4) and laboratory marked abnormalities (laboratory adverse 
events) using pre -defined abnormality criteria will  be descriptively summarized.  For 
laboratory adverse events , the severity will be graded by CTCAE, when possible.  For 
parameters for which a CTCAE scale does not exist, the frequency of subjects with values 
below, within, and above the normal ranges will  be summar ized. In the by -subject analysis, a 
subject having the same abnormality more than once will be counted only once based on the 
worst severity grade observed.

Concomitant medications will be coded by means of the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary into Anatomical -Therapeutic -Chemical classification codes.  The type  and timin g 
(between each visit) of use of specific concomitant medications will be listed and 
summarized.  
The frequency, timing (between each visit), type, and amount of any other therapies for 
aniridia will be considered with special interest.  
11.11 Exploratio n of Corre lations 
Correlations between subject characteristics and outcome measures, and correlations among 
outcomes measures may be explored using regression models or other appropriate 
techniques.  
11.12 Subgroup Analyses  
Data will be summarized within subject subgroups of interest based on potentially relevant 
demographic, genetic, and clinical factors, such as age, nonsense mutation stop codon type 
(UGA, UAG, UAA), nonsense mutation exon location, and/or baseline efficacy parameters.  
11.13 Multiplicity  
The key secondary endpo ints will be tested sequentially in the order of Reading Accessibility 
Index and then BCVA at the two -sided significance level 0.05. For example, if the 
hypothesis for the primary endpoint, Maximum Reading Speed  of OU, is rejected at 
0.05 level, then Readi ng Accessibility Index will be tested at 0.05 level. Further, if  the 
hypothesis for Reading Accessibility Index is rejected at 0.05 level , then BCVA will be 
tested at 0.05 level. If the hypothesis for the primary endpoint is not rejected at 0.05 level , 
then no hypothesis testing will be performed for the key secondary endpoints.

participating in the study, and to ask any questions that the subject and/or parent/guardian 
may have about the study.  The subject and/or parent/guardian should be able to ask 
additional questions as and when needed du ring the condu ct of the study.  The subject’s 
and/or parent(s)/guardian signature (as  required by local regulations) on the informed consent 
form should be obtained at the investigator site in the presence of the investigator or a 
qualified representative (e.g., sub-investigator).  Where applicable, the subject will sign an 
age-appropriate assent form.  
Each subject or parent/guardian will be given a copy of the signed consent/assent form.  The 
original signed informed consent forms will be retained by the i nvestigator wi th the study 
records. 
The written subject information must not be changed without prior approval by 
PTC Therapeutics and the IRB/IEC . 
12.4 Electronic Case Report Forms  
An eCRF is required and must be completed for each subject, with all required study data 
accurately recorded such that the information matches the data contained in medical records 
(e.g., physicians’ notes, nurses’ notes, clinic charts, and other study -specific source 
documents).  The eCRFs exist within a web-based electronic data c apture (EDC) system 
managed by the data management contract research organization for this study.  After the 
investigator or the investigator’s designees ( e.g., research coord inators) have been 
appropriately trained, they will be given access to the EDC sy stem and will enter the data 
required by the protocol into the EDC system.  Any change of data will be made via the EDC 
system, with all changes tracked by the system to provi de an audit trail . 
With an electronic signature, the investigator certifies that the data are complete and accurate 
prior to database lock.  This electronic signature serves to attest that the information 
contained in the eCRFs is true.  After database loc k, the investigator site will receive a 
CD-ROM and/or paper copies of the subject  data for archiving at the investigator site.  At all 
times, the principal investigator has final responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of 
all clinical data entered  onto the eCRFs and/or reported to PTC  Therapeutics from the 
investigator site . 
12.5 Study Records  
During the study, the investigator will maintain adequate records for the study, including 
medical records, source document records detailing the progress of the study for each 
subject, laboratory reports, a CD -ROM or paper copy of the data th at have been captured in 
the EDC for each subject ( eCRFs), paper CRFs, signed informed consent forms, ataluren 
disposition records, correspondence with the IRB/IEC, adverse ev ent reports, and 
information regarding subject discontinuation and completion of the study.  Current 
regulations require PTC  Therapeutics (or an authorized designee) to inspect all documents 
and records required to be maintained by the investigator, includ ing but not limited to 
medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) for the subj ects enrolled in this study.  These 
regulations also allow the same records to be inspected by authorized representatives of the 
Food and Drug Administration ( FDA), Health Can ada, or other regulatory authorities .

V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 79 of 96 12.6 Confidentiality  
Research records will be co llected and stored in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 
subject information.  The names and identities of all research subjects will be kept in strict 
confidence a nd will not appear on eCRFs, paper CRFs, or other records provided to or 
retained by PTC Therapeutics (or its authorized designee).  The names and identities of the 
subjects need not be divulged; however, the records must nevertheless be inspected.  This 
will be accomplished by redacting the subject’s name and replacing the name with t he 
subject’s study identification number on any record provided to or retained by PTC 
Therapeutics.  The informed consent form must include appropriate statements explaining 
these requirements . 
By signing this protocol, the investigator affirms to PTC Ther apeutics that the investigator 
will maintain, in confidence, information furnished by PTC Therapeutics and will divulge 
such information to the IRB/IEC under an appropriate un derstanding of c onfidentiality with 
such board.  
12.7 Retention of Records  
To enable ev aluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or PTC Therapeutics, the 
investigator agrees to keep accurate and complete records, including the identity of all 
participating subjects (sufficient information to link eCRFs and clinic records), all orig inal 
signed informed consent forms, CD -ROM or paper copies of the data that have been captured 
in the EDC for each subject ( eCRFs), and detailed records of ataluren dispositio n.  All 
records and documents pertaining to the study (including but not limited to those outlined in 
Section 12.5) will be maintained by the invest igator until notification is received from PTC 
Therapeutics that the records no longer need to be retained . 
The investigator must obtain written  permission from PTC Therapeutics before disposing of 
any records.  In order to avoid any possible errors, the investigator will contact PTC 
Therapeutics prior to the destruction of any study records.  The investigator will promptly 
notify PTC  Therapeutics  in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.

13 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN FEATURES  
13.1 Subject Selection  
13.1.1 General 
This study is a randomized, double -masked, pla cebo-controlled safety and efficacy study of 
ataluren in subjects with nonsense mutation aniridia.   Consistent with GCP guidelines, 
parents/guardians and subjects must provide informed consent/assent before initiation of any 
study procedures.  To minimize missing data and premature discontinuations, subjects must 
have the personal and family resources to comply with study procedures and restrictions.  In 
addition, subjects must not have serious concomitant conditions that would compromise 
safety, compliance , or evaluation . 
13.1.2 Reproductive Considerations  
Ataluren is not genotoxic, did not affect fertility i n male and female rats, and was not 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits.  In addition, lack of sexual maturity in many of the subjects 
likely to be enrolled in th is study limits reproductive risks.  However, restriction on eligibility 
relating to willingness t o avoid unprotected sexual intercourse in any subjects known to be 
sexually active is included as a general precaution.  Because it is unknown if ataluren is 
excreted in breast milk, lactating female subjects who are breast -feeding are excluded from 
participation. 
13.1.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapies  
Surgery for aniridia -related conditions is permitted  during the study . 
Conventional supportive therapies will be perm itted; however, efforts will be made to avoid 
use of concomitant medications that might confound i nterpretation of study results ( e.g., 
aminoglycosides) or pose a safety risk.  Ataluren has not proved allergenic in studies 
performed to date, but review of known allergies to excipients contained in the formulation is 
prudent. 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 82 of 96 As the primary route of ata luren metabolism is via glucuronidation by UGT1A9, clinically 
significant interactions between ataluren and co -administered drugs metabolized by CYPs are 
unlikely.  In particular, ataluren is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/ 5, and does not have induction potential on the major CYP enzymes.  
In vitro, ataluren is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, but in vivo drug -drug 
interactions mediated by these enzymes are not expected according to the criteria described 
in the EMA gui deline on the investigation of drug interactions  (EMA 2012 ).   
The metabolism of losartan to its active metabolite may, in part, be mediated by CYP2C9.  
However, concomitant use of losartan and inhibitors of CYP2C9 have not been examined .  
Because this drug  does not have a narrow therapeutic window, the potential for mild to 
moderate changes in activity does not require a dose modification.  
Based on in vitro studies, ataluren is also not expected to be an inhibitor or a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein (P -gp)-mediated transport . 
Note: Topical cyclosporine therapy is permitted.  
In vitro data indicate that ataluren is an inhibitor of UGT1A9, OAT1, OAT3 and OATP1B3.  
Caution should be exercised when ataluren is co -administered with drugs that are substrates 
of OAT1, OAT3, or OATP1B3 ( e.g., oseltamivir, acyclovir, ciprofloxacin, captopril, 
furosemide, bumetanide, valsartan, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin) 
because of the risk of increased concentration of these drugs.  
Other restrictions rela ting to recent use of experimental drugs or surgery allow candidates 
sufficient time to recover before proceeding to ataluren dosing.  Restrictions against 
enrollment of subjects expected to have major surgical procedures during the course of  the 
study or who have substantial respiratory or cardiac compromise are intended to avoid safety 
problems or gaps in ataluren administration in subjects who require intensive supportive care.  
Please refer to the IB for the latest information on prohibited  medications.   
13.2 Treatment Rationale  
13.2.1 Ataluren Schedule and Dose Selection  
Dosing based on body weight will be employed.  Such dosing is common in pediatrics and 
reduces variability in exposure by accommodating differences in subject size across the span 
of ages of the su bjects who will participate in the clinical study . 
The schedule of drug administration is derived directly from Phase 1 PK modeling and from 
Phase 2 exposure information.  The intent of administering 2 smaller doses at 6-hour 
intervals during  the day and a  larger dose at a 12 -hour interval overnight ( e.g., at 7:00 AM, 
1:00 PM, and 7:00 PM) is to optimally sustain target plasma concentrations while 
minimizing total exposures.  This schedule is likely to fit well with daily patterns of living 
for subjects, th us enhancing compliance.  As confirmation of that premise, compliance with 
ataluren dosing in Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing has been excellent.  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 83 of 96 In clinical studies of ataluren in other nonsense mutation genetic disorders, particularly 
nmDMD and  nmCF, atalure n has been studied most extensively at the 10, 10, 20  mg/kg dose 
level.  In the Phase 2b, randomized, double -masked, placebo-controlled study of ataluren in 
nmDMD (Study  007), a total of 57 subjects received ataluren 10, 10, 20  mg/kg for 48 w eeks.  
In addition, all subjects in the ongoing open -label safety studies of ataluren in nmDMD 
(Studies 016 and 019) are receiving the 10, 10, 20  mg/kg dose level.  As of 31 January 2015, 
the estimated median duration of exposure was 196.6 weeks for Study 016 (N=108 ) and 
102.4 weeks for Study  019 (N=93).  Across the Phase 3, randomized, double -masked, 
placebo-controlled study of ataluren in nmCF (Study 009) and its open -label extension 
(009e), a total of 170 nmCF subjects have received ataluren 10, 10, 20  mg/kg for ≥48 weeks, 
including 132 subjects who have received ataluren 10, 10, 20  mg/kg for ≥96 weeks.  The 
controlled studies in nmDMD (Study 007) and nmCF (Study 009) have documented a 
favorable risk -benefit at the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose level in these ind ications (Bushby 2014 , 
Kerem 2014 ).  In nmDMD, ataluren has been conditionally approved at a dose of 10, 10, 
20 mg/kg for the t reatment of nmDMD.  Based on the collective clinical experience with 
ataluren 10, 10, 20  mg/kg in other indications, this dose level will be evaluated in subjects 
with nonsense mutation aniridia.  
13.2.2 Duration of Therapy  
The primary objective of this Phase 2 st udy is to evaluate the effect of ataluren on Maximum 
Reading Speed  as measured using the MNREAD Acuity Charts  in subjects with nonsense 
mutation aniridia.  Secondarily, this study also aims to evaluate other efficacy outcome 
measures in this patient population. Given that there have been very few clinical trials in 
aniridia, it is important to gather information regarding long -term changes and variability of 
outcome measures.  
This study also aims to determine whether ataluren can be safely ad ministered as a chronic 
treatment for subjects with nonsense mutation aniridia.  In subjects with other nonsense 
mutation genetic disorders, ataluren has been generally w ell tolerated when administered 
chronically for >4 years.  Therefore, exposure to atal uren for up to 240 weeks in this study is 
not expected to pose undue safety risk.  
13.2.3 Selection of Outcome Measures  
The proposed efficacy, safety, and exposure evaluations ar e chosen based on relevance to the 
pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of the disease and past experience that these 
assessments can be performed with acceptable accuracy.  
13.2.3.1 Slit-Lamp Examination and Macro Photography  
Slit-lamp examination and macro photography are standard ophthalmological techniques to 
inspect the anterior segment o f the eye.  In the diagnosis of aniridia, slit -lamp examination 
and macro photography are critical to identify and document iris and pupillary abnormalities 
(Hingorani 2012 ).  Corneal opacification and vascularization and cataract or glaucoma can 
also be detected, if present.  The procedure is non -invasive and can be performed in children 
and adults.  Images will be analyzed by an independent central reader mas ked to subject 
identity. 
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 84 of 96 13.2.3.2 Fundus Photography 
Fundus examination including posterior segment photography will be used to assess for 
abnormalities in the retina, macula, and choroid as well as the optic disc.  Abnormalities of 
posterior ocular structures, namely foveal and optic nerve hypoplasia, often occur in patients 
with aniridia and cause or contribute to visual impairment  (McCulley 2005 ).  Images will be 
analyzed by an independent central reader masked to subject identity.  
13.2.3.3 MNREAD  
An MNREAD Acuity Chart curve of reading speed vs print size is characterized by 
3 summary values. At large print sizes, reading speed  remains constant, forming a plateau 
that represents the Maximum Reading Speed. As the print size decreases, a Critical Print Size 
is reached at which reading speed begins to decline rapidly. Finally, the smallest print size 
that can be read is defined as the Reading Acuity. These 3 parameters of the MNREAD 
Acuity Chart curve are used to summarize visual reading function.  
Maximum Reading Speed  is a person’s  reading speed when reading is not limited by print 
size. Maximum Reading Speed  is known to be reduced  when foveal vision is degraded, such 
as is seen in patients with aniridia. Reading speed, in words per minute, has been widely used 
in psychophysical studies because it can be measured objectively, is reproducible, and is 
sensitive to variations in visual  parameters (Legge 1985 ). Maximum Reading Speed  is a 
measure that reflects the dynamic nature of reading.  
The Reading Accessibility Index is defined as an individual’s mean reading speed measured 
across the 10 largest print sizes on the MNREAD Acuit y Chart (0.4 –1.3 logarithm of the 
minimum angle of resolution at 40 cm), normalized by 200 words per minute (the mean 
value for a group of 365 normally sighted young adults). The Reading Accessibility Index  is 
a single-value measure that captures an indivi dual’s range of accessible print sizes and 
reading fluency within this range (Calabrese 2016 ). These charts were developed at the 
Minnesota Laboratory for Low -Vision Research, Un iversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, USA.  
The reading level of the MNREAD Acuity Charts is approximately 2nd to 3rd grade level. It 
is estimated that subjects around the age of 8 years or older will be able to complete this 
assessment. Any subjec t less than the age of 8 years old will not be required to have this 
study assessment administered.  
13.2.3.4 Optical Cohe rence Tomography  
High-resolution OCT enables the measurement and visualization of microscopic structures of 
the anterior and posterior segments.   Anterior segment OCT imaging will be performed to 
detect potential changes in the anterior angle structures.  Posterior segment OCT will be 
attempted to detect potential changes in foveal and optic disc structures, although corneal 
opacities may preclude  clear imaging in some patients  (Gregory-Evans 2011 ). Images will be 
analyzed by an independent central reader masked to subject  identity.

Poor visual acuity resulting from iris hypoplasia and foveal hypoplasia is a hallmark 
symptom of aniridia  (Netland 2011 , Hingorani 2012 ).  BCVA and refraction will be 
evaluated using the well -established ETDRS method.   If needed, an age -appropriate 
alternative visual acuity chart ( e.g., LEA symbols) may be used; however, the same chart 
should be used throughout the duration of the study.

V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 86 of 96 13.2.3.11 Safety 
In defining therapeutic activity in a particular clinical  setting, it is imperative that the drug’s 
safety profile be fully characterized.  As is conventional in all clinical studies, proper 
description of each ad verse event or laboratory abnormality requires an understanding of the 
type, incidence, timing, seve rity, and relatedness to study drug.  In this study, particular focus 
will be placed on monitoring for ocular adverse findings.  For consistency of interpre tation, 
adverse events will be coded using the standard MedDRA, and the severity of these events 
will be graded using the well -defined CTCAE Version  4.0.  Standard definitions for 
seriousness will be applied.  Particular attention will be paid to any adver se events causing 
discontinuation of ataluren and to SAEs requiring rapid regulatory reporting.  
Ocular safety will be monitored via slit lamp, ophthalmoscopy, and visual field assessments.  
14 BENEFITS AND RISKS  
14.1 Benefits and Risks: Non -Clinical 
In addition to the non-clinical studies of P AX6Sey+/– mice described in Section 2.2.1.2 in 
cellular assays and animal models of genetic disease, ataluren demonstrated the ability to 
specifically and selectively enable readthrough of mRNA cont aining a premature stop codon, 
inducing production of full -length protein that localizes to the appropriate cellular location 
and is functionally active.  Ataluren consistently enabled mRNA readthrough and functional 
full-length protein production from mRN As that contain a premature sto p codon without 
promoting readthrough of normal stop codons . 
Ataluren was shown to be selective for translation. Ataluren did not alter levels of mRNA 
with premature stop codons or wild type mRNA demonstrating that ataluren d oes not modify 
transcription or  mRNA stability.  In cell -free translation assays, ataluren functions at the 
level of translation and not transcription.  Ataluren does not produce a functional protein by 
promoting readthrough of premature stop codons due to  frameshift mutations (insertio ns or 
deletions) or of mRNAs harboring multiple sequential premature stop codons.  Ataluren is 
selective for premature stop codons and does not promote readthrough of normal stop 
codons. 
Toxicokinetic data were obtained in to xicity studies conducted in mic e, rats, rabbits and 
dogs.  Consistent with the short t½, there was no accumulation of drug in plasma upon 
repeated daily dosing.  In all species, ataluren exposure increased with increasing dose, but 
the increase was general ly less than dose proportional.   There were no sex -related differences 
in ataluren exposure in dogs, but in rats and mice, exposure was slightly higher in females 
than in males.  The major metabolite seen in mice, rats and dogs was ataluren acyl 
glucuronid e; exposure to this metabolite in the toxicology species at 
lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels , no-observed-adverse-effect levels, and no -effect 
levels in the toxicology program was greater than the exposure observed in humans 
administered the clinical dose of 10, 10 and 20  mg/kg at morning, midday, and evening, 
respectively.  Ataluren is highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins in all species, including 
human.  Ataluren is neither a substrate for nor an inhibitor of P -gp.  Enzyme inhibition 
studies with h uman liver microsomes showed th at ataluren has a weak potential for direct 
inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.  As an added measure of safety, investigators should 
pay specific attention to use of drugs that are known substrates of these enzymes, particularly  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 87 of 96 when such drugs may have a nar row therapeutic index.  Enzyme induction evaluations in 
human hepatocytes showed that ataluren did not induce the activities of CYP450 enzymes.  
Induction of metabolism by ataluren is not expected since slight increases in CY P2B6 and 
CYP2C9 activity are ob served only at an ataluren concentration that is 3 - to 5-fold higher 
than the average peak concentration after a 20  mg/kg dose. 
Based on in vitro studies, ataluren is a substrate of UGT1A9 and BCRP.  Coadministration 
with rifampin, a strong inducer of meta bolic enzymes, including UGT1A9 and CYP3A4, did 
not affect exposure of ataluren in healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment is required when 
ataluren is co -administered with UGT1A9 -inducing medications. Caution should be 
exercised when ataluren is co -administered with drugs that are inhibitors of BCRP ( e.g., 
cyclosporine, eltrombopag, gefitinib), as these drugs may affect ataluren plasma 
concentrations.  
Note: Topical cyclosporine therapy is permitted.  
In vitro data indicate that ataluren is an inhibitor of OAT 1, OAT3 and OATP1B3.  Caution 
should be exercised when ataluren is co -administered with drugs that are substrates of OAT1, 
OAT3, or OATP1B3 ( e.g., oseltamivir, acyclovir, ciprofloxacin, captopril, furosemide, 
bumetanide, vals artan, pravastatin, rosuvastati n, atorvastatin, pitavastatin) because of the risk 
of increased plasma concentration of these drugs.  
Ataluren was evaluated in safety pharmacology studies and found to have no effects on the 
cardiovascular system, respiratory  system, or central nervous sys tem.  In the toxicology 
program, the major findings observed were species -specific, i.e., observed in one toxicology 
species only.  These findings included kidney findings in mice (nephrosis, predominantly in 
the distal nephr on, reversible following cessation of dosing) and adrenal gland cortical 
findings in dogs (lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with focal parenchymal cell degeneration in 
regions responsible for synthesis of glucocorticoids).  Chronic studies were conducted in 
weanling rats an d dogs to support dosing in children as young as 2 years of age.  Ataluren 
was not genotoxic and was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits.  In rats and rabbits, fetal 
toxicity was observed only at materno -toxic doses.  Ataluren had no effect on the fertilit y of 
male and female rats.  In rats, postnatal developmental effects were observed only at 
materno-toxic doses.  Maternal administration of ataluren in rats had no effect on F 1 
reproduction or F 2 embryo/fetal development.  Ataluren did not i ncrease the inc idence of 
tumors in a 26 -week carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 mice. Tumors observed in rats in the 
toxicology program occurred at exposures that exceeded clinical exposure and/or were not 
considered relevant to humans.  The structurally id entified proces s impurities of the ataluren 
drug substance were qualified in rats at doses 29 - to 33-fold higher than would be 
administered in the clinic at the proposed morning, midday, and evening doses of 10, 10 and 
20 mg/kg, respectively.  Ataluren is a small molecul ar weight compound, and therefore, is 
not expected to produce anti -drug antibodies.  Ataluren had no effect on the immune system 
in the toxicology program and in the clinical trials; therefore, immunotoxicity studies were 
not performed with ataluren. 
Nonclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies indicate that ataluren has an 
acceptable safety profile.  The findings seen pose a low human safety risk and the program 
supports chronic administration of ataluren in subjects as young as 2 years of age.

The ability of ataluren to enable readthrough of nonsense mutations has been clinic ally 
demonstrated in other indications of nonsense mutation -mediated disease  (Kerem 2008 , 
Sermet-Gaudelus  2010, Wilschanski 2011 , Finkel 2013 ).  Ataluren’s effect in treatment of 
nmDMD has been demonstrated (Bushby 2014 ), and in July 2014 ataluren was approved by 
the EMA for treatment of nmDMD.  In addition, in a Phase 3 study of nmCF subjects, 
ataluren-treated subjects had less lung function decline and fewer pulmonary exacerbations 
than placebo -dosed subjects (Kerem 2014 ). 
Totaling all ataluren clinical studies, including healthy volunteers as well as subjects with 
several nonsense mutation genetic disorders, >750 subjects have been exposed to ataluren in 
Phase 1 (Hirawat 2007 ), Phase 2 (Kerem 2008 , Sermet-Gaudelus 2010 , Wilschanski 20 11, 
Finkel 2013 ) and Phase 3 (Bushby 2014 , Kerem 2014 ) clinical studies.   Ataluren has shown a 
favorable safety profile in clinical studies.  
Approximately 40% of patients with aniridia have a nonsense mutation in one allele of th e 
PAX6 gene (Tzoulaki 2005 ).  Because ataluren -induced readthrough of nonsense mutations 
has been demonstrated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of other nonsense mutation 
genetic diseases, while showing a favorable clinical safety profile, it can be expected th at 
ataluren treatment of nonsense mutation aniridia will exhibit acceptable benefit v s risk. 
14.2.1 Justification for Inclusion of Minors  
In standard toxicology studies, dosing is initiated in young adult rats (6 to 8 weeks old) and 
in 4-to 6-month old dogs.  How ever, the chronic toxicology studies conducted with ataluren 
initiated dosing in wean ling animals (approximately 4 - to 5-week-old rats, and dogs 
<3 months of age) to support dosing of pediatric subjects as young as two years of age.  A 
detailed summary of methods and results of these chronic toxicity studies is provided in 
Section 7 of the  ataluren investigator ’s brochure.  
In the clinic, ataluren has already been administered to subjects as young as three years old.  
A Phase 2 study of ataluren in subjects with methylmelonic acidemia (MMA) enrolled 
11 subjects, including two subjects who were three years old and one subject who was 
4 years old.  All three of these subjects completed the study as planned, re ceiving ataluren 
5, 5, 10 mg/kg for 28 days in Cycle 1 and ataluren 10, 10, 20  mg/kg for 28 days in Cycle 2; 
there was a washout period o f 21 days between the cycles . 
Ataluren was well tolerated by the three subjects <6 years old in the MMA study.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events in these subjects were vomiting, pyrexia, 
nasopharyngitis, cough, flatulence, and rash.  All treatment -emergent adverse events were 
mild or moderate in severity, and none were serious or led to discontinuation of treatment.  
Overall, the ataluren safety profile was similar in <6 years old and ≥6  years old.  
PTC124-GD-028-ANI 
Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 89 of 96 Twenty-four-hour blood sampling for ataluren PK assessments was performed on Day 28 of 
each cycle; the data from Cycle 2, in which a dose of 10, 10, 20  mg/kg was administered, a re 
of particular relevance to the proposed study in nonsense mutation aniridia.  Ataluren plasma 
concentrations in the 3 subjects <6 years old were comparable to ataluren plasma 
concentrations in the 8 subjects ≥6 years old who participated in this study.  Mean area under 
the curve ( AUC)0-24h was 279.3 h•µg/mL and 358.4 h•µg/mL for subjects <6 and ≥6 years 
old, respectively, on Day 28 of Cycle 2.  Mean maximum concentration ( Cmax) was 
28.2 µg/mL and 29.9 µg/mL for subjects <6 and ≥6 years old, respectively,  on Day 28 of 
Cycle 2 (10, 10, 20  mg/kg).  These data suggest similar ataluren PK profiles in subjects 
<6 and ≥6 years old.  
Based on the above considerations, inclusion of young children in this protocol is 
appropriate.  Furthermore, there has been careful  consideration of the study design, wherein 
measures have been taken to minimize the number of subject visits and blood draws while 
maximizing the amount and quality of data required to effectively achieve the study 
objectives. 
Study of young children is i mportant given the onset of disease in early childhood, the 
importance of intervention when the disorder is still in its early phases, the limited treatment 
options that are currently available for this condition, and ataluren’s favorable benefit/risk 
profile. 
14.3 Benefit/Risk Conclusions  
Aniridia is a devastating disease wherein patients have multipl e ocular pathologies and 
become progressively visually handicapped.  Current therapeutic approaches to treat aniridia 
are limited in efficacy, such as surgical man agement of cataracts and glaucoma treatments to 
relieve intraocular pressure .  These treatments do not correct the anatomical defects 
associated with aniridia nor halt the progressive decline in visual acuity.  There is a high 
unmet medical need for an eff ective treatment for aniridia. 
Evaluation of ataluren as a treatment for nonsense mutation aniridia has sound scientific 
rationale founded on activity data from nonclinical disease models and clinical data from 
subjects with other genetic diseases, includi ng efficacy and safety data from Phase 2b/3, 
placebo-controlled trials in nmDMD and nmCF.  The safety profile of ataluren is supported 
by safety pharmacology and toxicology studies of appropriate type and duration, and b y 
Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 safe ty data obtained in children and adults; the development 
program has identified potential clinical safety risks and appropriate monitoring strategies are 
included in the clinical studies.  
Given the seriousness of aniridi a and the limitations of available t herapies, the aggregate 
potential benefits relative to the potential risks support further development of ataluren in this 
disease.

Clinical Protocol  
V7.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 93 of 96 16 APPENDICES  
16.1 Protocol Amendment History  
Changes in Version 6.0 ( 08 Nov 2018) to Version 7.0 ( 17 DEC 2019 ) 
Justification  for the amendment : Due to the continuing unavailability of any treatment 
options targeting the underlying cause of nonsense mutation aniridia, a very small disease 
population, and the enrollment challenges that were encountered du ring the study,  PTC  
Therapeutics  amended t he protocol, changing the primary endpoint from safety to efficacy in 
order to investigate the clinical utility of intervention with ataluren in the current study. The 
revised primary endpoint is the change from baseline (Visit 2/Day 1) to Week 48 in 
Maximum Reading Speed  of OU as measured using the MNREAD Acuity Charts ,  
 Maximum Reading Speed  is a person’s reading speed 
when reading is not limited by pr int size and is a measure that reflects the dynamic nature o f 
reading. Maximum Reading Speed  is known to be reduced when foveal vision is degraded, 
such as is seen in patients with aniridia . The primary objective was amended accordingly to 
reflect this cha nge in primary endpoint . Additionally,  the characterization of the systemic and 
ocular safety profile of ataluren in subjects with nonsense mutation aniridia was moved from 
being the primary objective to one of the secondary objectives. A corresponding sec ondary 
safety endpoint was added to reflect this change.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
8/13/2019  
  
Introduction . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is characterized by progressive airway 
obstruction and limited exercise tolerance.1,2 A major determinant of limited exercise tolerance in COPD  is 
the development of exercise -induced dynamic hyperinflation.3 The severity of exercise -induced d ynamic 
hyperinflation can be reduced using several strategies4 including a novel breathing -retraining  technique 
that we developed.5  By combining this technique with exercise -training , patients  with COPD can achieve 
greater improvement s in symptoms , functional status , and quality of life  than with exercise -training  alone .6-8  
   A crucial aspect of any pulmonary rehabilitation program  is the maint enance  of the early benefits of 
rehabilitation  over the long -term.9,10 Unfortunately, in most patients  those benefits significantly decrease six 
to twelve  months after  traditional  rehabilitation programs  have ended,9,11,12 and nearly disappear 
thereafter .13  The inability to maintain the  benefits  of traditional rehabilitation over time exposes patients to 
an increased risk of functional decline , exacerbations , hospitalizations , and worse  quality of life .9,12,14,15 The 
few patients in whom  the benefits of traditional pulmonary rehabilitation persist ove r time are those who 
achieve high self -efficacy .13   
   Cognizant of these findings, we explored whether self-efficacy was affected by our breathing technique in 
64 COPD patients undergoing rehabilitation.5 In that study, self -efficacy (quantified in terms of mastery over 
breathing) was greater after exercise -training plus breathing -retraining than  after exercise -training  alone.5 
This observation raises the possibility that COPD patients undergoing rehabilitation program s where 
breathing -retraining  is combined to traditional  exercise -training  may maintain the beneficial  effects of 
rehabilitation for a longer time than patients undergoing traditional exercise alone . Accordingly, we propose 
to test the hypothesis that in COPD patients, improvements in exercise duration on a constant -load 
treadmill test  will be greater afte r completing 12 -weeks of breathing -retraining  plus treadmill exercise  
followed by a 42 -week adherence -intervention  program  (one year total) than after completing 12 -weeks of 
treadmill exercise alone  followed by a 42 -week adherence -intervention  program . The adherence -
intervention  will consist of weekly phone calls and monthly ‘booster’ visits to reinforce  both exercise and , 
for the breathing -retraining group,  breathing training. In addition, we propose to study potential 
mechanisms that can affect long-term sustainability  of the gains achieved through pulmonary rehabilitation.  
 
Hypothesis/Research Questions   
Primary  
H1 In patients with COPD, improvements in exercise duration  on a constant -load treadmill test will be 
greater after completing 12 weeks of breathing -retraining  plus treadmill exercise -training  followed by a 
42-week adherence -intervention  program  (one year total)  than after  completing 12 weeks of treadmill 
exercise -training  alone followed by a 42-week adherence -intervention  program  (one year total) . 
Secondary  
H2 One year after randomization , reduction s in exercise -induced dynamic hyperinflation  during  a constant -
load treadmill test will be greater in the breathing -retraining group than in the exercise -alone  group.  
H3 One year after randomization , improvements in the 6-minute walk distance  will be greater in the 
breathing -retraining group than in the exercise -alone group.  
H4  One year after randomization , improvements in percei ved mastery over breathing  will be greater in the 
breathing -retraining group than in the exercise -alone group . 
     
 
 
 General Overview of Design.  The proposed study has been designed as a randomized , controlled 
clinical trial. After completing baseline testing, patients will be randomized to one of two groups: breathing -
retraining plus exercise -training  or exercise -training  alone . We did not include a non -treatment group as it 
has been clearly demonstrated that patients randomized to a non -treatment group (no exercise -training) 
experience no significant improvements in exercise capacity.12,16  
 
   Sample  Size Calculation . Sample size calculations for the current proposal are based on two 
considerations . First, in our previous investigation6 we observed that the mean exercise endurance 6 
weeks after the completion  of training  was 7.0 min greater with exercise plus breathing -retraining than with 
exercise  alone . When the analysis was restricted to those patients who developed exercise -induced 
dynamic hyperinflation, the difference was 8.27 min . Second, due to greater gains in mastery over 
breathing  with exercise plus breathing -retraining than with exercise alone ,47 we expect that the difference in 
exercise endurance between the two groups will widen over time – i.e., we expect that the breathing -
retraining group will better maintain the benefits of rehabilitation than the exercise -alone group . Based on 
these cons iderations we conservatively estimate that the difference in exercise duration between the 
groups at 12 months will be 8.27 minutes with a pooled standard deviation of 13.7 min (effect size =.60) . 
This means that to achieve 85% power , 100 patients are need ed (50 in each group) using two -sample t -
test ( =.05) .  
   According to the local IRB, enrollment  is the equivalent to a patient signing an informed consent . In our 
three latest studies,6,7,84 30-46% of patients who signed the informed consent (i.e., enrollees) did not meet 
PFT criteria or did not qualify for other reasons.  Accordingly, t o have complete data  on 100 patients while 
accounting for attrition due to disqualifying conditions, lack of exercise -induced dynamic hyperinflation, and 
short -term and long -term attrition, we plan to ‘enroll’ 250 patients (i.e., signed informed consent) and to 
‘randomize’ 140 of them .  
 
 Recruitment. Patients  with moderate -to-severe COPD ,  40 years of age, will be recruited from the 
outpatient Pulmonary Medicine Service at the Hines  VA (Table 1). No patient will be excluded based on 
gender or ethnic ity. About 9 patients per month will be ‘enrolled ’ with 5 of them being ‘randomized ’.      
  Screening a nd Baseline 
Testing . Proposed study 
participants will be screened for 
eligibility  and written informed 
consent will be obtained . All 
testing and training will take place 
at Hines  VAH’s Physical 
Performance Research 
Laboratory . During screening, 
patients  will be asked  about their 
medical history  and medication 
use. This will be followed by 
physical examination , pulmonary 
function  testing  and completion of 
quality of life/dyspnea 
questionnaires . Then, patients will 
undergo an incremental -load 
treadmill test . Thereafter, e ligible patients will perform the baseline tests7 that include two constant -load 
treadmill tests , functional assessment of the respiratory muscles and quadriceps, quadriceps 
ultrasonography , physical activity mo nitoring  and 6-min walk  test. After the baseline testing is completed 
and study criteria are met, patients will b e randomized to breathing -retraining  plus exercise -training  or to 
exercise -training  alone .  
   Randomization will be computer -generated with permuted blocks  with random block sizes . This strategy 
is intended to preserve balance in the randomization of patients to maintain  unpredictability of the 
treatment assignments . Group assignment will be managed by the Hines Cooperative Studies Program 
Coordinating Center (CSPCC) . When a patient is ready for randomization, we will contact the CSPCC to 
receive the randomization designation . To maintain testing integrity, one Co-PI will supervise  patient testing 
and will be blinded to group assignment . When data are reviewed, the data will be void of any identifiers .  
 
   Exercise Prescription  (All patient s). Ambulation is a critical element to achiev e adequate quality of life 
and independence .  Accordingly, the primary mode of training will consist of ambulation on a treadmill . An 
individualized treadmill exercise prescription  (interval training )34,36,89 will be prepared for each pa tient. This 
prescription will specify exercise intensity, duration of exercise interval s, duration  of recovery interval s, and 
number of repetitions ). During training, patients will progress through six levels of exercise intensity .90  At 
‘Level 1’, patients will exercise for a total of 25 min with 5 min of aerobic exercise at workloads equivalent 
to 60, 65, 70, 75 and 80% of VO 2peak. By the time patients progress to ‘Level 6’, they will complet e a total of 
50 min of aerobic exercise, with 35 min of training at 80 and 85% of VO 2peak . Rest periods between exercise 
intervals will be based on individual recovery patterns.7  
   All training session s will also include progressive upper and lower body resistance exercise s.7 Upper 
body resistance exe rcise s will be carried out using  rubber bands (TheraBand ), light hand weights and a 
Series II 8400 Schwinn Strength system .7 Lower body resistance exercise s will be carried out using a 
LifeFitness leg curl, leg extension and leg press .45 Patients  will complete upper body exercises that recruit  
accessory muscles of respiration7 and lower body exercise s that recruit muscles of ambulation. Upper and 
lower body resistance training will include 6 -8 exercises (e.g., triceps  extensions, later al arm raises , leg 
press ), it will be progressive (i.e., bands with greater resistance and heavier weights will be used as 
 
Table 1.  Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
patients ’ strength improves ), and it will be completed in two sets of 12 -15 repetitions per exercise.7  
Patients will be instructed to avoid breath -holding during resistance exercise  training .  
   All patient s will exercise 3 times weekly for approximately 25 -50 min of aerobic training  and 
approximately 15 min of resistance training . To enhance self -efficacy for exercise during activities of daily 
living and mirror  “real-life” home exercise, two exercise sessions during the last two weeks of training will 
take place outside of the lab (i.e., in the hallways or outdoors). During these sessions, the patient and 
trainer will problem solve real -life issues such as using perceived severity of exertion and perceived 
severity of breathless to gauge exercise intensity outside of the lab and, for the breathing -retraining group , 
practice slow breathing without the computer feedbac k. During testing and training , supplemental oxygen  
will be administered as needed to maintain SpO 2 ≥90% .  
     Exercise -Training . For all patients, training session s will include a warm -up period, an interval training  
period , and a cool down period.7 Before, during and after training , heart rate, blood pressure, perceived 
severity of exertion and perceived severity of dyspnea (Borg ratio scale) will be recorded.7  Patients will 
receive instructions on how to use the Borg scale.7  The Level  of exercise intensity will be based on 
protocol guidelines . Patients will complete at least two training sessions at each Level  before progressing 
to the next Level.7  This p rogression will be based on rating of dyspnea (consisten t ratings < 3 [moderate 
dyspnea]) and/or reduction in the duration of rest periods between exercise intervals .  
     Breathing -Retraining . Breathing -retraining  will be conducted with the same strategy we successfully 
used in our previous stud ies .6-8  Patients will breathe through a pneumotach ometer  interfaced to a 
computer. Inhalation (T I) and exhalation times (TE) will be displayed on the computer’s screen  as moving 
horizontal bars. TI and T E goals will be shown as ‘‘targets’’ on the screen. These  goals, and thus, 
respiratory frequency goals will be based on the breathing pattern recorded during the baseline 
incremental -load test .6-8  During inhalation , the bar on the computer screen  will move to the left of the 
screen; during exhalation, it will move  to the right . Patients are given a score (“hit” or “miss”) with each 
breath. If at a ny time during training the patient is not able to hit the exhalation and inhalation targets at 
least 85% of the time, the respiratory rate will be  increased by 1 breath/min increments until the patient can 
consistently “hit” the targets. When the patient is again able to hit the targets at least 85% of the time, the 
breathing -retraining parameters will be  returned to levels corresponding to the goal s of respiratory pattern 
for the given level of exercise .  To avoid  a potential placebo effect  (i.e., desensitization  to exercise -induced 
dyspnea as a result of being distracted by the computer screen) , patients in the exercise -only group  will 
train while watching  scenic venues  on the computer screen . 
 
     Adherence -Intervention  Program . Following the 12 week s of supervised training, all patients will 
participate in the adherence -intervention  program  developed . This adherence intervention program  
consist s of three elements: use of pedometer, weekly motivational phone interviews and monthly ‘booster’ 
structured rehabilitation  session in the lab.  
Pedometer . All patients will receive  a pedometer with weekly step goals. The initial goal will be to walk 
800 more steps than the number of steps walked during Week-12 of supervised training . Patients will be 
instructed to increase the number of weekly steps as recommended by Moy et al.91 
Weekly M otivational Interviewing  by Telephone . Motivational interviewing is a patient -centered, 
directive  style intervention intended to enhance readiness for lifestyle change by helping patients explore 
and resolve ambivalence.92 The w eekly motivational interviews by tele phone will be preferably carried out 
by the trainer who primarily work ed with the patient . The purpose of the se interview s is to strengthen the 
patients ’ motivation and commitment to the program . The trainer will ask patient s how often they exercised 
during the previous week and for how long . Patients in the  breathing -retraining plus exercise  group will also 
be asked  on their use of the breathing techniques taught in the lab . If patients are not adherent to the home  
program , the trainer will work with them  to overcome or minimize real or perceived barriers  to adher ence. 
We expect  that each phone call will last about 10 min.  
Monthly  Booster  Training Sessions . These sessions are intended to review information previously 
taught  to the patients , to re-evaluate each patients ’ home program and to provide reinforcement and 
encouragemen t. During the booster sessions, p atients will undergo exercise -training  at the same intensity 
as in the last lab session . (We recognize that there may be a need to adjust  the intensity of exercise in 
some patients .) Upon completion of exercise , staff will discuss facilitators and barriers to physical activity 
outside the lab . For breathing -retraining patients , the booster session  will include breathing -retraining set 
with the same specifications as the last session completed in the lab . In these patients , the session will 
include a discuss ion to reinforc e the need to practice the breathing strategies taught  in the lab during 
activities of daily living . Based on the findings of McAuley et al ,93 we reason that the proposed booster 
sessions will have a powerful effect on self -efficacy  as they will provid e information on mastery and 
additional motivation  to the patients .     
   Time Summary . The two groups  of patients  will complete the same testing procedures at the same time 
intervals .  During training, all patients will exercise in the lab oratory  for about 1 hour thrice  weekly .  
 
  Treadmill Test Protocols . All treadmill tests will be separated by at least 48 hours  of rest . 
      Incremental -Load Treadmill Test . The purpose for this  test is to determine the patient’ s VO 2peak and 
his/her breathing pattern during exercise . This information will be used to set the workload during the 
constant -load treadmill test and to set the breathing -retraining goals during exercise -training . At the start of 
the incremental -load test the treadmill will be set at 0% grade and a t a speed of 1.8 mph . Every 30 sec onds  
during testing , the incline will increase  by 0.5%. Additionally, after minute 6  of the protocol , the treadmill’s 
speed  will increase by 0.2 mph every 3 min . With this protocol, energy demands step up  by one metabolic 
equivalent (MET)94 every 3 min .  
     Constant -Load Treadmill Test . The purpose of this test is to determine exercise duration, respiratory 
pattern, extent of exercise -induced dynamic hyperinflation, dyspnea and leg fatigue at randomization, after 
12-weeks of training and 6 and 12 months  after randomization . The speed and grade of the treadmill will be 
the same a s the speed and grade recorded when patient s reached 85% of their VO 2peak during the baseline 
incremental -load treadmill test .  
    Recordings During Incremental -Load  and Constant -Load Tests . During all treadmill tests, cardiac 
activity (Leads II, V1, and V5; General Electric), SpO 2 (Nellcor Works), airflow (MedGraphics). VO 2 and 
VCO 2 (MedGraphics) will be monitored  continuously . This setup allow s us to record of minute ventilation, 
tidal volume, and respiration rate  as well as breath -by-breath recording s of gas exchange .  
   As previously described,6,7,84  VO 2peak will be the highest value of VO 2 recorded between the 60 sec 
before and 30 sec after the incremental -load treadmill exercise test ends , when patients have reached their 
‘peak effort’ .  
  Inspiratory capacity will be measured just before each exercise test, every 2 min throughout the test, at 
peak exercise and at 2 and 4 min into rec overy.7 Similarly, b lood pressure will be recorded every 2 min . 
Ratings  of perceived dyspnea and exertion will be obtained using Borg's ratio scale49,50 during the last 30 
sec of each stage of exercise . For patients experiencing exercise desaturation (SpO 2 <90%), an oxygen  
reservoir system (100 L Douglas bag) will be used for continuous oxygen  suppl ementation .7  
 
   Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) . This questionnaire is d esigned to determine how 
the lives of patients with chronic airflow limitation are affected by the illness and the perceived impact of 
symptoms and limitations  on quality of life .105 The 20 questions on  the CRQ measure four dimensions:  
dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and the patient’s feeling of control over the disease (mastery) . Each 
question is scored during a structured interview . Test-retest reliability and validity  of the CRQ  have been 
established.106  Patient s will not be informed of their previous respon ses on the questionnaire when the 
CRQ  is administered at follow -up. CRQ scores will be used as covariates in the final analysis if appropriate.  
   Short Form -36 Health Survey  (SF-36): This is a general health -related quality of life instrument to 
quantify perceived physical function  and mental health .107,108 The SF -36 will be used to describe the sample 
and to have a comparator measure to published clinical pulmonary rehabilitation program s.109 
   Charlson  Comorbidity Index . This validated110 and widely utilized index65,66 will be used to determine 
whether comorbid ities influence study outcomes .  
   Depression  and Anxiety . To control for the influence of ongoing depression and anxiety on adherence, 
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES -D)111 and the State -Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(STAI)112-114 will be administered at baseline and  at major data collection time -periods.  CES-D and STAI 
scores will be used as co variate s in the final analysis  if appropriate . 
   Self-Efficacy . The Self -Efficacy for Walking115  and the Self -Efficacy for Shortness of Breath 
questionnaire s116 will be used to measure self -efficacy at all time  periods .115,117 These are reliable and 
valid116 instruments designed  to assess a patient’s confidence in keeping shortness of breath from 
interfer ing from walking or from doing what they want to do.  
   Exacerbations . Approximately 50% of patients with moderate -severe COPD are expected to experience 
an exacerbation over the course of 12 months.15 Exacerbations neg atively impact adherence to  exercise 
programs and quality of life.15  Exacerbations will be monitored weekly throughout the  study . Acute 
exacerbations are defined b y changes in sputum color, volume or consistency and are accompanied by an 
increase in dyspnea .60 Acute exacerbations are classified as mild  (the need for increased use of inhaled 
bronchodilators only) , moderate  (the need for systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics) , or severe  (the 
need for hospitalization) .60 Since moderate exacerbations usually resolve in approximately two weeks ,118 
patients who experience a n exacerbation within two weeks of testing will have their testing deferred  until 
the exacerbation has resolved.   
  
  Statistical Analysis.  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize  baseline characteristics of 
participa nts. Comparison of the two groups (breathing -retraining  plus exercise -training  and exercise -
training  alone) will be undertaken for all baseline variables to determine whether any imbalances on 
purported prognostic factors exist . T-test for two independent samples will be used f or comparison of the 
two groups at baseline, continuous data  and changes in co ntinuous  outcomes from basel ine to end of 
treatment . The continuity -corrected chi -square test will be used  to compare categorical data in the two 
groups at baseline and end of treatment . When this test is not appropriate due to small category 
frequencies, Fisher’s  exact test will be used . To examine the potential for response bias, b aseline 
measurements of patients who complete and do not complete follow -up visits will be compared.  This 
procedure will be done for the overall study sample and for each randomized group.  
 
Primary Hypotheses:     
H1:   IN PATIENTS WITH COPD,  IMPROVEMENTS IN EXERCISE DURATION  ON A CONSTANT -LOAD  TREADMILL TEST 
WILL BE GREATER AFTE R 12 WEEKS OF BREATHING -RETRAINING PLUS TREA DMILL  EXERCISE -TRAINING  FOLLOWED 
BY A 42-WEEK ADHERENCE -INTERVENTION  PROGRAM (ONE YEAR TOTAL ) THAN AFTER  12 WEEKS OF TREADMILL 
EXERCISE -TRAINING  ALONE FOLLOWED BY A  42-WEEK ADHERENCE -INTERVENTION  PROGRAM (ONE YEAR TOTAL ). 
 
The principal analysis of the primary outcome measure will compare changes in duration of exercise 
from baseline to end of follow -up in the constant -load treadmill test using the 2 -sample t -test (two -tailed P 
=.05). The primary analysis will be based on intention -to-treat principles (i.e., all randomized patients will be 
included in  the analysis). Multiple imputation will be used for study patients  who are missing the 12 -month 
measurement. This imputation model will be based on the baseline characteristics of the study participants. 
The primary analysis will be repeated, restricted t o patients who complete the treatment protocol. Linear 
regression will be used to determine whether the observed treatment persists after adjustment for baseline 
covariates and measures of treatment adherence. Since several measurements will be taken on ea ch 
patient, mixed -models analysis will be used to compare the changes on the constant -load treadmill test 
over time between the two groups. The missing data pattern will be explored to determine whether data 
have been informatively censored. If the data do  not appear to be missing at random, an indicator variable 
(alone and as an interaction with slope) will be used in the model to separately estimate intercepts and 
slopes for the censored group and the group with complete data. At the patient level, random  intercepts 
and slopes will be assumed. Several correlation structures will be evaluated to determine which best 
represents the observed correlation structure. We will also use multiple imputation to estimate the missing 
values in the mixed -model ANOVA as a sensitivity analysis. This will be accomplished in two ways. The 
first multiple imputation technique will account for the treatment group to which each study participant was 
randomized. We will then use a second multiple imputation model in which all mis sing values are imputed 
from a model that only includes data from the control group. This latter multiple imputation model will 
provide a lower bound (or conservative) estimate of the treatment differences.   
 
Secondary Hypotheses : 
H2:  ONE YEAR AFTER RANDOM IZATION , REDUCTIONS IN EXERCISE -INDUCED DYNAMIC HYPE RINFLATION  WILL BE 
GREATER IN THE BREAT HING-RETRAINING GROUP THA N IN THE EXERCISE -ALONE GROUP . 
Statistical analysis for H 2 will parallel that of H 1. 
H3:  ONE YEAR AFTER RANDOM IZATION , IMPROVEMENTS IN THE  6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE  WILL BE GREATER IN 
THE BREATHING -RETRAINING GROUP THA N IN THE EXERCISE -ALONE GROUP . 
Statistical analysis for H 3 will parallel that of H 1. 
H4:  ONE YEAR AFTER RANDOM IZATION , IMPROVEMEN TS IN PERCEIVED MASTERY OVER BREATHI NG WILL BE 
GREATER IN THE BREAT HING-RETRAINING GROUP THA N IN THE EXERCISE -ALONE GROUP .  
      Statistical analysis for H 4 will parallel that of H 1.

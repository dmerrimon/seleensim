Objective  
The Behavioral Neurology Unit studies the human brain s ystems underlying learning and adaptation with 
the ultimate goal of finding interventions to make these processes more efficient . We are interested in  
whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  (rTMS) can alter functional connectivity (FC) and 
behavioral efficiency in two memory networks in the brain: the hippocampal  network, which supports the 
storage and retrieval of recallable facts, concepts, and events, and the striatal network, which supports the 
storage and retrieval of skills and habits . Additionally, b ecause these networks interact  behaviorally and 
can interfere with each other , an important question is whether neuromodulation  of one network changes 
connectivity  and efficiency  in the other network . Pilot data from our group suggest that exogenous 
stimulation of one network causes it to expand  its range of FC  and co-opt resources from the other , which 
is a potenti al mechanism for the observed behavioral interaction . This study is  designed to test a) whether  
rTMS - modulates within -network FC and memory supported by that network , and b) whether this also 
causes FC and behavioral changes in the other  network .  
 
Study population : Healt hy Volunteers  
 
Design  
This study contains four between -subject s experiments  and is a mixed inter -/intra subject design . 
Experiment 1  will use nominally excitatory stimulation targeting  the hippocampal network to increase  FC 
within the hippocampal network . We also e xpect to increase FC between the hippocampal and striatal  
networks , increased  declarative  memory , and a possible decrease in procedural, learning. Experiment 2 
will use excitatory stimulation  targeted to the stri atal network . We expect this to cause  stronger within -
network FC in the striatal  network , increased FC between the hippocampus and the striatal  network  and 
concomitant behavioral effects . Experiments 3 and 4 will be similar except that we will  target nomin ally 
inhibitory stimulation to these networks and look for the inverse results . FC will be measured under 
resting and task -activated conditions and active rTMS will be compared to vertex sham.  
 
Outcome measures  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 2 of 34  The primary outcome measure is the change in FC produced by rTMS  within the targeted network . 
Between -network FC changes and corresponding  memory changes  will be secondary  outcomes . 
Exploratory  measures will include  correlations between individual cognitive differences (questionnaires 
and NIH Toolbox scores ), and our primary and secondary outcome measures.

page 5 of 34  1. Introduction  and Background  
a. Background  
Memory deficits are among the most debilitating problems  in neurolog y (Nestor et al., 2005; Vakil, 
2005) , reduce quality of life for  caregivers  (Kreutzer et al., 1994) , and tax the American public  financially  
(e.g., $80-100 billion /yr for Alzheimer disease; CDC & NCCDPHP, 2000) . Memory is affected 
disproportionately  among cognitive functions in  traumatic brain injury (TBI ; Levin et al., 1988)  and an 
estimated 3.2 -5.3 million Americans are living with a TBI -related disability (Frieden et al., 2015) . 
Because there are no accepted methods for improving memory in amnestic patients, new approaches are 
urgently needed . Additionally, the rise in popularity of “brain training” indicates a growing interest in 
improving memory amongst healthy adults (Rabipour & Raz, 2012) . While behavioral approaches such as 
brain training have gained popularity, their utility to everyday human function is controversial  (Simons et 
al., 2016) .  
 
Cognitive functions, such as memory, reside in brain networks (Power et al., 2011)  and brain  disorders 
disrupt these networks, causing effects on behavior (Gratton et al., 2012) . The two characterized memory 
networks are the striatum -centered  memory system (Keele et al., 2003; Knowlton et al., 1996) , and 2) the 
hippocampal -centered  memory system (Knowlton et al., 199 6; Raichle et al., 2001) . The striatal system 
supports  the encoding and retrieval of skills and habits through repetition  (e.g., riding a bike; procedural 
memories ), whereas the hippocampal system supports the encoding and retrieval of recallable facts 
related to objects, events, or concepts (e.g., knowing a bike has two wheels; declarative mem ories ). 
Although commonly discussed as discrete systems, the y interact  (Mattfeld & Stark, 2010, 2015; Poldrack 
et al., 2001) , and learning typical ly involves both declarative and procedural acquisition . (Ghilardi et al., 
2009) . Evidence  from neuroimaging (Mattfeld & Stark, 2010, 2015; Poldrack et al., 2001) , behavioral  
studies in healthy subjects  (Ashby & Crossley, 2010; Foerde et al., 2006, 2007)  and patients  (Foerde et 
al., 2013; Moody et al., 2004) , and lesion experiments  in rats (Lee et al., 2008; Packard & McGaugh, 
1996) , support a competitive relationship between systems . For example, engaging in learning of one 
memory type can interfere with learning of the other (Brown & Robertson, 2007; Cohen & Robertson, 
2011) . 
 
rTMS has been shown to improve declarative memory (W ang et al., 2014 ; Figure 1), but it is unknown 
whether this enhancement is associated with behaviora l effects on procedural memory or whether 
modulation of the striatal network affects declarati ve memory. Although TMS has been used to show a 
double dissociation between stimulation of different cortical sites and their effects on procedur al and 
declarative memory (Cohen & Robertson, 2011; Galea et al.,  2010) , these studies did not include a 
measure of target engagement. Therefore, these studie s cannot be considered mechanistically informative . 
To optimize the effect of  rTMS on learning and memory , a mechanistic understanding of how these 
improvements  occur is required . We will attempt to fill this gap by using functional connectivity (FC) as 
a marker of target engagement , and measuring changes in procedural and declarative learning . Because 
understanding mechanistic changes are necessary to optimize  the effect on behavior, changes in FC will 
serve as  our primary outcome measure.  
 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 7 of 34  field, rTMS affect s network -level activity beyond the site of stimulation (Fox et al., 2012) . By applying 
rTMS to a cortical site known to be connected to a network of interest, it is possible to modulate t he FC 
of that network (Eldaief et al., 2011; Rahnev et al., 2013; Steel et al., 2016; van der Werf et al., 2010; 
Vercammen et al., 2010) . Wang, and colleagues (2014) delivered nominally excitatory (20  Hz) rTMS to 
the subject -specific posterior parietal cortex (PPC) site that was maximally connected to the anterior 
hippocampus and observed robust increases in hippocampal network FC . Specifically, this technique 
increased resting -state FC (rsFC) between the hippocampus and several cortical regions (Fig. 3 Image 
showing Stiumlation -dependent enhancement of hippocampal network ). These changes were specific to 
the hippocampal network , and not the local site of stimulation , as the voxels throughout the brain with the 
highest baseline FC with the hippocampus showed the largest FC increase . Furthermore, these effects 
were present two -weeks later (Wang & Voss, 2015) . The validity of using rsFC of a cortical area with a 
deep node (the hippocampus) as a subject -specific targeting guide and then using the change in FC as an 
outcome measure has been e stablished by Wang et al (2014)  and confirmed in our  laboratory (see pilot 
data below ).  
 
Using this technique , we will  attempt to increase and decrease FC within the hippocampal  and striatal  
memory systems by selectively  targeting  each network  with rTMS  in separate experiments . We predict 
that rTMS  will cause changes in FC and memory in the  targeted network , which  correspond with the 
stimulation protocol: Nominally excitatory stimulation will cause enhancement of the targeted network, 
and nominally inhibitory stimulation will cause FC to decrease . Additionally, because these networks are 
known to interact  in behavioral and 
imaging experiments  (Brown & 
Robertson, 2007; Cohen & Robertson, 
2011; Mattfeld & Stark, 2010, 2015; 
Poldrack et al. , 2001), we expect that 
altering the function of one network 
will cause changes in the pattern of FC 
in the other . Pilot data from our 
laboratory (Fig. 4 Connectivity changes 
with left Precuneus and medial 
Occipital Cortex ) show that declarative 
 network FC enhancement is accompanied by significantly increased rsFC between the striatum 
and the hippocampal  network . “Capture” of one system by the other is a good explanation for why 
behavioral engagement in one learning type interferes with the other (Brown & Robertson, 2007; Cohen 
& Robertson, 2011) .  
b. Pilot  Data  
Pilot data from our laboratory show that enhancing the hippocampal network with rTMS  via the PPC  
(Wang et al., 2014)  is effective and replicable: Nine subjects tested showed significant FC increases 
between the hippocampus and regions that showed a group -level increase in FC with the hippocampus in 
Wang et al. (precuneus and medial occipital cortex; t(8) = 2.73, p < 0.05, d = 0.75; Fig. 4). To show that 
these effects were specific to the hippocampus, we calculated FC  changes between the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex and the same regions (i.e. precuneus and medial occipital cortex), and found no change 
from pre - to post -stimulation (p = 0.22) . Furtherm ore, the increase in hippocampus  FC with the 
precuneus/medial occipital cortex were significantly greater than the change in global connectedness of 
the brain ( t(8) = 2.62, p  < 0.05, d = 0.58), showing that these effects were network -specific .  
 
These pilot data, however, also suggest rTMS targeted to the hippocampus and connected areas also 
affect s the striatal  network . Figure 4  shows statistically significant FC increases between the caudate and 
the precuneus/medial occipital cortex . Thus, in addition to increasing FC in the hippocampal  network, 
rTMS also caused the striatum to be pulled into tighter association with the hippocampal network . 
Figure 3.  Hippocampal FC changes from Wang et al. (2014)  
 Stimulation -dependent enhancement of hippocampal network overlaid on a 
template brain from Wang et al. (2014). The highlighted regions  represent the 
areas that increased in FC with the hippocampus caused by PPC  stimulation.  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 8 of 34  Structural equation modeling, which can be used to determine the direction of influence between network 
nodes, indicate d a robust increase in connectivity from the striatum to the precuneus and medial occipital 
cortex after stimulation . This may explain why behavioral engagement of the hippocampal  network 
interferes with procedural learning (Brown & Robertson, 2007; Poldrack et al., 2001) . Based on  these 
preliminary findings, we will guide rTMS to the hippocampal network and examine the effects on both 
the hippocampal -dependent memory system and the striatal  memory system . We will also target the 
striatal  network, and look for similar effects on the hippocampal  network .

c. Resting -State vs. Task -Based  Connectivity  
The results of Wang et al. (2014) and data from our laboratory show that rTMS can enhance rsFC within 
a targeted network . However, it is unknown whether the same is true of tbFC . Because tbFC may be a 
better measure of stimulation -induced changes, we will include this measurement in our experiments and 
compare the results to rsFC .  
d. Measuring  mentation  during  resting -state  scans.  
Recent work has revealed that me ntation patterns during resting -state scanning correlates with FC 
measurements (Gregory et  al., 2016) . Because differences in mentation between participants  are difficult 
to control and could potentially explain our results, we will include a measure of mentation (the 
Amsterdam Resting -State Questionnaire) as an exploratory measure to our pr otocol .  
2. Study Objectives  
The overall objective of this study is to determine whether the hippocampal  and striatal  memory networks 
can be modulated  using rTMS . We will also examine cross network changes in FC  by guiding nominally 
excitatory and inhibitory stimulation to the striatal  and hippocampal  memory networks and measuring the 
effects on both the targeted and non -targeted one . The results will be used to inform future clinical trials 
of rTMS in patients w ith disorders of learning and memory  and possibly to enhance and accelerate 
learning in healthy individuals .

Table 2 shows  the timeline of each experiment . Each study will include FC and memory testing at 
baseline , 24-hours  after, and two weeks after  three days of  rTMS . The number of days of rTMS is  based 
on pilot data where  three days of stimulation produces significant enhancement of rsFC in the 
hippocampal network in five out of six individuals tested . Each participant will make a maximum of 6 
visits to the lab (not including screening), for a maximum time commitment of 14 hours . The 24 -hour 
follow -up will occur between 12 and 48  hours after the last stimulation session, and the 2 -week follow -up 
will occur 14 -21 days after baseline measurements . Scanning will occur in the NIH NMRF . All visits will 
be outpatient .

Healthy participants will be recruited from the pool of individuals self-referring to the study 
directly and via the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program. Although NIH employees will be 
allowed to participate, no direct solicitation of employees/staff by supervisors or co-workers will 
take place. All recruitment material will be IRB approved. Participants who indicate interest will 
be pre-screened over the phone. Pre-screening questions are listed in Appendix B. 
 
Healthy participants will be recruited from the pool of individuals self-referring to the study 
directly and via the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program and via advertisements that will 
be pre-approved by the IRB. Although NIH employees will be allowed to participate, no direct 
solicitation of employees/staff by supervisors or co-workers will take place. Any recruitment 
material will be IRB approved. Participants who indicate interest will be pre-screened by phone. 
Pre-screening questions are listed in Appendix B. 
  
IRB-approved ads will be posted on NIH listservs with the permission of the moderator and IRB 
required statement on how the receiver was identified. Listservs may include NIH sponsored 
recruitment list serves such as (NIH HV recruitment list serv). Listserv announcement will 
include: 
  
“You are receiving this message because your email address is included in the above NIH 
Listserv/mailing list. The purpose of this message is to inform you of studies that are recruiting 
volunteers at NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. The moderator of the listserv/mailing list has permitted 
its use for this distribution”.  
 
i. Participant  rescheduling   
It is likely that some participants will miss some sessions . If this occurs, and the participant is still willing 
to participate, we will reschedule . If the subject has already received rTMS, we will wait at least 30 days 
to reschedule the session so that the effects of stimulation wash out . If a participant misses a visit after 
baseline measures have been collected, bes ides the two week follow -up visit,  baseline measurements 
(MRI and behavioral assessments) will be performed again . If a participant completes all visits, but is 
unable to attend the follow -up visit, their attendance in the study will be considered complete . 
c. Screening   
Participants who pass pre -screening will be invited to participate in the study and scheduled for consent 
and formal screening .  
 
Upon arrival to the screening appointment, written, i nformed consent will be obtained by an investigator 
and formal screening will be done according to Appendix A.  
 
Volunteers who have not had a neurological exam from an NINDS provider within the past two years will 
receive a neurological examination from an NINDS physician or nurse practitioner . This will not repla ce 
any exam the participant will receive for purposes of medical care; the exam will be for resear ch purposes 
only. All women of child -bearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test (not earlier than 24 hours) 
before each MRI scan .  
d. Study  procedures  
ii. Behavioral  Tasks   
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 12  of 34  Behavioral testing will occur at baseline, 24 -hours, and two -weeks after stimulation.  
 
Weather Prediction Task (feedback version; WPT -F) - This is a test of the ability to learn an implicit, 
stochastic, association by trial and error and re cruits a brain network including the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex and the head of the caudate nucleus, primarily in the right hemisphere . In the WPT, participants 
learn to predict a binary outcome, based on arbitrary stimuli with a hidden statistical lin k to that outcome . 
One, two, or three -card combinations of four possible cards are presented on a computer and the subject is 
asked to predict the “weather;” i.e. whether it will be rainy or fine . After each prediction, the subject 
receives corrective feedback . Each card is independently associated with one outcom e with a fixed 
probability . For example, the probability of rainy might be 0.2 for squares, 0.4 for diamonds, 0.6 for 
circles, and 0.8 for triangles . We will use three different vers ions of the task at the three test sessions (see 
below) . The task has 200 trials, with breaks after every 50 trials .  
 
Weather Prediction Task (Observational version; WPT -O) – The observational version of the WPT 
resembles a paired associates test where th e feedback and cards are displayed on the screen are shown on 
the screen together . After all pairs are shown the cards are again shown an d the participant is asked to 
remember which feedback outcome (rain or fine) goes with that set of cards . Unlike the WP T-I, the WPT -
E recruits brain regions that support declarative  memory . Both version each take  approximately 20 
minutes . The order of the tasks will be counterbalanced across  participants.  
iii. MRI  
We estimate a maximum of 2 hours for each scan in all experiment s. Because scanner malfunctions and 
subsequent loss of data are common we will not report these as unexpected problems at the time  of 
occurrence, but only at the time of continuing review . Subjects whose data are lost due to scanner 
malfunctions will be re scheduled, if possible.  
1. MRI Anatomical scanning 
All subjects will have anatomical (MPRAGE) scans at basel ine, 24 -hours, and 2 -weeks after rTMS . 
Participants who have not had one in the past year will receive a standard clinical MRI scan of the head,  
which will be submitted to the Diagnostic Radiology Department CC for interpretation . Depending on the 
requirement for a clinical scan, this phase will take 10 -30 min .  
2. Resting-State FC 
During scanning, participants will be instructed to l ie motionless wi th open eyes fixated on a cross that is 
presented on a screen visible through a mirror attached to the MR head coil (approximately 10 min).  
3. Task-Based FC 
During scanning, participants will perform both versi ons of the WPT and tbFC will be measured . During  
the feedback version of the task, when a response is required, participants will respond using one  of two 
buttons on a button box inside the scanner . Participants will respond verbally during the retrieval phase of 
the WPT -O. 
iv. rTMS  
The parietal target in Experiments 1 and 3  will be the region of the left  PPC with the greatest connectivity 
with the left hippocampus derived from the baseline resting -state fMRI session, (similar to Wang et al.  
2014) . The left PPC  was chosen because of its dense connections wi th the hippocampus (Cavada & 
Goldman -Racic, 1989; Mesulam et al., 1977) . 
 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 13  of 34  The target in Experiments 2 and 4  will be the M1 area of maximal connectivity with the right  striatum . 
M1 has extensive projections to the striatum (Parent & Hazrati, 1995) , and these regions are functionally 
connected at rest (Di Martino et al., 2008) . 
 
rTMS targets will be marked in the participant’s anatomical MRI volume and located with a frameless 
stereotaxic system . If any experiment, for any reason, fails to produce useful individual targets,  a 
literature -based location for the parietal cortex (Wang, et al ., 2014)  or motor cortex will be used as our 
location of stimulation . To reduce the influence of diurnal variations in the  responsiveness to 
neuroplasticity protocols (Sale, Ridding, & Nordstrom, 2008) , we will make every eff ort to test subjects 
during the same time of day.  
 
20-Hz Stimulation  (facilitation)  will be delivered  at 100% of the motor evoked potential threshold and 20 -
Hz in trains  lasting  2 s for 20 min with 28 second rests in -between trains (similar to Wang et al., 2014) .  
 
Continuous Theta -Burst  Stimulation (cTBS; inhibition)  will be delivered at 80% of active motor  threshold 
for 40 seconds  (similar to Huang  et al., 2005 ). cTBS consists of 50 -Hz triplets separated by 200ms.  
 
Control stimulation . As a negative control, rTMS will be delivered to the vertex  with the same delivery 
parameter values and neuronavigation . Wang and colleagues (2014 ) used vertex  stimulation as a control 
condition and found no significant effects on rsFC  or behavior . In addition, there is no evidence that 
vertex stimulation causes  other  changes in rsFC (Jung et al., 2016) . 
 
Contingency for Ex perim ents 3 and 4  if we are unable to inhibit each network . Because targeted 
inhibition  of the hippocampal  and striatal  network with cTBS has not been demonstrated, i t is possible 
that cTBS may not yield the expected  inhibitory effects in Experiments 3 and 4 . Thus, we will examine 
the results from the first three subjects receiving active stimulation in Experiments 3 and 4 and if there is 
no clear decrease of  FC in the targeted  network, we will run a cohort of 3 subjects using 1 -Hz rTMS . We 
will proceed with the stimulation type that demonstra tes the most reliable inhibitory effect .  
 
 1-Hz Stimulation . Stimulation will be delivered at 115% of the motor evoked potential threshol d at 1 -Hz 
continuously for 16 minutes (similar to Chen et al., 1997) . 
v. Cognitive  Battery  
The purpose of the battery is to detect effects on other memory processes  other than those targeted in the 
study , characterize participants cognitive abilities at baseline,  and to monitor for unexpected deleterious 
effects of stimulation . The data will be treated as exploratory . Some tasks will only be included at 
baseline (ind icated below) . These tests will not be given inside of the scanner . The battery includes the 
following tests:  
 
1) Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (executive function and attention) - Participants 
respond to the direction of a target arrow while  inhibiting attention to arrows flanking the target 
arrow (~3 minutes) . This test will only be given at baseline.  
 
2)  Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (executive function a nd set -shifting) – Participants must 
match pictures based on one of two rules . These rules are transposed and participants’ set -shifting 
abilities are measured by their accuracy and reaction time (~4 minutes) . This test will only be 
given at baseline.  
 
3) List Sorting Working Memory Test (for working memory) – Participants are given two lists  of 
items (e.g. animals and foods) and are asked to list the items in size order . The task requires the 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 14  of 34  participant to concurrently remember the items while sorting (< 10 minutes) . This test will only 
be given at baseline.  
 
4) Picture Sequence Memory Test (fo r story sequence memory) – Participants are given a list of 
objects and must remember the order of these objects in relation to each other . For example, if 
object A is listed in position X, the participant must recall what object is in pos ition X+1 (~7 
minutes) .  
 
5) Oral Reading Recognition Test (for language) – The participant is asked to read individual words 
and the researcher records whether the word is read correctly (~3 minutes) . This test will only be 
given at baseline.  
 
6) The Picture Vocabulary Test (for language) – Participants are aurally presented with a word and 
must match that word with one of four pictures that b est represents the meaning of the word . The 
number of correct responses is recorded (~4 minutes) . This test will only be given at basel ine. 
 
7) Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (for processing speed) – Participants are presented 
with two pictures and must determine whether they are the same or different . The number of 
correct responses in 90 seconds is recorded (~3 minutes) . This tes t will only be given at baseline.  
 
8) Georgia Complex Figures task (for visual memory) – Participants are asked to copy a complex 
drawing, and reproduce it from memory after a 20 -minute delay . The number of successful 
elements of the complex figure are recorded (~ 5 minutes without delay) .  
 
9) Category Fluency test (for category fluency) – Participants are given a category (e.g. animals, 
tools) and are asked to name as many category members in 60 seconds as possible (~ 2 minute s).  
 
10) Verbal paired associates test  (for verbal memory) – This test is similar to the WPT -O, but instead 
of new items used at each time point, the same pairs are retested at the end of the week of 
stimulation (~ 5 minutes) .  
 
11) Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ) (a subjective memory assessme nt) – Participants are 
asked 13 questions to assess their impression of their memory function . For each question, 
participants rate how often a particular memory problem has occurred, e.g. not being able to 
recall a word, having to check something that has  already been done (~ 3 minutes) .  
 
12) Neuro -QOL  forms: Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance  – Participants report outcome 
measures through computer adaptive tests (CAT), short  forms, or scales . (~ 20 minutes).  
vi. Amsterdam  Resting -State  Questionnaire  
The ARSQ  will be administered immediately after each resting -state scan and includes 50 questions 
related to patterns of mentation that could occur during resting -state scanning (see Appendix C). For each 
question, the participant is asked whether they agree or disagree with a statement related to thei r thoughts 
in the scanner . This question naire generally takes < 8 minutes to complete .  
 
All clinical rating scales can be performed using an  interpreter in any language.    Interpreters will also be 
available for other protocol procedures as necessary.  
 
e. End of participation  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 15  of 34  Volunteers will remain under the care of their own providers . No care will be offered to those 
participating in this protocol, except for any acute care required for adverse events . Findings of clinical 
significance, e.g., significant pathology on MRI will be shared with participants and any provider whom 
they designate .  
5. Management of Data and Samples  
a. Storage  
The results of testing will be stored on password -protected computers or backed up on media stored in 
locked cabinets. Keys to participant identity will be stored in  lab notebooks, available only to study 
investigators. Samples will not be stored under this protocol.   
b. Data   
This protocol is not subject to the Genomic Data Shari ng (GDS) policy. Data may also be shared with 
collaborating laboratories at NIH or outside o f NIH and/or submitted to NIH -designated repositories and 
databases if consent for sharing was obtained  
 
Data will be stripped of identifiers and may be coded  (“de -identified”) or unlinked from an identifying 
code (“anonymized”) .  When coded data is shared, the key to the code will not be provided to 
collaborators, but will remain at NIH . Data may be shared with investigators and institution s with an 
FWA or operating under the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH) and reported at the time of continuing review . 
Sharing with investigators without an FWA or not operating under the DoH will be submitted for 
prospective IRB approval . Submissions to NIH -sponsored or supported databases and repositories will be 
reported at the time of Continuing Review . Submission to  non-NIH sponsored or supported databases and 
repositories will be submitted for prospective IRB approval.  
6. Additional Considerations  
a. Research  with  investigational  drugs  or devices  
• Magnetic resonance imaging system operating in research mode  
• Magstim Rapid2 Therapy System  and the  
• Magstim Air Film Coil  
 
According to 21 CFR 812.3 (m) and FDA “Information Sheet  Guidance for IRBs, Clinical 
Investigators, and Sponsors: Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk 
Medical Device Studies January  2006 (accessible at  
http:// www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM12 6418.pdf), the use of 
these devices in the study  are a Non -signficant Risk study. 21 CFR 812.3(m) enumerates four 
criteria for a Significant Risk Device  Study ; none of these apply to this study : 
 
1. is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject ; 
None of the three devices are implants .  
2. is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents 
a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject ; 
None of the three devices are for use in supporting or sustaining human life.  
3. is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to 
the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 16  of 34  The investigational use of the three devices is not of substantial importance in 
diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment 
of human health.  
4. otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject  
The use of the legally marketed MRI system in research m ode will be performed under 
operating conditions below each of the limits (field strength, Specific Absorption Rate, 
time rate of change of gradient fields and sound pressure levels) deemed to be significant 
risk by the FDA as stated in the FDA guidance do cument, Criteria for Significant Risk 
Investigations of Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices.  
 
The Magstim Rapid2 Therapy System is legally marketed, indicated for “the treatment of 
Major Depressive Disorder in adult patients who have  failed to achieve sa tisfactory 
improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current episode.” The Magstim 
Air Film Coil is legally marketed as “a stimulating coil solely intended for use with the 
Magstim® Rapid2 Stimulating Unit for the purposes of peripheral nerve  stimulation. The 
Air Film Coil is an accessory of the Magstim® Rapid2 Unit. ” Both are used in 
combination in rTMS. Their use in this study is not within the labeled indications. The 
major risk of rTMS and cTMS is the risk of seizure. Brief, self -limited, seizures were seen 
in early studies, before limits were established for combinations of delivery parameters. 
However, this risk has been reduced to the order of o ne in every 50,000 sessions. For 
rTMS, safety guidelines have been developed (Wassermann, 1998) and updated (Rossi, 
Hallett, Rossini, & Pascual -Leone, 2009) . These guidelines were incorporated into 
FDA’s Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Repetitiv e Transcranial Magnetic 
Stimulation (rTMS) Systems in Table 2. Maximum Safe  Train Duration (seconds) Limits 
for Avoiding Seizures. The rTMS and and 1 -Hz Stimulation  in this study are below the 
limits defined in these documents. Furthermore, the study subjects are a lower risk since  
subjects with any neurological or psychiatric di sorders, history of seizure or taking 
certain medications are excluded. cTBS was  not included in the guidelines . However, 
there is only a single report of seizure with cTBS  (Lerner, Wassermann, & Tamir, 2019; 
Oberman et al., 2011, Rossi et al., submitted  manuscript ). In that single patient, the study 
was conducted in at stimulation intensity levels high er than in this study . Over  the past 20 
years, the FDA has generally waived pre -IDE inquiries for TMS/rTMS studies on an NSR 
device basis.  
 
All subjects wil l wear hearing protection.  
 
The protocol will comply with the abbreviated IDE requir ements under 21 CFR 812.2(b), 
available at:  
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=812.2  
 
b. Gene  therapy  
• N/A 
7. Risks and Discomforts  
b. General 
 rTMS, as delivered under this protocol, involves more than minimal risk to participants . The 
behavioral tasks, neuroimaging procedures, and screening procedures are minimal risks to the participant .   
c. Study Procedures 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 17  of 34  i. Behavioral  measures   
There are no major risks associated with these memory  tests other than frustration or embarrassment 
associated with the participants’ performance .  
ii. MRI  
People are at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have pacemakers or other  implanted electrical 
devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips  on the wall of a 
large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implan ts), 
permanent eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal workers ar e also 
at risk for injury because of possible small metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware . 
People with fear of confined spaces may become anxious during an MRI . Those with back problems may 
have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner. The noise from the scanner is loud enough to 
damage hearing, especially in people who already have hearing los s. Participants will be fitted with ear 
plugs.  There are no known l ong-term risks of MRI scanning.  
iii. TMS  
There is a small possibility of a seizure during TMS.  TMS has been found to produce hearing loss in 
experimental animals, caused by the click produced by the stimulating coil . However, no evidence of 
chronic hearing loss  when hearing protection was used, in several normal participants who had been 
extensively studied with TMS was found, nor transient changes in several participants tested befor e, and 
immediately after stimulation  (Pascual -Leone et al., 1992)  and more recent has found no increase in 
auditory threshold from TMS (Janicak et al. , 2008; Levkovitz et al., 2007). All of our participants will 
wear earplugs to reduce the risk of cochlear damage . Other than this, TMS does not appear to pose any 
hazard to the brain beyond that of electric stimulation, which has been in clinical use for decades . The 
World Health Organization task group and the Food an d Drug Administration concluded that brief 
exposure to static magnetic fields up to 2 Tesla have no adverse effects on human health ).  
d. Procedures to Minimize Risk 
i. Behavioral measures 
To minimize the risk associated with frustration or e mbarrassment, the researcher will maintain a positiv e 
attitude and observe the participants’ behavior to determine if they are overly frustrated . Breaks will be at 
subject’s discretion.  
ii. MRI 
To mitigate the risk of damage associated with exposu re to a powerful magnet, all magnetic objects (for 
example, watches, coins, jewelry, and credit cards) must be removed before entering the MRI scan room . 
In addition, participants will be screened for metal implants such as pacemakers or other implanted  
electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (m etal clips on the 
wall of a large artery), metallic pr ostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear 
implants), permanent eyeliner,  tattoos posing MRI risk, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments.  
 
To minimize the risk of hearing damage, participants  will be given earplugs or nois e reducing 
headphones . To confirm that our female participants are not preg nant, thus removing any unknown risks 
of MRI on a fetus, women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test within 24 hour s of 
participation in the fMRI experiment . Female participants will not be allowed to participate  if the test is 
positive . There are no risks of pregnancy testing.  
iii. TMS  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 18  of 34  Study staff will be trained in rTMS administration, rTMS safety, and the measurement of the TMS -
evoked potentials by Dr. Eric Wassermann . Study staff will be trained to recognize and respond to signs 
of seizure and syncope . For each session, at least two rTMS -trained personnel will be in the laboratory . A 
licensed independent practitioner (LIP), a physician or nurse practitioner trained  in rTMS, will be in 
house , specifically aware of the session,  and reachable by phone for all TMS sessions . The TMS 
laboratory is in a clinic area with nursing and code team support . Each room has oxygen, suction, and an 
emergency call button . If a participant  has a significant event, such as a seizure, the hospital emergency 
system  (Code Blue) will be activated  and treatment will be initiated as required . 
 
Study staff will monitor individuals during participation and participants will be encouraged to tell 
experimenters of any discomfort . At each session, participants will be asked whether st imulation was (1) 
tolerable, (2) tolerable with some discomfort, or (3) intolerable . If the participant responds that 
stimulation is intolerable, the participant will b e withdrawn from the experiment . Any participant 
exhibiting distress or who wishes to stop the experiment for any reason will be allowed t o stop . 
Nonprescription drugs may be used to alleviate heada che or pain discomfort.  
 
Syncope will be treated safely by immediately placing the participant in a lying position with legs 
elevated . Should any participant  become faint, the  LIP covering the study will be called immediately.  
 
Although no long -term deleterious effects of rTMS cognition have  been reported, we will monitor  
cognition with the NIH Toolbox. This is a standardized assessment with age -adjusted normative values . 
An investigator will review NIH Toolbox results for each participant at the post -stimulation and 2 -week 
follow -up assessments . If a participant experiences a significant drop from baseline, the IMM will be 
informed and the test(s) repeated in a few days . If the deficit persists, the participant will be withdrawn 
from the study and referred for clinical neuropsychologi cal evaluation . If, in the judgment of Dr. 
Wassermann or IMM, a study procedure is causing freq uent unexpected or adverse events of any kind, the 
study will be suspended until a review can be undertaken in consultation with the IRB . Depending on the 
outcome, the protocol may be amended, and/or specific language added to the protocol and documents to 
reflect the altered risk.  
 
TMS Training  
In accordance  with safety  guidelines,  the TMS  operator  is a TMS -trained  technician  who operates  under  
the supervision  of the PI and/or  Medically  Responsible  Investigator .  Examples  of TMS  operators  include  
medical  assistants,  technicians  with relevant  experience,  psychologists,  physicists,  physiotherapists,  
engineers,  physician  assistants,  nurses,  nurse  practitioners,  and physicians.    
 
Persons  operating  TMS  equipment  will have  been  certified  by a NINDS  laboratory  in safe application  of 
TMS.  
 
Standard  training  procedures  used include  training  in TMS  device  operation,  supervised  repeated  practice  
in TMS  procedures,  and testin g for inter-rater reliability  in motor  threshold  determination.   To be 
credentialed  as a TMS  technician,  an individual  must  have  passed  the following  criteria  (as assessed  by a 
designated  BNU  TMS  instructor):  
 
1) Training  in TMS  device  operation  
2) Supervi sed administration  of at least 10 TMS  procedures  
3) Demonstration  of inter-rater reliability  on motor  threshold  determination  
4) Current  Basic  Life Support  certification   
5) In-service  training  on basic  TMS  safety  and risks  by TMS -trained  physician  
6) In-service  training  on recognition  and initial  response  to seizures  
 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 19  of 34  8. Subject Safety Monitoring  
A credentialed physician or nurse practitioner will b e on site for all rTMS administration and immediatel y 
available . This is the standard of care in community and a cademic clinical and experimental rTMS 
centers, nationwide . Study staff will be trained in rTMS administration, rTMS safety, and the 
measurement of the motor evoked potential threshold an d will have performed 10 measurements under 
supervision . Study staff will monitor individuals during participation and pa rticipants will be encouraged 
to tell experimenters of any discomfort. Any subject exhibiting distress or who wishes to stop the 
experiment for any reason will be allowed to stop . Participants may withdra w at any time. Data of those 
participants that have completed at least the first session of any experiment  (i.e. both MRI scan and 
behavioral assessment) will be kept and analyzed. A researcher may end experimentation for the 
following reasons:  
• Abnormal response to rTMS including the occurrence of  a seizure, loss of consciousness, 
or the participant’s unwillingness to continue  or headache produced by rTMS .  
• Withdrawal of consent and/or decision to terminate.  
• The experiment will be ended if the pa rticipant is unwilling to continue due to pain, or 
frustration with the procedures  
9. Outcome Measures  
a. Primary  outcome  measures  
• Pre-to-Post rTMS differences in rsFC and tbFC  within the targeted  memory network .  
b. Secondary  outcome  measures  
• Pre-to-Post rTMS differences in WPT -O scores  
• Pre-to-Post rTMS differences in WPT -F scores  
• Pre-to-Post rTMS differences in rsFC and tbFC between memory networks .  
c. Exploratory  outcome  measures  
• Correlations between network FC changes and:  
o ARSQ scores  
o NIH To olbox Scores  
o WPT -F scores  
o WPT -O scores  
10. Statistical Analysis  
a. Analysis  of data/  study  outcomes  
Our primary aim is to examine stimulation -dependent  changes in FC within the targeted network in each 
study . Secondary aims for this protocol will include all behavioral change data  from the WPT -F and 
WPT -O and changes in FC to the non -targeted network, and between networks.  
 
To calculate FC  from resting -state scans , the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between time courses of 
BOLD activity in a seed region (i.e. hippocampus or striatum)  will be calculated to determine the FC 
before and after rTMS stimulation . They will be Fi sher-transformed to normalize r -values . 
 
To calculate FC from task -based scans, the time series from a seed region will be inputted  into a general 
linear model analysis as a regressor along with a regressor indicating when the task is occurring . For the 
WPT -F, this will include both the choice  phase and the feedback phase during learning . For the WPT -O, 
this will include the observational trials and the retrieval trials . This analysis will be performed on each 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 20  of 34  individual to create a spatial map of beta values indicating the strength of the asso ciation between the 
seed and other regions during task performance .  
 
Statistical analysis for Experiments 1 and 3  (targeting the hippocampal network)   
iv. Preliminary  Aims  
  Primary  Aim 1  
To confirm modulation  of the hippocampal network , the average timeseries of the left 
hippocampal seed will be correlated with all other voxels with available data before and 
after stimulation . These data will be submitted to AFNI’s 3dLME linear mixed effects 
function, which will be used to reveal potential areas of s ignificant change  in rsFC and 
tbFC .  
v. Secondary  Aims  
  Secondary  Aims 
Behavioral data will be submitted to a 3 x 2 x 2 ANOVA using timepoint (Pre -
stimulation, post -stimulation, and follow -up), group (PPC vs. Vertex), and learning type 
(procedural and declar ative) as factors . A significant interaction (p < 0.05) between time, 
group , and learning type will confirm network -dependent modulation of each memory 
type.  
 
To confirm changes in FC, a  similar analysis will be performed as Primary Aim 1, except 
that the  timeseries of the right  striatum  seed will be used instead of the hippocampal seed.  
 
Statistical Analysis for Experiments 2  and 4  (targeting the striatal network)  
i. Preliminary  Aims  
  Preliminary  Aim 1  
To confirm modulation  of the striatal network , the average timeseries of the right  striatum 
seed will be correlated with all other voxels with available data before and after 
stimulation . These data will be submitted to AFNI’s 3dLME linear mixed  effects 
function, which will be used reveal potential areas of significant change in rsFC and 
tbFC .  
ii. Secondary  Aims  
  Secondary  Aims  
Behavioral data will be submitted to a 3 x 2 x 2 ANOVA usi ng timepoint (Pre -
stimulation, post -stimulation, and follow -up), group (M1 vs. Vertex), and learning type 
(procedural and  declarative) as factors. A significant interaction (p < 0.05) between time, 
group, and learning type will confirm network -dependent modulation of each memory 
type.  
   
To confirm changes in FC, a  similar analysis will be performed as Primary Aim 1, except  
that the timeseries of the left hippocampus  seed will be used instead of the striatal seed.  
 
Interim Analysis  for Experiments 3 and 4 . The data from 3 initial participants in Experiments 3  and 4 will 
be examined to confirm that cTBS is inhibiting our networks of interest . FC will be calculated within the 
targeted networks and analyzed by study investigators . If, in the opinion of the study team, inhibition of 
these networks is unreliable, a cohort of 3  subjects will be run and will recei ve 1-Hz stimulation instead . 
Following this cohort, the results will be compared between stimulation protocols and the st udy team will 
make an informed decision about whether to continue w ith cTBS or to switch to 1 -Hz stimulation instead.   
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 21  of 34  b. Power  analysis  (All experiments)  
All experiments  in this protocol  are powered  based  on the primary  outcome,  which  relates  to modulating  
FC within  the targeted  networks .  
A power analysis was conducted on our preliminary  data using G*Power v3.1 . We used a repeated -
measures  ANOVA model with FC changes between the hippocampus and the  precuneus/medial occipital 
cortex as my dependent variable . The precuneus/medial occipital cortex was used becaus e these regions 
showed the most robust response to stimulation in Wang et al., (20 14). Based on these data (Mean 
Difference = 0.16, Pooled Standard Deviation = 0.21, Cohen’s d = 0.75), and assuming power of 0.80 and 
α = 0.05, 26 right -handed  healthy participants between 18  and 40 years of age will be needed (13 per 
group) for each exper iment  (104 total) . To acco unt for attrition (estimated ~15 %), we will request an 
accrual celling of 122 .  
 
There were no preliminary data to conduct a power analysis for  stimulation  involving the striatal  network. 
Thus, we propose to have 13 analyzable subjects in the M1 group, the same number as in the parietal 
group  from Experiments 1 and 3. We also plan to obtain 13 subjects in the control group, resulting in 26 
analyzable healthy subjects (13  per group) .  
11. Human Subjects Protection  
a. Subject  selection  
We will recruit healthy participants through referra ls from the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer program  
or through self -referrals to the protocol . We will work to ensure equitable selection .  
b. Justification  for exclusion  of children  
Children will not be included . The study is predicated on the work of Wang et al. (2 014) and Poldrack et 
al. (2001; 2003), preliminary data from our laboratory for participants above the age of  18. Therefore, we 
will recruit a sample of the same age .  
c. Justification  for exclusion  of subjects  above  the age of 40 
Because neuroplasticity is reduced in older adults (Fathi, et al., 2010) , inclu ding subjects above the age of 
40 would reduce our power for detecting change in FC . A lower age of 40 years old for the upper limit, as 
older brains have less memory capability  . Therefore,  this group will be excluded .  
d. Justification  for the Exclusion  of other  Vulnerable  Subjects  
i. Women  who are Pregnant,  Plan to Become  Pregnant,  or are Breast -feeding  
The effects of MRI on fetal development and the healt h of pregnant women is unknown . Therefor e, 
women who are pregnant will be excluded and women who ca n become pregnant will be excluded 
following a positive pregnancy test .  
e. Justification  of sensitive  procedures  
This study involves no sensitive procedures .  
f. Safeguards  for vulnerable  populations  
Since the effects of rTMS and MRI on fetal development are unknown, women of childbearing potential 
will have a pregnancy test before each rTMS and MRI se ssion .  
i. Safeguard  of vulnerable  subjects  (NIH  employees)  
Protections for employees and staff participati ng in this study include 1) assuring that the participation or 
refusal to participate will have no effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the subject’s employmen t or 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (5.4.17)     
   
page 22  of 34  position at the NIH, 2) giving employees and staff who are interested in participating the “N IH 
Information Sheet on Employee Research Participation” prior to obtaining consent, and 3 ) assuring that 
there will be no direct solicitation of employees or staff .  
 
Consent will not be obtained by a co -worker . We will only enroll NIH employees and staff when they are 
not members of the Behavioral Neurology Unit in the National Institute of Neurological Dis orders and 
Stroke . This is the laboratory in which the research describe d in this protocol will occur . NIH employees 
and staff who participate dur ing work hours must have permission from their supervisor . NIH employees 
and staff must either participate outside of work hours or take leave in order to receive compensat ion. The 
last stipulation does not apply to the home -monitoring period .  
 
All investigators and staff authorized to consent subjects will complete consent training prior to obtainin g 
consent.  
 
12. Consent Documents and Process  
a. Designation  of those  obtaining  consent  
Study investigators designated as able to obtain consent are noted in th e Study Personnel document . All 
study investigators obtaining informed consent have or will complete the ‘Elements of Successfu l 
Informed Consent’ training prior to experimentation.  
b. Consent  procedures   
All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, 
procedures and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants . Participants will 
have the opportunity to review the written consent form carefully and ask questions regarding this s tudy 
before signing . Consent will not be obtained by a co -worker .  
 
 
 
c. Consent  documents  
The consent form contains all required elements .  
13. Data and Safety Monitoring  
a. Data  and safety  monitor  
Data and safety will be regularly monitored by the Principal investigator . Dr Leonardo Cohen, a 
neurologist and an intramural NINDS investigator, will serve as the Independent Medical Monitor  for this 
protocol .  
b. Data  and safety  monitoring  plan  
Protocol investigators will evaluate the safety of study su bjects throughout the conduct of the study and 
respond to adverse events (AEs) in a timely manner . The IMM will be informed of serious adverse events 
within 7 days and sent a summary of adverse events a t the time of each annual review  
 
If no interval data were collected, the monitor will be informed and a re port will not be required. The 
IMM will also be sent protocol updates and other pertinent documents relating to the study on an  as-
needed basis.  The IMM may also be consulted in person and as neede d to d iscuss clinical issues. In 
person consultations with the IMM will be documented.

page 23  of 34  c. Criteria  for stopping  the study  or suspending  enrollment  or procedures  
If a study procedure is causing serious adverse events, or unanticipated problems it will be suspend ed.  If 
there is a serious adverse event the study will be suspended until a review can be undertaken  in 
consultation with the IRB. Depending on that consultation, the procedure may be dropped from the 
protocol via an amendment, or specific language may be added to the protocol and consent forms to 
reflect the changing risk level.  
 
14. Quality Assurance  (QA) 
a. Quality  assurance  monitor  
The NINDS Quality Assurance (QA) Audit Committee will periodic ally monitor the protocol.  
b. Quality  assurance  plan  
This protocol will undergo periodic review by the QA Audi t Committee as outlined in the NINDS QA 
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  
 
This protocol will undergo random review by the NINDS Qual ity Assurance (QA) Office as outlined in 
the NINDS QA Standard Operating Procedure . The purpose of the QA audit is to assess compliance wit h 
applicable regulatory requirements, good clinical practice guidelines, NINDS/NIH policies, as w ell as to 
provide recommendations for improving the management of clinical research  data. The protocol will be 
audited according to the decision algorithm as described in the NINDS SOP . This protocol is classified as 
“more than minimal risk” and thus will be audited with a target frequency of once during the fir st year 
following IRB appr oval, and then approximately every three years thereafter.  
15. Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events and 
Protocol Deviations  
Reportable events will be tracked and submitted to the IRB as outlined in Pol icy 801. 
 
 
16. Alternatives to Participation  
Participants do not receive rTMS in this study or forego any treatment in order to participate in this study . 
The alternative, therefore, is not to participate.  
17. Privacy 
All research activities will be conducted in as priva te a setting as po ssible .  
18. Confidentiality  
a. For research  data  and investigator  medical  records  
All study investigators will have access to research records and data . Hard copy research data/records will 
be coded, no individual will be identified by name, and the data will be stored in a locked filing cabi net in 
a locked office  to protect subject anonymity. Electronic data with identifiers (including neuroimaging) 
will be saved password -protected NIH -issued computers on secured servers . Neuroimaging data will be 
maintained on a secure internet -based server . Only study investigators will have access to the data . De-
identified results from clinical trials will be posted on  cctrials.gov . Clinical data will be managed 
according to NIH Clinical Center’s standard policies

page 24  of 34  (http://www.cc.nih.gov/participate/patientinfo/legal.shtml ). Sensitive, private information (such as a urine 
drug test) will not be collected in this study, so no special protections for NIH empl oyees and staff are 
necessary . However, confidentiality protections for them will be the same as those for all subjects . The PI 
will instruct all  study personnel in the relevant SOPS and proce dures to ensure the privacy of NIH 
employees and staff who participate in our study . All investigators will be required to read the SOP on 
participation of NIH personnel.  
 
Participant research data will be de -identified and stored on secure computer systems . The only entries in 
the medical record will be to document participation in the research study. In laboratory record s, all 
personally -identifying information will be removed. Participants will be identified  by a number code, the 
key to which will be accessible only to the investigators. The information gathered during this study will 
be kept confidential to the extent that the law allows. The lab results will be kept safe in a locked room. 
The subjects will be informed that these results may be published for scientific purposes, provided their 
identity is not revealed.  
b. For medical  records  
Clinical data will be managed according to NIH’s Clinica l Center’s policy 
(http://www.cc.nih.gov/participate/patientinfo/legal.shtml).

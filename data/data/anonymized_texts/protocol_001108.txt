Amended protoco l 09 (21 December  2020 ) 
This amended protocol (Amendment 0 9) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article  10(a) of Directive 2001/20/ Ethics Committee ( EC) of the European Parl iament 
and the Council of the European Union . 
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The overall rationale for this amendment is as follows : 
• To include the recommendations that were developed for the COVID -19 pandemic period 
and were shared with the sites /Investigators. These recommendations will remain 
applicable after the end of the pandemic, especially the information regarding the post -
infusion surveillance period . 
• To revise the text in Sections 12, 13, and 14 as per the cu rrent Sanofi protocol template to 
use the updated wordings that are compliant with general guidance, including monitoring 
techniques . 
• To update Section 8.1 for detail s regarding home infusion s to harmonize this text  across 
the different  studies included in  the avalglucosidase alfa develo pment program.

Section Number  and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Protocol  Amendment  Summary  of 
Changes  Table Document formatting revision . To update document history and provide 
overall rationale for  the amendment . 
Section 8.1 Investigational medicinal 
product  Requirement for patients to remain in the 
hospital or in the infusion center for the 
observation period related to onset of 
AEs was revised  from 2  hours to 1 hour 
and the following text was add ed: “In 
case the patient does not stay for this 
observation period (eg, as part of 
contingency measures for a regional or 
national emergency that is declared by a 
governmental agency), the Investigator  
(or appropriate designee) will contact the 
patient to ensure that no AEs occurred 
during the observation  period.”  Due to COVID -19 pandemic restrictions, 
the observation  period after the infusions  
were  performed at the study site  or 
infusion center was shortened or 
skipped for patient’s safety reasons. 
Also to lighten this period after the end 
of the pandemic  and in order  to obtain 
information in case this observation 
period is not performed , the observation 
time after the end of  infusion is reduced 
to 1 hour.  
Section 8.1 Investigational medicinal 
product  Unde r “Home infusion” subsection, the 
text was updated to harmonize with other 
studies included in  the avalglucosidase 
alfa development program . The home infusion text is amended to 
allow patients to benefit from home 
infusion sooner  in case of an 
unexpected e vent (ie, after 6 months 
free of IARs instead of 12 months) or to 
resume home infusion sooner after 
interruption for IAR durin g home 
infusion. Some text is also updated to 
harmonize across  the other studies 
included in  the avalglucosidase alfa 
development program.  
Section 10.4.3 Instructions for reporting 
serious adverse events  Text was deleted regarding proactively 
sending the SAE -related reporting 
documents via fax  or as photocopy . As per recent  Sanofi procedures, the 
direct sending of source documents t o 
the Sponsor (except to 
Pharmacovigilance department) is no 
more recommended.  
Section 12 Regulatory, ethical, and study 
oversight consideratio ns; Section 13 
Study monitoring; Section 14 Additional 
requirements  Heading s, subsections, and 
corresponding tex t were fully updated in 
Sections 12, 13, and 14 to reflect current 
practices as outlined in the current 
protocol template, including monitoring 
techniques.  To align with current protocol template . 
Section 17.2 Appendix 2: Protocol 
amendment history  Added new Section  17.2.8 . To incorporate the changes from 
amended protocol 0 7 to amended 
protocol 0 8. 
Throughout  Typos have been corrected where 
necessary.  
Minor editorial and document formatting 
revisions  are made.  To provide c larifications .

Efficacy  
6-minute walk test (6MWT) . 
Pulmonary function testing (PFT) endpoints . 
ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE  Refer to study and period flo w charts.  
Medical/surgical history, and Pompe disease history, including GAA 
gene mutations, will be imported from the patient’s prior 
avalglucosidase alfa  study file in the database when possible.  
STATISTICA L CONSIDERATIONS  Out of range laboratory values , vital signs, and ECGs will be flagged by 
the Investigator as clinically significant or non -clinically significant 
abnormalities. The clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded 
as AEs and included in the TEAE counts.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated (counts and 
percent ages). 
Infusion -associated reactions  and discontinuations due to AEs will be 
summarized.  
Descriptive statistics will be generated by dose level and time points for 
selected parameters of interest.  
In addition, ra w data and changes from baseline for selected 
parameters will be summarized by descriptive statistics and/or plots.  
Descriptive statistics for actual values and changes from baseline will 
be generated by time point for selected safety parameters of interes t. 
Data may also be plotted. For the purpose of analysis, baseline will be 
prior to the first dose of GZ402666 in a ny prior avalglucosidase alfa  
study.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters will be summa rized for each dose level 
and study visit by me ans of descriptive statistics.  
Pharmacodynamics  
Changes over time in tissue glycogen content in the lower extremity 
muscle will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Evaluation of 
intact muscle and fatty  replacement from MRI will be descriptive using  
a grading scale and, if feasible, quantitative using a numeric method of 
determining the degree (%) of overall fatty replacement of muscle from 
the skeletal muscle MRI and an individual (%) measure for the 
quadriceps. A correlative measure comparing the b iopsied muscle and 
its MRI counterpart will also be performed. Relationship between 
pharmacodynamic and efficacy endpoints will be explored using 
graphic display or correlational analysis as appropriate.  
Explo ratory efficacy  
Observed measurements and chang es from baseline will  be provided 
for each endpoint:  6MWT and PFT parameters.  
DURATION OF STUDY (per patient)  The duration of the study for each patient is initially  6 years. Each 
patient will continue with t he study until the patient withdraws, the 
Inves tigator withdraws the patient, or the Sponsor terminates the study.  
An additional follow -up phase will begin  after the patient  has completed 
the 6 -year study period, and will last until avalglucosidase alfa  is 
approved in the patient’s country , except in  the UK, German y and

4.1 INTRODUCTION  
Pompe disease (also known as acid malta se deficiency or glycogen storage disease [GSD ] 
Type II) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid 
α-glucosidase ( GAA ), an enzyme that degrades glycogen. Genzyme, a Sanofi company, has 
developed alglucosidase alfa, which contains the active ingredient recombinant human acid 
α-glucosidase ( rhGAA ), as long -term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT ) for patients with a 
confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease. Alglucosidase alfa treatment is globally approved 
(tradenames: Myozyme® and Lumizyme®) for the treatment of Pompe disease based on its 
efficacy to prolong invasive ventilator -free survival in infants (1) and its ability to improve 
walking distance and to stabilize respira tory function in children 8 years and older and adults (2). 
To achieve these benefits, alglucosidase alfa is administered at high doses (20 mg/kg every other 
week [qow] ), relative to other ERTs. Echocardiogram measurements demonstrate that 
alglucosidase alfa works well in cardiac muscle. There is a more variable response to treatment in 
skeletal muscle. This is thought to be, at least in part, due to the relative low level of  
bis-mannose -6-phosphate (bis -M6P ) on alglucosidase alfa. Therefore, increasing the level of  
bis-M6P on alglucosidase alfa may provide a mechanism to drive uptake into the skeletal muscle.  
Genzyme is investigating a second gener ation therapy for Pompe disease called avalglucosidase 
alfa (neoGAA, GZ402666)  (rhGAA  conjugated with synthetic bis -M6P -Man6 glycan ). 
Avalglucosidase alfa  is a modification of alglucosidase alfa that results in the conjugation of a 
number of hexamannose st ructures containing 2 terminal M6P  moieties to oxidized sialic acid 
residues on alglucosidase alfa, thereby increasing bis -M6P levels on the compound.   
4.1.1  Safety pharmacology and toxicology  
Four in vivo t oxicology studies have been conducted to support the development of 
avalglucosidase alfa . These include 2 repeat dose studies (2 and 4 weeks) conducted in CD -1 
mice , and 2 repeat dose studies (4 weeks and 6 months) conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. A 
safety  pharmacology evaluation was also conducted as part of the 6 -month toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Additionally, a mouse micronuclei assessment was conducted in GAA 
knockout (GAAKO ) mice to evaluate t he potential genotoxicity of avalglucosidase alfa . 
The toxicity of avalglucosidase alfa  was first evaluated in CD -1 mice in a 14 -day repeat dose 
study. Doses were administered as an intravenous (IV ) bolus at 50  mg/kg every other day for 
14 days. Administration of avalglucosidase alfa  at 50  mg/kg was associated with macroscopic 
findings in the male reproductive tract (none of the male reproductive tract tissues were examined 
microscopically).  
In the liver, minima l to mild multifocal necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates were present after 
administration of avalglucosidase alfa  at 50 mg/kg, although no correlating serum chemistry 
alterations were observed. Terminal elevations in serum calcium, phosphorus, and potas sium were

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 26 observed in males dosed with 50 mg/kg of avalglucosidase alfa . A definitive relationship of these 
alterations to the test article could not be established because of the possible confounding factor of 
carbon dioxide asphyxiation prior to blood co llection in these animals. The above findings were 
further evaluated in the 28 -day studies in CD -1 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, and in the 
26-week study in cynomolgus monkeys.  
The toxicity of avalglucosidase alfa  was evaluated in 28 -day repeat dose toxicit y studies in the 
CD-1 mouse and the cynomolgus monkey. In both studies , avalglucosidase alfa  was administered 
every week for 28 days (4 doses total) at 0, 4, 40, or 120 mg/kg via IV bolus to mice or via a 
6-hour IV infusion to monkeys. Toxicokinetic data a re summarized in Section  4.1.2 . 
Results from the study in CD -1 mice demonstrated that repeated administrations of 
avalglucosidase alfa  were overall well tolerated. One death was  noted and 1 early sacrifice was 
necessary within 1 hour of the fourth avalglucosidase alfa  administration in the 4 mg/kg dose 
group. This was likely due to a hypersensitivity reaction following repeated administration of a 
human protein into a mouse. Ther e were no significant changes noted in body weights, clinical 
observations, clinical chemistry and hematology parameters, or in organ weights and organ to 
body weight ratios. Histopathology of all animals at the terminal sacrifice showed no evidence of 
toxicity related to avalglucosidase alfa  administration.  
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL ) was established at ≥120 mg/kg in CD -1 mice.  
Results from the study in cynomolgus monkey s demonstrated that once weekly repeated 
administrations via a 6 -hour IV infusion for 4 consecutive weeks was well tolerated by 
cynomolgus monkeys. There were no test article -related clinical signs or changes in body weight, 
body weight change (gain), phys ical examination findings, clinical pathology parameters, or 
macroscopic/microscopic findings that could be attributed to the administration of avalglucosidase 
alfa. 
The NOAEL was established at ≥120 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.  
As hypersensitivity reactions are likely to occur in mice in long -term repeat  dose toxicity 
assessments, and no differences in toxicological findings between species were noted in the 
28-day st udies, a 26 -week repeat dose toxicity study was conducted in one species, the 
cynomolgus monkey. Avalglucosidase alfa  was administered every other week for 26 weeks at 
doses of 0, 50, or 200  mg/kg via a 6 -hour IV infusion, followed by a 4 -week recovery per iod. 
Toxicokinetic data are summarized in  Section  4.1.2 . 
Administration of avalglucosidase alfa  was well tolerated and caused no changes in any parameter 
that was measured in th is study. There were no test article -related changes in clinical 
observations, body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, ophthalmic evaluations, 
organ weights, or in macroscopic/microscopic evaluations. Furthermore, there were no 
macroscopic or microscopic findings in the male reproductive tract or in the liver.  
There were 2 early sacrifices during the study. One female monkey on study was sacrificed in a 
moribund condition prior to receiving any test article. On Day 168, a second female monkey a t 
50 mg/kg was sacrificed in a moribund condition. The most likely cause of the moribund

access port and unrelated to the test article based on the macroscopic and  microscopic findings.  
The following evaluations were conducted as part of this study for evaluation of safety 
pharmacology and the results are as follows:  
• Central nervous system : There were no changes in activity levels considered related to 
avalglucosida se alfa  administration when compared to controls. All monkeys were 
observed to be in a normal quiet state (score of 2) to a high arousal state (score of 4) 
during the study. Observations for the presence of muscle fasciculations, facial muscle 
movements, a nd visual field were all normal.  
• Respiratory rate, heart rate, and core body temper ature: There were no changes considered 
related to avalglucosidase alfa  administration when compared to controls.  
• Electrocardiograms  (ECGs) : All monkeys maintained sinus rhy thms throughout the study. 
One atrial and 1 ventricular premature depolarization were noted on Day 155. The 
ventricular premature depolarization occurred in a male animal administered vehicle, and 
the atrial premature depolarization was observed in a male monkey treated with 50 mg/kg 
of avalglucosidase alfa . These rhythm disturbances can occur in normal monkeys and were 
not test article related. Intravenous dosing once every 2 weeks with avalglucosidase alfa  at 
up to 200  mg/kg/dose did not have any toxicolo gic effects on recorded ECG s in this study.  
The NOAEL was established at 200 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.  
4.1.2  Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion data  
The pharmacokinetics (PK ) of avalglucosidase alfa  have been evaluated in a number of preclinical 
studies in the GAAKO mouse model of Pompe disease following administration of 20 mg/kg. 
Additionally, toxicokinetic (TK ) evaluations were conducted as part of the 28 -day toxicology 
study in CD -1 mice, the 28 -day toxicology study in non -human primates, and the 26 -week 
toxicology study in non -human primates.  
Average PK parameters in GAAKO mice following  a single IV administration at 20  mg/kg of 
avalglucosidase alfa  are as follows:  the terminal elimination half -life ( t1/2), 26.9 min utes; volume 
of distribution, 29.0 mL/kg; area under the concentration curve ( AUC ), 36.7 min utes*mg/mL; and 
clearance  (CL), 0.55  mL/min utes/kg. 
Avalglucosidase alfa  TK was evaluated following single  and repeat IV administration at dose 
levels of 4, 40, and 120 mg/kg in CD -1 mice ( Table  1). Saturation kinetics were observed at the 
dose levels evaluated. This was characterized by increased t1/2, decreased  CL, and increased 
AUC /dose as the dose levels increased to 120  mg/kg. No consistent differences in TK parameters 
were noted when comparing the first and fourth dose, suggesting that there were no meaningful 
changes in TK parameters following repeated IV adminis tration in CD -1 mice.

Values represent mean ±SD.  
Toxicokinetic parameters were also determined for avalglucosidase alfa  in non -human primates 
following the first and fourth infusion at 40 and 120 mg/kg dose levels in a 28 -day toxicology 
study ( Table  2). There were limited serum concentration data available for the 4 mg/kg dose level 
at both the first and fourth doses, which did not allow for the estimation of TK parameters. Across 
both infusions analyzed, avalglucosidase alfa  elimination was either monophasic or biphasic. 
Toxicokinetic parameters were calculated only from the first phase of elimination, as the second 
phase had limited data points for analysis (many animals had avalglucosidase alfa  levels below 
the level of detection at lat er time points).  
At both the first and fourth infusions of avalglucosidase alfa , saturation kinetics appear to be 
present. While this is only a trend at the first infusion, statistically significant differences occur in 
t1/2 and CL at the fourth infusion. This suggests that saturation kinetics may become more 
prominent between 40 and 120 mg/kg after repeated infusions of avalglucosidase alfa . 
No significant differences were noted for TK parameters between the first and fourth infusions at 
the 40 mg/kg dose level, but significant differences in TK parameters (decreased CL and 
increased AUC 0-inf/dose) were noted with repeated administration at the 120 mg/kg dose level. 
This suggests that repeated dosing in the monkey at this dose level affects the TK profile o f 
avalglucosidase alfa . For both dose levels and infusions, avalglucosidase alfa  TKs did not appear 
to differ between male and female monkeys.

Toxicokinetics were evaluated as part of the 6 -month toxicology study in non -human primates. 
Avalglucosidase alfa  TK parameters were evaluated follo wing the 1st, 7th, and 13th  infusion at 
the 50  and 200 mg/kg dose levels.  
Across all infusions and both doses analyzed, avalglucosidase alfa  elimination was biphasic. 
Toxicokinetics parameters were calculated only from the first phase of elimination, as th e second 
phase had limited data points for analysis and represented GAA activity at, or very close to, 
background levels observed in vehicle -treated animals.  
At infusion 1, 7, and 13 of avalglucosidase alfa , saturation kinetics were present ( Table  3). These 
dose-related TK differences reached statistical significance with all 3 infusions analyzed. This 
strongly suggests that saturation kinetics is occurring between 50 and 200 mg/kg with 
avalglucosidase alfa  in monke ys. 
Intradose TK parameters appeared to change with successive infusions (ie, infusion 1, 7, and 13). 
These changes were characterized by increases in Cmax, t1/2, and  AUC , and decreases in  CL. 
Compared to the first infusion of 50 mg/kg, most TK parameters were significantly different for 
both the 7th and 13th infusions. At 200 mg/kg, compared to the first infusion, most TK 
parameters exhibited a trend for differences at infusion 7 and sign ificant differences at 
infusion  13. Toxicokinetic parameter changes o bserved between infusion 1, 7, and 13 suggest that 
repeated dosing in the monkey at the dose levels tested affects the TK profile of avalglucosidase 
alfa. 
For both dose levels and infusions, avalglucosidase alfa  TK did not appear to differ between male 
and female monkeys.

Biodistribution studies were also conducted with avalglucosidase alfa  to evaluate the tissue 
distribution in GAAKO mice following a single 20 mg/kg dose. Results indicate that the majority 
of avalglucosidase alfa  (~60% of injected dose) was detected in the liver, while less than 2% and 
1% of injected dose was present in the heart and skeletal musc le, respectively.  
More detailed information on the compound is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB ). 
4.2 STUDY DESIGN AND R ATIONALE OF SPECIFIC  PARAMETERS  
4.2.1  Study design  
LTS13769 is an open -label,  multicenter, multinational extension study with repeated IV infusions 
of avalglucosidase alfa  Safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, pharmacogenetic, and 
exploratory efficacy data will be collected during this long -term study. The population will be  
patients with Pompe disease who have completed a n avalglucosidase alfa  study.  
4.2.2  Specific parameters rationale  
4.2.2.1  Safety  
Safety parameters include adverse event (AE) collection, physical examination, urine pregnancy 
test for women of childbearing potential , body weight, vital signs, hematology, biochemistry, 
urinalysis, and ECG . 
VV-CLIN-0049122 9.0
Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 09   21-Dec-2020  
LTS13769  - avalglucosidase alfa  Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 31 Patients will receive an IV infusion of avalglucosidase alfa  every other week ( qow). Prior to  each 
infusion, the patient should be assessed by the Investigator or appropriate designee to determine if 
the patient is free of acute illness and is clinically stable to receive the infusion. Detailed infusion 
administration procedures can be found in th e pha rmacy manual . 
The follow -up observation period for the end -of-study visit and for treatment -emergent adverse 
events ( TEAE ) is anticipated to be approximately 4 weeks after the last ad minis tration of 
avalglucosidase alfa  considering the long tissue half -life of ERTs used to treat lysosomal storage 
diseases.  
An immune reaction against an exogenously administered recombinant protein plays a critical role 
in the safety of the compound. The refor e, safety assessments will include blood samples for  
anti-avalglucosidase alfa  antibodies, neutralizing antibody formation in anti-drug antibody (ADA)  
seropositive patients , and anti-alglucosidase alfa immunoglobulin G (IgG ) antibodies (only 
patients who were previously treated with alglucosidase alfa ). 
Additional exploratory safety assessments will be conducted when clinically indicated. In the 
event that a patient experiences a moderate, severe, or  recurrent mild infusion -associated reactions 
(IAR s) suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions, additional blood samples will be collected for the 
evaluation of:  
• Circulating immune complex detect ion; and 
• Immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum tryptase, and complement activation.  
Additionally, skin testing may be performed, as appropriate, in patients who experience an IAR 
that meets the following criteria:  
• Infusion -associated reaction  is suggestive of IgE -mediated hypersensitivity reaction, with 
persistent symptoms of bronchospasm, hypotension, and/or urticaria requiring intervention 
OR any other signs or symptoms at the discretion of the Investigator or t he Sp onsor.  
Skin testing may be another predictor of IgE -mediated reaction and may be suggested for 
confirmation of the IgE results.  
4.2.2.2  Pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarkers assessments  
Glucose tetrasaccharide (Hex4 ), a tetraglucose oligomer, has been shown to be elevated in the 
urine of patients with Pompe disease. Hence, determination of fasted Hex4 levels may be a means 
by which the efficacy of treatments may be monitored.  
Fasted plasma samples  and fasted urine samples will be taken for exploration of potential 
biomarkers of disease severity or response to avalglucosidase alfa . 
Skeletal muscle magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) will be taken  to guide site selection for 
muscle needle or open biopsies and to explore the effects of therapy on muscle pathology. When a 
muscle biopsy is available p harmacodynamic activity of avalglucosidase alfa  will be assessed 
through tissue glycogen measurem ents from biopsies of the lower extremity (quadriceps).

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 32 Glycogen content will be measured by histomorphometric analysis or severity grading to 
determine how effectively avalglucosidase alfa  is able to remove glycogen from muscle.  
4.2.2.3  Exploratory efficacy  
Explo rator y avalglucosidase alfa  efficacy will be evaluated in terms of functional capacity using 
the 6 -minute walk test (6MWT ) distance walked and pulmonary function testing (PFT ; including 
the assessment of forced vital capacity [FVC ], forced expiratory volume in the 1st second of the 
FVC maneuver [FEV1 ], maximal inspiratory pressure [MIP], maximal expiratory pressure 
[MEP ], and peak expiratory flow [PEF] in the upright and supine positions ). 
4.2.2.4  Pharmacogenomics  
Previous studies in Pompe muscle biopsies have shown a number of RNA species whose 
expression is correlated with di sease  progression. Measurements of circulating muscle creatine 
kinase indicate that muscle cell contents can be observed in the blood of patients with Pompe 
disease, suggesting the possibility of measuring muscle derived RNAs  among the cell -free RNA 
in the  blood, as has been done in cancer and for prenatal diagnosis. If feasible, circulating RNA 
measurement could provide a minimally invasive biomarker for disease progression and severity. 
Therefore, plasma samples will also be collected and assessed for cir culat ing microRNA 
concentrations on both the whole -genome and individual gene levels.  
When a muscle biopsy is available, s keletal muscle tissue samples , taken by needle or open 
biopsy , will be evaluated for exploratory RNA expression. Such data will be us ed to  evaluate if 
transcriptional changes are predictive of disease course and if the pattern indicates response to 
treatment. An additional serum sample will be collected in connection with this analysis. This 
serum sample will be used to assess whether a ny of  the targets that are identified in muscle are 
expressed in serum and therefore could be  assessed as a serum -based marker of Pompe disease.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE P ROTOCOL  
LTS13769 is an open -label, multicenter, multinational extension study with repeated IV infusions 
of avalglucosidase alfa  (neoGAA,  GZ402666) . Safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, 
pharmacogenetic, and exploratory efficacy data will be collected during this long -term study. The 
population will be  patients with Pompe disease who have completed a n avalglucosidase alfa  
study. The gra phical design and study flow charts are presented in  Section  1. 
Patients who have provided signed written informed consent and have met all of the inclusion 
criteria and ha ve no t met the exclusion criterion will be enrolled in the study.  
Safety , pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, pharmacogenetic, and efficacy assessments will be 
performed at scheduled visits throughout the extension study. Adverse events and concomitant 
medic ation s will be collected continuously throughout the study.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) will review safety information during 
periodic bi -annual safety reviews, as well as on an ad ho c basis as outlined in the DMC  charter , 
which is maintained separately from the study protocol.  An immunologist will be consulted, when 
necessary, to review information and provide treatment recommendations for IARs.  
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PA RTICIPATION  
6.2.1  Duratio n of study participation for each patient  
The duration of the study for each patient is initially  6 years. Each patient will continue with the 
study until the patient withdraws, the Investigator withdraws the patient, or the Sponsor 
terminate s the stu dy. An additional follow -up phase will begin after the patient has completed the 
6-year study period, and will last until avalglucosidase alfa is approved in the patient’s country, 
except in the UK, Germany and Denmark, where the duration of the additional  follow-up phase 
will be up to the approval in the country or limited to a maximum of 2 years, whichever occurs 
first (ie, for patients in the UK, Germany and Denmark, the total study duration per patient is 
8 years at the maximum including the initial 6 -year p eriod and the additional 2 -year follow -up) 
(refer to Appendix  1 [Section  17.1] for definition applicable for patients  in the UK, Germany and 
Denmark ). 
6.2.2  Determination of end  of clinical trial (all patients)  
The clinical trial will end when the last patient completes the last follow -up visit.

6.3.1  Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DM C, appointed by the Sponsor , will review the protocol and will thereafter 
provi de me dical and ethical guidance related to the conduct of this study. The DMC will review 
safety information as outlined in the D MC charter , which is maintained separately from the study 
protocol.  
During the course of the study bi -annual periodic reviews o f safety data will be performed by the 
DMC. In addition, t he DMC  will review safety data on an ad hoc basis if any AE meet s the 
individual patient or study stopping criteria  as discussed in Section  6.3.3.1  and Section  6.3.3.2 , or 
if any AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, raises significant concerns regarding 
the safety of the avalg lucos idase alfa  administered dose . Should any major safety issues arise, 
final decisions regarding the study will be made by the Sponsor’s Chief Medical Officer and 
Global Safety Officer, taking into consideration the DMC  opinion (as applicable).  
6.3.2  Allergic React ion Review  
Infusion -associated reaction s and other events which could require consultation of an 
allergist/immunologist will be reviewed by an immunologist.  
Should any major safety issues arise, final decisions regarding the study will be made by the  
Spon sor’s Chief Medical Officer and Global  Safety Officer, taking into consideration the 
immunologist opinion (as applicable).  
6.3.3  Guidance for stopping rules  
For the purpose of this study, the following criteria should be considered as guidance for the 
decis ion to stop avalglucosidase alfa  administration to a  patient or to stop the trial.  
6.3.3.1  Individual patient stopping criteria  
If any of the following AEs occur, dosing will be temporarily stopped for the specific patient who 
experienced the AE, pending ad hoc DMC rev iew and recommendations:  
• Any life -threatening Grade 4 AE as graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI ) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE , v4.03 ) not related to the  
patient’s underlying condition.  
• More than 1 AE of CTCAE Grade 3 or greater, not related to the patient’s underlying 
condition, for which the relationship to treatment  cannot b e rea sonably excluded.  
• Any increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT ), aspartate aminotransferase (AST ), total 
bilirubin, or alkaline phosp hatase >3x the baseline  value, ie, prior to the first dose of 
GZ402666 in any prior avalglucosidase alfa  study .

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICI NAL PRODUCT S 
Avalglucosidase alfa , the investigational medicinal product ( IMP), will be  supplied as a sterile, 
nonpyrogenic, lyophilized product in single -use 20  mL vials containing approx imately 100 mg 
of avalglucosidase alfa  in 10  mM histidine, 2% glycine, 2%  mannitol, and 0.01% polysorbate 80, 
with a pH of 6.2. 
Avalglucosidase alfa  will be administered by IV infusion following reconstitution and dilution at 
a dose of 20  mg/kg body weight  qow.  
The total amount of investigational product administered may be adjusted as needed to account 
for changes in body weight . Most recent body weight shou ld be used for dose calculation. Each 
avalglucosidase alfa  IV infusion will be administered in a ste p-wise manner. The rate will begin at 
a slow initial rate and will be gradually increased if there are no signs of IARs, until a maximum 
rate is reached. The infusion length will be dependent on the dose. Specific details pertaining to 
the infusion volumes  and rates  as well as dose calculation  can be found in the pharmacy manual . 
Prior to each infusion, the patient should be assessed by the Investigator or appropriate designee 
(ie, qualified physician  with the exception of patients who receive home infusion  of 
avalglucosidase alfa  as outlined below  under the subsection “Home infusion” ) to determine if the 
patient is free of acute illness and is clinically stable to receive the infusion. Infusions will be 
postponed (see Sectio n 8.7.1 ) if the patient is acutely ill on the scheduled day of infusion.  Any 
modification to the dose and/or frequency of dosing is not permitted unless it is due to an AE, in 
which case it is not a protocol vi olation, but the Investigator must consult with the Sponsor in the 
event of a dose change. No dose increase above the maximum recommended dose of 20 mg/kg 
qow will be allowed for any patients .  
Patients will be required to remain in the hospital or the inf usion center for observation of AEs for 
1 hour after each infusion ; see below for the patients receiving home infusion. Patients may be 
required to stay for a longer observation period at the Investigator’s discretion.  In case the patient 
does not stay for  this observation period (eg , as part of contingency measures for a regional or 
national emergency that is declared by a governmental agency), the I nvestigator  (or appropriate 
designee) will contact the patient to ensure that no adverse event occurred duri ng the 
observational period.  
Home infusion  
Home infusion may be possible , where permitted by national and local regulations . Patients must 
meet the eligibility requirements ou tlined below. In addition, the I nvestigator and the  Sponsor 
must agree that home infusion is appropriate.  Patient’s underlying co -morbi dities and ability to 
adhere to the requirements of the study need to be taken into account when evaluating patients for 
eligibility to receive home  infusion. Any identified risk of noncompliance to mon itoring of study

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 39 requirements or potential for loss to follow -up should lead to this patient not being eligible for 
home infusion.  
The following criteria must be documented in the patient’s medical record:  
• The Investigator must agree in writing that home i nfusion is appropriate for the patient.  
• The patient must be willing and able to comply with home infusion procedures.  
• The patient has been trained on home infusion process.  
• The patient must, in the Investigator’s (or designee’s) opinion, have been clinica lly stable 
with no history of moderate or severe IARs for at least 12 months, and must be on a stable 
avalglucosidase alfa  dose. In case of unexpected event that prevent infusions to be 
performed at site for a prolonged period, (eg , as part of contingency measures for a 
regional or national emergency that is declared by a governmental agency), with DMC 
agreement, the required period of 12 months with no history of moderate or severe IAR 
may be reduced to 6 months, to allow home infusion to be resumed  sooner . 
• If this reduced period from 12 months to at least 6 months , is considered safe and after 
confirmation with the DMC  (which will be documented in Trial Master File) , it will be 
considered as a permanent criterion after the unexpected event is resolved (eg , 
contingency measures for a regional or national emergency that is declared by a 
governmental agency are terminated).  
• No infusion rate increases will be allowed while  a patient is receiving home infusions.  
• The patient must have no ongoing (not yet recovere d) SAEs that, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, may affect the patient’s ability to tolerate the infusion.  
• Home infusion infrastructure, resources, and procedures must be established and available 
according to applicable regional regulations  (see Section  17.1 for regulations applicable 
specifically in France disallowing the option for home infusion) . In exceptional 
circumstances, the Investigator may require a local vendor for  home infusion services. In 
such circumstances, the Investigator will attest that this vendor meets the requirements to 
properly manage the home infusion of avalglucosidase alfa, including available resources 
and procedures.  
• Patients experiencing a moderat e or severe IAR while being infused at home will return to 
the study site for their following infusion and will continue to receive infusions at the site 
until the Investigator feels it is safe for the patient to resume home infusion . 
• If recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions have occurred prior to  start of

Packaging is in accord ance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements.  
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS A ND SHELF LIFE  
Investigators or other authorized persons (ie, pharmacists  or designees ) are re sponsible for storing 
IMP provided by the Sponsor in a secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, 
labeling specifications, policies , and procedures.  
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated sto rage) and 
information on in -use stability and instructions for handling the compound should be managed 
according to the rules provided by the Sponsor.  
It is recommended that the reconstituted product be used immediately after reconstitution.  
Additional sta bility data are provided in the pharmacy manual . 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES  
The Investigator, the clinical site  pharmacist , or other personnel allowed to store and dispense  the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the I MP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable r egulatory requirements.  
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription, and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of  IMP issued and returned is 
maintained.  
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an I MP (eg, deficiency in condition, 
appearance, pertaining documenta tion, labeling, expiration date ) should be promptly notified to 
the Sponsor. Some deficiencies  may be recorded through a complaint procedure.  
A potential defect in the quality of I MP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the S ponsor, in order to recall I MP and eliminate potential hazards.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply I MP provided by the Sponsor to a third party, 
allow the I MP provided by the Sponsor to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial  
protocol , or dispose of I MP provided by the Sponsor in any other manner.

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 42 8.7.1  Treatment accountability and compliance  
Administration of the IMP is performed in collaboration with qualified study personnel, and under 
the responsibility of  the Investigator or the subinvestigator.  
• IMP accountability:  
- The person responsible for drug dispensing is required to maintain adequate records of 
the IMP. These records include the date and number of treatment units received from 
the Sponsor, dispensed for patient , and destr oyed or returne d to the Sponsor,  
- The person responsible for drug administration to the patient will record precisely the 
date, time of the drug administration , and number of treatment units used for 
administration , 
- The Investigator records the dosing inform ation on the appropriate page(s) of the 
eCRF , 
- The monitor in charge of the study then checks the eCRF data by comparing them with 
the IMP which he/she has retrieved and IMP records.  
The patient’s compliance with the treatment regimen will be monitored in t erms of the patient 
receiving the study drug infusion every other week within a ±7-day window from the previous 
infusion date. Missed, delayed, or incomplete infusions will be clearly documented and 
considered in the analysis.  Missed doses of study treatme nt due to sickness, safety concerns, or for 
medical reasons are not protocol deviations, but must be documented for analysis and potential 
impact on the study results.  
8.7.2  Return and/or destruction of treatments  
Reconciliation of the IMP must be performed at t he site by the Investigator and the monitoring 
team using the appropriate accountability log and documented on the appropriate accountability 
log countersigned by the Investigator and the monitoring team.  
A written authorization for destruction will be giv en by the Sponsor  once the reconciliation is 
achieved.  This destruction can be performed at the site depending on local requirements; 
alternatively, the IMP  can be returned to the Sponsor for destruction.  
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ON 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to any I MP. 
Medications and therapies taken by the patient during the period between the end of the prior 
avalglucosidase alfa  study until prior to providing informed consent for the extension study , and 
during the course of the study , will be recorded in the eCRF . Similarly, pre -infusion medications 
(if allowed; see Section  8.8.1  and Section  8.8.2 ) and assistive devices will be recorded in the 
eCRF.

avalglucosidase alfa  treatment purposes.  
8.8.1  Pretreatment for patients with infusion -associated reactions  
In clinical trials with alglucosidase alfa , some patients were pretreated with antihistamines, 
antipyretics , and/or corti costeroids. Infusion -associated reactions occurred in some patients after 
receiving antipyretics, antihistamines , or corticosteroids.  
In general, the use of pretreatment in this study is at the discretion of the Investigator. The routine 
use of pretreatmen t is not recommended, especially in patients with previous IgE -mediated 
hypersensitivity reaction. Antihistamines can mask early symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction 
(skin reaction) , making it difficult for the infusion staff to recognize the initial si gns of distress 
and the need to decrease the infusion rate and/or otherwise intervene.  
8.8.2  Management of infusion -associated reactions  
For management of mild IARs, infusion rate reductions (ie, reduced to half the rate) or temporary 
interruptions may mitigate the reaction.  
Testing for moderate, severe , and recurrent mild IARs will include, if clinically indicated:  
• Assessments for circulating immune complex detection; and IgE, serum tryptase, and  
complement activation, following moderate, severe, or recurrent mi ld IARs suggestive  of 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
• Skin testing if IARs are suggestive of a Type I hypersensitivity reaction (IgE -mediated)  as 
appropriate.  
For moderate to severe or recurrent IARs, the Investigator may consider the use of pretreatment 
medic ations (ie, antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or glucocorticoids), in addition to infusion rate 
reductions, interruptions, or even discontinuation, if necessary.  Please refer to the Investigator 
Brochure for further guidance on the management of infusion -associated reactions.  
If severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of the 
infusion should be considered, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated. Severe 
reactions are generally managed with infusion int erruption, administration of antihistamines, 
corticosteroids, IV fluids, and/or oxygen, when clinically indicated. In some cases of anaphylaxis, 
epinephrine has been administered. Because of the potential for severe infusion reactions, 
appropriate medical support measures, including CPR  equipment especially for patients with 
cardiac hypertrophy and patients with significantly compromised respiratory function, should be 
readily available.  
The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parame ter returns to baseline or 
until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary.

9.1.1  Adverse events  
Adverse events, spontaneously reported by the patient or observed by the Investigator, will be 
monitored throughout the study. This includes the monitoring and reporting of IARs. The safety 
profile will be based on incidence, severity, and cumulative nature of TEAEs. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events  are defined as AEs that develop or worsen during the 
on-treatment period. For this study, the on -treatment period will be defined as the period from the 
time of first dose of IMP to at least 4 weeks after the last administration of the IMP. The 
on-treatment period may end earlier (ie, 2 weeks after the last administration of IMP) if the patient 
enrolls in another study or receives commercially available ERT.  For the purposes of the study, 
status of ongoing and new  AEs will be assessed 4 weeks after the last study infusion, or for 
patients who discontinue early, after their last completed study visit  (Section  10.1.3.8 ). Any new 
AE or serious AE (SAE ) that occurs during the 4 -week follow -up period and is assessed as related 
to the drug or study procedures will be reported/collected in the clinical database.

9.1.5  Body weight  
Body weight will be measured in k ilograms  and collected  in the eCRFs every 3 months  
throughout the duration of the study, as well as at the “end of study visit”. More frequent  weight 
may be obtained at the discretion of the Investigator.  
9.1.6  Electrocardiogram variables  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs are recorded after at least 15 minutes in the supine position using an 
electrocardiographic device. The following will be assessed:  heart rate, rhythm, interval between 
the peaks of successive QRS complexes ( RR), interval from the beginning of the P wave until the 
beginning of the QRS complex ( PR), interval from start of the Q wa ve to the end of the S wave 
(QRS ), interval between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave ( QT), QT interval 
corrected for heart rate ( QTc) automatic correction evaluation ( by the ECG device), QRS axis, 
R voltage V6, voltage V1, left v entricular hypertrophy criteria, right ventricular hypertrophy 
criteria, repolarization charges, and overall cardiac impression for each patient.  
Each ECG consists of a 10 -second recording of the 12 leads simultaneously, leading to:  
• A single 12 -lead ECG (2 5 mm/s, 10  mm/mV) printout including date, time, initials, and 
number of the patient, signature of the research physician, and at least 3 complexes for 
each lead. The study site cardiologist’s medical opinion and automatic values will be 
recorded in the eC RF. This printout will be retained at the site.  
• A single digital file will be stored which enables manual reading when it is necessary 
(centralized reading of computerized ECGs); each digital file will be identified by 
theoretical time (day and time), real  date and real time (recorder time), and patient number

will be adapted to the absence of infusion of avalglucosidase alfa  until the patient resumes 
treatment within the study:  
- Study visits can be adapted to every 4 weeks or when laboratory and/or clinical testing 
are scheduled, as long as the assessment time windows in the study protocol are 
respected.  Patients should adhere to original target infusion and visit schedule based on 
first infusion  in LTS13769 or  first infusion of 20 mg/kg in the LTS13769 study . 
- As no infusion of IMP will be performed, no assessment of infusion -associated vital 
signs, as well as no PK sampling is required while the participant is temporarily 
withdrawn from treatment.  
• Reinitiation of treatment with IMP will be offered to the patient at the discretion of the 
Investigator and in agreement with the study participant, under close and appropriate 
clinical and/or laboratory monitoring.

notably he/she should follow -up the outcome of any AEs (eg, clin ical signs, laboratory 
values or other) until the return to normal or consolidation of the patient's condition.  
• All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact that are designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed by the Investigator at subsequent visits/contacts . 
• In case of any SAE, the patient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and 
laboratory results have returned to normal, or until outcome has been stabilized. This may 
imply that follow -up may continue after the patient has left the clinic al trial and that 
additional investigations may be requested by the monitoring team. The Investigator will 
ensure that follow -up includes further investigations consistent with appropriate medical 
management and patient consent to elucidate the nature and/ or causality of the AE.  
• In case of any SAE or non -serious AE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any 
time after cessation of the IMP and considered by him/her to be caused by the IMP with a 
reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the  monitoring team.

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 59 • The Investigator will provide follow -up information for any SAE to the Sponsor as soon as 
it is available. The Sponsor or regulatory authorities may request additional information 
regarding an SAE.  
• For this study, the on -treatment period will be defined as the period from the time of first 
dose of IMP to at least 4 weeks after the last administration of the IMP. The on -treatment 
period may end earlier (ie, 2 weeks after the last administration of IMP) if the patient 
enrolls in another stud y or receives commercially available ERT. In this case the follow -up 
period may be reduced from 4 to 2 weeks. For the purposes of the study, status of ongoing 
and new AEs will be assessed 4 weeks after the last infusion, or for patients who 
discontinue ear ly, after their last completed study visit. Any new AE or SAE that occurs 
during the 4 -week follow -up period and is assessed as related to the drug or study 
procedures will be reported/collected in the clinical database.  
10.2 DEFINITION OF SOURCE  DATA  
All evalu ations that are reported in the eCRF must be supported by appropriately identified source 
documentation. The results of certain examinations or evaluations recorded in the eCRF may be 
considered to be source data.  
The Investigator must provide the Sponsor or its designee direct access to each patient’s source 
documents. Source documents may include, but are not limited to, the following original 
documents, data, and records where information was first recorded:  
• Hospital records . 
• Medical histories and narrat ive statements relating to the patient’s progress . 
• Clinical and office charts .

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 60 10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT T EMPORARY OR PERMANEN T TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DIS CONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. I n case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the eCRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in th e study as long as possible.  
The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator or Sponsor to discontinue a patient 
from treatment:  
• The patient was erroneously included in the study (ie, was found to not have met the 
inclusion/exclusion criterio n). 
• The patient experiences an intolerable or unacceptable AE.  
• The patient is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol.  
• The patient participates in another investigational study without the prior written 
authorization of the Sponsor.  
• The pati ent becomes pregnant.  
• The patient becomes lost to follow -up. 
The Investigator o r the Sponsor (see Section  14.2) terminates the study . 
10.3.1  Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational med icinal product(s)  
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs or if the patient becomes pregnant . Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under 
close and appropriate clinical/and or laborat ory monitoring once the Investigator will have 
considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP in the 
occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still 
met (refer t o Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be r ecorded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate screen s of the eCRF when considered as confirmed.  Visit and assessment 
schedules will be adapted to the absence of infusion of IMP (refer to Section  1.2 and 
Section  10.1.2.8 ). 
10.3.2  Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s)  
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re -expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time.

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 61 10.3.3  Criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation  
At patient request, ie, withdrawal of the consent for treatme nt, the patients may withdraw from 
treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this 
may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to document the reasons for 
treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the eCRF.  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient . 
10.3.4  Handling of patients after perm anent treatment discontinuation  
Patients will be followed -up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed -up as specified in this p rotocol, whichever comes last.  
If possible, and after the permanent discontinuation of treatment, the patients will be assessed 
using the procedure normally planned for the last dosing day with the IMP.  
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation shou ld be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate screen s of the eCRF when considered as confirmed.  
10.3.5  Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at  any 
time and irrespective of the reason . Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished 
from withdrawal of consent for follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non -patient 
contact follow -up, eg, medical records check. If possible, the patients should be assessed using the 
procedures defined above.  
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information elicited should be documented. Prefera bly 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing.  
If possible,  the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end  of study 
visit.  
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to recontact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physi cian, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. 
Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted  telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).  
The statistical analysis plan will specify how these patients lost to follow -up for their primary 
endpoints will be considered.

10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE IN VESTIGATOR REG ARDING SAFETY REPORT ING 
10.4.1  Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1  Adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical inves tigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment . 
10.4.1.2  Serious adverse event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death , or 
• Is life -threatening , or: 
- Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more  severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization , or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is a medically important event : 
- Medical and scientific judgment  should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the patient or may requi re intervention ( ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
10.4.1.3  Adverse event of special interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or non -serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to t he 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor may be appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in 
order to characterize and understand them. AESIs may be added or r emoved during a study by 
protocol amendment.

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 63 AESIs  will include:  
• Infusion -associated reactions : 
- IARs are d efined as AESIs that occur during either the infusion or the observation 
period following the infusion which are deemed to be related or possibly rela ted to the 
IMP. At the discretion of the Investigator, AEs occurring after completion of the  
post-infusion observation period that are assessed as related may also be considered 
IARs.  Refer to Section  8.8.2  for additional testing in the event a patient experiences a 
moderate, severe, or recurrent IAR suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions and for 
suggested guidelines for the management of IARs.  
• Pregnancy : 
- Pregnancy occurring i n a female patient included in the clinical trial. Pregnancy will be 
recorded as an AESI with immediate notification in all cases. It will be qualified as an 
SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria.  
- Male patients will be instructed to notify the Investiga tor immediately if they discover 
that their sexual partner is pregnant.  
- In the event of pregnancy  in a female participant , IMP should be discontinued.  
- Follow -up of the pregnancy is mandatory  in a female participant or in a female partner 
of a male particip ant, until the outcome has been determined.  
• Overdose : 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient and defined as at least twice the 
intended dose within the intende d therapeutic interval, adjusted according to the tested 
drug.  
• Clinical laboratory (change from baseline , ie, prior to the first dose of GZ402666 in any 
prior avalglucosidase alfa  study) : 
- ALT or AST increase of ≥3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN ) if baseline is <ULN, or 
ALT or AST increase ≥2 x the baseline  value  if baseline is ≥ULN , 
- A maximum ALT value of ≥400 IU/L or AST value of ≥500 IU/L or an increase in 
direct, indirect , or total bilirubin of ≥2  x ULN , 
- Serum creatinine increase of >1.5  x the baseline  value  (and final serum creatinine 
value is >ULN) . 
In the event of an AESI, the Sponsor will be informed immediately (ie , within 24 hours), using the 
AE form together with the SAE complementary form to  be entered in the eCRF.

LTS13769  - avalglucosidase alfa  Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 64 10.4.2  General guidelines for reporting adverse events  
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP, spanning from the signature of 
the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that 
patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding screen (s) of the eCRF.  
• When a safety event is categorized as a primary outcome, the event will be reported as an 
AE but will be waived from reporting to health authorities providing an agreement has 
been reached  with them.  
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigation s performed, outcome, 
and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by the IMP.  
- There is one exception to this rule. In instances where a patient experiences an IAR 
(refer to Section 8.8.2 ), allergic, or anaphylactic reaction, either during infusion or post 
observation period, each of the individual signs and/or symptoms comprising the 
reaction should be captured as individual AE terms . 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patient s. This may imply that 
observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patien t’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient.  
• Laboratory, vital signs , or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or , 
- Requiring either corrective treatment or consultatio n, and/or , 
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or , 
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or , 
- Defined as an AESI.  
10.4.3  Instructions for reporting serious adverse events  
In the case of  occurrence of an SAE , the Investigator must immedi ately : 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the eCRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after 
approval of the Investigator within the eCRF or after a standard delay.  
• All further data updates should be recorded in the eCRF as appropriate within 24 hours of 
knowledge. In addition, every effort should be made to further document any SAE that is 
fatal or life -threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification.

used when the eCRF system does not work.  Please refer to the Study Operation s Manual 
for further guidance.  
Any SAE  brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the 
patient and considered by him/her to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team . 
10.4.4  Guidelines for reporting advers e events of special interest  
The needs for specific monitoring, documentation, and management of AESIs are described in 
this section.  
For each defined AESI, consider carefully the need to collect additional specific information that 
would impact the study and/or the eCRF design, such as:  
• Pre-existing related condition or lifestyle of interest for the AE (eg, habits, cardiovascular 
risk factor) . 
• Expected list of associated signs and symptoms . 
• Corrective actions (eg, treatment discontinuation, concomitant tre atment) . 
• Diagnostic actions (eg, test [s] or procedure [s] results) . 
• Additional descriptive factors . 
• Sequelae . 
• IARs : 
- Any pre-infusion medication(s) administered,  
- Infusion rate at which the IAR occurred,  
- Time to onset of IAR,  
- Any adjustments to infusion rate made,  
- Any medication s and/or therapies administered,  
- Time to IAR resolution (de -challenge),  
- Re-challenge,  
- Relevant vital signs (including pre -infusion vital signs) .

The Sponsor will be responsible for data collection and editing, reviewing , and validating all the 
information in the eCRFs, statistical analysis, and generation of the clinical report.  
Prior to locking the  database, all data editing will be complete and decisions regarding the 
evaluability of all patient data for inclusion in the statistical analysis will be made. The rationale 
for excluding any data from the statistical analyses will be prospectively defin ed, and 
classification of all or part of a patient’s data as non -evaluable will be completed and documented 
before the entire database is locked.  
All data collected in this study will be documented using summary tables, figures, and patient data 
listings.  
All summary statistics will be computed and displayed overall and by treatment group  and 
scheduled assessment time point. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include n, 
mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical va riables, 
frequencies and percentages will be presented. Graphical displays will be provided as appropriate.  
Any changes to the statistical analysis will be delineated in the statistical analysis plan . 
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
This is an ongoing extensi on study, and therefore, the number of patients will be determined by 
enrollment from other avalglucosidase alfa  studies. Thus , no formal sample size calculations have 
been performed.  
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIE NTS 
Disposition of patients will be depicted by inte nded dose level for both the patient study status and 
also for the patient analysis populations. For patient study status, the total number of patients for 
each one of the following categories will be presented in the clinical study report:  
• Registered pati ents are patients who signed the informed consent and who are planned to 
receive the IMP. 
• All treated population . 
• Patients who completed the study treatment period as per protocol . 
• Patients who discontinued study treatment and reasons for discontinuation . 
• Pharmacokinetic  population . 
• Pharmacodynamic  population .

numbers and percentages by dose level.  
Additionally, the analysis populations for safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy will be 
summarized in a table by patient counts on the registered population.  
11.2.1   Protocol deviations  
During the re view of the database, compliance with the protocol will be examined with regard to 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment compliance, prohibited therapies, and timing and 
availability of planned assessments. Protocol deviations will be identified by t he study team 
before database lock and documented as appropriate, including missing data and IMP 
discontinuations, and classified as minor, major, or critical . Protocol deviations discovered during 
the data reconciliation process will be tracked by the Spo nsor or its designee.  
Individual deviations to inclusion and exclusion criteria as reported by the Investigator will be 
listed.  
If any, other deviations will be listed by patient and/or described in the body of the clinical study 
report.  
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIO NS

completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The Investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cau se 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for study termination by the Sponsor, as well as reasons for the early closure of a study 
site by the Sponsor or Investigator may include but are not limited to:  
• For study te rmination:  
- Information on the product leads to doubt as to the benefit/risk ratio . 
- Discontinuation of further study intervention development . 
• For site termination:  
- Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines . 
- Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) of 
participants by the Investigator . 
- Total number of participants included earlier than expected . 
If the study  is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the 
Investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organization(s) 
used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified b y the applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure 
appropriate participant therapy and/or follow -up.

Property of the Sanofi Group  - strictly confidential  Page 2 REASON FOR ERRAT UM: 
 
In the Clinical Trial Summary table (p age 5) and in section 5.2 (p age 33), exploratory efficacy 
variables are wrongly listed as secondary endpoints.  
In the LTS13769 study  protocol (Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 09, p age 6), exploratory 
plasma and urine biomarkers and pharmacogenetics assessments are wrongly listed as secondary 
endpoints.  These assessments are clearly exploratory in nature and are not reported in the Clin ical 
Study Report, as also described in the study protocol:  
• Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 09, p age 50 
9.3.4  Exploratory plasma and urine biomarkers  
Fasted plasma and urine samples will be collected prior to IMP infusion for the assessment of 
explorator y biomarkers. Procedures for the collection, handling, and shipment of all samples will 
be included in the study -specific laboratory manual. Results will be used to inform on biomarker 
targets for future studies and will not be reported in the CSR.  
• Amend ed Clinical Trial Protocol 09, p age 51 
9.5 Pharmacogenetic assessment  
Fasted pharmacogenetic samples will be collected. Refer to the study -specific laboratory manual 
for guidelines on the collection and shipment of whole blood samples.  
9.5.1  Skeletal muscl e RNA expression analysis  
In patients in whom the prior muscle biopsy, obtained in a prior avalglucosidase alfa study, had a 
glycogen content >5% or who show significant clinical decline, muscle tissue samples will be 
taken via biopsy of the lower extremit y (quadriceps) muscle, as indicated in Section 9.3.2. An  
additional serum sample will be collected in connection with this analysis. These serum samples 
will be used to assess whether proteins for any of the mRNA targets that are identified in muscle 
are e xpressed in serum and therefore could be assessed as a serum -based marker of Pompe 
disease. Results will be used to inform on biomarker targets for future studies and will not be 
reported in the CSR.  
9.5.2  Circulating microRNA analysis  
Plasma samples will be collected and assessed for circulating microRNA concentrations on both 
the whole -genome and individual gene levels. Results will be used to inform on biomarker targets 
for future studies and will not be reported in the CSR.

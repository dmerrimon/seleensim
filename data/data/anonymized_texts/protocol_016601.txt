CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 88 Correlative/Exploratory:  
• Correlative markers include baseline and on -treatment serum levels of 
chemokines, cytokines, antibodies to tumor antigens, and other immune 
mediators (e.g. sIL2R  and CTACK for PTCL; CD30 , IL-31 and IL -32 for 
CTCL) as deemed relevant by the sponsor.  
Study  Design 
and Procedure  This is a multi -center, open label, non -randomized, two -part Phase I/II study of 
Tenalisib  in combination with Romidepsin  in adult p atients with 
relapsed/ refractory TCL . The first part is a n open label, 3+3 design, Phase I dose 
escala tion for MTD  determination. The second part is a Phase II, dose expansion 
to delineate the safety and anti -tumor activity of the combination at the 
MTD/optimal dose.  
 
In dose escalation, a minimum of 2 and maximum 1 8 patients will be enrolled in 
three dose levels unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ 
optimal dose. In dose expansion, up to 24 TCL patients will be enrolled (Group 
1 = 12 PTCL patients and Group 2  = 12 CTCL patients).  
 
The study will end when all ongoing subjects have reach ed their third tumor 
assessment on Cycle 8/Day 1 (C8D1) or have discontinued from the study for 
any reason, whichever is earlier. At the end of the study, all ongoing patients 
with no evident disease progression will be given the opportunity to enroll in a n 
open -label compassionate use study protocol and will be followed up.  
 
PHASE I (DOSE ESCALATION):  
Sequential dose escalation will begin with Cohort 1. A minimum of three patients 
will be enrolled at each dose level. Dose levels will be increased in successive 
increments according to the dose escalation cohorts mentioned in the table below . 
Escalation to the next cohort will occur if no patient w ithin a three -patient cohort 
or one in six patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). De -escalation 
to different lower doses in case DLT criteria is met, will be done as per the 
discretion of Safety Review Committee (SRC). The highest doses of th e 
combination (Tenalisib at 800 mg BID plus Romidepsin IV 14 mg/m2) will be 
considered as optimal in case there is no DLT  at this dose level.  
Dose escalation scheme:  
Cohort  N Tenalisib1 Romidepsin2 
Cohort 1  3-6 Tab. 400 mg PO twice a day  IV 12 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Cohort 2  3-6 Tab. 600 mg PO twice a day  IV 12 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Cohort 3  3-6 Tab. 800 mg PO twice a day  IV 14 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Note: Alternate dose levels/dosing schedules may be considered by the SRC if deemed 
essential based on emerging safety and PK data.  
1In case the dose (e.g. 8 00 mg BID ) is leading to DLT of the combination , the dose of 
Tenalisib will be reduced to lower do se (e.g. 6 00 mg BID ) and will be evaluated for 
safety in a separate cohort .

Original Version : 1 .0, 16 August 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 88 2In case the dose (e.g. 14 mg/m2) is leading to DLT of the combination, the dose of 
Romidepsin will be reduced to lower dose (e.g.12 mg/m2) and if required further to 10 
mg/m2 and will be evaluated for safety in a separate cohort.  
 
DLT assessment: The data of at least 3 patients will be required for DLT 
assessment. DLT assessment period will be 28-days  (inclusive) (will begin on 
C1D1 and end on C2D1) , unless extend ed by the medical monitor. In the first 
cycle, p atients must have been treated with at least 2 doses of Romidepsin  and 
minimum 14 days with Tenalisib  to be considered eligible for safety analysis  
unless identified to have a DLT. Patient s who experience a DLT will be 
considered evaluable regardless of the number of doses received.  
 
Individual patients will be considered for Intra -subject dose  escalation at the 
discretion of investigator  after discussion with medical monitor . 
 
PHASE II (DOSE EXPANSION):  
After establishing the MTD/optimal dose, the Phase II  (expansion part ) will be 
opened as approved by the SRC  to enroll two groups of patients . 
Group  N Patient population  Tenalisib  Romidepsi n 
Group 1  12 Patients with R/R PTCL  MTD/Optimal 
dose MTD/Optimal dose on 
Day 1, 8 and 15  
Group 2  12 Patients with R/R CTCL  MTD/Optimal 
dose MTD/Optimal dose on 
Day 1, 8 and 15   
The details of the study procedures are given in  the schedule  of events.  
No. of Patients  Phase I : Total 2-18 patients will be enrolled in 3 escalating cohorts unless 
additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ optimal dose.

Estimated 
Study 
Participation  Dose Escalation :  Approximately 10 months for accrual and follow up  
Dose Expansion :  Approximately 18 month s for accrual plus patient follow up.  
Assessment of 
Response   Initial disease assessment will be performed at screening.  The r esponse  to 
treatment will be done at C3D1 (± 7 days), C5D1 (± 7 days), C8D1 (± 7 days) 
and/ or at the EOT and or as clinically indicated (if clinical progression is 
suspected or for confirmation of complete response/disease progression). The 
following assessment s will be done.  
 
PTCL :  
The re sponse assessment will be done using CT scan as per the Lugano 
classification. PET -CT will be preferred for FDG -avid lymphomas. PET -CT will 
be performed at C3D1 (± 7 days) and to confirm the CR. Bone marrow biopsy 
will be performed to confirm complete resp onse.  
 
CTCL:  
Response assessment in CTCL will be done as per the modified  Severity 
Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) .  Additionally, CT scan will be done in 
the CTCL  patients with lymph node and visceral involvement. CTCL patients 
with subcutaneous lesions which cannot be measured by mSWAT will be 
assessed  by change in PET -CT avid lesions. Bone marrow biopsy will be 
performed in patients with B 2 blood involvement. In these patients, Sezary cell 
count will be quantified by flow cytometry or morphology in blood/bone 
marrow.  
Study 
Treatment  
 For purposes of this study, each cycle of therapy consists of 4 weeks.  
Tenalisib : 
Tenalisib  will be administered from Day 1 -28 in 28 -days of cycle  up to C8D1 in 
absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. However, in Cycle 1 
of Dose Escalation, Tenalisib will be started from Day 3 to permit 
pharmacokinetic analysis of Romidepsin alone prior to combination treatment.

Statistical 
Analysis  
 Part 1:  In Dose Escalation, three patients per cohort are considered appropriate 
for the assessment of overall safety and tolerability and for providing adequate 
confidence for dose escalation. No formal sample size and power analysis is 
done. Accordingly, total 2-18 patients will be enrolled in 3 escalating cohorts 
unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ optimal dose.  Optimal 
dose will be determined by the SRC.  
Part 2:   Total 24 patients with relapsed/refractory TCL will be enrolled in two 
groups (12 patients in each group).   
 
The SRC may modify the sample  size due to unforeseen clinical situations.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 88 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Tenalisib ( RP6530 ) 
The phosphoinositide -3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes involved in various cellular 
functions, including cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intrace llular 
trafficking and immunity .[1-3] Tenalisib  is a highly specific and orally available dual PI3K 
δ/γ inhibitor with nano -molar inhibitory potency and several fold selectivity over α and β 
PI3K isoforms. The specificity of Tenalisib  towards PI3K δ and γ is evidenced by >1000 
and >100 -fold selectivity over α and β isoforms in an enzyme -based  assay. Chemically, 
Tenalisib  is an iso-flavone substituted adenine.   
 
1.1.1 Summary of Pre-Clinical Evaluation  
Tenalisib  has equimolar potency against both PI3K δ/γ isoforms in enzyme, cell, and blood -
based assays. Additionally, the compound inhibited antigen -induced superoxide or cytokine 
release from primary human neutrophils or monocytes at nano -molar concentration 
indicating a potential in modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Studies using 
immortalized B and T lymphoma cell lines demonstrated the anti -proliferative effect of 
Tenalisib  coupled with induction of apoptosis and a concomitant inhibition of the 
downstream biomarker, pAKT. Similarly, cytokine induced  pAKT was inhibited in 
malignant primary CTCL cells isolated from patient donors. Tenalisib  induced apoptosis of 
patient derived primary CTCL cells  following 48 hr incubation .  
 
In vivo efficacy of Tenalisib  was confirmed in a subcutaneous mouse MOLT -4 xen ograft 
model representative of human T -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Oral administration of 
50 mg/kg/BID over an 18 -day period resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth .[4] In 
28-days toxicity stud ies in rat  and dog , once daily oral administration of Tenalisib  was well 
tolerated. Target organ effects were observed in thyroid and liver.  The no -observed -adverse -
effect level (NOAEL) was 20  mg/kg/day in rat and 10 mg/kg/day in dog.  
 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed background information on 
Tenalisib .[5] 
 
1.1.2 Summary of Clinical Evaluation  
To date, Tenalisib  has been evaluated in four clinical trials:  
1. A Phase I Dose Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of RP6530, a dual 
PI3K δ/γ inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies 
(European study: Protocol Numbe r RP6530 -1301) Status: Completed   
2. A Phase I/Ib, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of RP6530, a dual 
PI3K δ/γ inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory T -cell Lymphoma (US study: 
Protocol number RP6530 -1401). Status: Recruitmen t completed. Study Ongoing  
3. An open label, randomized, single dose, crossover study to evaluate food effects on 
relative bioavailability of RP6530 administered in fasting and fed conditions in healthy 
volunteers (Food effect study, Protocol no: RP6530 -1501) . Status: Completed  
4. An Open label, Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RP6530, a novel 
PI3K δ/γ dual inhibitor given in combination with an anti -PD-1 therapy, Pembrolizumab 
in adult patients with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgki n’s lymphoma (cHL). Status: 
Ongoing and currently recruiting.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 88 • Safety:  
In RP6530 -1401 study, a total of 58 patients were treated at 200 mg BID (n=4), 400 mg BID 
(n=4), 800 mg BID (Fasting) (n=44) and 800 mg BID (Fed) (n=6) in both dose escalation 
and dose expansion cohorts. Tenalisib demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability profile 
up to 800 mg BID (fasting). Tenalisib 800 mg BID (Fasting) was considered as MTD dose 
in patients with T -cell lymphoma. Majority of AEs include transaminitis, skin rash. 
Treatment related Grade ≥ 3 includes AST/ALT elevation (n=12), rash (n=4), 
hypophosphatemia (n=2), neutropenia (n=1), INR Increase (n=1), sepsis (n=1), pyrexia 
(n=1), diplopia secondary to neuropathy (n=1), drug reaction (n=1), and bacteremia (n=1). 
Treatme nt related SAE reported were pyrexia (n=1), raised INR (n=1), sepsis (n=1), diplopia

• Pharmacokinetics:  
In RP6530 -1401 study,  at the 200 mg dose, AUC 0-t and C max were 3713.94 h*ng/mL and 
1463.57 ng/mL at C1D1 respectively; corresponding levels at C2D1 were 3985.52 h*ng/mL 
and 1781.24 ng/mL. Similarly, at the 800 mg dose (fed), AUC 0-t and C max were 13204.17 
h*ng/mL and 2988.66 ng/mL at C1D1 respectively; correspond ing levels at C2D1 were 
12737.21 h*ng/mL and 3234.50 ng/mL. At the 800 mg dose (fasting), AUC 0-t and C max were 
14033.67 h*ng/mL and 4174.71 ng/mL at C1D1 respectively; corresponding levels at C2D1 
were 13210.24 h*ng/mL and 3395.28 ng/mL.  Based on C max and AUC, dose proportionality 
was observed up to the 800 mg dose. Upon increasing doses, no changes in T max were 
observed and while changes in T 1/2 were observed, steady state PK parameters of Tenalisib 
as determined on C2D1 revealed no accumulation.  
 
• Efficacy:  
In RP6530 -1401 study, response assessments of the thirty -five evaluable patients receiving 
at least two cycles of Tenalisib showed an ORR of 46% (16/35 patients) out of which 3 (9%) 
were CR and 13 (37%) were PR.   Eleven patients showed stable di sease (31%). Indication 
specific analysis showed an ORR of 47% (7/15, 3 CR, 4 PR) in PTCL and 45% (9/20, 9 PR) 
in CTCL. Effect of RP6530 on associated correlative markers in PTCL (sIL -2R and CD30) 
and CTCL (IL -31, IL -32α, and CTACK) patients that were eith er a CR, PR, or SD on C3D1 
showed decreased plasma concentrations of markers with the reductions being most 
pronounced for CD30 (57%) and IL -31 (33%) in the respective patient populations.[6] 
 
1.2 Romidepsin  
Romidepsin  is a histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor and was approved by FDA for the 
treatment of CTCL a nd PTCL in 2009 and 2011 respectively for the patients who have 
received at least one prior systemic therapy. A pivotal phase II study on Romidepsin in 131 
patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL showed an ORR of 26 % (CR rate of 15  %), 
progression free survival (P FS): 4 months and DoR  of 13 months.[7] Similarly, Romidepsin 
was evaluated in 2 multicenter, single -arm clinical studies in patients with CTCL. 
Cumulative, response rate (ORR) in 167 patients was 35 % (CR rate of 6%) and DoR of 13 
months.[ 7]

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 88 1.3 Study Rationale  
1.3.1 Rationale for Study Population  
T-cell lymphomas (TCL) comprise a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies arising 
from mature T -cells. Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL)  constitut e 10–12 % of non -
Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) in Western countries but are relatively common in Eastern 
Asian, cons tituting about 20  % of mature NHL .[8] There is no consensus regarding optimal 
treatment for PTCL, especially in relapsed or refractory cases, which have very poor 
prognosis. High -dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT) has been accepted as a salvage treatment for eligible patients, although the evidence 
is unclear.[9] Moreover, the overall prognosis remains dismal in patients unsuitable for 
ASCT.   
 
Cutaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCLs)  represent a group of rare, clinically and 
pathologically heterogeneous diseases. The incidence of CTCL has been increasing and is 
currently 6.4 per million persons, with the highest incidence rates being reported among 
males and African -Americans. Mycosis  fungoides (MF) is the most common primary CTCL 
variant and is closely related to a rare leukemic variant, Sézary syndrome (SS). Skin-directed 
therapies, such as psoralen plus ultraviolet A in combination with retinoids or interferon, are 
used in the early  stage disease and generally produce good, long -term responses. Patients 
with advanced -stage disease require a multidisciplinary approach that includes combinations 
of skin -directed therapies, biologic -response modifiers and systemic chemotherapeutic 
agent s. Although patients with early stages of disease have an excellent prognosis, ∼25% 
develop progressive disease.[10-12] The prognosis for patients presenting with advanced -stage 
disease is poor.[10, 11, 13, 14] 
 
Over recent years, several single -agent therapies have proven to be effective in 
relapsed/refractory PTCL . Pralatrexate, romidepsin, and belinostat are all approved broadly 
for PTCL with ORR ’s in phase II studies of 29, 25, and 26  %, respectively. Brentuximab 
vedotin is also approved in relapsed ALCL with an ORR of 86  % in a small phase II trial.  
 
Despite recent progress, there are hurdles to overcome in managing patients with PTCL as 
respons es with these therapies are not optimal (all approved therapies except brentuximab 
has response rate <30%). Given the aggressive nature of PTCL, which has a poor prognosis, 
this patient population represents an unmet medical need.  
 
CTCL patients are respo nsive to treatment in the early stages; patients have a long duration 
of survival but are rarely cured of the disease. For refractory early -stage and advanced -stage 
disease (IIB -IV), a multidisciplinary approach is used that include bexarotene, interferon α, 
extracorporeal photopheresis, histone deacetylase inhibitors  (vorinostat and romidepsin) , 
and antibody therapies such as alemtuzumab, systemic chemotherapy, and allogeneic 
transp lantation. Though, these agents, alone or in combinations, are associated with high 
response rates, unfortunately response is often of limited duration (frequently measured in 
months) and especially in advanced cases, characterized by frequent recurrences,  probably 
due to treatment resistance.  Therefore, the prognosis for patients presenting with advanced -
stage disease generally poor[10, 11, 13, 14]. Hence , novel therapeutic agents, either alone or in 
combination, are  needed  to achieve better disease control in these patients .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 88 1.3.2 Rationale for Combination of Tenalisib  and Romidepsin     
Modification of histones by acetylation plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of gene 
expression and is controlled by the balance between histone deacetylases (HDAC) and 
histone acetyltransferases (HAT). HDAC inhibitors induce cancer cell cycle arrest,  
differentiation and cell death, reduce angiogenesis and modulate immune response.  
 
Recently it is recognized that TCL may be a disease characterized by epigenetic 
dysregulation , partly explain ed by TCL sensitivity to histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitors . Early phase clinical studies have demonstrated that combination therapy with 
epigenetic therapies such as HDAC inhibitors plus other agents known to have activity in T 
cell lymphoma have enhanced clinical benefit for this group of diseases. Therefore, HD AC 
inhibitors have been increasingly used as a platform to which other novel therapies or 
chemotherapy can be added.  
 
Pre-clinical experiments  demonstrated the synergistic anti -tumor  activity achieved by 
combining PI3K  inhibitor with H DAC inhibitor  in B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary 
NHL/ CLL cells. These experiments  indicate d that interference with PI3K signalling 
dramatically increases H DAC inhibitor -mediated apoptosis in malignant haematopoietic  
cells - this might be through either AKT -dependent or AKT -independent mechanisms. 
Moreover, the dramatic increase in HD AC inhibitor -related apoptosis observed in PI3K  
inhibitor -treated cells appears to be related to the disruption of the ERK signalling 
pathway.[15]  
 
Synergistic potential of the combination of Tenalisib and  Romidepsin in attenuating T -cell 
lymphoma cell proliferation was determined using HuT -78, HuT -102, MOLT -4, and Jurkat . 
Cells were incubated with desired concentrations of DMSO (Vehicle), Tenalisib ( RP6530 ), 
or a combination of Tenalisib ( RP6530 ) and Romid epsin for 72 h ours cell viability estimated 
in the MTT -based assay. Combination effect was determined by calculating the Bliss score 
where scores >10  indicate synergism. Among the cell lines evaluated, synergism between 
RP6530 and Romidepsin was most evide nt in the CTCL cell lines, Hut -78 and HuT -102.

In the clinic al setting , individually, both Tenalisib and Romidepsin has show n good response 
rate of > 25 % (ORR) and dura ble response for >4 months in TCL patients in 
relapsed/refractory setting. It is therefore hypothesized that a Tenalisib /Romidepsin 
combination has the potentia l to synergize and improve depth and durability of responses in 
these patients.  
 
1.3.3 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The safety and tolerability of Tenalisib has been established at 800 mg BID in an ongoing 
study in patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma. Given the fact that both 
Romidepsin and Tenalisib have non -overlapping toxicity profiles, half of the opti mal dose 
of Tenalisib (400 mg BID) and one dose below the approved dose of Romidepsin (12 mg/m2) 
are considered reasonable as starting dose s of the combination  from safety point of view . In 
line with the approved prescribing information, Romidepsin will be  administered at Day 1, 
8 and 15 in a 28-day cycle . The lower doses may be selected on the basis of emerging 
toxicities of each of the agents given the distinctive nature of toxicities.  
 
1.4 Benefit and Risk  
It is expected that proposed combination of Tenalisib with Romidepsin has the potential to 
improve response rates and increase the durability of response . However, a ll the patients in 
clinical trials generally cannot expect to receive direct benefit from t reatment during 
participation, as clinical trials are designed to provide information about the safety and 
effectiveness of an investigational medicine. Additional details regarding specific benefits 
and risks for subjects participating in this clinical tr ial may be found in the accompanying 
IB and Informed Consent documents.

2.1 Primary Objectives  
• To characterize safety, tolerability and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of Tenalisib in combination with Romidepsin in patients with R/R T-cell lymphoma.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the preliminary anti -tumor activity of various dose levels of Tenalisib  in 
combination with Romidepsin as determined by the Objective R esponse Rate (ORR)  
and Duration of Response (DoR).   
• To characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tenalisib  and Romidepsin when given in

and qualitative measurements of malignant cells, cytokines, and chemokines in 
blood/serum.  
 
 
3 TRIAL DESIGN  
3.1 Trial End Points  
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
•  Safety:  
Adverse Event (AE), Grade 3/ 4 AEs, Serious and fatal Adverse Event (SAE), graded 
using NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. 
 
3.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
•  Efficacy:  
1. Objective R esponse Rate (ORR) , defined as sum of CR and PR rates, assessed 
according to the Lugano Classificati on for initial evaluation, staging, and response 
assessment of Hodgkin/non -Hodgkin lymphoma  in PTCL patients; and according to the 
modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) in CTCL patients.

Romidepsin.  
 
3.1.3 Correlative/ Exploratory End Points  
Correlative markers include baseline and on -treatment serum levels of chemokines, 
cytokines, antibodies to tumor antigens, and other immune mediators (e.g. sIL2R and 
CTACK for PTCL; CD30, IL -31 and IL -32 for CTCL) as deemed relevant by the sponsor.  
 
3.2 Design of Trial 
This is a multi -center, open label, non -randomized, two -part Phase I/II study of Tenalisib  in 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                       Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 88 combination with Romidepsin in adult patients with relapsed/refractory TCL . The first part 
is an open -label, 3+3 dose es calation, Phase I study for MTD determination. The second part 
is a Phase II, dose expansion to delineate the safety and anti -tumor activity of the 
combination at the MTD/optimal dose.  
 
In dose escalation, a minimum of 2 and maximum 1 8 patients will be enrolled in three dose 
levels unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ optimal dose. In dose 
expansion, up to 24 TCL patients will be enrolled (Group 1= 12 PTCL patients  and Group 
2= 12 CTCL patients ).  
 
The study will end  when all ongoing subjects have reached their third tumor assessment on 
Cycle 8/Day 1 (C8D1) or have discontinued from the study for any reason, whichever is 
earlier. At the end of the study, all ongoing patients with no evident disease progression will 
be given the opportunity to enroll in an open -label compassionate use study protocol and 
will be followed up.  
 
3.2.1 Phase I : Dose Escalation  
3.2.1.1  Dose Escalation Cohorts  
Sequential dose escalation will begin with Cohort 1. A minimum of three patients will be 
enrolled at each dose level. Dose levels will be increased in successive increments according 
to the dose escalation  cohorts mentioned in Table 1 . Escalation to the next cohort will occur 
if no patient within a three -patient coho rt or one in six patients experiences a dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). De-escalation to different lower doses in case of DLT criteria met will be 
done as per the discretion of the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The highest doses of the 
combination (Tenalisi b at 800 mg BID plus Romidepsin IV 14 mg/m2) will be considered as  
optimal in case there is no DLT at this dose level .  
 
Table 1: Dose Escalation Scheme  
Cohort  N Tenalisib1  Romidepsin2  
Cohort 1  3-6 Tab. 400 mg PO twice a day  IV 12 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Cohort 2  3-6 Tab. 600 mg PO twice a day  IV 12 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Cohort 3  3-6 Tab. 800 mg PO twice a day  IV 14 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Note: Alternate dose levels/dosing schedules may be considered by the SRC if deemed essential based on 
emerging safety and PK data .  
1In case the dose (e.g. 800 mg BID) is leading to DLT of the combination , the dose of Tenalisib will be 
reduced to lower dose (e.g. 600 mg BID) and will be evaluated for safety in a separate cohort.  
2In case the dose (e.g. 14 mg/m2) is leading to DLT of the combination , the dose of Romidepsin will be reduced 
to lower dose (e. g.12 mg/m2) and if required further to 10 mg/m2 and will be evaluated for safety in a separate 
cohort.  
 
Notes:  
• For dose escalation decision, safety data of the first 28 -days follow up  and PK data of 
C1D1  and C1D 8 is essential.  
• The dose escalation may occur if no patient within a three -patient cohort experiences a 
DLT as defined in Section  7.6 If one of three patients within a 3 -patient cohort experiences 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                       Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 88 a DLT, an additional three patients will be treated at the same dose level. If one of six 
patients within a dose level experiences a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If two or 
more of six pa tients within a dose level experience a DLT, that dose level will be defined 
as exceeding MTD, no further dose escalation will occur. The previous dose level will be 
considered the MTD or de -escalation to lower dose  level will be done as per the discretion  
of the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Once the MTD/optimal dose of the combination 
is established; the same doses will be expanded to further elucidate safety and efficacy. 
Multiple expansion cohorts will be opened at different dose levels, if deemed nece ssary.  
• If two of the first 3 patients in a cohort experience a DLT, that dose level will be defined 
as exceeding MTD, no further dose escalation will occur. The previous dose level will be 
considered the MTD and will be expanded to further elucidate safet y and to evaluate 
efficacy.  
• The actual number of dose cohorts explored will depend upon the MTD and the safety 
profile observed d uring the conduct of the trial.  Intermediate dose levels and dosing 
schedules may be explored if deemed appropriate.  
• An optimal  dose of combination is defined as the threshold dose s of individual drugs  at 
which Tenalisib/Romidepsin  combination shows clinical activ ity/efficac y (shows 
complete response or partial response) in the disease population and is at or below the 
maximum tolerated dose.   
 
3.2.1.1  Intra -subject Dose Escalation  
During dose escalation, individual patients may be considered for treatment at a dose level 
of Tenalisib /Romidepsin  higher than the dose to which they are initially assigned at 
investigator’s discret ion after discussion with Medical Monitor.  For a patient to be treated at 
a higher dose level of Tenalisib /Romidepsin , the patient must not have experienced a DLT 
at the assigned dose and tolerated the lower dose for at least one cycle of therapy. The patient 
must have undergone a disease evaluation and been found appropriate to continue on study. 
(e.g. A patient on Tena lisib 400 mg can be escalated to 600 mg dose once the safety of 600 
mg dose is established. For a patient to be treated at 600 mg dose level, the patient must not 
have experienced a DLT at 400 mg dose and tolerated the dose for at least one cycle of 
therap y. Similar is the case for Romidepsin )  
 
The new higher dose must be a dose that has completed evaluation and has not exceeded the 
MTD. T he dose escalation can occur at the start of a new cycle. At the discretion of 
investigator, dose escalation may be don e in patient who received lower doses (de -
escalation) due to safety reasons.  
 
3.2.1.2  Alternative Dosing Cohorts  
Depending on nature and timing of the toxicities , pharmacokinetic data of 
Tenalisib/Romidepsin , alternative dosing regimens and schedules may be examin ed. If in 
the opinion of the SRC , observed toxicities (DLTs and/or non -dose limiting adverse events 
of concern) are likely to have resulted from a continuous exposure to the study drug or 
cumulative effect, alternative dosing regimens or sc hedules ma y be explored. The SRC  will 
determine an alternative schedule, based on PK data, nature and timing of toxicities, and the 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                       Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

Guideline for Administration of Romidepsin:  
• Method of administration: Romidepsin  will be administered as an intravenous infusion 
in outpatient basis/ hospital setting.  
• Pre-medications:   
o Nausea and vomiting are common following treatment with Romidepsin , therefore 
prophylactic antiemetics  are recommended for all patients.  Advise patie nts to 
report these symptoms so that appropriate treatment can be instituted the earliest.  Due 
to potential for CYP3A4 interaction, administration of a neurokinin -1 receptor 
inhibitor antiemetics (e.g. aprepitant, fosaprepitant) is not permitted.  
o Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden are at the risk of tumor 
lysis syndrome, therefore these patients are advised to maintain high fluid intake  for 
at least 72 hours after each dose.  
• Serum potassium and magnesium should be ≤ ULN before Ro midepsin treatment.  
• Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each cycle of 28 
days. Interruptions from the treatment plan may be allowed for toxicity management, but 
require consultation between the investigator and Sponsor, an d written documentation of 
the collaborative decision on subject management.  
• All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
• Romidepsin should be infused over 4 hours.  Sites should make every effort to target 
infusion timing to be as close to 4 hours as possible. However, given the variability of 
infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted.  
• Romidepsin must be stored as per presc ribing information. . 
• Prescribing information should be referred for specific instructions for Romidepsin  
reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.  
 
3.4.4 Accountability of Investigational Products  
The PI/ designee are responsible for accountability of all trial drug supplies (used/unused) at 
the site. During on -site monitoring visit, t he study monitor /CRA  will verify receipt of 
investigational product , returned and empty vials /cartons , batch numbers of used vials , and 
will conduct an inventory of remaining clinical trial supplies at the site close -out visit. All 
trial drug inventories must be made available for inspection by the monitor, sponsor 
representatives and regulatory agency inspectors /monitor  upon request.  
 
Following monitor/CRA verification and instruction, expired or unused trial drugs can be 
return to the sponsor or destroyed according to local institutional policy with sponsor pre -
approval of a site -specific destruction policy. Certificate(s) of destruction  or documentation 
of destruction must be filed at the site and in Trial Master File.  Used, returned trial drugs 
can be destroyed according to local institutional policy with sponsor pre -approval of a site -

3.4.5 Precautions and Risks Associated with Investigational Products  
3.4.5.1  Tenalisib  
Monitoring of liver enzymes and levels of TSH, T3, and T4  in subjects receiving Tenalisib  
is recommended  based on target organ toxicity . Patients will be monitored for  increased 
ALT/AST,  skin rash, neutropenia as these are reported with Tenalisib . In additi on, enteritis 
(colitis), pneumonia /pneumonitis as these events are reported with other PI3K inhibitors .  
 
Tenalisib  elicit s no photo instability upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiations. However, 
in absence of in  vitro data, possibility of photo -toxici ty with Tenalisib  cannot be ruled out.  
 
Tenalisib  shows inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme. Therefore, concomitant administration of 
Tenalisib  with predominant CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. calcium channel blockers, warfarin, 
carbamazepine, macrolide antibiotics, lovastatin, simvastatin, terfenadine) may reduce 
clearance of these drugs increasing the risk of adverse events. Similarly, as Tenalisib  is 
inhibited by CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9, there is possibility of drug interaction wit h inhibitors 
or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. If concomitant treatment of these drugs are clinically 
warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised.  Strong inhibitor or inducers should 
be avoided as directed in Section on prohibited medication . Please  refer to the recent 
Investigator Brochure for additional safety information .  
 
3.4.5.2  Romidepsin  
The following adverse events have been reported in patients receiving Romidepsin : 
o Myelosuppression: Romidepsin can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia 
and lymphopenia), and anemia; monitor blood counts during treatment with  
Romidepsin ; interrupt and/or modify the dose as necessary.  
o Fatal and serious infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and viral rea ctivation, 
including Epstein Barr and Hepatitis B viruses, have been reported in clinical trials with 
Romidepsin .  These can occur during treatment and within 30 days after treatment. The 
risk of life -threatening infections may be greater in patients with a history of prior 
treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against lymphocyte antigens and in 
patients with disease involvement of the bone marrow.  
o Several treatment -emergent morphological changes in ECGs (including T -wave and ST -
segment changes) hav e been reported in clinical studies.  The clinical significance of 
these changes is unknown.  
o Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported to occur in 1% of patients with tumor 
stage CTCL and 2% of patients with Stage III/IV PTCL.  Patients with advanced st age 
disease and/or high tumor burden are at greater risk, should be closely monitored, and 
managed as appropriate.  
o Since Romidepsin is a substrate of CYP3A4 enzymes , concomitant administration of 
CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer may interact with Romidepsin.  If concomitant treatment 
of these drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised.

3.5 The Expected Duration of  Subject Participation and Follow -up 
The expected duration of subject partic ipation in the study will be about 8 months. Post 
C8D1, patients with no evident disease progression w ill be given the opportunity to enroll 
in an open -label compassionate use study protocol and will be followed up.  
 
3.6 Study Stopping Rules 
3.6.1 Stopping Rule for Dose Escalation  
The SRC  will be in charge of reviewing safety data following the final treatment dose ( Day 
28 of Cycle 1) of the last patient in each cohort and  will decide whether or not it is possible 
to proceed to the next cohort according to the dose escalation procedure des cribed in Section 
3.2.1.1 . In order to ensure safety and limit toxicity for enrolled patients, dose modifications 
will be performed according to the procedure described in Section  7.7.  
 
3.6.2 Suspension of Patient Enrollment  
In the event of one (1) death attri buted to the study drug, study accrual will be suspended 
pending further investigation, and will only be resumed at the recommendation of the SRC.  
The SRC  will have discretion to terminate the trial if an additional death occurs that can be 
attributed to the study drug.  
  
3.6.3 Stopping Rule for Dose Expansion  
After establishing the MTD/optimal dose, the Phase II expansion part will be opened as 
approved by the SRC. The SRC  will continue to monitor safety of the combination (or 
toxicity trends that may be of concern) at interval of 3 months from initiation of expansion 
cohort till the completion of the study. Safety/toxicity will be monitored across cohorts 
combined together . The SRC will have discretion to terminate the trial if there are major 
safety concerns.  
 
3.6.4 Study Stopping  
Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study in the interest of patient safety, for non -
compliance with the protocol, lack of recruitment or any  other administrative reasons. The 
sponsor and PIs will notify the regulatory authority and respective IRB (s) respectively if the 
trial terminates early with a  justification for the early termination.

ongoing clinical benefit and risk.  The decision to allow a patient to continue will be 
documented and archived at the site and at Rhizen.  
 
5.5 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance.  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance.  
 
5.5.1 Tenalisib  
Subjects will be instructed to bring any unused study drug to the site at each visit.  Research 
personnel will count and record the number of used and unused stud y drug tablets at each 
visit. The study coordinator will question the patient regarding adherence to the dosing 
regimen, record the number of tablets and strengths returned, the date returned and determine 
treatment compliance before dispensing new m edicat ion to the study patient.  Compliance 
below 80% will require counseling of the patient by study site personnel.  
 
5.5.2 Romidepsin  
Administration of trial medication will be documented by the investigator and/or trial staff  
as per institutional practice . The tota l volume of treatment infused will be compared to the 
total volume prepared to determine compliance with each dose administered.  Compliance 
with trial treatment will be measured by  number of  Romidepsin  infusion .  
 
 
6 TRIAL ASSESSMENT AND PROCEDURE  
6.1 Overview  
The Schedule of Event ( Table 5  and Table 6 ) summarizes the trial procedures to be performed 
at each visit and is divided into following.  
1. Screening (Day -28 to Day 0)  
2. On treatment procedures (C1 D1 to C 7D28) 
3. End of Treatment ( C8D1 or within 7  days from the last dose)  
4. End of Study (Day +30 from the last dose)  
 
Individual trial procedures are described in detail below. It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the 
investigator. Multiple procedures may be scheduled at the same time point relative t o 
Tenalisib. Priority should be given to PK collection at the time specified and vital signs 
should be performed prior to blood collections.  
 
6.2 Informed Consent   
The investigator or qualified designee must obtain documented written consent from each 
potential subject or each subject’s legally acceptable representative prior to participating in 
a clinical trial. Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated sign ature or by the 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                       Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 88 subject’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature on a n IRB -approved  consent 
form along with the dated signature of the person conducting the consent discussion. A copy 
of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the  subject before participation in 
the trial.   
 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form 
and any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/IEC’s 
approval/favorable opinion in advance of u se. The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial. The 
communication of this info rmation will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature or 
by the subject’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature. Specifics about a trial 
and the  trial population will be added to the consent form template at the protocol level. The 
informed consent will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and 
Sponsor requirements.  
 
6.3 Screening  
Written informed consent must be obtained ≤30  days prior to the initiation of trial treatment 
and before any protocol -specific procedures are performed. ( The first day of trial treatment 
will be considered as C1D1.) Patients should be re -consented in the case that informed 
consent is obtained >30 days prior to the initiation of trial treatment. Screening  vitals,  
laboratory tests, as described in the Schedule of Events, will be performed  as per institutional 
practice and will be reviewed by the site PI /designee . The laboratory tests should be done  
≤7 calendar days prior to the initiation of trial treatment. Re -screening can be done at the 
discretion of PI. Scans and other investigations to document measurable disease should be 
performed within 28 days prior to C1D1.  
 
Lymphoma diagnosis should be made  on the basis of morphology, immunohistochemistry, 
and flow cytometry reviewed by an experienced lymphoma pathologist. Appropriate, 
molecular studies should be considered to accurately categorize the lymphoma. For CTCL, 
the histopathologic diagnosis should  be confirmed in a skin biopsy representative of current 
disease by a  pathologist with expertise in cutaneous lymphoma.  For Sezary patients, the 
diagnosis should be based on skin and blood criteria (defined as meeting T4 plus B 2 criteria) 
(Appendix D). 
 
Clinical assessments of patients will include ECOG performance status ( Appendix A ), lymph 
nodes, organomegaly, and “B” symptoms. The staging of NHL/HL and CTCL patients will 
be done according to Ann Arbor (Appendix G) and ISCL/EORTC criteria (Appendix E)

1. A bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate should be collected ≤3 months prior to C1D1.  
2. A bone marrow biopsy will be done unless it has been shown to be negative  within the 
last 6 months.  
3. The scan and other investigations to document measurable disease should be performed  
within 28 days prior to C1D1.  
 
During screening, active infection  with HBV, HCV, CMV , EBV or HIV should be ruled out.  
To be considered negative for active infection, following algorithm will be used:  
• HBV: HBc antibody should be negative or if HBc antibody is positive, HBVDNA 
should be undetectable  
• HCV: HCV antibody should be negative or if HCV antibody is positive, HCVDN A 
should be undetectable  
• HIV: HIV antibody should be negative. (HIV 1/ 2 antibody should be negative unless 
positive result is considered false positive by PI)  
• EBV: Negative for anti -EBV VCA IgM antibody  or if anti -EBV VCA IgG antibody  is 
positive, EBV DNA  should be negative . 
• CMV: Negative for anti -CMV IgM antibody or if positive anti-CMV IgG antibody is 
positive, CMV DNA should be negative . [Note: Carriers will be monitored per 
institutional guidelines.]  
Note:  Patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of 
antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti -HBc positive), need to be evaluated for initiation 
of HBV antiviral prophylaxis  and should be closely monitored for HBV reactiva tion.  
  
6.3.1 Assignment of Subject N umber  
All consented subjects who undergo at least one post -consent procedure will be given a 
unique subject number that will be used to identify the subject for all procedures that occur 
prior to enrollment. Each subject wil l be assigned only one subject number. Subject numbers 
must not be re -used for different subjects. Any subject who is screened multiple times will 
retain their original subject number assigned at the initial screening visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 88 6.7 Radiological Evaluations  
Initial disease assessment by tumor imaging (baseline scan) must be performed within 28 
days prior to C1D1. The site investigator /designee  must review radiological images to 
confirm the subject has measurable disease as defined in the inclusion criteria. D isease 
assessments or scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use 
as the screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to 
the first dose of trial treatment.  
 
• PTCL and CTCL patients wi th lymph node/visceral involvement:  
Computed tomography (CT) scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis/neck as appropriate) will be 
performed at screening for disease assessment. PET -CT is preferred for FDG -avid 
lymphomas. Other radiological evaluations (e.g. X -ray/MRI/ USG) will be performed if 
warranted.   
 
• CTCL patients with skin and blood involvement:  
CT scan will be performed at screening for disease assessment.  
o In patients with clinically early  disease (maximum/current T 1-2N0M0B0-1), repeat scans 
should not be per formed except in cases of an objective response (OR) in the skin . 
o In those patients  with more advanced disease at baseline (TNMB > T 1-2N0M0B0-1), CT 
scan should be performed at the time of PR and CR in the skin; any time there is a  
question of new or PD in the lymph nodes or viscera; and at end of study.  
 
6.8 Skin Biopsy  
In CTCL patients, skin biopsy should be taken  at screening, and to confirm a complete 
response. B iopsy should be performed  at the most indurated area if only one biopsy.  Skin 
biopsy will not be done in other patients.  
 
6.9 Skin Photograph  
CTCL patients will have half body  global and up to 5  selected representative index 
lesions  photographed  at screening (baseline), at the time of response (PR/CR/PD) and at 
other time points as required by the PI.   
 
6.10 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of Tenalisib  and its metabolites /Romidepsin 
in the Dose Escalation part of the study at the timepoints indicated in the below table. PK 
will not be performed in Dose Expansion. Blood will be collected, processed and stored at   
-70 °C at the site and shipped to the sponsor’s central bioa nalytical laboratory: NorthEast

negative within the last 6 months) and as indicated to confirm a complete response.  
16. Skin biopsy: In CTCL patients, skin biopsy should be performed at screening, and to confirm a complete response. Historical data of 12 wee ks is 
acceptable.  
17. Radiological scan: In PTCL and CTCL patients with nodal and visceral involvement, PET and “diagnostic quality ” CT scan will be performed at the 
time of screening within 28 days of screening. Following screening, CT scans should be repeated at C3D1 (± 7 days), C5D1 (± 7 days) and C8D1 (± 7 
days) . PET should be done at C3D1 (± 7 days) and to confirm CR .  
18. Skin assessment: In all CTCL patients, mSWAT will be performed at the time of screening within 28 days of screening and at C3D1 (± 7 days), C5D1 
(± 7 days) and C8D1 (± 7 days). Disease response assessment will be performed at C3D1 (± 7 days), C5D1 (± 7 days) and C8D1 (± 7 days) and/ or at 
the EOT or as clinically indicated using mSWAT .  
19. Skin photograph: In CTCL patients, skin lesion  photograph will be taken at screening, at the time of response (PR/CR/PD) and at other time points as 
required by the PI.  
20. Blood will be collected for biomarkers (e.g. sIL2R and CTACK for PTCL; CD30, IL -31 and IL -32 for CTCL).  
21. Tenalisib  will be administered orally twice a day from Day 3 (C1D3) onward in 28-days of cycle for 7 cycles in absence of disease progression or 
toxici ty warranting discontinuation of therapy.  On the day of Romidepsin  administration , the morning dose of  Tenalisib  should be given in clinic one 
hour prior to Romidepsin  infusion.  Tenalisib will be dispensed at the start of each cycle (C1D1, C2D1 , C3D1  …). Only in Cycle 1, Tenalisib will be

22. Romidepsin  will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 4 hours unless progression of disease or toxicity warranting discontinuation of therapy.  
23. All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug should be recorded spanning from the informed consent drug un til 30 calendar days after 
the last dose of study drug.  
24. Post C8D1, patient experiencing clinical benefit with no evident disease p rogression will be given the opportunity to enroll in an open -label 
compassionate use study protocol and will be followed up.  Excluding patients who participate in compassionate use study protocol, a ll other patients 
will undergo the end -of-treatment (EOT)  assessments within 7days after the last dose of study drug or discontinuation  from the study .   
25. Patients should be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after the last dose of study treatment. Telephonic follow up during this period is acceptable. 
All new AEs occurring during this period should be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the opinion of the inves tigator, the adverse event 
or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the  underlying disease.

will be considered as C1D1.  
2. Demographic profile will include age, sex and race.  
3. Detailed history will be taken at screening that includes history of cancer, past history, no of prior therapies and prior me dication (in last 4 weeks); and 
other medical history. Any medical significant history at subsequent visit will be captured as adve rse event.  
4. Vitals will be done prior to the administration of study treatments (Pre -dose and Pre -infusion), during infusion and post -infusion as applicable, at the time 
points specified above.  
• In the first cycle, vitals will be taken prior to the adminis tration of study treatments (15 min before Tenalisib dose and 5 min prior to infusion). During 
the infusion, vitals should be done at every 15 min (± 5 min) during first hour and at every 30 min (± 10 min) for next 3 hou rs and 1 hr (± 15 min) 
post infusion . All time points will be recorded in the CRF.  
• In subsequent cycles, vitals will be done as per the institutional practice. Pre -dose; and Pre - and Post -infusion vitals will be recorded in the CRF.  
• When slowing or re -starting an infusion due to an infusion  reaction, vital signs should be monitored at every 15 minutes or as directed by the 
investigator until the infusion is completed and 15, 30 and 60 min post -infusion and longer if necessary until the subject is stabilized. In such case, 
the event of infusi on reaction should be recorded as an adverse event.  
5. Weight will be measured at all visits. Height to be measured at screening only ; historical data is acceptable.   
6. Physical examination will include lymph node and systemic examination. Complete physical ex amination will be done at screening and EOT visits. At 
other  visits, abbreviated examination (directed physical examination) will be done depending on the assessment of tumor.  Skin biopsy15  X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 88 7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Adverse Events  
The PI is responsible for collecting and reporting adverse events (see Section  7.1.2 ).  It is Sponsor 
responsibility to report relevant SAEs to the applicable regulatory body.  
 
7.1.1 Definitions of Adverse Events   
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavourable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a n investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product.    
 
7.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
All adverse events of any patient during the course of the trial will be reported in the case report 
form, and the investigator will give his or her opinion as to the relationship of the adverse event to 
trial drug treatment (i.e., whether the event is rel ated or unrelated  to trial drug administration).  If 
the adverse event is serious, it should be reported immediately t o Sponsor. Other untoward events 
occurring in the framework of a clinical trial are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur 
prior to assignment of trial treatment that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run -in). 
 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to Tenalisib /Romidepsin , spanning from the 
informed consent  drug until 30 calendar days after the last dose of study drug, discontinuation or 
completion of protocol -specific treatment  as defined by the prot ocol for that patient, are to be 
recorded in the electronic Case Record Form ( eCRF ).  
 
7.1.3 Handling of Adverse Events  
All adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the trial should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization. Patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after the last dose of study 
treatment . All new AEs occurring during this period mus t be reported and followed until resolution 
unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the adverse event or laboratory abnormality/ies are not 
likely to improve because of the underlying disease. In this case, the investigators must record his 
or her reas oning for this decision in the patient’s medical recor d and as a comment on the eCRF. 
After 30 days of completion of protocol -specific treatment or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or 
deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment related are to be repor ted. 
 
7.2 Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Causality Assessment  
Causality is assessing the relationship of the trial treatment to the adverse event. For this study, the 
causality assessment will be categorized as related and not related.  
 
• Related:  All tox icities should be considered to be related to Tenalisib /Romidepsin  unless there 
is a clear alternative explanation.    
• Not related:   If there is no temporal association, or another etiology has been identified as the 
cause, or the trial treatment cannot be implicated based upon the current information.  
 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA  
Amendment 1: 30 November 2018  
Original version : 1 .0, 16 August 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 88 7.3 Serious Adverse Events  
7.3.1 Definitions of Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of serious adverse events (SAEs) are given below. The principal investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the trial is familiar with the content of this section.  
 
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is 
immediately life -threaten ing, requires at least a 24 -hour in -patient hospitalization or prolongation 
of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
The definition of SAE also include s any important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such 
as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These should also usually be con sidered serious. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an e mergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Progression of malignancy (including fatal 
outcomes), if documented by use of approp riate method (for example, as per Lugano 
classification 2014), should not be reported as a serious adverse event.   
 
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“in-patient hospitalization” (although i f any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay in unit or short stay to facilitate PK blood draws  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospice or skilled nursing facility  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respite care facility  
 
Hospitalization during the trial for a pre -planned surgical or medical procedure (one which is  
planned prior to entry in the trial  or planne d in advance and not related to the study procedure/ 
drug), does not require reporting as a serious adverse event to the Sponsor.  
 
7.3.2 SAE Reporting by Investigators  
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the terms are  not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  O n the other hand, a stroke which 
results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, b ut would be 
considered an SAE. Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording 
AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the S AE Report Form.  
 
Adverse events classified by the treating investigator as serious  require expedit ious handling and 
reporting to s ponsor in order to comply with regulatory requirements.  Serious adverse events may

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 88 occur at any time from the signing of the informed consent form through the 30 -day follow -up 
period a fter the last trial treatment. Sponsor/sponsor representative must be notified of all SAEs, 
regardless of causality, within 1 day of the first knowledge of the event by the investigator.   
 
To report an SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information.  All 
SAEs occurring from the signing of consent until 30 calendar days of last trial treatment must be 
reported to the Sponsor as SAEs on the SAE Report and followed until resolution (with autopsy 
report if applicable).  
 
Deaths and other SAEs occurring > 30 calendar days after last trial treatment that are deemed related 
to Tenalisib /Romidepsin  must be reported as SAEs on the SAE Report within 1 day of first 
knowledge o f the event by the treating physician or research personnel (with an autopsy report if 
available).  Deaths occurring > 30 calendar days after last trial treatment and not attributed to trial 
treatment (e.g.,  disease progression) need not be reported as SAEs,  but simply captured on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
 
The SAE Report Form should be sent to the sponsor/sponsor representative via fax or e -mail within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The detailed SAE reporting process will be reviewed 
with sites during the site initiation visit as well as provided on the SAE report itself. Transmission 
of the SAE report should be confirmed by the site personnel submitting the report. Follow -up 
information for SAEs and information on non -serious AEs that become serious sh ould also be 
reported to Sponsor as soon as it is available; these reports should be submitted using the SAE 
Report Form.   
 
Investigators must report SAEs and follow -up information to their responsible IRB/IEC  according 
to the policies of the responsible IRB/IEC . 
 
7.3.3 Sponsor ’s SAE Reporting Requirements  
Sponsor/Sponsor representative  is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to t he competent 
authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance 
with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
 
Sponsor/sponsor representative is responsible for reporting unexpec ted fatal or life -threatening 
events associated with the use of the trial drugs to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities 
via telephone or fax within 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.   
 
The Sponsor will report all related, unex pected SAEs, including non -death/non -life-threatening 
related unexpected SAEs associated with the use of the trial medications to the FDA by a written 
safety report within 15 calendar days of notification. Reporting to the IRB/IEC  will be done 
according to  institutional policy.  
 
7.4 Recording of A E and S AE 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or SAEs on 
the SAE Report Forms and AE eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. All AEs, including 
those that meet SAE rep orting criteria, should be recorded on the AE eCRF; AEs that meet the 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA  
Amendment 1: 30 November 2018  
Original version : 1 .0, 16 August 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 88 definition of an SAE should additionally be reported following the procedures noted in above 
sections.  
 
7.4.1 Diagnosis vs. Signs and  Symptoms  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Coordinating Investigator or designated physician, the AEs constitute components 
of a recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter cas e, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time 
of reporting, each individual e vent should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the 
relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF). If a diagnosis is subsequently established, 
it should be reported as follow -up information is available. If a diagnosis is determined subsequen t 
to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect 
the diagnosis.  
 
7.4.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points. Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the 
AE eCRF, irrespective of severity. ( E.g. If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in 
severity, it should be recorded once with highest grade of severity on a SAE Report Form and/or 
AE eCRF).   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent events  should be recorded separately on an SAE Report Form 
and/or AE  eCRF.  
 
7.4.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Any grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities or any clinically significant grade 1 or 2 hematology or 
biochemistry laboratory value(s) should be recorded as an AE. Isolated laboratory abnormality 
without clinical significance should not be captured as AE if confirmed by the investigator. If an 
abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign 
or symptom should be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should 
be considered addit ional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF. If the laboratory 
abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE 
Report Form or AE eCRF.  
 
7.4.4 Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specif ied AE reporting period that are attributed by the 
investigator solely to progression of disease will be recorded on the “Trial Discontinuation” eCRF  
and should not be reported as a SAE . All other on- trial deaths, regardless of attribution, will be 
recorded on an SAE Report and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor.  
 
When recording a serious adverse event with an outcome of death, the event or condition that 
caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should  be recorded as the single medical concept on the

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 88 7.4.5 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization of >24 hours or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as an SAE unless specifically instruc ted otherwise in this protocol. There 
are some hospitalization scenario s that do not require reporting as an SAE when there is no 
occurrence of an AE. (See  section 7.3 )  
 
7.4.6 Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the trial.  Such cond itions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF. A pre -existing medical condition should 
be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens 
during the trial. When recording such events on an SAE  Report Form and/or AE  eCRF, it is 
important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by including applicable 
descript ion. 
 
7.4.7 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/ Congenital Anomalies  
Pregnancy, abortion, birth defects, and congenital anomalies are events of special interest.  Please 
refer to pregnancy Section  7.5.1  for specific instructions.  
 
7.4.8 New Cancers  
The development of a new primary cancer should be re garded as an AE and will generally meet at 
least one of the serious criteria. New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for 
the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion  of the patient into 
the study.  They do not include new lesions of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the 
new lesions itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease 
progression.  
 
7.4.9 Lack of Efficacy  
When there is deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment is being used, there may 
be uncertainty as to whether thi s is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such cases, unless the sponsor or 
reporting physician considers the study treatment contributed to the deterioration of the condition, 
the deterioration should be considered lack of efficacy and not an AE.  
 
7.5 Protocol -Defined Events of Special Interest  
The following are events of special interest, and will need to be reported expeditiously.  
 
7.5.1 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth defects/ Congenital anomalies  
Female patients who are not of child -bearing potential (see  Appendix B ) and female patients of 
child -bearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test within 72  hours prior to  C1D1 are 
eligible for the study. F emale patients of child -bearing potential (see  Appendix B )), and all male 
partners must consent to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the study 
period and for 4 weeks  after the last dose of Tenalisib . An approved barrier method of contraception 
must be discussed with the investigator and documented in source note .    
 
During the course of the trial, all female patients of childbearing potential and pregnant partner of 
male subjects must contact the treating investigator immediately if they suspect that they may be 
pregnant (a missed or late menstrual period should be reported to the treating investigator).   
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA  
Amendment 1: 30 November 2018  
Original version : 1 .0, 16 August 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 88  
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant pr ior to administration of trial drug(s), 
the trial drug(s) must be withheld until the result of t he pregnancy test is confirmed.  If a pregnancy 
is confirmed, the patient must not receive any trial drug(s), and must be discontinued from the trial. 
The outcom e of the pregnancy will be monitored as outlined in Appendix B . 
 
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant after the patient has been receiving trial 
drug(s), the trial drug(s) must immediately be withheld until th e result of t he pregnancy test is 
confirmed. If a pregnancy is confirmed, the trial drug(s) must be immediately and permanently 
stopped, the patient must be discontinued from the trial, and the investigator must notify the 
Medical Monitor and Sponsor Repre sentative as soon as possible. If a patient becomes pregnant 
while enrolled in the trial, a Pregnancy Form should be completed and faxed to the Sponsor.  The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be monitored as outlined in Appendix B . 
    
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always  meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously descri bed process for SAE reporting. A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to reflect 
the outcome of the pregnancy.  
 
7.5.2 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as accidental or intentional administration of any dose of product that is 
considered both excessive and medically important. For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be 
defined as any dose exceeding the proposed dose of Tenalisi b (e.g. > 400 mg in first coho rt) and/or 
prescribed dose for Romidepsin .   
 
Symptomatic and non -symptomatic overdose must be reported in the CRF.  Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the trial treatment that is symptomatic, even if not fulfilling a  seriousness 
criterion, is to be reported to the Sponsor immediately as an AE . All symptomatic overdose, 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion, is to be reported as an SAE as per the SAE reporting procedure.  
For patients who experience overdose, treatment sho uld consist of supportive  therapy.  A decision 
to interrupt treatment or dose reduction to be taken depending on the symptoms.  
 
7.6  Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
All toxicities should be considered to be related to either Tenalisib / Romidepsin  combination or 
to either Tenalisib  or Romidepsin  individually unless there is a clear alternative explanation.  
Toxicity will be considered dose -limiting if it occurs during the first cycle (2 8 days) treatment 
and is considered related to the combination . Toxicity will be assessed utilizing the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0. Dose -
limiting toxicities are defined as the following:  
 
7.6.1 Hematological DLTs  
• Grade 4 neutropenia that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 3 within 14 days with supportive treatment 
(e.g. growth factors) OR Grade ≥3 Febrile neutropenia (ANC <1000/µL with fever >38.5ºC 
[101ºF] that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 14 days with supportive  treatment.  
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA  
Amendment 1: 30 November 2018  
Original version : 1 .0, 16 August 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 88 • Grade 4 thrombocytopenia that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 3  within 14 days with supportive 
treatment OR Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia associated with Grade >2 bleeding that does not 
resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 14 days with supportive treatment.  
 
7.6.2 Non-Hematological DLTs  
• Grade ≥3 non -hematologic toxicity  that could not be controlled or prevented by supportive care  
including corticosteroid s with exception of:  
• Grade ≥3 ALT/AST elevation that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 14 days;  
• Grade ≥3 diarrhea that improves ≤ Grade 2 within 48 hours or Grade ≥3 diarrhea in patients 
who have not received optimal treatment with anti -diarrhoeal drug s.  
• Grade ≥3 vomiting in patients who have not received the highest therapeutic dose of 
antiemetics (e.g. steroids, 5HT3 antagonists, prochlorperazine, lorazepam)  
• Single episode of Grade ≥3 infusion reaction.  
• Grade 3 nausea, Grade 3 asthenia  or Grade 2 alopecia .  
• Treatment delay of ≥14 days due to unresolved toxicity.  
Adverse events meeting the above def initions but unrelated to study drug  will not be considered 
DLTs. In some instances  (e.g. in case of pre -existent Grade 2 toxicity) , an event may fall within 
the protocol definition of a DLT but will not be considered a DLT (i.e., not clinically 
meaningful/significant or relevant to the combination). In such cases, the SRC will thoroughly 
review the event, supporting data, and the reasons for not considering the event a DLT will be 
clearly documented with supporting rationale. Conversely, other ev ents which do not meet the 
definition of a DLT but are concerning to the SRC may be considered as DLTs.  
 
7.6.3 Determination of Dose-limiting toxicity  
The patient population used for determination of MTD will consist of patients who have met the 
minimum safety e valuation requirements of the study, and/or who have experienced a DLT. The 
data of at least 3 patients will be required for DLT assessment.  
• DLT assessment period will be 2 8-days (inclusive) (will begin on C1D1 and end on C2D1), 
unless extended by the medical monitor.  
• Patients must have been treated with at least 2 doses of Romidepsin  and minimum 14 days 
with Tenalisib  in the first cycle to be considered eligible for safety assessment unless 
identified to have a DLT.  
• Patients experienc ing DLT after initiating combination will be considered evaluable 
regardless of the number of doses received  (Please note Romidepsin alone will be 
administered on  Day 1, therefore patient will not be considered for MTD assessment if  
patient develop s DLT on these days) .  
If a patient withdraw s from the study during Cycle 1 due to any reason other than DLT (e.g. 
disease progression or consent withdrawal) and does not  meet the minimum requirements for 
inclusion in the MTD -determining population described above  will be replaced.   
 
7.6.4 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The MTD is the highest dose of the combination at which 0 of 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients  
experience a DLT during 1  cycle (2 8 days) of therapy. If 2 or more patients in a dosing group 
experience a DLT, the MTD has been exceeded.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 88 7.7  Dose Modifications  
All dose modifications are graded by the CTCAE v 5.0.  
Note:  If cytopenia events are deemed related to the underl ying disease rather than either 
Tenalisib  or Romidepsin , dose reduction will be done as per the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients who experience either a DLT or an adverse event meeting DLT criteria (that occurs after 
the DLT assessment window) will be allowed to delay dosing in order to recover from the toxicity. 
Patients may resume Tenalisib , provided that the toxicity has  resolved to Grade ≤2 or baseline. If 
study drug is delayed >2 weeks due to drug toxicity , treatment initiation should be discussed and 
agreed with the Medical Monitor . 
 
Dose reductions will be permanent.  A dose re -escalation are not permitted for patients  who 
previously had a dose reduction. Holidays from study drug are discouraged. Any patient in whom 
similar toxicity recurs at the reduced dose should be discontinued from further Tenalisib  treatment. 
Note: In e xception al case, a patient may be allowed fol lowing a careful assessment of benefit and 
risk by the investigator and with approval from the Medical Monitor.  
 
7.7.1 Criteria for Re-Starting Tenalisib  after Drug toxicity  
Treatment continu ation in the study is at the discretion of the treating Investigator. In the absence 
of unacceptable toxicities or disease progression, patients may continue treatment with Tenalisib  
as long as:  
• Absolute neutrophil count has returned to baseline, or >750/µL.  Platelet count is >50,000/µL.  
• Recovered from grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicity to grade 2 or baseline (excluding 
alopecia). Treatment may be delayed for up to 2 weeks to recover from toxicity.  
• No clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression.  
• If treatment is  delayed > 2 weeks  due to toxicity , because of an adverse event,  treatment 
initiation should be discussed and agreed with the Medical Monitor.  
 
7.7.2 Dose modifications  
The dose modification guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines 
the events to be related to either one of the investigational product .  
• In case the investigator determines the events to be related to Romidepsin , Tenalisib  can be 
continued depending on toxicity at discretion  of investigator.  
• Similarly, i n case the investigator determines the events to be related to  Tenalisib , 
Romidepsin  can be continued depending on toxicity at discretion  of investigator.  
• In case the event is possibly related to Romidepsin  as well as Tenalisib , the most conservative 
approach  of dose modification should be used.

7.7.3 Romidepsin  Dose Modifications  
If toxicity, in the opinion of the investigator, is attributable to Romidepsin, the guideline for 
Romidepsin dose modification should be followed. Final discretion is with the treating investigator 
in regards to aggressive dose reductions, as well as the n umber of dose reductions.  
 
7.7.3.1  Hematologic Toxicity  
• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia: Treatment with romidepsin should be delayed 
until the specific cytopenia returns to ANC ≥1.5×109/L and platelet count ≥75×109/L or 
baseline, then therapy may be restarted at same dose . 
• Grade 4 febrile (≥ 38.5ºC) neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that requires platelet transfusion: 
Treatment with romidepsin should be delayed until the specific cytopenia returns to ≤ Grade 1 
or baseline, and then the dose should be pe rmanently reduced to 10 mg/m2 or lower dose . 
 
7.7.3.2  Non-Hematologic Toxicities  
Nonhematologic toxicities except alopecia  
• Grade 2 or 3 toxicity: Treatment with romidepsin should be delayed until toxicity returns to ≤ 
Grade 1 or baseline, then therapy may be restarted at same dose. If Grade 3 toxicity recurs, 
treatment with romidepsin should be delayed until toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and 
the dose should be permanently reduced to 10 mg/m2 or lower.  
• Grade 4 toxicity: Treatment with romidepsin sh ould be delayed until toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 
1 or baseline, then the dose should be permanently reduced to 10 mg/m2 or lower dose.  
• Romidepsin should be discontinued if Grade 3 or 4 toxicities recur after dose reduction.  
 
 
8 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
8.1 Specification of the Efficacy Parameters  
Evaluable for objective response:  Patients who have had a pre -treatment baseline efficacy 
evaluation and at least one post -treatment efficacy evaluation will be considered evaluable for 
response. “Investig ator assessed response”  will be used in the study. These patients will have 
their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
 
Disease parameters:  
• Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured 
in at least two dimensions with conventional techniques (PET/CT, MRI, x -ray) or a s >1.5 cm 
with spiral CT scan. All tumor measurements should be recorded in centimeters.   
 
• Non-measur able disease (evaluable disease):  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including 
small lesions, (<1 cm using spiral CT scan) are considered non -measurable disease. Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangiti s, and cystic 
lesions are all non -measurable.  
  
• Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 6 lesions total, representative of all 
involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA  
Amendment 1: 30 November 2018  
Original version : 1 .0, 16 August 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 88 Target lesions s hould be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest SPD 
diameter), and the highest SUV avidity (high SUV lesions may be prioritized even if not the 
largest lesions, and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imag ing 
techniques or clinically). A baseline sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. The baseline sum of the diameters will be use d as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
• Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 6 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presenc e, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
Evaluation of best objective r esponse: The best objective response is the best response recorded 
from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence .  
 
8.2 Response Evaluations and Measurements  
In all patients (PTCL and CTCL), the response will be assessed approximately at 8 weeks interval 
for the first two assessments [(e.g. C3D1 (± 7 days), C5D1 (± 7 days) ] and then at C8D1 (± 7 da ys) 
and/ or at the EOT  or as clinically indicated (if clinical progression is suspected).  
 
• PTCL  
PTCL patients will be evaluated according to Lugano classification Cheson 2014 )[16] (Appendix C) 
using the CT scan. PET -CT will be preferred for FDG -avid lymphomas.  The modality chosen 
should be the same through out the duration of the study. In addition, PET-CT will be performed  at 
C3D1 (± 7 days) and to confirm C R. If PET and CT scan at Screening are negative for disease 
involvement in the neck, subsequent CT scans may not include neck. If PET and CT scans at 
Screening are positive for disease involvement of the neck, subsequent CT scans must include neck. 
Disease as sessments and imaging should not be delayed for delays in cycle starts.   Disease 
assessments and imaging should be continued until documented disease progression, the start of 
new anti -cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study , whichever occurs 
first.  
 
Each participating site will be responsible for radiological review and confirmation of response as 
per standard efficacy guidelines. The frequency outlined is the minimum required for study 
participation. Patients who progress according to the corresponding criteria will receive no further 
treatment. Patients who respond to the treatment (i.e., CR, PR or SD) may remain on trial. All 
disease specific assessments are to be completed as applicable to disease type.  
 
• CTCL:  
CTCL pat ients will be evaluated as per modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT)  
(Appendix F ). [17]  Additionally, CT scan will be done  in the CTCL  patients with lymph node and 
viscera l involvement . CTCL patients with subcutaneous lesions which cannot be measured by 
mSWAT will be assessed  by change in PET -CT avid lesions.  Bone marrow biopsy will be 
performed in patients with B2 blood involvement.  In these patients, Sezary cell count will be 
quantified by flow cytometry or morphology in blood/bone marrow.  
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA

In CTCL patients with other than presumed stage IA disease, or selected patients with limited T2 
disease and the absence of adenopathy or blood involvement, CT scans of chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis alone ± FDG -PET scan will be done to further evaluate any po tential lymphadenopathy, 
visceral involvement, or abnormal laboratory tests. MRI may be substituted if clinically indicated.  
 
9 STATISTICAL METHOD AND CONSIDERATIONS   
This section describes the statistical methods to be used to analyze efficacy and safety. These 
methods may be revised and updated due to reasons such as regulatory requirements or need for 
further clarifications. The final analysis plan will be documented in a formal statistical analysis 
plan (SAP) that must be finalized before databas e lock. The SAP will include details on how 
variables will be derived, how missing data will be handled, and how data will be presented as well 
as the details on statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy analyses. The final clinical 
study repo rt will discuss deviations from the SAP, if any.  
 
9.1 General Considerations  
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical analyses will be performed using a two -sided hypothesis test 
at the overall 5% level of significance.  The primary efficacy endpoint for the P hase II trial will be 
evaluated at a one -sided 5% level.  No adjustment for Type I error rate will be required because 
the study has only one primary endpoint with one comparison.  P -values will be rounded to three 
decimal places.  If a p -value is less tha n 0.001 it will be reported as “<0.001”.  
 
Continuous data will be described using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, median, 
minimum and maximum. Data will be displayed in all listings sorted by phase, group and patient 
number.  When count data are presented, the percentage will be suppressed when the count is zero 
in order to draw attention to the non -zero counts.  A row denoted “Missing” will be included in 
count tabulations where necessary to account for dropouts and m issing values.  Unless otherwise 
specified, the denominator for percentages will be the number of patients with a non -missing 
assessment in a given treatment group within the analysis population of interest.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using  SAS 9.1 or higher.  
 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size  
Part 1:  In Dose Escalation, three patients per cohort are considered appropriate for the assessment 
of overall safety and tolerability and for providing adequate confidence for dose escalation. No 
formal sa mple size and power analysis is done. Accordingly, total 2 -18 patients will be enrolled in 
3 escalating cohorts unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ optimal dose. Optimal 
dose will be determined by the SRC.  
 
Part 2:  Total 24 patients with relapsed/refractory TCL will be enrolled in two groups (12 patients 
in each group). Twelve patients per group is considered appropriate for assessment of preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of the combination.  However, t he SRC may modify the sample size du e to 
unforeseen clinical situations.  
 
9.3 Study Population  
The following 3 analysis populations are planned for this study:

population and will include data from all patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication and provide at least 1 post -baseline efficacy assessment.  
• Per-Protocol  (PP) Population: the PP Population is a subset of the modified Intent -to-Treat 
Population and will include patients without major protocol deviations.  
• Safety Population: The Safety Population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 
dose of the s tudy drug.  
Membership in the analysis populations will be determined before database lock.  
 
9.4 Statistical Analysis  
9.4.1 Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.  
 
9.4.2 Safety Analyses  
The safety endpoints will include:  
• Incidence of DLTs   
• Incidence of AEs and related AEs  
• Incidence of grade 3  and grade 4 AEs   
• Incidence of SAEs  and death

review and approval of the trial.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements 
currently required by the regulatory authorit ies or state regulations and national require ments.  
Translation of the informed consent form is allowed if necessary.  
 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the trial. Once the essential information has been provided to the pr ospective 
candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications of 
participating in this trial, the candidate will be asked to give consent to participate in the trial by 
signing an informed consent form. A notation that written informed consent has been obtained will 
be made in  the patient’s medical record. A copy of the signed informed consent form will  be 
provided by the investigator to the patient.   
 
If an amendment to th e protocol substantially alters the trial design or the potential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s re-consent to continue participation in the trial should be obtained.  
 
10.6   Confidentiality

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 88 In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, 
by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e.,  that the patient is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled trial period.  
 
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of 21 CFR, it is a requirement that 
the investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of Sponsor, the regul atory 
authorities and the IRB/IEC  direct access to review the patient’s original medical records at the site 
for verification of trial -related procedures and data.  
 
Measures to protect confidentiality include  mentioning of only a unique trial number and i nitials 
will identify patients on the CRF or other documents that will be submitted to Rhizen . This 
information, together with the patient’s date of birth, will be used in the database for patient 
identification. Patient names or addresses will not be ente red in the CRF or database. No material 
bearing a patient’s name will be kept on file by Sponsor. Patients will be informed of their rights 
within the ICF.   
 
10.6.2  Investigator’s Responsibilities  
Medical supervision is the responsibility of the Principal Investi gator named on the FDA Form 
1572 /country specific forms . The Investigator may delegate day -to-day activities to a sub -
investigator listed on these forms but retains overall responsibility for ensuring that the study is 
conducted properly and in accordance with the study protocol.   The Investigator is required to 
provide the Sponsor with his/her own CV and applicable licensure, as well as those of the personnel 
assuming significant responsibility in the study (e.g., sub -investigators).  The Investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that the study is conducted according to applicable health authorities ( e.g. 
FDA), sound medical practices, and in compliance with applicable regulations ( e.g. 21 CFR, ICH).

application has not been approved by FDA /health authority , for no less than 2 years after the last 
shipment / delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA /health authority  
has been notified of the discontinuation.  
 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or from the Sponsor or its 
representative, the investigator additionally  agrees to keep records, including the identity of all 
participating patients (sufficient information to link records e.g., eCRFs and medical records), all 
original, signed informed consent forms, and copies of all eCRFs, SAE Reporting forms, source 
docume nts, detailed records of treatment disposition, and related essential regulatory 
documents.   The documents listed above must be retained by the investigator for as long as needed 
to comply with national and international regulations (generally 2 years afte r discontinuing clinical 
development or after the last marketing approval).   Sponsor will notify the 
investigator(s)/institutions(s) when the trial -related records are no longer required.   
 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdra ws from the trial, both site and sponsor 
should be prospectively notified.  The trial records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, 
such as another investigator, another institution, or to sponsor.  The investigator must obtain the 
sponsor written  permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have 
been met.  All trial files will be maintained by the Sponsor/Sponsor Representative/CRO 
throughout the trial, and will be transferred to the Sponsor at the conclusion of the t rial. 
 
12.1   Data Collection  
The data will be captured in electronic Case Record Form (eCRF) via an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system. The eCRF is clinical trials data management tool that provides investigational sites 
a standardized and validated, remote,  electronic data capture system for the collection of clinical 
trial data.  All data requested on the eCRF must be supported by and be consistent with the patient’s 
source documentation. All missing data must be explained. When a required laboratory test, 
assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the eCRF,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 88 Appendix B: Contraceptive Guidelines and Pregnancy  
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are defined as Follows  
Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age 
appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous a menorrhea with 
serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow u p hormone level assessment 
is she considered not of child bearing potential.  
Contraceptive Guidelines for Women of Child -Bearing Potential  
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highl y effective contraception during the study and for 5 T1/2 (48 hrs) plus 
an additional 4 weeks after stopping treatment . The highly effective contraception is defined as 
either:  
1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of  the subject. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
2. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or 
tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level 
assessment.  
3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the  
absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the sole partner for that patient.  
4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):  
a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
b. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or   
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.  
The following are unacceptable  forms of contraception for women of childbearing potential:  
• Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as Tenalisib  
may potentially decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.  
• IUD progesterone T  
• Female condom  
• Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield  
 
Women of child -bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test ≤ 72 
hours prior to initiating treatment.

  Fertile Males  
Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring must use 
condom during treatment, plus additional 12 weeks after stopping treatment  and should not 
father a child in this period.   
Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study treatment must be reported to 
Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should 
be followed up for 3 months after the termination of the pregnancy to determine outcome , 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the 
mother.  
Pregnancy is not considered a SAE. Initial and follow up information should be recorded on a 
Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigato r to Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA. 
Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of 
the possible relationship to the investigational drugs to any pregnancy outcome  will also be 
captured on the pregnancy form . Any SAE  experienced during pregnancy must be reported on 
the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should  be obtained from the mother.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 88 * A score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at the  time of an 
interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider 
a score of 3 as inadequate responses  (to avoid under treatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest 
dominant n odes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes 
should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and 
retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions incl ude those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI 
involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. Non measured lesions: Any disease not selected as 
measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considere d not measured. These sites include 
any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the 
requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is  any 
site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural 
effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed by imagi ng. In Waldeyer's ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone marrow), 
FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response, but should be no higher 
than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activa tion as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid 
growth factors).  
† PET 5PS: 1, no uptake above background; 2, uptake ≤ mediastinum; 3, uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 4, 
uptake moderately > liver; 5, uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions; X, new areas of uptake unlikely 
to be related to lymphoma.

 Recommended evaluation/initial staging of the patient with MF/Sézary syndrome  
 
Complete physical examination including  
• Determination of type(s) of skin lesions  
o If only patch/plaque disease or erythroderma, then estimate percentage of body surface area involved 
and note any ulceration of lesions  
o If tumors are present, determine total number of lesions, aggregate volume, largest size lesion, and 
regions of the body involved  
• Identification of any palpable lymph node, especially those >1.5 cm in largest diameter or firm, 
irregular, clustered, or fixed  
• Identification of any organomegaly  
 
Skin biopsy  
• Most indurated area if only one biopsy  
• Immunophenotyping to include at least the following markers: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, 
and a B -cell marker such as CD20. CD30 may also be indicated in cases where lymphomatoid 
papulosis, anaplastic lymphoma, or l arge-cell transformation is considered.  
• Evaluation for clonality of TCR gene rearrangement  
 
Blood tests  
• CBC with manual differential, liver function tests, LDH, comprehensive chemistries  
• TCR gene rearrangement and relatedness to any clone in skin  
• Analysis for abnormal lymphocytes by either Sézary cell count with determination absolute number 
of Sézary cells and/or flow cytometry (including CD4+/CD7 - or CD4+/CD26 -) 
 
Radiologic tests  
• In patients with T1N0B0stage disease who are otherwise healthy and without c omplaints directed to a 
specific organ system, and in selected patients with T2N0B0disease  
• with limited skin involvement, radiologic studies may be limited to a chest X -ray or ultrasound of the 
peripheral nodal groups to corroborate absence of adenopathy  
• In all patients with other than presumed stage IA disease, or selected patients with limited T2  disease 
and the absence of adenopathy or blood involvement, CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
alone±FDG -PET scan are recommended to further eval uate any potential lymphadenopathy, visceral 
involvement, or abnormal laboratory tests. In patients unable to safely undergo CT scans, MRI may 
be substituted.  
 
Lymph node biopsy  
• Excisional biopsy is indicated in those patients with a node that is either ≥ 1.5 cm in diameter and/or 
is firm, irregular, clustered, or fixed  
• Site of biopsy  
o Preference is given to the largest lymph node draining an involved area of the skin or if FDG -PET 
scan data are available, the node with highest standardized uptake value (SUV ). 
o If there is no additional imaging information and multiple nodes are enlarged and otherwise equal in 
size or consistency, the order of preference is cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas.  
• Analysis: pathologic assessment by light microscopy, flow cytome try, and TCR gene rearrangement.

Stage I  
Either of the following means the disease is stage I:  
• The lymphoma is in only 1 lymph node area or lymphoid organ such as the thymus 
(I). 
• The cancer is found only in 1 area of a single organ outside of the lymph system 
(IE). 
 
Stage II  
Either of the following means the disease is stage II: 
• The lymphoma is in 2 or more groups of lymph nodes on the same side of (above 
or below) the diaphragm (the thin band of muscle that separates the chest and 
abdomen). For example, this might include nodes in the underarm and neck area 
but not the combin ation of underarm and groin nodes (II).  
• The lymphoma extends from a single group of lymph node(s) into a nearby organ 
(IIE). It may also affect other groups of lymph nodes on the same side of the 
diaphragm.  
 
Stage III  
Either of the following means the dise ase is stage III:  
• The lymphoma is found in lymph node areas on both sides of (above and below) 
the diaphragm.  
• The cancer may also have spread into an area or organ next to the lymph nodes 
(IIIE), into the spleen (IIIS), or both (IIISE).  
 
Stage IV  
Either of  the following means the disease is stage IV:  
• The lymphoma has spread outside of the lymph system into an organ that is not 
right next to an involved node.  
• The lymphoma has spread to the bone marrow, liver, brain or spinal cord, or the 
pleura (thin lining of the lungs).  
Other modifiers may also be used to describe the lymphoma stage:

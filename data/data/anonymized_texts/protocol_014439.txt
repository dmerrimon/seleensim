1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Nerve block with liposomal bupivacaine yields fewer complications and 
similar pain relief when compared to an interscalene catheter for 
arthroscopic shoulder surgery: a randomized controlled trial  
Study Description : This is a  blinded, randomize d controlled trial to compare the control arm 
(continuous ropivacaine ISC) to the experimental arm (single -injection, 
brachial plexus nerve block using liposomal bupivacaine) in patients 
underg oing outpatient arthroscopic shoulder surgery  at a single, tertiary 
academic institution . 
Objectives:  
 • Compare complication rates  
• Compare pain level, dose freque ncy of prescribed opioid analgesics, 
consumption of prescribed nonopioid analgesics, quantity and quality of 
sleep, and overall satisfaction with pain control  
• Compare patient -reported outcome measures  
Endpoint s: • Patient reported complications on post -op day 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4  
• Visual Analog Scale, prescribed opioid analgesic dose frequency, 
consumption of prescribed nonopioid analgesics, hours of 
uninterrupted sleep, subjective quality of sleep (0 -10 scale), and 
pain control overall satisfaction (five -point Likert scale) on post -op 
day 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4  
• Visual Analog Scale, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, 
American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder 
Assessment Form, and Penn Shoulder Score at 12 w eeks post -op

  2 Description of Study  
Intervention : Patients in the ISC arm will have a 19 gauge  Arrow Continuous Nerve Catheter 
(Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) placed with a bolus of 15 -20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine 
given through the needle prior to threading the catheter. An elastomeric, basal -
only, On -Q infusion pump (Avanos Medical, Alpharetta, GA, USA) w ith 0.2% 
ropivacaine will be started in the post -anesthesia care unit at 8 mL/hour, and the 
catheter will be removed by the patient after two days. For patients in the LB arm, 
10 mL (133 mg) of liposomal bupivacaine (Pacira BioSciences, Parsippany, NJ, USA )

  3 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Following orthopedic surgery, patients frequently experience pain and discomfort. Multiple methods of regional 
anesthesia are available; however, the optimal technique to adequately manage pain while minimizing 
complications remains under investigation in a rthroscopic shoulder surgery.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
After orthopaedic surgery, patients experience exquisite levels of pain due to the large, invasive and disruptive 
procedures performed on the musculoskeletal system.  Perioperative and post -operative pain manageme nt has 
traditionally involved regional anesthesia, utilizing sodium -channel blockers such as bupivacaine or ropivacaine.  
However, their short -acting nature requires continuous infusion via an implanted catheter that remains in place for 
48-72 hours.  This  catheter is undesirable because it can become dislodged, requires the patient to manage it, as 
well as return days after surgery for removal.  
A modified form of bupivacaine that is bound to lipid (liposomal bupivacaine) has been shown to have a much 
long er duration of action than the traditional sodium channel blockers1.  It is long enough that it could cover the 
same duration of pain as an implanted catheter and has generated interest in its potential use to control 
postoperative pain.  Among patients un dergoing total shoulder replacement, liposomal bupivacaine has shown to 
be non -inferior to standard catheter treatment2-6, but there is a paucity of information on its use in rotator cuff 
repair7.  This study is meant to investigate the use of liposomal bu pivacaine after arthroscopic shoulder surgery as 
compared to standard, catheter -infused ropivacaine.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
Risks are no different than that of routine multi -modal pain control. This includes inadequate pain control, nausea, 
vomiting, opioid addiction, infection, headache, respiratory depression, opioid addiction, hypotension, sedation, 
ileus, constipation, dry mouth, and gastric ulcers.  
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
The benefits of liposomal bupivacaine include  potentially increased pain control, decreased narcotic use, and 
decreased catheter -associated complications including knotting and falling out. If it shows either superiority or 
even non -inferiority to the routine multi -modal pain management, its addition  will potentially decrease adverse 
outcomes of current procedures.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
 Patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery were prospectively assessed after randomization into either 
ropivacaine  ISC or single -injection liposomal bupivacaine brachial plexus nerve block (LB) arms. All patients were 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  4 discharged with 5 analgesics  (acetaminophen, methocarbamol, gabapentin, acetylsalicylic acid, and oxycodone) for 
as-needed pain relief. Preoperatively, p atient demographics  and baseline Visual Analog Scale, Single Assessment 
Numeric Evaluation, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and  Penn Shoulder Scores were obtained. For the 
first four days postoperatively, complication rates (nausea, dyspnea, anesthet ic site discomfort  and/or irritation 
and/or leakage, and self -reported concerns and complications), pain, medication usage, and sleep data were 
assessed  by phone survey every 12 hours. The primary outcome was overall complication rate. At 12 weeks 
postoper atively, Visual Analog Scale,  Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons, and Penn scores were reassessed. Outcome scores  were compared with Mann -Whitney U tests, and 
demographics were compared with chi -squared tests. Signif icance was set at P <.05  
 
3.2 END OF STUDY DEFINITION  
 
At 12 weeks postop patients will have ASES, SANE, and Penn shoulder scores calculated.  This will 
conclude their participation in the study.

6 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND SUBJECT  
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
6.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
If the subject experiences adverse effects of study intervention, the int ervention will be withdrawn 
immediately.  
 
6.2 SUBJECT  DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Subject s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at an y time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a subject  from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
subject  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are rando mized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and 
receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the 
study, will not be replaced.  
6.3 LOST TO FOLLOW -UP 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for 2 scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contacted by the study site  staff .  
 
The following actions must be taken if a subject  fails to be available f or a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact the subject  and reschedule the missed visit and counsel the 
subject  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the subject  
wishes to and/or should continue in th e study.  
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every effort 
to regain contact with the subject  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified 
letter to the subject ’s last known mailing addre ss or local equivalent methods). These contact 
attempts should be documented in the subject ’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the subject  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
 
 
7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  6 7.1 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 
• twice -daily phone calls for the first 4 days post -surgery  
 
At each phone call,  the following surveys will be performed:  
• Medication Intake Survey  
o Since the last phone call: 
▪ Which medications have been consumed?  
▪ How many pills?  
• Pain Survey  
o On a scale of 1 -10, with 10 being the worst, what is your pain right now?  
• Sleep Quality Survey  
o On a scale of 0 -5, with 5 being the best, how was your sleep last night?  
o How many hours were you able to sleep before being interrupted by pain?  
 
7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
   
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether  or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
7.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE)  is considered “serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  (of note, the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of t he event , rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) 
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may je opardize the 
subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
7.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
7.2.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AE s), the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  7 • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functi oning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.   Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to  “serious .” 
 
7.2.3.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by the clinician who 
examines and evaluates the subject  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the st udy intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationshi p between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset , or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
7.2.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
7.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reac tions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by t hose with the 
training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Chan ges in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode.  
 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  8 The Study Coordin ator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the Study Coordinator  will in quire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
 
7.2.5  ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the IRB according t o regulatory requirement s. The 
Principal Investigator  will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event, whether or not 
considered study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or package insert  and must 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility th at the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study interventio n and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator  deems the  event to be chronic or the subject  is stable. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
7.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
7.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedur es involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
7.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems (UP s) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
numbe r; 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  9 • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective acti ons that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAE s) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working  days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
 
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): Postoperative Pain Scores  
 
 
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  Postoperative Oral Morphine Equivalents , Analgesia 
Satisfaction, Analgesia Complications, Sleep Quality, and Hours of Painless Sleep  
 
 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
A po wer analysis was conducted at 0.8 with an alpha of  0.05, using liposomal bupivacaine and ISC 
complication rates  calculated from prior literature.  
 
 
8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for  Macintosh, version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, 
NY, USA). Prior to  study arm comparison, a Shapiro -Wilk test was performed, which  indicated non -
normally distributed data.  
Patient age,  BMI, operative time, perioperative pain scores, medication consumption,  duration and 
quality of slee p, satisfaction, and preoperative  and postoperative PROMs (VAS, SANE, ASES, and PSS)  
were compared using Mann -Whitney U tests.  
Additional patient demographics, including gender, smokable tobacco consumption, intraoperative 
complications, ASA classification , CCI scores, surgical procedures, and 6 perioperative complications 
(nausea,  dyspnea, anesthetic site discomfort and/or irritation and/or  leakage, and self -reported 
complications), were compared with chi -squared tests. Graded measures, such as anesthetic site 
discomfort and irritation, were dichotomized based on severity, into ‘‘none -to-mild’’ and ‘‘moderate -to-
severe’’ categories for analysis. Statistical significance was set to P < .05.

  10 9.1 REGULATOR Y, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
9.1.1.1  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO SUBJECT S 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
subject  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to conducting study screening 
procedures . A separate screening consent form will not be used.  
 
9.1.1.2  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the subject  will be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject  and answer any questions that may arise. A 
verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  subject ’s comprehension of the purposes, 
proc edures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research subject s.  Subject s will have 
the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The 
subject s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about 
it prior to agreeing to participate. The subject  will sign the informed consent document prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study.  Subject s must be informed that participation is 
voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the 
informed consent document will be given to the subject s for their records. The informed consent 
process will be condu cted and  documented in the source document (including the date), and the form 
signed, before the subject  undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights and welfare of the 
subject s will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medi cal care will not be 
adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
9.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, docume nting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by the suspending or terminating party to regulatory authorities.  If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study subjec ts and the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study 
subject s will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or  suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subject s 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that  the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility

  11 9.1.3  CONFIDENTIALITY  AND PRIVACY   
Subject  confidentiality  and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators  and their 
staff. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict confidence. No info rmation concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Principal Investigator .  
 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
 
Representative s of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) may inspect all documents and records required 
to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or 
hospital) and pharmacy records for the subject s in this study. T he clinical study site will permit access to 
such records.  
 
The study subject ’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as 
long a period as dictated by the reviewing  IRB and/or  Institut ional policies . 
 
Study subject  research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be 
stored at the UAB Department of Otolaryngology research office . This will not include the subject ’s 
contact or identifying informa tion. Rather, individual subject s and their research data will be identified 
by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by 
research staff will be secured and password protected.  
 
9.1.4  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND Q UALITY CONTROL  
The site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, documentation and 
completion.  Quality control ( QC) procedures will be completed by the Data Manager during data entry 
into the appropriate CRF . Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the Study 
Coordinator  for clarification/resolution.  
 
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) , the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is 
conducted and data are generated  are collected , documented (recorded), and reported in compliance 
with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
The site will provide direct access to all trial relate d sites, source data/documents, and reports for the 
purpose of monitoring and inspection by local and regulatory author ities.  
 
9.1.5  DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING   
 
9.1.5.1  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
Principal Investigator . The Principal I nvestigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported . 
 
All source documents should be comple ted in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data.   
 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  12 Hard  copies of source document  worksheets will be used for recording data for each subject  enrolled in 
the study.  Data re cord ed in the case report form ( CRF) derived from source documents should be 
consistent with the data recorded on the source documents .  
 
9.1.5.2  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 3 years after the completion of the study . These 
documents should be retained  for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations.  
 
9.1.6  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol  requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject , the investigator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
 
These practices are consistent wi th ICH GCP:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator  to use continuo us vigilance to identify and report 
deviations within 10 working days of identification of the protocol deviation.  Protocol deviations must 
be sent to the reviewing  Institutional Review Board (IRB)  per their policies.  The Principal Investigator  is 
respons ible for knowing and adhering to the  reviewing IRB requirements.  
 
9.1.7  CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence , such as  by the pharmaceutical 
industry , is critical .  Therefore , any actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, 
conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial  will be disclosed and managed . Furthermore, 
persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have s uch conflicts managed in a 
way that is appropriate to their participation in the design and conduct of this trial.

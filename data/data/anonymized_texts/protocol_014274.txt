ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx

 1 Introduction 
Infections are now a leading cause of death and morbidity in kidney transplant 
recipients. Herpes viruses such as Epstein- Barr vi rus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) are particularly troublesome.  
 At the present time, valganciclovir (valG) is the primary prophylactic agent against CMV in kidney transplant (KTx) recipients. Although many centers try to prevent CMV disease by placing all or  in some centers, only the high risk patients (defined as CMV 
antibody negative patients  receiving organs from CMV antibody positive donors) on 
antiviral prophylaxis with valG for three to 12 months post -KTx, there continue to be 
patients with break -through infections. CMV viremia has been noted in 22% of pediatric 
post-KTx recipients, and the incidence at the University of Minnesota (UMMC) in all KTx 
recipients is as high as 17% despite valG prophylaxis. CMV disease post -KTx can 
manifest as fever, leucopenia, or mild to severe organ involvement. While an effective anti-CMV drug, valG has a number of adverse effects including leucopenia, also a side 
effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), one of the cornerstones of current anti -rejection 
regimens.  Combined therapy with MMF and valG frequently results in leucopenia associated infection or leucopenia necessitating reduction in MMF doses, increasing the risk of rejection. In addition, valG is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, rather than prophylaxis, many centers adopt a pre- emptive therapeutic approach whereby post -Ktx 
patients are screened for CMV, and at new onset viremia, valG is initiated. This approach has been associated with increased CMV infections and resistant viral strains.   
Therefore, there is need for an alternate drug with a more benign side effect profile and equal effectiveness against CMV. Valacyclovir (valA) was shown to reduce the incidence and delay the onset of CMV disease in both CMV seronegative patients (P<0.001) and CMV seroposit ive patients (P=0.03) and has fewer severe adverse 
events. In fact, very high doses of valA (8g/day), for post -KTx CMV prophylaxis were 
shown to have no severe or treatment -limiting side effects compared to placebo.  
 Currently, prevention of EBV infection is conducted by close monitoring of patients and 
immunosuppression reduction at the discovery of EBV viremia.  A recent study suggested that valG prophylaxis post -KTx is protective against EBV infection, but it had 
design flaws and the number of subjects was limited. Therefore to date, the anti -EBV 
effect of valG is poorly defined. EBV can present post -KTx as infectious mononucleosis 
syndrome, hepatitis and, most importantly, can initiate potentially fatal lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). Between Octo ber 2003 and December 2009, EBV 
viremia occurred in 20% of adults and 50% of pediatric KTx recipients (60/120) at UMMC, and, PTLD occurred in 6% (7/120) of pediatric recipients. Effective anti -EBV 
prophylaxis could substantially improve KTx outcomes. ValA therapy resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in oral EBV shedding, accompanied by a clinical benefit, and valA is currently used for the therapy of severe cases of infectious mononucleosis in the community.   
 This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 7 of 25 
 312 or 812 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable 
government regulations and Institut ional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 Therefore as stated above CMV and EBV remain critical posttransplant complications that can significantly and negatively impact patient and kidney transplant survival. In addition to overt CMV and EBV related issues detailed above, subclinical CMV and/or EBV viremia have been associated with deterioration in kidney function in KTx recipients. The significance of this research also includes the potential for substantial 
cost-savings. At UMMC, even with dis counted pricing due to the University status and 
bulk ordering, a 90 day supply of 450mg doses of valG administered twice daily is approximately $11,000 compared to $3250 for 1.5g tablets twice daily of valA. At least 200 patients receive kidney transplant s each year at UMMC, making the impact of a 
successful outcome from this research a saving of at least $1.55 million per year in addition to the cost -saving of reducing viral infection or rejection related admissions and 
expenses.  
 UMMC conducts surveilla nce bio psies at 3 and 12 months post -KTx on some adult 
transplant recipients, providing an ideal opportunity to assess kidney tissue for EBV and CMV via molecular and immunological assays.  We think it likely that post -KTx, kidneys 
exposed to an immunosuppr essed milieu allowing viral multiplication will increase the 
likelihood of isolating the virus from infected recipients; a pivotal step in our 
understanding of the mechanisms of CMV and EBV infection post -KTx.  
 In summary, valA is less expensive, with few er adverse effects, and less likelihood of 
causing  leucopenia than valG.  If this  agent ha s equivalent efficacy in CMV and any 
efficacy in  EBV prophylaxis, the use of valA will result in significant financial savings, a 
reduced risk of leucopenia- associated infection, and a lower incidence of rejection by 
allowing the use of standard MMF doses.  
 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Valacyclovir (valacyclov ir hydrochloride) is the hydrochloride salt of the L -valyl ester of 
the antiviral drug acyclovir. Caplets are for oral administration. Each caplet contains 
valacyclovir hydrochloride equivalent to 500 mg or 1 gram valacyclovir and the inactive ingredients carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidon, FD&C Blue No. 2 Lake, 
hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, and titanium dioxide. The blue, film -coated caplets are 
printed with edible white ink.  
 Valacyclovir oral suspension (25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL) may be prepared extemporaneously from 500 mg VALTREX Caplets for use in pediatric patients for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate.  
 
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 8 of 25 
 The chemical name of valacyclovir hydrochlori de is L -valine, 2[(2- amion- 1,6-dihydro- 6-
oxo-9H-purin_9_yl)methoxy]ethyl ester, monohydrochloride.  
 
Valacyclovir is a nucleoside analogue DNA polymerase inhibitor. Valacyclovir hydrochloride is rapidly converted to acyclovir which has demonstrated antivir al activity 
against HSV types 1 (HSV -1) and 2 (HSV -2) and VZV both in cell culture and in vivo. 
The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV and VZV. This viral enzyme conv erts acyclovir 
into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by  a 
number of cellular enzymes.  
 Valganciclovir (valganciclovir hydrochloride) contains valganciclovir hydrochloride  
(valganciclovir HCl), a hydrochloride salt of the L- valyl ester of ganciclovir that exists as 
a mixture of two diasteromers. Ganciclovir is a synthetic guanine derivative active against CMV.  
 Tablets are available as 450 mg for oral administration. Each tablet contains 496.3 mg 
of valganciclovir HCl (corresponding to 450 mg of valganciclovir), and the inactivie ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K -30, crospovidone and stearic acid. 
The film -coat applied t o the tablets contains Opadry Pink.  
 For pediatric patients, valganciclovir HCl is available in an oral solution that must be 
prepared by a pharmacist prior to dispensing.  Valganciclovir HCl for oral solution (50 mg 
per mL) is  supplied as a white to slightly yellow powder for constitution, forming a 
colorless to brownish yellow tutti -frutti flavored solution. Available in glass bottles 
containing approximately 100 mL of solution after constitution.  
 Valganciclovir is an L- valyl ester (prodrug) of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two 
disteromers. After oral administration, both diastereomers are rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases.  
1.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
The anti -EBV effect of valG has not been conclusively demonstrated or proven. On the 
other hand, data from infectious mononucleosis intervention trials document that two 
weeks of valA therapy resulted in a statistically significant reduction in oral EBV shedding, accompanied by a cli nical benefit ( 1, 2), and valA is currently used for the 
therapy of severe cases of infectious mononucleosis in the community ( 1, 3).  
Oral acyclovir has been shown to prevent CMV disease in post -KTx recipients ( 4-7) and 
valA in particular has been shown to reduce the incidence and delay the onset of CMV disease in both CMV seronegative patients (P<0.001) and CMV seropositive patients (P=0.03) (8). But since that trial did not include a comparison arm with the current 
standard of care which is valG and did not provide information on the anti -EBV effect of 
the valA, our study is critical in proving the effectiveness of valA for CMV and EBV prophylaxis.  
 
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 9 of 25 
 ValG is associated with adverse events including diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, 
tremor, leucopenia, neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in ≥20% of patients 
based on their package insert which we have attached.  ValG induced leucopenia often 
necessitates a reduction in immunosuppressive therapy, increasing the risk of allograft rejection. Fewer severe adverse events are related to valA, including rash (8%), abdominal pain (1% to 11%), nausea (5% to 15%), vomiting  (less than 1% to 6%), 
headache (13% to 38%) and fatigue (8%). Very high doses of valA (8g/day) for post -
KTx CMV prophylaxis was shown to have no severe or treatment -limiting side effects 
compared to placebo (8).  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Prior research at the University of Minnesota has shown that valacyclovir 1g every 8 
hours for a total daily dose of 3g is well tolerated and was associated with a reduction in 
EBV excretion ( 1) in patients with infectious mononucleosis. Subsequently a study done 
at the University of Minnesota to characterize the pharmacokinetics and explore the 
pharmacodynamics of acyclovir in plasma and oral washings of 8 subjects  with EBV 
infectious mononucleosis  receiving the same daily dose of  valacyclovir  (3g) as a twice 
daily dosing of  1500 mg twice daily  demonstrated safety and showed that the quantity of 
EBV DNA in oral washings and blood, and the severity of illness, measured by a graded 
scale, decreased during treatment ( 9).  
Therefore in order to increase the likelihood of compliance in our patients, we have 
decided to utilize 1.5g twice a day dosing of valacyclovir and since it was shown to be effective as therapy in the above study, we hypothesize that it will be adequate for anti -
viral prophylaxis as intended in this study. The dose will of course be adjusted based on GFR and in pediatric patients based on their weight as detailed in package insert and below.  
 No major side effects are anticipated since even very high doses of v alA (8g/day), for 
post-KTx CMV prophylaxis were shown to have no severe or treatment -limiting side 
effects compared to placebo (10).  
  
2 Study Objectives 
 
Primary Objectives : 
To compare the effectiveness of valacyclovir (valA) compared valganciclovir (valG) in the prevention of EBV and CMV viremia post -KTx.  
 To compare the proportion of patients requiring dose reduction or cessation of valA compared to valG due to adverse drug  side effects.  
 
Secondary Objective:  
To identify the presence and quantity of EBV and CMV in renal tissue biopsies from kidney transplant recipients.

3 Study Design 
This is a single -center, prospective, randomized, pilot study of up to 200 kidney 
transplant recipients  from the University of Minnesota Medical Center . Randomization of 
subjects will be in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ValA or standard of care regimen of ValG. 
Duration of therapy will be 3- 13 months.  
 Subjects will be assessed weekly then monthly for medication compliance, as well as 
assessing adverse events .  Subjects will be assessed at their routine clinic visits, or via 
email/telephone.   Subjects will be followed for a total of 12- 13 months, or for an 
additional 30 days aft er stop of the drug for adverse events.  
 Blood samples will be collected by using left -over standard of care samples for 
immunosuppression drug analysis. From these samples, qualitative PCR assay  (qPCR) 
will assess CMV and EBV  for up to six months post study drug cessation.  C omplete 
blood count and metabolic panels  will be collected clinically, and results recorded for 
this study . CMV and EBV IgG and IgM levels will be measured bi -annually  until 
seroconversion. In the cases where blood is not drawn for cli nical purposes at least 
once a month, 10- 15ml of the subject’s blood may be collected for this testing for 
research purposes. Surveillance kidney transplant biopsies are obtained at the time of 
transplant, 3 months post -transplant, 12 months post -transplant, and as clinically 
indicated. For the duration of subject study participation, kidney tissue (two to three 
cores) from any biopsy will be shared with the research team.  
 Subjects will be followed- up regularly by the research team during the first year p ost 
transplant. During these follow -up assessments, the research team will assess drug 
adherence  as well as evaluate side effects. If subjects are seen during a standard of 
care visit, laboratory values and a review of medical records will also be performe d to 
assess any potential  adverse events.

4.3.2 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Subjects will be followed for 12- 18 month s post-transplant procedure. Please refer to 
Table 1 for data points and frequency.  
5 Study Procedures  
5.1 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Initial contact regarding the research study will be done by the transplant clinical team  
or clinical research team once notification of treatment date is set .  For potential 
subjects that are receiving a transplant from a living donor, the study team will approach for informed consent prior to transplant surgery. For subjects that receive a transplant from a deceased donor,  because of time constraints, the study team may approach the 
patient after they are placed on the transplant list to introduce the study.  Informed 
consent will then be obtained up to 7  days  post-operatively.  
5.2 Randomization 
The randomization will be done i n a 1:1 fashion and will be computer generated.  
 
5.3 Laboratory Testing  
Blood is collected in accordance to standard of care procedures for these patients. Left -
over blood from the clinical laboratories of subjects will be obtained and tested for CMV and EBV quantitative PCR assay (qPCR), at minimum weekly for the first month and 
monthly for the first year to year and a half post -KTx. Acyclovir levels will be measured 
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 12 of 25 
 at 1 month in patients randomized to valA. CMV and EBV IgG and IgM levels will be 
measured bi -annually for patients who are seronegative until seroconversion after which 
they will no longer be checked. Safety labs include complete blood counts and basic metabolic panels which will be done for recipients randomized to valA monthly while participati ng in the study.  
 If the labs are not being collected at a minimum of weekly for the first month and then monthly for the first year, the study team will collect 10- 15mL of blood from the subjects 
for research procedures.   Half to one core of kidney tissue will be obtained, if available, from all kidney transplant biopsies performed during the first year post -KTx.  
 
5.4 Schedule of Events  
All assessments will be completed during routine clinical visits when feasible.  If the participant does not have a scheduled clinic visit, the participant or parent/guardian can 
choose to receive an email or phone call follow -up of drug adherence and adverse 
events.  Assessments will continue until at least 30 days after last dose of anti -viral.

6.3 Duration of Therapy  
Duration of therapy is dependent on donor and recipient antibody status.   Adult subjects will be treated with their assigned study drug (ValA or ValG) for  three 
months,  unless the donor is antibody positive and the recipient is antibody negative 
(D+R -) to CMV/EBV, then patient will get six months of prophylaxis.    
 Pediatric transplant recipients will be treated for twelve months  except  if both the  
donor and the recipie nt are antibody negative (D - R-) for both CMV and EBV, subjects 
will be treated for three months .   
 
Patients that are randomized to ValA that develop CMV disease or CMV viremia X2 
may discontinue ValA and begin standard of care treatment with ValG. At tha t time they 
will continue research related follow up but valA use is up to the discretion of the treating physician. At that time all protocol directed safety follow up with be 
discontinued ; however, outcomes  will be followed until month 12.   
6.4 Method for As signing Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized by the IDS pharmacy in 1:1 fashion using computer allocation to receive either valA or valG , and will notify the study team of the 
randomization assignment   
6.5 Preparation and Administration of  Study Drug 
After randomization, the treating investigator will order the treatment following this protocol dosing schema (see Tables 2 and 3).  Commercial supply of ValA and ValG will 
be dispensed to the subjects.

6.7 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Subjects will be asked to adhere to their prescribed treatment and dosage.  Medication adherence will be assessed by the study team during routine visits, by reviewing the medical record, and by communication with the subject or guardian (table in section 5.4). 
6.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All prior and concomitant therapies will be documented and allowed as per standard of care procedures. Provided there are no direct interactions with the randomized medication, all medications will be prescribed as standard of care. Management of all viral disease is as per physician and will not be protocoled by research procedures.

 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoints are as follows:  
1. Incidence and duration of CMV and EBV viremia and magnitude of viremia as 
measured by area under the viral load- time curve of recipients who become 
viremic with CMV and/or EBV in the first year post -Ktx.  
2. Incidence of subjects developing drug related side effects requiring dose reduction or cessation.  
3. Presence of EBV and or CMV in renal tissue (protocol biopsies).   
7.2 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Organ donor and recipient demographics, transplant characteristics, donor/recipient infection history (pre- transplant  EBV and CMV IgE antibody status and qPCR in donors 
and recipients.  
7.3 Primary Safety Endpoints 
Interim analysis will be done after the enrollment and completion of therapy with study drug valA or standard of care drug valG in 6 patients. If there is >= 20% increased incidence of CMV / EBV viremia in the valA cohort compared to the valG cohort then study will be stopped.  
7.4 Statistical Methods  
As per Lowance et al., 80% of the recipients that are randomized to the valA cohort will be CMV viremia free at 6 months . Therefore, to establish non- inferiority of valA as 
compared to valG, if I consider a difference less than 10% of no clinical importance, the required sample size with equal allocation between valA and valG to achieve an 80% power (β=0.2) at α=0.05 we wou ld need 54 recipients.  
 
 CMV viremia 
free proportion  N in valA grp  N in valG grp  Total=119  
CMV Ab+ R  80%  43 43 86 
CMV Ab - R 84%  61 16 32 
 
Since the anti -EBV effect of valG is unknown, a power calculation is impossible. 
Therefore we plan to include 200 recipients based on above sample size calculation and accounting for patient attrition etc.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events 
Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops 
or worsens in severity during t he course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or 
injuries will be regarded as adverse events .   
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 17 of 25 
 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse 
event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or  prolongs a hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of maj or clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization or intensi ve treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typically be considered serious.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious adverse events.  
 
Known side effects of the study drug an d of kidney transplant will not be 
treated as serious adverse events for this study  unless they are life-
threatening or fatal. See section 5.5 for a list of the known adverse effects of the 
study drugs. The know n adverse effects of kidney  transplant includ e: 
• Graft dysfunction, including:  
o Delayed graft function  
o Failure of donor kidney  
o Rejection of the new kidney  
o Vascular thrombosis  
• Recurrence of primary kidney diagnosis  
• Severe infections  
• Surgical complications  
• Risks related to immunosuppression  
• Risks related  to steroids  
• Hypertension  
• Cardiovascular disease 
• Diabetes  
• Malignancy  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined 
as 30 days following the last administration of study treatment.   
Preexisting Condition 
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 18 of 25 
 A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A pr eexisting 
condition will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events 
are resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any 
one o f the following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to 
confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g . 
change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospitalization , Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization will be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outc ome was uneventful.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for the study.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease 
of the study, unless it is a worsening or increase in freq uency of hospital 
admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.

 8.1 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on adverse 
events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Inform ation on all 
adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be record ed in the 
source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been deter mined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1  Study Sponsor Notification by Investigator  
A serious adverse event must be reported to the Principle Investigator  within 24 hours 
of finding out of the event.  Within the following 48 hours, further information on the serious adverse event must be documented in the form of a written narrative.  This 
should include a copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event form  (see Appendix) , 
and any other diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of the event.  Significant new information of ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the PI . The PI will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.  
Report serious adverse events by phone and facsimile to:  
 Henry Balfour Jr, MD  
612-625-3998  
balfo001@umn.edu
 
 At the time of the initial report, the following information should be provided:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• Current status  • Whether study treatment was 
discontinued  
• The reason why the event is 
classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the 
association between the event 
and study treatment  
 
 
8.2.2  IRB Notification by Investigator  
Reports of all serious adverse events (including follow -up information) must be 
submitted to the IRB within 5  working days if it falls under the expedited reporting

 8.3 Stopping Rules  
This study may be terminated by the PI or DSMB at any time. Reasons for terminating 
the study may include the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to subjects . 
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory . 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
The PI will oversee the safety of the study, including careful assessment and 
appropriate reporting of AEs. Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of SAEs.  
8.4.1  Internal Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be compliance with the UMN Clinical 
and Translational Scientific Institute’s Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMB).  
 A DSMB will meet twice per year, with the first meeting occurring once approximately 25% of target enrollment has been accrued. The DSMB will review recruitment, participant status and subject safety associated with the trial and create a report for the Principal Investigator with their recommendations, if any, to the PI for the conduct of the study.  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping 
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the r evocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study peri od. 
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 22 of 25 
 Source data are contained in source documents   Examples of these original 
documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, c opies or transcriptions 
certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments involved in the 
clinical trial.  
 Data generated by the methods described in the protocol will be recorded in the subjects' medical records and/or study progress notes. Data may be transcribed legibly on CRFs supplied for each subject or directly i nputted into an electronic system or any 
combination thereof.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error  has been 
made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or unce rtain 
entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
9.4 Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least 6 years after the last approval of a marketing application in their country and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in their country or at least 6 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  These documents will be retained for a longer period if required 
by an agreement with the sponsor.  In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
This study will be monitored according to FDA/GCP guidelines.  The investigator will 
allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 23 of 25 
 10.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator wi ll permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB, 
the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality 
assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data coll ection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure 
the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.  
11 Ethical Considerations  
To avoid participants forgetting their participation in the study, those subjects who begin active participat ion more than two months after their original consent will be contacted 
to confirm their interest in participation before they are randomized.  
 This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 2 1 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization 
guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted 
independent Institutio nal Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal 
prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be prov ided to the sponsor before commencement of this 
study.  The investigator should provide a list of IRB members and their affiliate to the sponsor.  
 
11.1 Informed Consent  
All subjects’ will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficie nt information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation 
in this study. The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the IRB for the study. The formal consent of a subject using the IRB -
approved consent form must be obtained before that subject is submitted to any study 
procedure. This consent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable 
surrogate and the Investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent. 
A blank copy  of the IRB -approved form must be kept on- site by the Investigator.

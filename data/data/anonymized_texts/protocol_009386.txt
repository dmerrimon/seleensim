1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:   A Single Arm Study of Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (rs -fMRI) -Guided Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) in Primary 
Progressive Aphasia (PPA)   
IRB Number:   
Study Des cription : Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a non -Alzheimer’s dementia that 
is the 2nd most common cause of dementia in the United States. FTD may 
present with focal language symptoms that are clinically described as 
primary progressive aphasia (PPA).  There are two types of PPA 
associated with FTD —semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (SV -
PPA) and nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (NFV -PPA).  Both diseases are progressive neurodegenerative disease 
processes that co mpromise dominant hemisphere large scale brain 
network function, ultimately resulting in mutism. There are currently no FDA- approved treatments for PPA and management is mostly 
supportive.  In combination with resting state functional MRI (rs -fMRI), 
transc ranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with intermittent theta burst 
stimulation (iTBS) offers a non -invasive alternative to pharmacotherapy 
in persons with PPA. In our prior studies of AD and LBD subjects, we have determined that the anterior temporal pole (area TGd and TGv) is an area that is commonly dysfunctional in dementia.  We have already embarked upon an fMRI guided study of iTBS in early stage Alzheimer’s disease where subjects received a series of 5 treatments to distinct brain 
regions inclusive of area TGd.   We propose a case study of 3 PPA studies 
where rs -fMRI is applied to the large -scale language networks    
Objectives:  
  
Primary Aim  
1.  To describe  the effect of rs -fMRI -guided TBS on connectivity 
dysfunction within the large scale language networks in persons 
with PPA.  
Exploratory Aims  
1. To describe  the effect of rs -fMRI -guided TBS on Naming (Boston 
Naming Test) in PPA due to FTD  
2. To describe  the effec t of rs -fMRI -guided TBS on Receptive 
Language (Token Test and Peabody Picture Verbal Vocabulary Test) in PPA due to FTD  
3. To describe  the effect of rs -fMRI guided TBS on Fluency (Animal 
naming and Controlled Oral Word Association Test  [COWAT]) in 
PPA due to FTD

2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE  AND BACKGROUND  
Frontotemporal degeneration  (FTD) is a spectrum  of neurodegenerative  disease  characterized  
by either  behavioral  changes  or primary  progressive  aphasia and represents  the seco nd most  
common  cause  of young  onset  dementia.   When  impacting  the right  hemisphere,  FTD presents  
as a behavioral variant  with  disinhibition,  apathy,  loss of empathy,  hyperorality,  and repetitive  
motor  behaviors  whereas  involvement  of the left hemisphere  results  in primary  progressive  
aphasia  (PPA).   PPA due to FTD is characterized  by two clinical  phenotypes:  the semantic  variant  
(SV-PPA)  and the nonfluent/agrammatical variant  (NFV -PPA).   We are most  interested  in the 
application  of TMS  to these  two conditio ns, which  have  well-established  localized  
neuroanatomical localizations  that correlate  with  clinical symptoms.   
The clinical phenotype  associated  with SV-PPA is marked  by language  impairments  in naming,  
object  knowledge,  and single -word  comprehension (Kerchner  & Rosenbloom,  1999) . Words 
may  be at the tip of the tongue  and readily  recognized from a list, but a patient  with  svPPA  
loses not only  the word itself  but also the semantic  knowledge  surrounding  the noun  in 
question.   Neuroanatomically,  this condition is defined by progressive  neurodegeneration  of 
the left anterior  temporal  pole  (or areas  TGd/TG v), an integration  center  for neural pathways  
from auditory,  visual,  and somatosensory  brain  regions.   With  time,  SV-PPA neurodegeneration  
may  spread  to the contralateral  right  anterior pole  (areas  R TGd/TGv),  leading  to symptoms  of 
prosopagnosia,  food  fats, mental rigidity,  and disinhibition  (Rabinovici  & Miller,  2010) .  fMRI  
studies  have  further  implicated  a disconnection  of the left temporal  pole  from  large  scale  brain  
networks  in SV-PPA (Montembeault  et al., 2019) .   The  underlying  neuropathology  associated  
with  SV-PPA is exclusively tar DNA -binding  protein 43 [(TDP -43); (Davies  et al., 2005)].  Post -
mortem  evaluation  typically  reveals  tau more  frequently  than TDP- 43 pathology  (Kerchner  & 
Rosenbloom,  1999) . 
Similar to SV-PPA,  NFV-PPA leads  to progressive  neurodegeneration  localized  to the left 
hemisphere  and results  in compromise  of expressive  speech  and language.   Patients  present  
clinically  with  motor  speech  dysfunction  and effortful,  nonfluent  speech  with  shortened  phrase  
length,  dysarthria,  phonemic  paraphasias,  and speech  apraxia.  In addition  to effortful  speech,  
the other  key clinical feature  is agrammatism,  with  omissions  of articles  and other  syntactic 
words,  leading  to speech  sometimes  described  as telegraphic  (Gorno -Tempini  et al., 2011) . The

condition  localizes  within the left hemisphere  prefrontal -perisylvian  region  of the cerebral 
cortex (Gorno -Tempini et al., 2004) .  
There  are no FDA-approved  treatments  available  for either  SV-PPA or NFV-PPA,  both  of which 
typically  result  in death 5+ years  from diagnosis.   Treatment  for these  conditions  is mostly  
supportive,  consisting of speech  therapy,  psychosocial  support,  and management  of 
neuropsychiatric  symptoms.    
Transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (TMS)  is a therapeutic  tool,  consisting  of magnet  and coil that 
utilizes  Faraday’s  principle  to induce  electric  currents  in specific  brain  regions,  leading  to 
cortical excitability  or suppression  (Janicak  & Dokucu,  2015) .  The treatment  is relatively  safe 
with  the most  common  side effect  being  tension headache  (to which patients  frequently  
acclimate  over  time)  and is FDA-approved  for the treatment  of depression  (Janicak  & Dokucu,  
2015) .  The device  is routinely  used  in outpatient psychiatry  clinics  including  HealthPartners  and 
Park  Nicollet  behavioral health.   Repetitive  TMS  (rTMS)  has been  shown  to induce  changes  in 
cortical excitability  and modulate  neural network  activity  beyond  the duration  of the stimulus  
itself  (Pascual -Leone et al., 2011) .  Intermittent  theta  burst stimulation  (iTBS)  is a more  recent  
variation  of TMS  that delivers  longer  lasting  change  in brain  activity  with  less stimulation  and 
has likewise  been  found to be safe and well-tolerated  by patients  (Blumberger et al., 2018;  
Gonsalvez,  Baror,  Fried,  Santarnecchi,  & Pascual -Leone,  2017) .  Whereas  rTMS  applied  to the 
dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex is an FDA approved  treatment  for refractory  depression,  TMS  has 
significan t potential  as a targeted  treatment  for cognitive  disorders.   A proposed  mechanism is 
that persistent  enhancement  of cortical  excitability  results  in long -term  potentiation  (Huang,  
Edwards,  Rounis,  Bhatia,  & Rothwell,  2005)  and increased  expression  of brain  derived  
neurotrophic  factors  (Phillips  et al., 1991) . 
Omniscient  is a for-profit,  Sydney,  Australia- based  company,  has designed  the Infinitome  
program,  which  utilizes  data  from the Human  Connectome  Project  (HCP) together  with  machine  
learning  to analyze  diffusion tensor  and resting -state  fMRI  imaging  data  from  remote  sites.   The 
HCP commenced  one of the most  ambitious  neuroscientific  initiatives  to “map  the 
brain (Glasser  et al., 2016) ,” identified  379 functional  areas  of the cerebrum,  and discovered  97 
new  brain  regions  that had not been  previously  described.   The foundation for this imaging  tool 
is based  upon the HCP atlas,  which has also informed  prior  publications  from  our group,  
including  the Connectomic Atlas  of the Human  Cerebrum (Baker  et al., 2018) .  The  Infinitome  
program  creates  a subject specific  version  of the Human  Connectome  Project  Multimodal  
Parcellation  (HCP -MMP1)  atlas  using  diffusion tractography  (DT).   Analytics  are performed  on 
both  diffusion tensor  imaging  (DTI) and rs-fMRI  (see appendix  Guide  to Planning an Infinitome  
Study ).  Outlier  detection  using  a tangent  space  connectivity  matrix  is performed  by comparing  
results  with a subset  of 300 normal  HCP subject fMRI  samples  to determine  the range  of normal  
A23-078 TMS Pilot in PPA   Version 2.0

 8 
correlations  for each  region  of interest  in a LSBN.   Abnormal connectivity  is determined  as a 3-
sigma  outlier  for that correlation .  The program includes  a 15-minute  imaging  protocol  that can 
readily  be added on to structural  MRI sequences  and provides  automated support  for image  
analysis,  thus  simplifying  the process  of accessing  clinically  applicable  imaging  data.   Preliminary  
work  has shown  that connectomic analysis  in AD subjects  using  this software  is feasible  and can 
detect  functional  anomalies  involving  regions  of interest  described  by the HCP (Ren  et al., 
2020) .  
Clinical trials  applying  rs-fMRI -guided  TMS  to refractory  depression  have  suggested  that 
functional  imaging  may  effectively  target  large  scale  brain  networks  of interest,  thus  more  
effectively  treating  clinical symptoms  (Cole  et al., 2019) .  Both  SV-PPA and NFV-PPA are 
dementing  conditions  that promote  focal  neurodegeneration  of the large -scale  language  
cortical networks  within the left hemisphere.  Thus,  TMS  represents  a potential  symptomatic  
treatment  capable  of modulating  dysfunctional  language  networks  within  the frontotemporal  
lobes.   There  has been  a significant,  but limited  number  of studies  evaluating  the impact  of TMS  
treatment  to the DLPFC  on language  symptoms  in these  two disease  processes.    TMS  to the left 
or right  DLPFC  improved  naming  accuracy in NFV-PPA subjects  (Cotelli  et al., 2012) . A pilot  trial 
of TMS  to the left DLPFC  in 6 patients  with  PPA demonstrated improved  accuracy  on action  
naming  tasks  10 min post -treatment  (Margolis  et al., 2019) .    A double -blinded,  sham -
controlled  study  of 20 subjects  with  PPA due to either  SV-PPA or NFV-PPA found  that 
personalized  targeted  of affected  language  regions  improved  spontaneous  speech  and 
enhanced  left fronto -parieto -temporal  lobe  metabolism (Pytel  et al., 2021) .  
Human  Connectom e studies  have  identified three  major  language  networks  based  on their  
functional  connectivity  (Rolls,  Deco,  Huang,  & Feng,  2022) .; a ventrally  based  “semantic  
network”  inclusive  of inferior temporal regions  temporal area G dorsal (TGd)  and TE1a,  which  
participates  in semantic  representation of objects  based  upon their  visual  and reward  qualities.   
There  is another  dorsally  based  network that includes  areas  STV,  TPOJ1,  responsible  for 
semantic  representations  based  on auditory  and facial motion  characteristics.   Finally,  a third 
group  that largely  includes  frontal -based  structures  such  as 55b participates  in syntax  and 
speech  output.   Theoretically,  TMS  targeting  of these  three  areas  could  be effective  in treating  
conditions  that result  in primary  progressive  aphasia,  regardless  of the underlying  cause.   Our  
preliminary  research  at HealthPartners  using  Infinitome  in AD (n=4)  and dementia  with  Lewy  
bodies  (n=15)  has already  shown  area  TgD (Figure  1) to have  abnormal connectivity  in persons  
with  dementia.  
The present  study  will enroll 3 subjects  with  either  SV-PPA or NVF-PPA.   Those  patients  where  
fMRI  is contraindicated  (e.g.  implantable  device,  pacemaker,  metallic  implants,  etc.) or who  are 
unable  to tolerate  sitting  for a one-hour  fMRI  will be excluded  from  the study.   TMS  will be

networks.

2.2 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)  
The TMS  device  to be used  in this study  is the MagVenture  TMS  Therapy®  with  theta  Burst   
stimulation.  MagVenture  is a computerized,  electromechanical  medical  device  that produces  
and delivers  non-invasive,  magnetic  fields  to induce  electrical currents  targeting  specific  regions  
of the brain.  In 2018,  MagVenture  received  FDA clearance  for the 3 minute  protocol  which we 
market  under  the trademarked  name  Express  TMS®.  The Lancet:  “THREE -D: a randomized  non-
inferiority  trial”),  comparing  the standa rd, 37 minute  TMS  protocol  to the newer,  3 minute  
Theta  Burst  protocol  (TBS)  (Blumberger  et al., 2018) . The study  concluded  that the Theta  Burst  
protocol  is just as safe and effective  for the treatment  of major depressive  disorder  as standard  
TMS.  Recent  safety  review  of TMS  summarizes  the Theta  Burst  studies  and concludes  that TBS 
in the range  of 80-100%  of motor  threshold is safe (Supplementar y Table  5, (Rossi  et al., 2020) ). 
In this study,  the planned motor  threshold is 80%.   
The TMS  devices  are non-significant  risk devices,  in line with  the criteria  for exception  from  an 
IDE. Transcranial mag netic  stimulation  (TMS)  is a therapeutic  tool,  consisting  of magnet  and coil 
that utilizes  Faraday’s  principle  to induce  electric  currents  in specific  brain  regions,  leading  to 
cortical excitability  or suppression  (Janicak  & Dokucu,  2015)  .  The  treatment  is relatively  safe 
with  the most  common  side effect  being  tension headache  (to which patients  frequently  
acclimate  over  time)  and is FDA-approved  for the treatment  of depres sion (Janicak  & Dokucu,  
2015) .  The device  is routinely  used  in outpatient psychiatry  clinics  including  HealthPartners  and 
Park  Nicollet  behavioral health.   Patients  are generally  able  to drive  home  or return  to work

immediately  after  an TMS  session.  Rare  side effects  include  dizziness,  memory  trouble,  trouble  
concentrating  and sudden mood  changes.  The long -term  effects  of TMS  are not known.   
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
Structural MRI is a routine  diagnostic  procedure  at HealthPartners,  and the resting  state  portion  
merely  requires  15 minutes  of scan  time.    The patient  may  experience  claustrophobia  with  the 
narrow  imaging  space  and hearing  loud  noises  while  inside  the machine.  An MRI scan  does  not 
involve  radiation  like conventional  X-rays.   Instead,  images  are generated  using  a magnetic  field  
and radio  signals.   Because  an MRI scanner  uses  strong  magnets,  subjects  will be screened  by the 
NSC Imaging  staff  – as for a routine  MRI.   People  with artificial heart  valve,  metal plate,  pin, or 
other  metallic  objects  in their  body  (including  gun shot  or shrapnel)  will not be eligible  for this 
study.  
 
Neuropsychological Testing  
Neuropsychological testing may result in frustration on the part of the patient but does not 
have any other significant risks.   
 Loss of Confidentiality  
There may be a slight possibility of breach of confidential information that was collected. 
However, the following procedures will be implemented to reduce this risk:  
• Data collection and reporting tools will be developed and stored internally.  
• Data collected and stored electronically will remain confidential and secure (e.g. secured 
server and password protected files [REDCap]).  
• Study binders will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a locked office.  
• After the study is closed, all subject identifiers will be destroyed.  
 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Benefits for the patient include the ability to review imaging of their rs -fMRI imaging studies.  In 
addition, patients may experience improvements in mood or cognition with the TMS although this has not been well -estab lished at this time.   
This research will be important to better investigate the role of non -invasive neurostimulation 
for symptoms in AD in a larger cohort and will support a future application for an NIH -
sponsored grant.  
 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND  BENEFITS  
We believe the potential risks to the participants in this study are minimal.

The following measures will be taken to protect patients from risk of TMS  
• Transcranial magnetic stimulation is associated with a 50% risk of self -limiting headache 
and a 1/10,000 risk of seizures.  All patients will undergo the TMS Adult Safety Screen 
(TASS), which will ensure that the risk of seizure is negligible for each subject 
participating in the study.  In the event of adverse events during TMS treatment, specific  
procedures will be outlined (aligned with HealthPartners Behavioral Health) and staff 
will be trained and on -site for any assistance . In addition, all research staff will be 
trained on the operation of device  (Fried et al., 2020) . Repeated exposure to TMS may 
result in sensorineural hearing loss, which is prevented by routine use of ear plugs.  
• Relative to most oral medications used in treatment of dementia, TMS has a very 
favorable side effect profile.  
The following measures will be  taken to protect providers and patients from the risk of breach of 
confidentiality:  
• A unique study ID code unrelated to the medical record number or other study subject-
specific information will be assigned to each patient and used to link data from vari ous 
sources and needed for analysis.  The study number will be used on the RedCap database and Infinitome Program.  All imaging data uploaded from the NSC research site will be de -
identified and uploaded to the Infinitome cloud -based server.   
• Infinitome program uses an industrial grade cyber security that is superior to what is offered at the leading medical device companies.  No personal health information is stored on servers and only de -identified scans are stored on a dedicated edge node on 
encrypted MinIO instances.  Patient data is only accessed through authenticated calls form Kubernetes pods contained in the VPC.  The web service requires user authentication.  Only the data related to a specific facility can be retrieved through 
authenticated calls and are restricted to their use.

5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
N/A 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
Research Referral Form: This will be filled out by PI or qualified designee to assess the 
appropriateness of TMS in these patients. Patients will be considered ineligible and not screened  
if they do not meet one or more of the criteria.  
 
Pre-screening Phone Call: All potential participants will undergo a pre -screening phone or a video 
call to determine whether they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be considered 
ineligible  if they do not meet one or more of the inclusion/exclusion criteria during pre -screening. 
We will collect information on why participants are ineligible or decide not to move forward with the trial.  
 
Screen failures  are defined as participants who are co nsidered eligible during the pre -screening 
phone call, but it was subsequently determined that they do not meet one or more of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. We will collect information on why participants screen fail or decide 
not to move forward with the trial.  
 
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of 
screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 
publishing requirements and to respond to queries from reg ulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious 
adverse event (SAE).  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 CMA CLINIC  
Subjects will be recruited from the Center for Memory and A ging clinic.  An Epic -based list has 
been created with subjects having either a  SV-PPA or NFV -PPA diagnosis.  Patients and their 
A23- 078 TMS Pilot in PPA   Version 2.0 
PI: Bhavani Kashyap, MBBS , PhD  May 18, 2023  
 
 15 
caregivers will be presented with the option of participating in the study by the PI including 
providing a brochure at the clinic visits. Participants with clinic visits will meet with research 
staff. Other patients will be mailed/e -mailed a letter and flyer/brochure.  An informed consent 
form will be provided to those individuals expressing interest in the study.  A video or phone encounter will be arranged to provide additional details of the study and informed consent. 
 RECRUITMENT FROM COMMUNITY/SUPPORT GROUPS/REFERRALS  
In addition, we plan to recruit from the community, support groups, referrals from other 
research/health systems, as this is a rare form of disorder. Potential participants/anyone who 
refers/ support groups will be provided with approved flyer/brochure in a mail/email. An 
informed consent form will be provided to those individuals expressing interest in the study  
and research staff will reach out to the participant via a phone call.  A video or phone encounter 
will be arranged to provide additional details of the study and informed consent. 
To reach our target enrollment, we anticipate that we will need to screen  10 people.  
Remuneration:  Participants will be provided gift cards totaling $100 per subject. The gift cards 
will be provided at the end of the study for completing all the study visits.  
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) A DMINISTRATION  
 STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
All subjects will receive TMS treatment with intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). The TMS devices are non -significant risk devices, in line with the criteria for exception from an IDE.  
The TMS device to be used in this study is the MagVenture TMS Therapy® (MagPror30/Theta 
Burst option) with theta Burst stimulation  (See User Guide) . A B65 -coil – FDA cleared figure 8 
coil will be utilized for iTBS treatment. In 2018, MagVenture received FDA clearance for the 3 minute protocol which we market under th e trademarked name Express TMS® for Major 
depressive disorder  (Blumberger et al. , 2018) , but TMS is not approved by the FDA for 
symptoms in primary progressive aphasia.   
Localite Neuro Navigator will be utilized  to stimulate brain regions identified by the Infinitome 
software  and allows correct positioning of the patient and coil 
(https://www.magventure.com/tms -research/localite -neuron avigation ).

 DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
There will be a total of 25 intermittent theta burst sessions spread evenly across 5 treatment visits (5 
sessions per treatment visit), all distributed over a two -week period.   Intermittent theta burst sessions 
will be administered at the following settings, which have been used in a standardized manner by our collaborators in their TMS clinic:  
Table 3: TMS Treatment Parameters  
Resting Motor Threshold  80%  
# of Pulses/Session  1200 pulses (40 cycles x 10 burst pulses x 3 
pulses per burst pulse)  
Inter -Train Interval  8 sec  
Pulse Frequency in Burst  50 Hz  
Session Length  15-30 min  
Time between Sessions  45 min to Hour  
Number of Targets  3 
Number of Sessions per Day  5 
Treatment Days  5 
Total Pulses per Day  18,000  
Total Pulses for Treatment  90,000  
The treatment regime above will be applied to a total of three regions of interest or 
parcellations (left TGd, left 55b, and left STV ).  The interval between treatment of separate 
regions of interest  (target)  will be at least 2 minutes . The interval between iTBS sessions within 
the same treatment visit will be 45 -60 minutes. Details of the operations of TMS and 
intervention will be included in a SOP or User guide that will be kept on site.  
During the treatment, the TMS operator will be in the room and trained to activate the seizure protocol 
(https://healthpartnersconnect.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/bhc/TMS%20Library/Safety/Emergency%20Management%20of%20Seizur
es%20Standing%20Order.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=p5h4Gg.   All patients will be screened with the TASS 
screening  questions.

Each treatment will be recorded on CRFs developed internally and will be based on 
HealthPartners Behavioral Health Clinic workflow and documents.  
6.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
Medications to be reported in the Case Report Form ( CRF) are concomitant prescription 
medications, over- the-counter medications and supplements . Specifically, any medication with 
that increases the risk of seizure  will be documented in CRF and judged by the PI  with an 
oversight by study physician  if it is allow ed in the study.  
 
7 STUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT  
DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) 
after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in 
participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an 
adverse event (AE) . 
If the patient develops a seizure, the PI may discontinue the TMS treatment and early 
withdrawal procedures will be performed.   
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may withdraw a participant from the study if:  
• Any medical condition, event or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject.  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not pre viously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation.   
• Significant study procedure non -compliance  
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact subject  
7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW -UP 
A23- 078 TMS Pilot in PPA   Version 2.0 
PI: Bhavani Kashyap, MBBS , PhD  May 18, 2023  
 
 18 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the 
relevant CRFs. Subjects who sign the informed consent  form and undergo only cognitive 
measures, and not imaging or TMS will not have completed participation and may be replaced.  
A participant will be considered lost to follow- up if he or she  fails to attend any scheduled study 
visit and study staff are unable to contact the participant after at least 5 attempts.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to attend any required study visit:  
• Study staff  will attempt  to  contact  the  participant,   reschedule  the  missed  visit,   
counsel  the  participant  on  the  importance  of  maintaining  the  assigned  visit  schedule  and  ascertain  if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• Before a  participant  is  deemed  lost  to  follow -up,  the  investigator  or  designee  will 
make every effort  to  regain  contact  with  the  participant  (where  possible,  telephone  
calls  or  e -mail –  if  no  answer  leave  a  vo icemail  on  the  first  and  last  attempt).  
These  contact  attempts  will be documented.  
• Should  the  participant  continue  to  be  unreachable,  he  or  she  will  be  considered  to  have  withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to fo llow -up.

Originally dev eloped in 1976 by Folstein, the MMSE is a paper -based test commonly used in 
clinical and research settings (Fols tein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) . A 30 point cognitive screening 
tool that assesses orientation, working memory, short term memory, visuospatial construction, 
and language. This will be used in the screening visit for eligibility of participants  in the s tudy  
 
 NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS  
All enrolled subjects will undergo the following cognitive scales.  These will be administered by the research staff trained in these assessments using instructions specific for te sts under the 
guidance/ supervision of the study neuropsychologist.  
8.2.3.1  LANGUAGE TE STV 
Boston Naming Test (BNT):   This test introduced in 1983 by Edith Kaplan, Harold Goodglass and 
Sandra Weintraub (Goodglass, Kaplan, & Weintraub, 1983)  is a widely used neuropsychological 
assessment of confrontational word retrieval in individuals with aphasia or other language disturbance caused by stroke, Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia.  The BNT contains 60 line drawings graded in difficulty and is one of the most sensitive test for det ecting 
language impairment in SV -PPA.  
Token Test:  The Token Test is used to identify and evaluate receptive language dysfunction 
associated with aphasias. The evaluation consists of a series of commands involving 20 tokens 
of different shapes, size, and color is presented in increasing complexity from "to uch the small 
red square" to "put the large green circle under the small yellow square, before you touch the 
white circle” (De Renzi & Vignolo, 1962) . 
Peabody Picture Verbal Vocabulary Test  (PPVT) : The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test  measures 
listening and understanding of single -word vocabulary.  It was developed for individuals 2 years 
6 months old through greater than 90 years old and measures the lexicon of words that a person can understand.  Examinees see a page o n an easel with four -color pictures. For each 
item, the examiner says a word, and the examinee responds by selecting one picture out of four that best illustrates that word’s meaning. Because the examinee points to the appropriate item, the test requires no reading, writing, or expressive verbal language. Thus, it can be used with 
nonreaders and those without fluent verbal abilities. The test is untimed and individually 
administered (Eigsti, 2021) .

PI: Bhavani Kashyap, MBBS , PhD  May 18, 2023  
 
 21 
Animal Naming: The Animal Naming Test (ANT) is an analysis of semantic fluency consisting of 
saying as many animal names as possible within one min ute.  
Controlled Oral Word Association Test : The Controlled Oral Word Association Test [COWAT; 
(Eigsti, 2021) ] is a verbal fluency test that measures spontaneous production of words 
belonging to the same category or beginning with some designated letter. There are two 
commonly used forms of the test, one using the letters F, A, and S, and the other using C, F, and 
L.  
WAB Sentence Repetition:  T he WAB assesses fluency and information content of spontaneous 
speech, comprehension, naming, repetition, reading, and writing as well as “performance” 
tasks such as praxis, calculation, drawing, block design, and Raven's co lored progressive 
matrices.  Testing in this study will focus on sentence repetition.  
Raw and normative scores for each test will be reported as appropriate.  
 MRI IMAGING  
Subjects will undergo MRI imaging at HealthPartners Neuroscience Center. Subjects will be 
screened for any contraindications for MRI. Subjects will undergo a protocol based on recommendation by Omniscent (o8t MR Acquisition Recommendations). We anticipate 15 
minutes of scan run time using a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner and the following images will be 
obtained.  
1) High -resolution multi -scan directional diffusion scan, which is most similar to a diffusion 
tensor image (DTI) acquisition - Specifically, diffusion weighted imaging with the 
following acquisition parameters will be used:  2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm voxels, FOV = 25.6 
cm, matrix = 128 mm x 128 mm, slice thickness = 2.0 mm, one non -zero b -value of b = 
1000, 40 directions, and gap = 0.0 mm.   
2) EPI BOLD rs -fMRI - A resting -state fMRI as a T2 -star EPI sequence, with 3 x 3 x 3 -mm 
voxels, 128 volumes/run, a TE = 27ms, a TR = 2.8s, a field of view – 256mm, a flip angle = 
90°  
3) Anatomical Scan – T1 Weighting  
All images will be de -identified and uploaded to the infintome cloud- based server to be 
analyzed. Internal guidelines/best practices based on infinitome user manual will be developed 
for transfer, obtaining accounts, uploading of raw images and downloading of analyzed data.

This will be transferred to the Localite Neuro Navigator to help with target areas for TMS 
Treatment  
 CONNECTOMIC ANALYSIS  
All subject images will be processed using the inf initome tool. This will be used to conduct a 
connectomic analysis to identify large scale brain networks.  
The Infinitome tool creates a machine learning -based, subject specific version of the Human 
Connect ome Project -Multimodal Parcellation (HCP -MMP1) atlas based upon diffusion 
tractography structural connectivity (Figure 3).  All data uploaded to the cloud is de -identified.  
This novel method was created by training a machine learning model on 200 normal s ubjects by 
first processing T1 and DT images.  An HCP -MMP1 atlas in NIFTI MNI space is then warped onto 
each brain and the structural connectivity calculated between every pair of this atlas and a set 
of ROI containing 8 subcortical structures per hemisphere and the brainstem based on the streamlines which terminated 
within an ROI.  To ensure this atlas is applicable to pathologically distorted 
brains, a machine -learning tool takes the 
individual’s DTI or CSD tractography and 
locates every voxel and reassigns them to an area that fits more accurately with the 
structural connection to create a 
personalized adjusted atlas. The 
personalized patient atlas is used to subset the resting -state and CSD tract ography data to 
create Structural and Functional connectivity matrices. When these matrices are compared to other individuals using machine -learning, an output of structural and functional anomaly 
matrices demonstrates the abnormal connectivity in this subject’s brain (Figure 4). Abnormal

connectivity is determined as a 3 -sigma outlier for that correlation, after excluding the highest 
variance 1/3 of pairs, to further reduce the false discovery rate. Assignment of parcellations to 
various large -scale brain networks is based on several previous coordinate based meta -analysis 
and matching the HCP -MMP1 parcellations to the coordinates of the ALE in MNI space, which 
has bee n previously published (or in review presently) by our group.  
8.3 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
 TRANCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION ADULT SAFETY SCREEN ( TASS ) 
Screening questionnaire to assess the safety of TMS prior to treatment. This will be conducted 
at visits 1 and 2.  
8.4 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An adverse event is any symptom, sign, illness or experience which develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are consid ered to be adverse events 
if the abnormality:  
• Results in study withdrawal.  
• Is associated with clinical signs 
or symptoms.  
• Leads to treatment or to 
further diagnostic te sts.  
• Is considered by the investigator to be of clinical 
significance.  
 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
Adverse events are classified as either serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event is any 
event that results in:  
• Death.  
• Life- threatening situation.

• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization.  
• Disability or incap acitation.  
• Other events determined by investigator to be medically significant in which subject’s 
well- being is jeopardized (e.g. events that have high likelihood of escalating to the point 
of meeting criteria outlined above)  
 EXPECTEDNESS  
PI, along with study physician will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event 
(AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
Upon consenting, a subject is considered to be a participant in the study, and until that person 
either withdraws or completes study, AEs and SAEs will be recorded. The investigational team 
will promptly report any AE/SAE as required per fede ral guidelines.  
8.5 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by the Office for Human 
Research Protections (OHRP). OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving ris ks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  
of the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant 
population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
3. Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.

 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING  
The PI will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing IRB. The UP report will include 
the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB 
project number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP  
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following 
timeline :   
 
• UPs will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days 
after the investigator first learns of the event  
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 STATSTICAL PLAN OVERVIEW  
The study sample demographics (age, race, etc.) and baseline m easurements (e.g., MMSE) will 
be displayed in tabular form, and described using appropriate summary measures (i.e. means, 
standard deviations, or medians for continuous variables and counts or percentages for discrete variables).  
The primary aim will be assessed by calculating the difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval between baseline and follow -up connectivity measures of the TGd, STV, and 
55b parcellations.  
The exploratory aims will be analyzed by calculating a difference in pre/post scores and 
corresponding 95% confidence interval for each cognitive test.   
 POWER ANALYSIS  
This study will include only 3 subjects and so no power analysis will be performed

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICA L, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
All research study staff will maintain certification in human subject’s protection. All study 
investigators and staff will take an active role in developing procedures to protect against or minimize potential risks to the safety and well- being of enrolled participants. Potential research 
subjects will be informed that participation in this study is voluntary and will not be discriminated against if they choose not to participate. Written informed or electronic consent and assent will 
be obtained from participants, and family member/caregivers or legally authorized 
representatives (LAR). Participants will be asked to describe in their own words the study’s 
expectations. Subjects will be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time and 
will be given a copy of the consent form. Subjects will have written assurance that while de -
identified individual subject data may be available to other researchers for research purposes, or 
used to impr ove the software program, only a summary of the results will ever be published or 
otherwise publicly released. Subjects will be assured that participation in the study will be strictly confidential, that any identifying information will be available to the  study staff only, and that no 
identifying information concerning the data and results will be made known.  
 Potential research subjects will be informed that participation in this study is voluntary and that 
their decision to participate will not reflect u pon their relationships with the Center for Memory 
and Aging, Regions Hospital, or HealthPartners. Subjects will be informed that they can withdraw 
from the study at any time and will be given a copy of the consent form.   
 With the electronic consent via REDCap the patient/caregiver providing consent will be able to 
review the consent form themselves and sign electronically with a stylus, touch screen, or cursor using a signature field in REDCap. After the individual has received the link and c an view the 
consent form, the research staff member will go through the consent form with the individual as 
would be typical in person. Following the consent conversation, the staff member will sign and 
e-mail the consent and HIPPA electronically to the patient. The patient will electronically sign, 
certify, and submit the consent and HIPPA in REDCap. A fully executed PDF copy of the consent 
and HIPPA will be provided electronically to the patient for their records as well as saved via the 
auto -archiver fun ction in REDCap.

 27 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provide d by the suspending or terminating party to regulatory authorities .  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will 
promptly inform study participants, the Instituti onal Review Board ( IRB).  Study participants wil l 
be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insu fficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed . 
 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY  
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, 
their staff, the safety and oversight monitor(s), and the sponsor(s). This confidentiality is 
extended to the data being collected as part of this study. Data that co uld be used to identify a 
specific study participant will be held in strict confidence within the research team.  No personally 
identifiable  information from the study will be released to any unauthorized third party without 
prior written approval of the sp onsor/funding agency.  
 All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
 All study regulatory binders will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a secure office. The internal study monitor, representatives of the IRB, or regulatory agencies , may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
 
The study participant’s contact information will b e securely stored at the clinical site for internal 
use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB, Institutional policies, or 
sponsor/funding a gency requirements.  
 
A unique study ID code unrelated to the medical record number or other study subject- specific 
information will be assigned to each patient and used to link data from various sources and 
needed for analysis.  The study number will be us ed on the REDCap  database and Infinitome

 28 
Program.  All imaging data uploaded from the NSC research site will be de -identified and 
uploaded to the Infinitome cloud- based server.   
 
Infinitome program uses an industrial grade cyber security that is superior to what is offered at 
the leading medical device companies.  No personal health information is stored on servers and 
only de -identified scans are stored on a dedicated edge node on encrypted MinIO instances.  
Patient data is only accessed through authenticated calls form Kubernetes pods contained in the 
VPC.  The web service requires user authentication.  Only the data related to a specific facility 
can be retrieved through authenticated calls and are restricted to their use  
 
The PI will ensure all mechanisms used to share data will include proper plans and safeguards for 
the protection of privacy, confidentiality, and security for data dissemination and reuse (e.g., all 
data will be thoroughly de -identified and will not be traceable to a specific s tudy participant). 
Plans for archiving and long -term preservation of the data will be implemented, as appropriate.

Study staff will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, 
documentation and completion.  
 Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 Informed consent --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process 
and 10% of the completed consent documents. Feedback will be provided to study staff to ensure 
proper consenting procedures are followed.  
 Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review documented protocol deviations on an ongoing 
basis and will implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a  level of concern.  
 Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI will provide direct access to all study related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by 
the sponsor/funding agency, and inspection by  local and regulatory authorities.  
 DATA  HANDLING  AND RECORD  KEEPING   
10.1.8.1  DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection will be the responsibility of the research study staff under the supervision of the 
PI. The PI will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness 
of the data reported. Data collection/reporting tools will be developed internally (i.e. CRFs or 
eCRFs (RedCap Database) and source documents).  Data collected and stored electronically will remain confidential and secure (e.g. secured server, encrypted data, password protected file).  
10.1.8.2  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Investigator records will be retained in accordance with regulatory, organizational and sponsor or grantor requirements.  All records will be maintained securely with limited access. Disposal of investigator records will be done in such a manner that no identifying information can be linked 
to research data.  
 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Plans for detecting, reviewing, and reporting deviations from the protocol should be described. 
A This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the study protocol. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site

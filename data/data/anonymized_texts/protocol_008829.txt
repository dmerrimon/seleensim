Background and Study Rationale  
1 Introduction  
 
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including [as applicable include the following regulations as they apply 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56 All episodes of noncompliance will be documented.]  
 The purpose of the study is to use 3D imaging to evaluate the effects of four FDA approved neuromodulator s on facial lines, wrinkles and animation. Participation is available to women who have 
never  had a cosmetic procedure above the malar region nor a treatment with a neuromodulator  with in 12 
months . All subjects will undergo 3D imaging using the VECTRA M3 (Canfield Scientific, Inc, Fairfield, 
NJ) prior to treatment with a neuromodulator  in order to determine their baseline dimensions. Imaging 
will be repeated post injection to determine change  over time . 
 
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
 With an annual rise and over 845% increase since the year 2000, botulinum  toxin neuromodulation is the 
most commonly performed minimally invasive technique in cosmetic surgery [1]. In accordance, much 
research has been produced evaluating the characteristics and efficacy of the various toxin -strain 
modalities currently available for use [2 -4].  
 One such method for evaluation involves 3D photogrammetry. This technology involves for high level feature enhancement and microscopic anatomical evaluation that was not previously possible [5]. 3D photogrammetry has been used for a range of studies in cosmetic and reconstructive medicine and surgery, including its use in evaluating  minimally invasive injection efficacy [6 -8].

 In spite of the research, t here are few FDA approved neuromodulator s for the treatment of dynamic 
ryhtids, most of which have been available for a period of time and have been clinically described [8]. 
More recently , a new er neuromodulator , PrabotulinumtoxinA , has received FDA approval , although few 
studies have captured its onset and effect  compared to currently available neuromodulator s [9]. We aim to 
assess onset and  quantify the efficacy of four  neuromodulator s to help determine  appropriate treatment  
selection.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
The overall study object is to quantify the dynamic strain of  four commonly available neuromodulator s 
using 3D imaging as well as other potential physical measurements  differences over time .  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
To compare the efficacy of four commonly available neuromodulators using 3D imaging to quantify 
dynamic  strain measurements  
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
 
This study is a randomized controlled trial in which patients will be randomly assigned into one of four 
groups: those receiving  onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan, Irvine, California), abobotulinumtoxinA  
(Dysport, Ispen Biopharmacueticals Inc.Cambridge, MA), incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin, Raleigh, NC) 
or prabotulinumtoxinA (Jeuveau, Evolus, Newport Beach, California) .  Each patient will receive FDA 
approved dosages  in which they are assigned in  to treat rhytids within  the glabella, as per FDA approved 
indications. All injections will be performed by a blinded single trained physician (Ivona Percec) 
according to a preset injection plan per FDA approved administration guidelines. Prior to injection patients will be imaged with 3 -dimensional photogrammetry. All pre -procedure images will be evaluated 
for absolute strain performing two types of facial animation: 1) relaxed , and 2) frowning. Subjects will 
return Day 3, 30, 90, and 180, post intervention for re -imaging with the same expressions. Strain will be 
calculated using the same metrics.  
 
3.2 Allocation to Interventional Group  
 
Subjects will be randomized to either the p rabotulinumtoxinA  abobotulinumtoxinA , incobotulinumtoxinA  or 
onabotulinumtoxinA groups . Subjects will be randomized in a one to one fashion using block 
randomization.   
3.3 Study Measures  
 3D photogrammetry imaging of each subject at the pre- determined time points will be obtained using the 
VECTRA M3 (Canfield Scientific, Inc., Fairfield, NJ) , This allows for dynamic measurements of facial 
strain. Each subject's face will be measured along lines of tension when the face is in the relaxed and then frowning. Each facial animation will be recorded as an image. Three -dimensional coordinates will be

 calculated to generate each subject ’s topographic configuration, displacement, and surface strain of each 
detected point on the surface of the face relative to its original reference image.  
 
3.4 Study Endpoints  
3.4.1 Primary Study Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is to quantify the change in dynamic  strain of the glabella area after  injection of 
four neuromodulator s using 3D facial imaging measurements  over time .  
3.4.2 Secondary Study Endpoints  
1) Quantify the change in the dynamic strain of the glabella area after injection between the four 
neuromodulator s  
2) Quantify the change  of dynamic strain measurements of each facial animation over time.  
 3) Correlation of satisfaction as determined by the FACE -Q to the degree of dynamic  strain 
overtime  
4 Study Population and Duration of Participation  
Adult subjects, ages 30- 65, who are interested in rhytid treatment of the glabella with a neuromodulator  
under FDA approved use. Each participant will participate for 180 days.   
4.1 Duration of Study Participation  
 The duration of study participation is a minimum of 180 days. Subjects will receive injections on day- 1, 
and follow up imaging and analysis occurs on day 3, 30, 90 and 180 post intervention.   The overall study duration is estimated 12-  18 months. It may take approximately 6 months to enroll all 
subjects and  complete initial imaging and procedures, 7 months for follow up imaging, and 4- 5 months  
for data analysis. Each individual subject’s  participation time in the study will consist of the duration of 
the initial imaging session ( approximately 20 minutes), procedure ( 15 minutes), follow up imaging ( 20 
min).  
4.2 Total Number of Subjects and Sites  
 140 patients will be enrolled from at a single location, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania .  
4.3 Inclusion Criteria  
• Female  
• 30-65 years of age  
• Interested in glabellar injections to reduce rhytids and facial strain  
• Participants must sign the informed consent form  
4.4 Exclusion Criteria  
• Females  under  30 or above 65 years of age  
• Males

 • Those who have received glabellar injections for rhytids  <12 months  
• Underwent cosmetic surgical procedure above the malar region  
• Those with a condition that affects facial expression, such as prior stroke  
4.5 Subject Recruitment  
 
Patients will be recruited through the plastic surgery  clinic, which is a high- volume practice for those who 
may be interested in cosmetic injections.  Additionally, we plan to use of a f lyer posted throughout the 
health system and campus. Injections to the glabellar region to reduce rhytids are a popular procedure and we do not anticipate significant difficulty  in recruiting willing participants.  
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not i ncluded in this research study. 
 
5 Study Procedures  
This section should list the procedures, observations, measures, etc. that will take place at each of the 
study visits. Every measure , procedure, observation, etc. that was listed in Section in Section 3.3 should 
be included in the study procedures section. A table can supplement this section. An example procedures table is included below in Appendix 15.1
.  
5.1 Screening  
The screening visit involves patient evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This information is readily available on the intake visit and does not deviate from standard of care for a clinic visit, including age and past medical history. Once patients are deemed eligible, the process of informed consent will begin. Informed consent  will take place . 
  
5.2 Study Intervention or Observational Phase  
Randomized Controlled Single Blinded Study  
5.2.1 Visit 1 (sometimes referred to as the baseline visit)  
 
Visit 1 involves screening, consent, baseline imaging to measure dynamic strain , randomization, 
intervention. The subject will be photographed using 3D imaging with multiple facial animations . All pre -
procedure images will be evaluated for absolute strain performing two types of facial animation: 1) relaxed , 2) frowning. Following the  baseline images, subjects will complete a FACE -Q questionnaire and 
then randomized to one of the four neuromodulator s onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan, Irvine, 
California), abobotulinumtoxinA  (Dysport, Ispen Biopharmacueticals Inc.Cambridge, MA) , 
incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin, Raleigh, NC)  or PrabotulinumtoxinA (J euveau, Evolus, Newport Beach, 
California) according to a preset injection plan per FDA approved administration guidelines. The injector will be blinded to the neuromodulator  assigned to the subject via randomization at the time of injection in 
order to decrease any underlying bias  during drug administration.  The syringes will be documented and 
prepared by appropriately trained staff.

5.3 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits will be handled on a case by case basis dependent upon the reasoning for the patients’ visit. If subjects are displaying signs of immediate danger or instability, they will be referred to emergency department or directly admitted. However, unscheduled visits are rare for this type of procedure.  
5.4 Subject Withdrawal  
 Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without impact to their care.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator .  Subjects may also be withdrawn 
following an adverse event that does not allow them to continue with the study. It will be documented 
Glabella 4 Toxin  Study   Page 11

 whether or not  each subject completes the study. Subjects who withdraw early will have one final 
communication  to collect final evaluations and assess for adverse events.   
5.4.1 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Patients must document in a letter asking not to use the data collected and formalize the withdrawal .  
Otherwise, data up until withdrawal  will be available for analysis.   
5.5 Early Termination Visits   
This may be due to the subjects’ own choice or the investigator’s decision. If the investigator makes the 
decision, subjects will be contacted and reasons for study termination will be thoroughly explained.  
6 Statistical Plan  
6.1 Sample Size and Power Determination  
The sample size is based on a previously successful study with the same purpose [1], and an anticipated 
15% drop- out/withdrawal rate.  Significant decrease in the dynamic strain in Ona botulinumtoxinA and 
AbobotulinumtoxinA  were determined at day 4, 14, and 90 post intervention compared to baseline.  We 
are increasing the patient population to account for a potential increase drop out due to the number of 
follow -up visits.

Clinical Trial of Comparative Dynamic Strain Reduction.  Plast Reconstr Surg . 
2016;137(5):1424–1433. 
  
6.2 Statistical Methods  
The primary analysis will be done using chi -squared testing and Fischer’s exact test for categorical 
variables, where applicable, and the paired t -test for continuous variables. Analysis is preformed blinded 
at the end of the study. There is no interim analysis.  
6.3 Control of Bias and Confounding  
 
Block randomization will be employed to assign subjects into each study arm. 40 blocks consisting of 4 
assignments per block will be used in sequence  until study enrollment is complete.  The injecting 
physician will be blinded to which neuromodulator  is assigned at the time of injections prevent any 
underlying bias.   
6.3.1 Baseline Data  
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by standard descriptive statistics (including mean and standard deviation for continuous variables such as age and standard percentages for categorical variables such as race).  
6.3.2 Analysis of Primary Outcome of Interest  
The primary analysis will be done using chi -squared testing and Fischer’s exact test for categorical 
variables, where applicable, and t he paired t -test for continuous variables.

 7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
For FDA regulated studies the FDA defines an adverse event as the following:  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use if a drug in humans 
whether or not considered drug related.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospitalization or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department 
would typically be considered serious.   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events .  
7.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention 
Glabella 4 Toxin  Study   Page 13

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
 or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will 
be recorded and reported immediately.  
7.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The relationship of each adverse event to the study procedur es should be characterized. The  PI or medical 
monitor will determine how the relationship of the AE will be  classified as:  
• likely related  – a well- known effect of the device or clearly not related to the subject or environmental 
factors  
• probably related – is known or suspected effect of device or cannot be readily explained by subject or 
study procedures   
• possibly related – is a possible effect of  the device or can be explained by the subject or study 
procedures  
• unlikely related – is not a suspected effect of the device or can readily be explained by the subject or 
environmental factors   
• unrelated – is not a known effect of the device and can readily be readily and easily explained by the 
subject or environmental factors  
7.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
Investigators and the protocol sponsor (which may or may not be a Penn Investigator) must conform to 
the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible,  
 If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention 
 
 Additionally , all other events (unanticipated problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse device 
effects and subject complaints will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional and federal policies.   
 
7.4.1 Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.

 7.4.2 Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Investigators from all participating sites should report all unexpected and related adverse events, 
regardless of whether they are serious or not, and all unanticipated problems to the sponsor. 
 
Any study- related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse 
event, will be reported to the study sponsor by telephone within 24 hours of the event.  To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by the investigator and emailed to the study sponsor within 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study 
site.  Report serious adverse events by sending via email to:  [Evolus ., Company Call Center:  1- 877-
EVOLUS1 (1 -877-386-5871), Company Email:  EvolusMI@druginfo.com ] 
 
Within the following 48 hours, the investigator will provide further information on the serious adverse event or the unanticipated problem in the form of a written narrative.  This should include a copy of the 
completed Serious Adverse Event form, and any other diagnostic information that will assist the 
understanding of the event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be 
provided promptly to the study sponsor. 
7.4.3 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
For single and multi- site studies each site PI will need to follow their local IRB reporting requirements in addition to 
the protocol outlined reporting.   
7.4.4 Sponsor reporting: Notifying Participating Investigators  
For clinical trials, in addition to reporting certain unanticipated problems and adverse events noted above 
to the FDA, it is the responsibility of the study sponsor to report those same adverse events or findings to participating investigators.  
7.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the site Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above. The lead PI will monitor all AEs reported.   
7.6 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

 7.7 Data Collection and Management  
REDCap will be used to store and main tain the primary study records. The data entered into REDCap will 
be obtained from the study- relevant patient EMRs.  Study personnel will be granted access to this project 
created in REDCap with each user obtaining individual access authenticated by a login system.  Minimal 
patient identifiers will be collected and  stored in the REDCap database.  Patient name and date of birth 
will be collected in REDCap.    Source data will mainly be  from the patient’s EMR.  When the study requires data not normally collected 
in the patient’s EMR, the case report forms wi ll also be the source document. Data from source 
documents (Appendix15.4, case report forms (case report forms definition - Appendix 15.5), will be 
entered into an el ectronic data capturing system. All source documents should be secure in private spaces 
with restricted access.  After Visit 1 the FACE -Q will be sent electronically to the subject for each follow -
up visit via a REDCap survey.   
 
During procurement of data charts will be reviewed in private spaces to ensure the conf identiality of 
acquired data. Data will be stored for up to 7 years after completion of the last follow -up visit of the last 
patient randomized.  Data may  be collected for up to two years following the treatment .     
7.8 Records Retention  
The Principal Investigator at each site is responsible for storing regulatory documents, subject files and 
financial records for the period specified by law.  The time period for maintaining research records is defined first by HIPAA regulations that require any HIPAA -regulated information, authorizations, 
waivers, etc. must be maintained for at least 6 years subsequent to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) acknowledgement of the termination of the research project and secondly by DHHS regulations (45 CFR 46.115) and FDA regulations (21 CFR 56.115) state that IRB records relating to research shall be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research.    
8 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
8.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be closely monitored by the PI and the project manager.  The  PI will be participating and 
the data will be collected by the PI and one other study steam member f rom the patient’s EMR .  The study 
team member will enter the data into the RED Cap and the project manager will monitor the entry to verify 
the compliance with respect to the protocol, data collection and source documents.     
8.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the EC/IRB, the sponsor, 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.

 9 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for 
formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor 
before commencement of this study.  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the EC/IRB for the study.  The 
formal consent of a subject, using the EC/IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that 
subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent. 
9.1 Risks  
All treatments used in this protocol will be used according to the FDA approved intended use.  No 
unexpected risks should occur.  Risks that may be experienced from any injection are swelling bruising, redness, itching, infection, or pain.   
 
There is minimal risk to this study. This study is a prospective observational study of an FDA approved 
cosmetic drugs used as approved.  The study protocol only adds 3D imaging required to make the observational measurements.  The images will be identifying as they are of the face.  All identifying images will be stored on a database or computer behind the firewall and a password.  
 
Potential risks of the neuromodulator s are:  
• dry mouth 
• discomfort or pain at the injection site  
• tiredness  
• headache  
• neck pain  
• eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your 
eyelids, and dry eyes.  
• drooping eyebrows  
• allergic reactions. Symp toms of an allergic reaction may include: itching, rash, red itchy welts, 
wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint.  
• upper respiratory tract infection  
 
Reproductive risks : If patient is of child -bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test may be administered 
prior to injection to confirm negative pregnancy status.  T he effects of this drug/device, there could be 
serious harm to unborn children or children who are breast -feeding. These effects could also harm the 
mother.

 9.2 Benefits  
Subjects participating in this trial may gain insight into the potential  benefit of w rinkle reduction in the 
glabella area from participating in this study.  The risks of this study are the same as those that would 
apply to any injection procedure, such as swelling and low -levels of pain. Additionally, a breach of 
confidentiality is a possibility although we have created measures to mitigate this risk. Although the 
benefits may not be readily apparent on an individual basis, the advancement of knowledge gained will 
serve the medical society and community  
 
There is financial compensation for participation in this study . Subjects will be compensated $15 for each follow -up 
visit and questionnaire completed. The payment will be administered after completion of the fourth and final 
follow -up visit for a maximum total of $60. The subjects will receive the neuromodulators for no charge.  
 
9.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
Subjects participating in this trial will unlikely experience an increase in risk  as this is an observational 
study of FDA approved neuromodulator s. No change in patient  care will happen if the subject is 
consented .  All subjects will be asked to return for four  follow -up visits for observation and surveys .  
9.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol fo r review and approval by the IRB for the study.  The formal 
consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject 
undergoes any study procedure.  The subject, or legally acceptable surrogate, must sign the consent form, and the investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent. Subjects will be consented by 
the study Principal Investigator, or appropriate designee, in a room we have selected in which to perform consent, which is located outside of the clinic. Potential subjects will review the consent form in detail with the person designated to consent (either PI or CRC) and have the ability to take the consent home for further review.

Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 25 1. Rationale 
Recently, after having demonstrated a sedative effect ( 1), a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, 
sham -controlled trial has shown the efficacy and safety of external trigeminal nerve stimulation (e- TNS) 
with the Cef aly® device for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine ( 2). Safety and patient 
satisfaction has been further confirmed by a prospective study on 2,313 patien ts (3). 
Many patients in Europe have reported benefit using t he device only during attacks. In past few years, 
small studies have been performed using the Cefaly ® device as an acute treatment:  
• A medical lab in France ("Spincontrol") implemented an open clinical trial during 28 days on 32 
patients suffering from frequent tension -type headache but not migraine. 66% reported pain 
relief using the device during an attac k.   
• University of Liege conducted a pilot trial on migraine patients ( 4).  Ten patients were asked to 
apply the Cefaly® device as an acute treatment for 3 attacks.  Electro -stimulation provided 
complete pain relief in 13% of attacks, delayed the need for acute medication use by more 
than 30 minutes in 20%, had no effect in 57% and increased the pain in 10%. However, there 
were flaws in the protocol design, including the short duration of the session (20 minutes),  which 
is not sufficient to provide relief based on experiential  feedback from migraineurs. In addition, 
the number of attacks treated was too small, as patients may require several sessions to adapt 
to and al low the intensity of stimulation to rise to a therapeutic level (otherwise it is under a 
minimum threshold of efficacy).   
• Kozminsky ( 5) assessed whether the Cefaly ® device was effective and well -tolerated as rescue 
therapy for migraine sympto ms lasting 72 hours or longer. t-SNS (or e -TNS) therapy with the 
Cefaly device brought about a reduction of migraine- related pain (average minus 46%) as 
rescue therapy in these patients. e -TNS therapy via the Cefaly ® device was well -tolerated, and 
most patients reported that they would consider home therapy if it were affordable.  
• Since March 2015, an open -label pilot trial on the acute treatment of migraine using the 
Cefaly® device has been underway at Columbia University, NY. Patients experiencing a 
migraine attack for at least 3 hours (without use of acute medications during this ti me) and 
having stable pain intensity for at least 1 hour, are eligible to receive a 60 -minute stimulation to 
treat their attack. Pain is assessed on a 10 -point visual analogue scale (VAS) before, after the 1 -
hour treatment, and 2 hours after the beginning of the treatment. The study is still on -going, but 
the results to date confirm prior observations that e -TNS therapy via the Cefaly ® device can 
significantly reduce pain intensity during an acute migraine attack, as measured via the VAS.  
Based on the data from the above studies and preliminary findings from the open -label pilot trial at 
Columbia, it is reasonable to further investigate the efficacy of e -TNS with the Cefaly ® device as an 
acute treatment for migraine via a double -blind, randomized, sham -contr olled trial.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 25 4. Study design  
4.1. General description 
This study is a clinical study with the following characteristics: 
• Multi -center  (4 investigation sites)  
• Prospective 
• Double -blind 
• Sham -controlled  
• Randomized  
4.2. Experimental protocol 
Patients having a stabilized migraine attack will be recruite d during a standard care visit or at an on -
demand appointment . They will report the ir pain score  before the treatment (recruitment phase), after 
1 hour of treatment (acute treatment phase) and finally 2 hours after the beginning of the treatment  
(post -treatment phase). At that moment ( 2 hours after the beginning of the treatment ), patients will 
recei ve rescue medication if necessary.  Rescue medication intake will be reported during the 24 hours 
following the beginning of the treatment. Pain score at 24 hours after the treatment will be reported as 
well. The overall study flow is illustrated in Figure 1. During the different phases the investigator will 
monitor adverse events.  
4.2.1.  Recruitment phase  
Two options are available to recruit patients:  
• Eligible patients can be recruited during a standard care visit if they are experiencing a 
migraine attack having lasted at least 3 hours, with pain stabilized for at least 1 hour, and have 
not used acute migraine medication within the past 3 hours.   
• Patients can also be screened beforehand (having been informed about the study at a 
standard visit or via advertisement), and arrange for an on -demand appointment when they 
are undergoing an attack for at least 3 hours, with pain stabilized for at least 1 hour .  
Patient will receive the information and consent documents and have to sign th ese documents before 
study procedures are initiated . Then the investigator will verify that the patient meets all inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion criteria.  If this is the case , the patient has to give a value on an 11 -point visual 
analog scale (VAS) (0  = no pain, 10  = maximum pain) of the current pain associated with  the migraine 
attack.  
The patient will then be randomized to either the verum or the sham group. To  this end, a unique device 
will be allocated to him/her.  
Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 25 The investigator will then apply the device on the patient and start the stimulation. If the patient cannot 
bear the paresthesia  of the neurostimulation (needs to stabilize intensity before 4 minutes  i.e. 
nociceptive threshold < 5 mA for impulse width of 250 µs), the patient is considered meeting the 
exclusion criteria of allodynia (too low nociceptive threshold). The patient is in this case not included in 
the trial.  
4.2.2.  Acute treatment phase  
When the patient bears more than 4 minutes of neurostimulation, he/she is included in the trial, and the 
neurostimulation continues for the 5 6 remaining minutes of the stimulation. The patient will be 
randomized to receive either:  
• Verum stimulation, with s quare pulse current (100 Hz, 250 µs) at a linearly increasing intensity 
starting at 0 mA up to a maximum of 16 mA after 14 minutes, then remaining stable for the rest 
of the session (46 minutes), OR 
• Sham stimulation with felt paresthesia.  
At the end of the  one-hour  treatment period the patient gives again an estimate of the pain on the 
same VAS.   
During the treatment, the patient can stabilize the intensity by pressing the button  or can stop the 
treatment. The device can  also be stopped accidentally , what interrupts the treatment. When stopped , 
voluntarily or accidentally , the device may not be restarted.  
Duration, intensity and/or interruption will be recorded for each patient thanks to a  built-in electronic 
system in the device.  
In any case, the patient gives the estimate of the pain after 60 minutes.  
4.2.3.  Post-treatment phase  
Two hours after the beginning of the treatment the pa tient will have to give a new estimate of the pain 
on the VAS , provided that the patient didn't take a recue medication before .  
After  the 2 hours, i f needed usual rescue treatment can be administrated to the patient. If so, this is 
recorded by the investigator.  
Patients will also be  instructed to record the pain level  24 hours after the beginning of the treatment . 
They will be contacte d to report this pain level and whether or not rescue medication was taken within 
the 24 hours following the beginning of the treatment . In case of rescue medication intake within the 24 
hours following the treatment the pain level at 24 hours will not be taken into account.  
4.2.4.  Drop -outs, intention -to-treat and last value carried forward  
a) During the treatment one-hour phase  
Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 25 If the patient takes rescue medication  before 1 hour , it is a drop- out because the action of the 
medication  affect s the pain estimate at 1 hour.  
If the patient stops the one -hour treatment and leaves the clinic, it is a drop -out because there is no 
pain estimate at 1 hour.  
If the device stopped working accidentally, it is a drop -out because of technical reason.  
On the  other hand, if a patient does not get the full Cefaly acute treatment (does not want to 
complete the 1 hour stimulation) , but stays available for the 2 hours of the protocol, this patient is kept in 
the trial and considered as an intention -to-treat patien t (as opposed to per protocol patient).  
b) During the post treatment phase  
If the patient takes rescue medication before 2 hours, only the one -hour pain intensity estimate has 
been measured; the last val ue carried- forward method will be applied  for 2 and 2 4 hours pain intensity 
estimate.  
If the patient takes rescue medication at 2 hours or after 2 hours, the last value carried -forward will be 
applied for the 24 hours pain intensity estimate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 of 25 6. Medical device and treatment  
6.1. Device description 
The Cefaly ® is a small, portable product, which is meant to be worn on the forehead by attachment to 
a self -adhesive electrode. Two 1.5V AAA batteries provide power to the Cefaly® device.  The Cefaly® 
gener ates very precise electrical impulses that permit stimulation of the nerve fibers . The device acts by 
stimulation of the upper branch of the trigeminal nerve.  
The device has been approved by the FDA as a class II therapeutic device indicated for the 
prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine in patients 18 years of age or older.  
The Cefaly® device ( Figure 2) is comprised of the following specifications:  
• Dimensions: 163 mm x 170 mm x 40 mm.  
• Weight: 30 g.  
 
Figure 2 - Cefaly®  device  
The device is connected to the body via a self -adhesive electrode ( Figure 3) applied on the forehead. 
The device specific for the trial will run sessions of 60 minutes. The Cefaly® electrode is 94 mm long an d 
30 mm high. It makes the interface between the device and the skin. This electrode has been approved 
by the FDA together with the device . 

Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 25  
Figure 3 - Cefaly®  electrode 
6.2. Device technology 
The Cefaly ® is an external cranial neurostimulator designed for supraorbital neurostimulation (also 
known as external trigeminal nerve stimulation: e -TNS). Trigeminal nerve stimulation induces a sedative 
effect on the central nervous system  (1). 
The Cefaly ® generates electrical impulses that are transmitted transcutaneously via a bipolar self -
adhesive electrode placed on the forehead. 
The Cefaly ® operates on direct electrical energy, which is output f rom two 1.5V AAA batteries.  
The Cefaly® delivers electrical energy in the form of rectangular biphasic pulses. The intensity is 
increasing linearly to reach a maximum of 16 mA after 14 minutes (and then stays constant for 46 
minutes). The pulse frequency i s 100 Hz. The pulse width is 250 µs. 
If the user feels that the intensity becomes too high, a simple pressure on the button will stabilize the 
intensity for the rest of the session.  
The supraorbital electrode is designed in order to cover both sides of the supratrochlearis and 
supraorbitalis nerves, which are branches of the trigeminal nerve ( Figure 4).  
The electrical impulses generated by the Cefaly® device are transmitted transcutaneously via the 
supraorbital electrode to excite (trigger action potentials) the supratrochlearis and supraorbitalis nerves.  
Supratrochlearis and supraorbitalis (or s upratrochlear and supraorbital) nerves belong to the upper 
branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1). Therefore the supraorbital neurostimulation is also known as external trigeminal nerve stimulation.  
 

Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 25  
Figure 4 - The electrode placed  on the forehead covers the supratrochlearis and supraorbitalis nerves  
6.3. Mechanism of action 
The Cefaly ® device generates electrical impulses. Electrical impulses get out of the device via 2 
metallic contacts. Contacts are in connection with 2 conductive areas on the self -adhesive electrode. 
The self -adhesive electrode is applied on the forehead. Therefore e lectrical impulses generated by the 
Cefaly ® device are running through the metallic contacts then through the electrode in order to carry 
out excitation on the nerve fibers  just located under the forehead skin i.e. supratrochlearis and 
supraorbitalis (or s upratrochlear and supraorbital) nerves which belong to the trigeminal nerve. 
Consequently electrical impulses generated by the Cefaly ® trigger signals (action potentials) on 
supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves or trigeminal nerve. Repetitive excitation of trigeminal nerve is a 
neuromodulation of the trigeminal system. Neuromodulation of the trigeminal system induces a sedative 
effect on the central nervous system and a trigeminal nociceptive threshold modification.  
6.4. Use during the trial  
The investigator will apply the device on the patient’s head. A session of 60 minutes will be applied. If 
the patient experiences discomfort during the stimulation, he or she can stabilize the intensity of 
stimulation at any time by pushing the “on” button  of the device (the current intensity will then remain 
stable until the end of the session).  The patient should at least let the device increases the intensity for 4 
minutes in order to be included in the trial: before this point, the patient’s nociceptive  threshold is 
considered too low because of allodynia.  
6.5. Sham device 
As this study is sham -controlled, a sham neurostimulator has to be pr ovided. The sham stimulator is  
identical in shape and colour as the verum Cefaly® device. Also, it will beep and flash i dentically to the 
verum Cefaly® device . No difference will exist between the sham and verum devices and it won’t be 
possible for the patient as for the investigator to know which device is verum or sham.  

Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 25 The only difference will be in the stimulation para meters.  The sham stimulator will contain a stimulation 
program with a low frequency , which will be sufficient for the patient to feel paresthesia similar to that 
produced by the verum, but will not induce a sedative effect to the central nervous system.  
The sham device has been validated in a clinical trial  on 128 subjects (62 verum and 66 sham) . 
Following the trial, the patients were indeed unable to distinguish whether they received an active or a 
sham device.  
6.6. Medication during the trial 
No medication can be used during the 2 hours of the study (1 hour of Cefaly stimulation followed by 1 
hour of observation). Any rescue medication can be used after these 2 hours and have to  be recorded  
during the 24 hours following the beginning of the tre atment . 
If a patient wants a rescue medication during the one -hour treatment phase it is a drop -out, if the 
patient wants a rescue medication after the one- hour treatment phase but before the 2 hours of the 
study the last value carried -forward is applied. 
6.7. Device provisioning 
The promoter will deliver the specific devices directly to the investigators.  The devices will be delivered 
by set s of even number of verum and sham devices , ensu ring at least one  device per patient . The 
investigator will not be able to  distinguish both. A single device cannot be reused on different patients . 
Each device will bear a unique number that has to be reported in the patient’s CRF and will allow to 
identify, at the end of the study, whether the patient used a sham or verum device. Electrodes will be 
delivered in enough quantity  to ensure to have one per patient.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 25 7. Practical study modalities  
7.1. Measures 
Pain score.  In order to evaluate the modification of pain score  from baseline to 1-hour  treatment and to 
2-hour  treatment, patients will be asked  to give an indication on the pain level using a visual analogue 
scale (VAS) counting eleven levels (0  = no pain, 10  = maximum pain)  at the recruitment  phase (before 
applying the treatment) , right after the treatment phase (1 hour) , 2 hours after the beginning of the 
treatment  and at 24 hours after the beginning of the treatment . 
Rescue medication after the treatment . The investigator will also record whether the patient uses 
another acute medication right after the 2 hours.  Patients w ill also be contacted 24 hours after the 
beginning of the treatment to report whether or not rescue medication was taken within the 24 hours  
following the beginning of the treatment . 
The following table depicts when the different measures will be  made :

7.2. Calendar 
The study is foreseen to start in  December  2016 and to be finished by July 2016.  
7.3. Blinding 
Blinding between verum  and sham devices has been previously validated in a trial on 128 patients (62 
verum and 66 sham).  A new device will be used for each study patient. Sham and verum stimulators 
and electrodes will look alike. Verum will use a high frequency impulse and sham  a low frequency. Both 
devices will generate paresthesia on the forehead to ensure blinding. Patients will therefore not be able 
to know if it is the active neurostimulation or the sham.   
The investigator and research coordinator will be blinded from which  device the patient has (sham or 
verum). A built -in electronic system will record the treatment delivered to each patient.   
The treatment allocation will be concealed using the following procedure. Verum  and sham stimulators 
will be programmed by the manufacturer Cefaly Technology . They will be sent to each investigator by 
blocks with equal number of verum and sham  devices . The only indication on the device box will be a

8.1. Data management  
The data will be included in th e case report form ( CRF) that will be prov ided  by the investigator  to the

or verum), the device number will be collected in the CRF as well.  
8.2. Statistics 
8.2.1.  Sample size  
Results from a randomized controlled  trial on an acute migraine treatment  (6) showed in the placebo 
group a reduction in mean pain score of 10% after 1 hour and 14% after 2 hours, compared to baseline . 
The results of the  pilot trial on the acute treatment of migraine using the Cefaly® device showed a 
reduc tion in mean pain score of 59% after 1 hour and 55% after 2 hours. The standard deviation related 
to mean pain score was 2.42 after 1 hour and after 2 hours. Based on these results we could assume a 
difference in mean pain score of 2.83 after 1 hour and 2. 40 after 2 hours between the active and 
placebo groups. A minimum of 17 patients in each group would be statistically required to detect a 
significant difference in mean pain score after 1 hour and after 2 hours, with a power of 80% and at 
two-sided alpha level of 5%, using a t- test for two independent samples.  
A previous study reported 71% of patients from the placebo group using rescue medication compared 
to 41.33% for active groups on average (7). Considering these percentages, 43 patients in each group 
would have been statistically required to detect a significant difference in rescue medication use after 24 hours with a power of 80% and at two -sided alpha level  of 5%, using a proportion test for two 
independent samples.  
Overall, at least 43 patients in each group should allow to detect a significant difference between 
active and placebo groups in mean pain score after 1 hour and after 2 hours, and in rescue medi cation 
use. As the trial will be conducted in three different centres, the number of patients is rounded to 45 in 
each group  (i.e. 15 patients per group and per centre). Consequently, 90 patients will be recruited.  
8.2.2.  Statistical methods  
• All relevant general,  safety and efficacy data will be descriptively summarized at each time 
point.  
• Continuous data will be summarized by the number of subjects (N), the arithmetic mean, the 
standard deviation, the coefficient of variation as a percentage (CV%), the median,  the inter -
quartile  range , the minimum and the maximum value.  
• Categorical data will be summarized by absolute (N) and relative (%) frequency tables.  
• Where considered as relevant, the study data will also be graphically depicted.  
Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 25 • Imputation of missing data wil l be performed according to the last value carried forward 
method.  
• Analyses will be conducted on an intent -to-treat (ITT) basis, i.e . including all subjects who used 
the study device for more than 4 minutes (see in exclusion criteria 8. Allodynia), did not  take 
rescue medication before the 1 hour and reported pain at 1 hour.  
• A sub-analysis of the per -protocol patients (those receiving the complete 1 -hour treatment) will 
be performed as well.

9.1. Definition 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable  and unintended sign, symptom or disease, 
regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical device or procedure that occurs during 
the course of the study.  
In all cases, etiology will have to be researched and identified as soon as possible.   
Serious Adverse E vent  (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization, results in 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
The investigator is responsible of transmission of SAE to the  promoter  and the promoter  is responsible of 
transmission of the SAE d eclaration to the authorities.  
9.2. Gradation  
Adverse events should be categorized by the investigator according to severity:  
• Mild:  perception of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated . 
• Moderate:  cumbersome  enough to impact subject activities.  
• Severe:  modifying considerably  patient activities, or impairing , or constituting a threat for the life 
of the patient.  
9.3. Causality 
Main factors to take into account to determine the causality are:  
• Events chronology,  
• AE evolution when the product is not used anymore or used again , 
• Existence of another etiology  that could explain the AE,  
• Existence o f similar published or known AE . 
9.4. Expected AE 
The expected AEs  of the Cefaly ® are: 
Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 25 • Reversible skin irritation at the place of electrode 
• Allergic reaction to the gel of the electrode (1 out of 1000)  
• Headache after the session (0.52%)  
• Feeling of fatigue  
9.5. AE collection 
The patients are instructed to report all AE s to the investigator during the 2 hours of the protocol . AEs will 
be analyzed by the investigator who will document it in the CRF.  
All AE s will be collected in the CRF, specifying:  
• Their nature  
• Start date and duration  
• Causality (according to investigator's opinion)  
• Countermeasures and results  
If the AE is a SAE, the promoter should be notified as soon as possible.  
9.6. Investigator's  respo nsibility with respect to a SAE. 
9.6.1.  SAE Notification  
Each SAE will be described on the specific form with as much detail as possible. The information s to be 
communicated to the promoter are:  
• Patient identification  
• AE severity  
• Start and end date  
• Detailed description  
• AE evolution  
• Current diseases and relevant medical history of the patient  
• Patient received treatments  
• Causality link with the device under test   
The investigator should also join to the AE report, each time it is possible:  
• A copy of the hosp italization  report  
• A copy of all complementary exam results performed, including relevant negative results and 
joining the laboratory reference values  
• Or any other document that he/she found useful and relevant  
• Possibly, a copy of the autopsy report  
Study 50213 - Protocol v1.0, 11/07/2016  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 25 All documents will be made anonymous and will bear the identification number of the subject.  
9.6.2.  Modalities of notification to the promoter  
All SAE, no matter its causality relationship with the device under test, should be declared by the 
investigator:  
• To promoter (represented by the CEO)  
• As fast as possible  
• By e-mail:  see the specific form  in the CRF  
9.6.3.  Monitoring    
The monitoring is ensured until total recovery, stabilization or death of the patient, on common decision of the monitor and the investigator. Related costs are covered by the promoter.  
9.6.4.  Notification period  
It is the investigator responsibility to notify the promoter about any SAE occurring:  
• During the whole study period  
• At any time, after the end of the study if the investigator thinks this could be rela ted to the 
device under test during the study (if no other cause than the research could reasonably explain it).  
9.7. Notification by the promoter to the authorities 
In case the promoter is notified of an unexpected AE, he will report it directly to the n ational competent 
authority ( FDA) and to the relevant central Investigational Review Board  (Columbia University IRB ). 
Similarly, if a new fact relevant to the study or to the device appears that could impact the safety of the subjects participating to the study, the promoter takes the appropriate emergency measures. The 
promoter also notifies both the FDA and the IRB of t his new fact and of the taken measures.  
The delay to inform the authorities will be 2 days in case of death or life threatening AE, and 15 days in 
case of other unexpected AE or new fact. An extra delay of 8 days is foreseen to provide a follow -up 
report.  
If necessary, the investigator will ask the subjects participating to the study to confirm their consent 
based on the updated information.

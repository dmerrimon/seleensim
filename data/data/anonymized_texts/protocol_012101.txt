unblinding - replaced “pharmacists” w ith “delegate(s)” to clarify that Investigator 
delegate(s) in addition to Investigator w ill be provided access to the unblinding of 
treatment .  This change allow s alignment w ith IXRS setup for this study. 
Section 6.3, Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding -ensuring blinding -
clarified that no other members of the study team, other than those listed e arlier w ithin this 
section, w ill have access to the randomization list during the conduct of the study.
Section 6.5 -Table 7 -Prohibited medications -updated w ording adding “adrenal 
insufficiency” now  reads “Any immunomodulators or immunosuppressives (c orticosteroids 
with systemic effects such as oral, parenteral, or intra -articular administration for reasons 
other than asthma are not allow ed. However, corticosteroid treatment of adrenal 
insufficiency is allow ed).”
Section 6.5 Table 5 - Restricted Medica tions table has been updated to include restrictions 
on use of immunomodulators and immunosuppressives.
Section 7.1, Discontinuation of study treatment - under “development of any study specific 
criteria for discontinuation, any malignancy” added the follo wing statement “except 
subjects who develop basal cell carcinoma or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the 
skin, provided that the malignancy is excised and determined to have clean margins.”  This 
change allow s subjects who have had excision of their le sions, w hich is considered 
curative, to continue study treatment.

when at least tw o of the follow ing attempts.”
Section 7.3.1, -The section “Discontinuation or suspension of entire study and site 
closure” was added.  This w as in order to provide information on Sponsor study 
termination, additional information about site closure and study completion. 
Section 8.2.4, Vital Signs -revised text to specify that the pulse rate w ill be obtained before 
blood pressure only if the manual measurement technique is used.  This is to re flect that 
when the automated device is used, the pulse and blood pressure measurements are taken 
simultaneously.
Section 8.2.4, Vital Signs -removed “in degrees Celsius” as the units of body temperature 
measurement.  This is to accommodate the local guid elines as some regions may not 
measure in degrees Celsius.
Section 8.3.8, Adverse Events of Special Interest - added “systemic” in front of antiviral 
medications.  The revised text reads: “Requiring treatment w ith systemic antiviral 
medications, intravenou s antibiotics or medication for helminth parasitic infection.”  To 
clarify that infections treated w ith local antivirals are not considered as adverse events of 
special interest.
Section 8.3.8, Adverse Events of Special Interest -added “Adrenal Crisis” as an AESI. 
Section 8.4.2.2, Paternal exposure -removed “Male subjects should refrain from fathering 
a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks (5 half -lives) follow ing the last 
dose.” To align w ith revised IB version 4.2.
Section 8.4.2.2, Paternal exposure -added “in the Pregnancy Report Form” to clarify 
where outcome of all pregnancies w ill be reported.  This change aligns w ith eCRF design. 
Section 8.4.2.2, Paternal exposure -added “Consent from the partner must be obtained 
before the Pregnancy Report Form is completed.” To clarify that consent is being obtained 
from the pregnant partner prior to completing the pregnancy report form.

below should only be implemented during the COVID- 19 pandemic. For further details, please 
refer to Appendix H.
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, changes are being implemented to ensure the safet y of trial 
subjects, to maintain co mpliance wit h good clinical pract ices, and to minimize risks to trial 
integrity. Where allowable by  local Heal th Authoriti es, ethics committees and healthcare 
provi der gui delines (e.g. hospital po licies), these changes include:
The opti on of  home visit s including home administration of Investigat ional Product (IP) 
must be performe d by a qualified Healt h Care Professio nal (HCP). Addit ional 
inform ation related to the visit can be obtained remotely  by phone call  and/or vi deo 
conference. The rationale for this change is to minimize the risk of subjects missing 
scheduled IP administrati on and visi t assessments due to inabilit y/unwillingness to visit 
the site during the COVID -19 pandemic. During home visits, safet y laboratory  samples 
may be obtained post IP administration and during the 1 -hour observat ion peri od. The 
rationale for thi s change is to allow processing of samples at the site according to the 
laboratory  manual. Other sam ples shoul d be collected pri or to IP administration or not 
collected. 
The opti on of  a visi t at an al ternat ive location including administration of IP and study
assessments per the SoA, away  from infect ion risk zones or closer to the subject’s ho me. 
The rati onale for this change is to minimize the risk of subjects missing scheduled IP 
administration and visit assessments due to inability/unwillingness to visit th e site during 
the COVID -19 pandemic. 
Remote vi sits (phone call and/or video conference) to replace on -site visi ts, if subjects 
cannot attend the visit s at the study  site where necessary . The rati onale for thi s change is 
to ensure continued assessments and collection of informat ion for visits that cannot be 
done at the site during the COVID -19 pandemic.
Re-consent will be obtained verbally  if allowed by l ocal and regi onal guidelines. The 
signed COVID -19 Addendum to ICF should be obtained when possible. The rationale for

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 36(144) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426this change is to ensure that the subject agrees to the changes implemented during the 
COVID -19 pandemic while minimizing the risk to subjects of COVID -19 exposure.
Subjects who are not able to attend an on -site EOT visi t in the predecessor study  due to 
the COVID -19 pandemic and are eligible for the DESTINATION study , are all owed to 
roll-over to the DESTINATION study  by the end of safet y follow-up of  the predecessor 
study . The rati onale for this change is to give subjects w ho di d not com plete an on -site 
EOT vi sit due to COVID -19 the possibilit y to partici pate in the study .

Number of Subjects
Subjects who have continued to receive IP and attended the EOT visit in one of the predecessor 
studi es may be eligible to enroll in the study . It is ant icipated that approximately 975 subjects 
will enro ll worldwide. This assumes that 90% of subjects in the predecessor studies co mplete 
dosing, and that 90% of those continue into the Long -Term  Extensio n Study  (i.e. approximately  
860 subjects transit ioning from D5180C00007 and approximately 115 subjects transit ioning 
from D5180C00009). 
Treatments and Treatmen t Duration:
The study  will consist of a screening/randomizat ion visit at the EOT Visit for the predecessor 
studi es. If eligible, the first dose of IP will be administered at this visit. A treatment period will 
follow whereby all subjects will cont inue on t reatment up to a total of 104 weeks (including 
predecessor study  treatm ent peri od durati on). All  subjects will  be re -randomized in the LTE 
study  to m aintain the blinding. Subjects previously randomized in one of the predecessor studies 
to the 210 mg tezepe lumab Q4W SC arm, will be assigned and remain on 210 mg tezepelumab 
Q4W SC dosing in the LTE study . Subjects randomized to placebo arm in the predecessor 
studi es will be re -rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to either 210 mg tezepelumab or placebo, both 
administere d Q4W SC. Given the rando mizat ion scheme o f subjects in the predecessor studies, 
this will give an overall subject distribut ion of 3:1 (tezepelumab: placebo), assuming a similar 
number of subjects rollover fro m each arm  in the predecessor studies. During t he treatment 
period, IP will be administered from day of randomizat ion in the LTE study  until week 100. No 
IP will be administered at week 104. Subjects that complete the treatment period in the LTE 
study  will either com plete a further 12 -week follo w-up pe riod (assessments as listed in the 
schedule of assessments in Table 1)

2Introduction
Asthma i s a chronic inflammatory  airway  disorder caused by  the interacti on of genet ic and 
environmental factors. It is characterized by widespread, variable, and reversible airflow 
obstructi on, ai
rway  inflammat ion, excessive mucus production; and airway hyperresponsiveness 
that lead to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing ( The 
Collaborative Study  on the Genet ics of Asthma (CSGA) 1997 ).
Progressive patho logic airway rem odeling and scar ring m ay occur in persistent asthma result ing 
in only partially reversible or irreversible airway obstruction ( Pascual and Peters 2005).
The eti ology of asthma is thought to be mult i-factori al, influenced by both genet ic and 
environmental mechanisms. The majorit y of cases ari se when a person beco mes hypersensit ive 
to allergens. Despite the availabilit y of multiple therapeuti c opti ons, asthma cont inues t o be a 
major healt h probl em. Worl dwide, asthma current ly affects approximately  300 milli on peopl e; 
by 2020, asthma is expected to affect 400 million peopl e (Partri dge 2007 ). Each y ear in the US,

visits, 479,000 hospitalizat ions (DeFrances et al 2008), and 3400 deaths ( Centers f or Di sease 
Control  and Prevent ion 2017 ).
Approximately  5% to 10% of asthma subjects have severe asthma, which may be inadequately 
controlled by ICS and LABA combinat ions together with addit ional controller therapies 
(Brightling et al 2008 ). These subjects are at risk of asthma exacerbat ions (Tough et al  1998 , 
Turner et al 1998 ) and have the greatest medical need among the asthmatic populat ion today . 
Subjects with severe asthma represent the greatest economic cost (>50% of total asthma -related 
healt h care costs) ( Antonicelli et al  2004 , Serra Batlles et al 1998 , Barnes and Kuitert 1996 ).
2.1 Study rationale
There are two Phase 3 studies current ly ongo ing.
The Navigator study  (D5180C00007) i s designed to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on the 
AAER, l ung f unction, asthma control, and safet y in adult and ado lescent subjects with 
uncontrolled severe asthma receiving medium or high -dose ICS pl us at l east one additional 
asthma controller medicat ion with or wi thout OCS. This will allow the benefit -risk profile of 
tezepel umab in the treatment of severe asthma to be further characterized and to enable a better 
understanding of how treatment with tezepelumab should be utilized in the management of 
severe asthma. 
The Source study  (D5180C00009) is designed to demonstrate the abilit y of tezepelumab versus 
placebo to enable reductions of the daily  maintenance OCS use in adult asthmat ic subjects who 
are al so using high -dose ICS pl us LABA wi th or wit hout other asthma controller therapy , while 
maintaining asthma control.
Tezepel umab is a fully  humanized immunogl obulin that binds to the TSLP and prevents it 
interact ion with the TSLP receptor. TSLP has an upstream and centra l role in the init iation of the 
immune responses and is expected to have an impact on a broad range of cell t ypes. In the 
predecessor studies the safet y of tezepel umab dosing is being studied over a 52 week and 48 
week treatm ent peri od in the D5180C00007 a nd D5180C00009 studies respect ively. However, it 
is important to further understand the safety  with continued dosing of tezepelumab for an 
additional year. The purpose of this Long -Term  Extensi on (LTE) study  is to con tinue to 
characterize the safet y profil e of tezepel umab administration in asthma subjects who have 
completed ei ther of the 2 predecessor studies.

Tezepelumab -D5180 C00018
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 46 (144 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Biologic therapies have been shown to reduce AAER in severe asthma subjects who are 
uncontrolled with medium to high dose ICS and addit ional asthma controller medications. 
Omalizumab provi ded benefi t for a subgroup of subjects with proven react ivity to an 
aeroallergen and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels who remain inadequ ately 
controlled with ICS plus LABA (XOLAIR US PI 2003). Additional bio logics, m epolizumab, 
reslizumab, benralizumab and dupilumab, have recent ly been approved for severe asthma wit h 
an eosinophilic phenoty pe (NUCALA US PI 2015 ; XOLAIR US PI 2003 ; CINQAIR US PI 
2016; FASENRA US PI 2017; DUPIXENT US PI 2018). Bio logics targeti ng IL -5 and IgE are 
now included in internat ional treatm ent gui delines ( GINA 201 8) as an add
-on treatment to 
subjects uncontrolled wit h ICS/LABA treatment. However, even when using current ly available 
biologics, substant ial proporti ons of subjects continue to experience exace rbations and m ay 
benefit from agents that target different mo lecular pathways ( Wenzel 2016 , Froi dure et al , 2016 , 
Swedin et al, 2017 ). Therefore, despite these addit ional therapeutic options, th ere is still a clear 
unmet medical need among subjects with severe asthma, independent ly of IgE status or 
eosinophil level, who are unable to gain co mplete asthma control using currently available 
therapi es.
Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is an epit helial cell -derived cy tokine that i s produced in 
responses to proinflammatory  stimuli (e.g. infect ious, allergic and environmental st imuli) and 
traum a. TSLP has an upstream and central role in the init iation of immune responses, and can 
activate a broad rang e of cell t ypes including eosinophils, mast cells, T cells, dendrit ic cells, type 
2 innate lympho id cells and basophils ( Watson and Gauvreau, 2014 ). Classically, TSLP may be a 
critical com ponent in the init iation and perpetuation of the T helper 2 (Th2) response and the 
resul ting cascade of cy tokines associ ated wi th Th2 driven asthma ( Kaur and Bright ling, 2012 ). 
Asthma i s recognized as a heterogeneous disease. There are subsets of subjects that do not 
exhibit Th2- associ ated disease ( Wenzel 2012 ), and there are em erging data that TSLP may also 
mediate non -allergic (non -T helper cell 2) inflammation ( Tanaka et al, 2009 , Ziegler et al , 2013 ).
Given that TSLP is an upstream and pleiotropic cytokine, the blockade of TSLP is therefore 
anticipated to have broad impact on the spectrum of inflammatory  responses seen in asthma.
Tezepel umab is a fully  human immunogl obulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) di rected 
against TSLP. Tezepelumab binds to human TSLP and prevents its interaction with TSLP 
receptor (TSLPR). Owing to the central role of TSLP in init iating and maintaining a Th2 
response, ant i-TSLP therapy  may provi de an opportuni ty to treat the upstream underlying 
mechanisms of asthma by reversing the established inflammatory  responses to asthma triggers.
Results of a co mpleted inhaled allergen challenge study in 31 adult subject s with mild atopic 
asthma (Study  20101183) dem onstrated that tezepelumab attenuated the LAR and EAR to 
allergen challenge, as measured by the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the percent fall in FEV1 
and the maximum percent fall in FEV1. Tezepelumab also att enuated the increase in FeNO value

tezepel umab dem onstrated an acceptable safet y profile in subjects with mild atopic asthma. No 
subjects developed anti -drug ant ibodie s (ADA) after receiving tezepelumab. Based upon these 
data, MedImmune/AstraZeneca have conducted a rando mized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, 
dose range finding study  in asthmat ics who were inadequately  controlled wi th medium  or hi gh 
dose ICS/l ong-acting β2 agonist (LABA) wit h or without other controller medications.
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929
-1146 was a Phase 2b mult icentre, mult inational, dose -ranging, double -
blind, randomized, parallel -arm, placebo -controlled study  to eval uate the effect of 3 dose levels 
oftezepel umab on the AER in adult subjects with inadequately  controlled, severe asthma. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dose levels o f SC tezepel umab (280 m g 
Q2W, 210 m g Q4W, 70 m g Q4W) or pl acebo (Q2W) for 50 weeks. Anomalous data at a single 
site was i dentified fo llowing com pletion of this study  and due to GCP non -compliance, all data 
relating to 34 subjects fro m this si te were excluded and the CSR revised. Consequent ly, a total of 
550 subjects received at least 1 dose of tezepelumab or placebo. Stati stically significant 
annualized AER reductions of 62%, 71%, and 66% for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 
mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with placebo were observed in the ITT 
popul ation (p<0.001).  
After repeated SC ad ministration, mean serum trough concentration increased over time and 
achieved steady -state by  week 12. Tezepelumab exhibited linear pharmacokinet ics (PK) across 3 
doses. A l ow incidence of ADA was observed across all treatment subjects. 6 (4.3%) placebo 
subjects and 7 (1.7%) total tezepelumab subjects who had no detectable ADA at baseline had 
detectable ADA post -treatm ent; no subjects develo ped neutralizing ADA in the study . There was 
no impact of ADA on tezepelumab PK. The results of this study  did not i dentify safet y signals 
associ ated wi th tezepel umab for any  dosing regimen. The overall incidence of TEAEs were 
similar between the placebo (65.9%) and the tezepelumab (66.0%) dose groups. A majorit y of 
subjects had TEAEs that were Grade 1(mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severit y and not rel ated to 
investigat ional product. TEAEs that resulted in permanent discont inuat ion of invest igational 
product occurred in few subjects, and at a similar incidence between the tezepelumab (5 subjects 
[1.2%] overall) and plac ebo (1 subj ect [0.7%]) groups. Overall, tezepelumab was well -tolerated 
with an acceptable safet y profile and no safet y signals were ident ified.
2.3 Benefit/risk assessment
In order to evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance for tezepelumab, preclinical and clinical data 
have been taken into considerat ion, as well as a review of the available information for 
monoclonal antibodies that are approved for and are in development for the treatment of severe 
asthma. Benefits for tezepelumab over placebo include a cl inically meaningful reduct ion in 
asthma exacerbations, improvement in lung function and asthma control metrics.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 48 (144 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Tezepel umab has been well tolerated with no safety  signals ident ified in studi es to date. No 
serious allergic reactions or anaphylact ic react ions considered related to tezepelumab were 
reported in the Phase 2 program. Alt hough TSLP suppressio n could theoretically have 
unant icipated immune -related si de effects impairing host defense against certain infect ions, there 
is no clear preclinical or clin ical evidence supporting such a role, and no safet y signals rel ated to 
infect ions have been detected in the tezepelumab program.
The benefit/risk assessment for tezepelumab in severe asthma based on the development through 
Phase 2 i s favourable. The benefi t / risk assessment will be further defined by results fro m the 
Phase 3 program.

of Treatm ent (EOT) vi sit from the predecessor studies D5180C00007 (Week 52) or 
D5180C00009 (Week 48). The first dose of IP will be administered the same day. During the 
screening/rando mizat ion visit, subjects must undergo all asse ssments per Table 1.  Pri or to 
rando mizat ion the subjects must meet all inclusio n/exclusion criteria for LTE study . If a subject 
does not m eet all inclusio n criteria or m eets any  excl usion cri teria as per 5.1and sect ion5.2, the 
subject will be screen failed and would then complete the safet y follow
-up porti on of the 
predecessor study . Further details are specified in section 5.4. 
A treatment period duration of 52 weeks for subjects who previously co mpleted study  
D5180C00007 or 56 weeks for subjects who previously co mpleted the D5180C00009 will 
follow. The l ast dose of IP will be administered at Week 100. EOT visit will be conducted at 
Week 104. IP will not be administered at week 104. This is fo llowed by a 12-week fo llow-up 
period whi ch includes 2 follow -up visit s (Vi sit 16 and Visi t 17).

4.2 Scientific rationale for study design
This is a global study  designed to continue to investigate the safety  and tol erabilit y of 
tezepel umab versus placebo in severe asthma subjects receiving medium or high dose ICS plus at 
least one addit ional asthma controller medicat ion, wi th or wi thout chro nic oral corticosteroids 
(OCS) and/or other asthma controllers for an addit ional year. The placebo -controlled study  
design will help to contextualize endpo ints by providing a direct comparator. During the blinded 
treatm ent phase (Visits 1 -15), half the subjects who were previously assigned to the placebo 
regimen during the predecessor study  will be reassigned to receive tezepelumab, while those who 
received act ive drug during the predecessor study will cont inue on that same regimen. Subjects 
rando mized to p lacebo in this study serve as co mparators to support interpretabilit y of the data 
collected for subjects rando mized to tezepelumab. TSLP has an upstream and central role in the 
initiation of the immune responses and is expected to have an impact on a broad range of cell 
types. In the predecessor studies the safet y of tezepel umab dosing is being studied over a 52

4.3 Justification for dose
This is a Long -Term  Extensi on study  to gather m ore informati onon the safet y and tol erabili ty of 
210 m g Tezepelumab Q4 weeks. Only subjects who have continued to receive investigational 
product and have attended the EOT visit in one of the predecessor studies may be eligible to 
enroll into this study  if they fulfil t he inclusio n/exclusio n criteria. Therefore, the dosage will 
remain the same as that which was given in the predecessor studies.
4.4 End of study definition
The end o f study  is defined as the last expected visit/contact of the last subject undergoing the 
study .
A subject i s considered to have co mpleted the study when he/she has co mpleted his/her last 
scheduled contact.

acceptable methods of contraception.  
Adolescent specific recommendat ions: If subject is female and has reached menarche 
or has rea ched Tanner stage 3 breast development (even if not having reached 
menarche), the subject will be considered a female of child bearing potential.
A highly effect ive method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low

Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either 
perm anent ly sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral 
salpingectom y), or who are postm enopausal . Women will be considered 
postm enopausal if they  have been amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned date 
of rando mizat ion without an al ternat ive medical cause. The following age specific 
requi rements apply :
oWomen <50 yea rs old woul d be consi dered postmenopausal if they  have been

Please Note: During the COVID -19 pandemic, if allowed by  local/regional gui deline s, IP 
preparati on and administration may be performed at the subject’s ho me or at alternative site by a 
qualified HCP. Please refer to Appendix Hfor further details.
Dose Preparation 
Each vial should be visually  inspected pri or to dose preparation. The IP will be provided to the 
study  sites as a col orless to slight ly yellow clear solut ion contained in a 5 mL single use glass 
vial to be stored at 2°C to 8°C unt il used. If defects are noted with the IP, the invest igator and 
site monitor shoul d be notified immediately. Preparation of IP must be performed by a qualified 
person (e.g., pharmacist or invest igator) at the site.
The IP does not contain preserv atives and any unused portion must be discarded. Preparation of 
the IP i s to be performed asept ically. Total in -use storage time from  needle puncture of the IP 
vial to start of administration should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature. If storage time 
exceeds this limit, a new dose must be prepared from new vials.
To prepare the subject’s dose, the IP will be selected for administration according to the kit 
ident ificat ion numbers assigned by the IRT. One vial o f IP will be assigned by IRT for each 
dose. 
Dose preparation steps:
1. Allow the vial to equilibrate at room temperature (about 30 minutes to 1 hour). Ensure 
that the vial is adequately protected from light during the warming process. Gently swirl the vial 
to ensure the contents are mixed to a clea r, hom ogeneous sol ution. Do not shake.
2. To prepare IP for administration remove the tab portion of the vial cap and clean the 
stopper wi th 70% ethyl alcoho l or equivalent. 
3. Attach a 21G 1½ -inch sterile disposable needle to a 2mL or 3mL sterile syringe . 
4. Withdraw 1.9 mL of the IP from the vial.

6. Attach a new 27G ½ -inch sterile disposable needle to the same syringe in step 5. 
7. Apply the appropriate label to the sy ringe.
The assigned vial should be used at one time to prepare the dose required at each visit. Unused 
product in opened and dispensed vials should not be used for subsequent dosing and should be 
stored for IP accountabilit y. If the opened and dispensed via ls must be di scarded immediately  
after dose preparation as per site’s SOP, the kit boxes must be retained for IP accountabilit y.
The IP will be administered by one SC inject ion (see Table 5) and m ust be prepared using

Dose Administration
The first 2 IP doses must be administered on -site. For further details during the COVID -19 
pandemic please refer to Appendix H. 
IP will be administe red by  a qualified HCP (e.g. Pharmacist, or study  nurse) at the site. The 
inject ion site must be recorded in the source documents at each treatment visit and in the eCRF. 
The person administering the dose will wipe the skin surface of the upper arm, anteri or thi gh or 
abdo men with alcoho l and allo w to ai r dry . The skin will be pinched to isolate the SC tissue from 
the muscle. The needle will be inserted at a 90 degree angle approximately halfway  into the SC 
tissue. The IP will be slowly injected (at least 5 second duration is recommended) into the SC 
tissue using gent le pressure. The area should not be massaged after inject ion. It i s advised that 
the site of inject ion of IP be rotated such that the subject receives IP at a different anatomical site 
at each tr eatment visit. Inject ion site must be documented on the eCRF and in the source 
docum ents at each treatm ent vi sit. In cases when rotati on of  the inject ion site is not feasible 
and/or the subject prefers not to rotate inject ion sites, the reason for not rota ting the inject ion site 
shoul d be docum ented in the source documents. The suggested inject ion site rotation sequence is

Specific information concerning the use of the IRT will be provided in a separate manual.
Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects 
Subjects who fail to m eet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
rando mized or receive study medication. There can be no except ions to this rule. Subjects who 
are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all  the eligibilit y criteria must not be 
rando mized or init iated on treatment and must be withdrawn from the study .
Where a subject does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s rando mized in error, or incorrectly 
started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the AstraZeneca Study Physician
immediately , and a discussi on shoul d occur between the AstraZeneca Study  Physician and the 
investigator regarding whether to continue or discont inue the subject from treatment. Study 
treatm ent m ust be di scont inued in all cases where continued treatment i s deemed to pose a safet y 
risk to the subject and AstraZeneca Study  Physician must ensure the decisio n is appropriately 
docum ented. Subj ects that are discont inued from treatment should be fo llowed up according to 
the opti ons described in section 7.1.1 .
In those cases where cont inuat ion of the study  therapy  is judged not to present a concern related 
to safet y and disease management, the rati onale f or continuing study  therapy  must be cl early

D5180C00007 or D5180C00009 treatment allocation for subjects may beco me known to the 
Sponsor staff and/or designated CRO. The blind will be maintained for the Invest igator, 
investigat ional site staff, and for the subject. To prevent complete unblinding of thi s study , 
treatm ent-revealing informat ion will not be shared with the study  sites or subjects (subject -level 
listings, as well as other treatment -revealing informat ion will be redacted from the Clinical Study  
Reports). Further details are provided in a sepa rate Blinding Plan.
An AstraZeneca site monitor will perform IP accountabilit y. In the event that the treatment 
allocat ion for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study  staff invo lved in the 
management of study  subjects or needs to be know n to treat an individual subject for an AE, the 
sponsor m ust be notified immediately by  the investigator and, if possible, before unblinding.
The following personnel will have access to the randomization list:
Those carrying out the packaging and labelling of IP
Those generat ing the randomization list
Personnel at the IRT company
Supply  Chain Management department
Patient Safet y department at AstraZeneca

have access to the rando mizat ion scheme during the conduct of the study  until  planned 
unblinding at primary database lock at Week 104.
The info rmation in the randomization list will be kept from other personnel invo lved in the 
conduct of the study  and in a secure location unt il the end of the study. Further details are 
provi ded in a separate Blinding Plan.
Methods for unblinding
Individual trea tment codes, indicat ing the treatment randomizat ion for each rando mized subject, 
will be available to the Invest igator(s) and delegate(s) at the study sites fro m the IRT. Routi nes 
for this will be described in the IRT user manual that will be provided to e ach site.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment randomizat ion. The Invest igator 
shoul d docum ent and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment given to 
subject to the AstraZeneca staff.
AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to 
be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulator y 
authori ties. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all 
decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from  each individual subject have been made and 
docum ented. Further details are provided in a separate Blinding Plan. 
6.4 Treatment compliance
Any change fro m the dosing schedule or dose discontinuat ions should be recorded in the eCRF.  
The IP Storage Manager is responsible for managing the IP from receipt by  the study  site unt il 
the destruction or return of all unused IP. The date and time o f all IP administrations, as well as 
any missed doses, should be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.
6.5 Concomitant therapy
All subjects will be taking medium- or high-dose ICS and potentially at least one addit ional

weeks (+/ -5 days) post last IP administration. Subjects who prematurely discont inue treatment 
shoul d be encouraged to return for all regularly scheduled visits for safet y and efficacy 
assessments.
At the IPD visit the subject will be given three options as to how they  will be fo llowed:
1. Ideally  the subject shoul d cont inue all regular clinic visits and perform all scheduled 
assessments (excluding IP administration) unt il the scheduled EOT visit at week 104 
(+/-5 days). 
2. (If the subject cannot comply or does not wish to comply wit h option 1 above) The 
subject will be offered follow -up on a m onthly basis via telephone calls. The subject 
shoul d return for an on-site follow-up visit 16 weeks (+/ -5 day s) (refer to SoA, V17 –
Week 116) post last IP administration and for the on-site EOT visit at Week 104 (+/- 5 
days). 
3. (If the subject cannot or does not wish to comply with option 1 or option 2), they will 
complete an on-site follow-up visit at 16 weeks (+/ -5 days) (refer to SoA, Visit 17 –
week 116) post last IP administration. After this visit the Investi gator will only  contact 
by phone the subject at week 104 (+/ -5 day s). No other study  assessments will be 
perform ed pri or to thi s contact.
If the last IP administration was after week 88 for options 1 or 2, the subject will return to the 
clinic for an on -site EOT visi t at Week 104 (+/ -5 days), and for option 3, the invest igator will 
contact on phone the subject at 104 weeks post randomizat ion. The subject for options 1, 2 and 3 
will then return for an on -site follow-up visi t 16 weeks (+/ - 5days) post last IP administration 
(refer to SoA, V17 –Week 116).

7.3 Withdrawal from the study
A subject m ay withdraw from  the study  (e.g. , withdraw consent), at any t ime (IP and 
assessments) at his/her own request, without prejudice to further treatment. A subject who 
considers withdrawing fro m the study  must be info rmed by the Investigator about modified 
follow-up opti ons (e.g., telephone contacts, contacts with a relat ive or treating physician, or 
inform ation from medical records) as per section s7.1.1 and7.3.2 .
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any adverse events (AE). The Invest igator will fo llow-up subjects as medical ly indicated. A 
withdrawal  visit is essent ial to collect as m uch data as possible for the subject as per EOT visit 
described in SoA, Section 1.1. 
Ifthe subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may  retain and 
continue to use any  data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
If a subject withdraws fro m the study , he/she m ay request destructi on of  any samples tak en, and 
the invest igator must document this in the site study records.

8.1 Efficacy assessments 
8.1.1 Assessm ent of asthma exacerbation
During the study , an asthma exacerbat ion will be defined as a worsening of asthma that leads to 
any of the fo llowing:
A tem porary  bolus/burst of systemic corti costeroi ds (or a tem porary  increase in stable 
OCS background dose) for at least consecutive 3 days to treat symptoms o f asthma 
worsening; a single depo -injectable dose of corticosteroids will be considered 
equivalent to a 3 -day bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids.
An emergency  room  or urgent care visit (defined as evaluat ion and treatment for <24 
hours in an emergency department or urgent care centre) due to asthma that required 
systemic corticosteroids (as per the above).

evaluat ion and treatment in a healt hcare facilit y for ≥ 24 hours) due to asthma.
The Investigator will have to just ify the decisio n for defining the event as an exacerbat ion by 
recording a ll symptoms and signs in the eCRF.
The start of an exacerbat ion is defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids or of a 
temporary  increase in a stable OCS background dose, date of ER or urgent care visit s requi ring 
systemic corticosteroids, or dat e of hospital admissio n due to asthma, whichever occurs earlier.
The end date of an exacerbat ion is defined as the last date of systemic corticosteroids or of a 
temporary  increase in a stable OCS background dose, date of ER or urgent care visit, or date of
hospi tal discharge, whichever occurs later.
If less than 7 days have elapsed since the end date of an asthma exacerbation and the start date of 
a new asthma exacerbat ion, the second event will be considered a relapse of the prior asthma 
exacerbation.
All asthma exacerbat ions that occur during the treatment period and fo llow-up  
 must be recorded in the exacerbation eCRF.  See section 8.3.7 for addi tional 
inform ation on recording asthma exacerbat ions as an AE/SAE during the study .

please refer to Appendix D  Acti ons requi red in cases of increases in liver biochemistry  and
evaluat ion of Hy’s La w’ for further instructi ons.
8.2.1.1 Pregnancy Test 
The fo llowing tests are applicable to female subjects only  and will  be conducted in accordance 
with the schedule provided in sect ion1.1.
o Serum  β-Hum anchori onic gonadotropin (β -HCG) -the test will be done at visit 
1 only, for WOCBP and adolescent females (analysed at central laboratory ) 
and should be added to the EOT visit for the predecessor study .
o Urine HCG –the test will be performed at the study site for WOCBP and 
adolescent females at each treatment visit before IP administration using a 
dipstick. Addit ionally, the test must be done at Follow -up
Visit 17 (Week 116) and Follow -up  
 even if subject discont inued IP. Posit ive urine test result 
must be confirmed with serum β -HCG.
Note: Females of childbearing potential who are sexually act ive with a nonsterilized male 
partner m ust u se a highly effect ive method of contraception fro m screening and must agree to 
continue using such precaut ions for 16 weeks after the final dose of IP (refer to Inclusion 3).
8.2.1.2 Maintaining the blind to the subject’s blood eosinophil, basophil and m onocyte co unts in 
cases of local laboratory usage  
The sponsor and site will be blinded to the eosinophil, basophil and monocy te counts from  the 
central  laboratory  reports throughout the study . However when  due to the global central 
laboratory  kit shortage and/or other l ogistical  factors limit ing access to central laboratory , 
investigators could be unable to perform central lab assessments and in these situat ions they  may 
use local laboratory  for saf ety assessments. 
To mit igate the risk of unblinding in case of a need to perform local safety  laboratory  
assessments, the requested tests should be restricted to the relevant test(s) required. For example, 
if hemoglo bin is desired, the investigator should avo id ordering a complete blood cell count with 
a different ial count. In cases where the invest igator requires an eosinophil, basophil, or monocy te 
count for managing safet y issues, he/she may order these tests as per regular site practice. 
AstraZeneca should be notified of all such cases.
To m aintain the blind in case of local laboratory  resul ts use, si te staff who are direct ly involved 
in the subject’s management should remain blinded to any  blood eosinophil, basophil and 
monocy te counts resul ts included as part of an outside laboratory  report or el ectronic m edical 
record. Similarly , eosinophil, basophil and monocy te counts resul ts must be redacted from  all 
communicat ions wit h the sponsor.

measurements will be performed in light clothing and with shoes off.  Reasonabl e attem pts 
shoul d be made to use the same equipment at each visit to measure height and weight.
8.2.3 Physical examinations
A co mplete physical examinat ion will be performed and include an assessment of the following: 
general appearance , respi ratory , cardi ovascu lar, abdom en,skin, head and neck (including ears, 
eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thy roid, muscul oskeletal  (including spine and extremit ies) 
and neurological systems. Brief physical examinat ion will also be performed and include an 
assessment of the general appearance, abdo men, cardi ovascular and respiratory  system . For both 
the com plete and brief physical examinat ions, only informat ion on whether the assessment was 
perform ed or not will be recorded.
Physical examinat ion (com plete and bri ef) will  be p erform ed at timelines as specified in the 
SoA. Invest igators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses, as new or worsening abnormalit ies may qualify  as adverse events, see Section 8.3.7 for 
details.
8.2.4 Vital signs
Vital signs (i .e. pul se, blood pressure, respiration rate and body  temperature) will be obtained in 
accordance with the Schedule o f Activities (SoA ). 
Vital signs will  be taken pri or to bl ood drawing, IP administration, and, if possible, usual asthma 
controller medicat ion. 
Blood pressure and pulse m easurements will be assessed in sitt ing posit ion with a com pletely  
autom ated device. Manual techniques will be used only  if an autom ated device is not available.
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by  at least 5 minutes of rest for the
subject in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., televisio n, cell  phones). 
Pulse rate will be obtained before blood pressure, if the manual measurement technique is used.
Respiration rate will be obtained after subject has been rest ing for at least5 minutes, by count ing 
number of breaths (i.e., how many  times the chest rises) for one minute.
Body  temperature will be measured prior to IP administration, in accordance with local 
standards.

The invest igator or authorized delegate will be responsible for the overall interpretation and 
determinat ion of clinical significance of any potential ECG findings. In case of discrepancy 
between the invest igator’s interpretation and that provided by the ECG machine (if applicable), 
the invest igator’s interpretation will take precedence and should be noted on the printout and 
recorded i n the eCRF. A copy  of the ECG will be produced and qualit y checked and kept in case 
of further need to re -evaluat ion.
ECG data and evaluat ion will be recorded in the eCRF.
8.2.6 COVID -19 vaccination recommendation s
COVID -19 vaccines are either nucleic acid vacc ines (which can include DNA plasmid and mRNA), 
recombinant vector vaccines (non- replicating viral vectors) or inactivated virus vaccines. DNA plasmid 
and mRNA vaccines are considered an inactivated vaccine. Recombinant vector candidates potentially 
may be in a new category. Based on available publications on mRNA and virus vector anti -SARS CoV -2 
vaccines, the immune response is developed rapidly after vaccine administration. For vaccines that are 
currently approved under emergency use authorization (EUA) or approved in the future, please refer to 
relevant health authority websites for further guidance. 
Please note: Any live attenuated vaccine is prohibited during study conduct (see Table 7).
Given the limited long term safet ydata of COVID -19 vaccines and the potential to confound the 
interpretati on of  safety resul ts in the study , the fo llowing COVID
-19vaccinat ion 
guidance provi ded in Table 9shoul d be followed based on the study  period.
Table 9 COVID -19 Vaccin ation Guidance
Study Period Vaccine usage 
Subject in treatment 
phaseIf COVID -19 vaccinat ion is in the best interest of the subject and the 
subject is vaccinated during the study , IP dosing can continue . 
However, it is recommended that IP not be administered within 14 
days before or 28 days after a dose of vaccine. As these intervals 
might change, please consult with theAstraZeneca Study  Physician
for the m ost current recommended t ime interval ,prior to any  vaccine 
dose.
If a subject receives a COVID -19vaccine less than 14 days from the 
last IP dose, th e next IP administration should be rescheduled or 
skipped to ensure the next IP dose is at least 28 days after the 
vaccine administration.

COVID -19 vaccinat ion schedule should fo llow country  specific 
healt h authorit y guidelines. Vaccinat ion against COVID -19should 
be planned in advance to ensure the IP dosing/COVID -
19 
vaccination intervals are maintained .
Study  visit s shoul d still be conducted within the protocol -specified 
time window ,even if a subject receives a COVID -19vaccine dose. 
However, if IP is not administered at a study  visit because of 
COVID -19 vaccinat ion restrict ions, the other site visit assessments 
shoul d be st ill be perform ed according to the Schedul e of Activities 
(SoA ).  
At every  study  visit during the treatm ent peri od, the invest igator 
must ask if the subject has received or is planning to receive a 
COVID -19 vaccinat ion. This is to ensure that the requ ired time 
interval  for IP dosing (m entioned above) is maintained. 
If it is ant icipated that a subject will miss two consecutive IP 
administrations, the AstraZeneca Study  Physician shoul d be 
contacted to discuss further subject participat ion in the study . The 
reason for skipping IP administration should be recorded with the 
prefix “COVID -19” in m edical records. 
Subject in fo llow-up 
 If COVID -19vaccinat ion is in the best interest of the subject , 
COVID -19 vaccinat ion could be administered. Subject should 
follow schedule of assessments; no special adjustments are needed
to the SoA . It is advised that subject wait for 14 days after the last IP 
dose. As these intervals might change, please discuss with Study  
Physician for the m ostcurrent recommended time interval prior to 
any vaccine dose
The suggested IP dosing/COVID -19 intervals is summarized in Figure 3.

8.3 Collection of adverse events
The Principal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study are 
familiar wit h the content of this sect ion.
The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appe ndix B. 
AE will be reported by  the subject (or, when appropriate, by  a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject's legally authori zed representative).  
The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, document ing, and recording 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE. For informat ion on how to fo llow/up AEs see 
section8.3.3 .
8.3.1 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal quest ioning of the subject is the preferred method toinquir eabout 
AEoccurrences.
8.3.2 Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information 
Adverse Events (new and ongo ing from predecessor study) will be co llected fro m time of

in Appendix B. The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 
hours of i t being available.
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study  subjects. However, if 
the invest igator learns o f any SAE, including a death, at any  time after a subject’s last visit and 
he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study  treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, 
the invest igator may notify t he sponsor.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for com pleting and transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix B. 
8.3.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively fo llow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAE/non -serious AEs/AEs of special interest will be followed 
untilresolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as 
appropriate in the study  are f ollowed up by the Investigator fo r as long as medically indicated, 
but without further recording in the CRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional 
inform ation for any  subject wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged 
necessary .
8.3.4 Adverse event data collecti on
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:
AE (verbat im)
The date when the AE started and stopped
Whether the AE is serious or not
Invest igator causalit y rating against the Investigat ional Product(s) (y es or no)
Action taken with regard to Investigat ional Product(s)

The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between Invest igational Product and each 
Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there is a 
reasonable possibilit y that the event m ay have been caused by  the investi gational product?’
For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix B to the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
8.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the subject or care provider or reported i n response to the 
open question fro m the study  site staff: ‘Have you/the child had any health problems sinc e the 
previous visit/you were last asked?’ or revealed by observat ion will be collected and recorded in 
the CRF. When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other 
signs or symptom s that are not generally  part of  the di agnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom  will be recorded separately .
8.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the Clinical Study  Protocol  mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be 
summarized in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to predecessor study  baseline in protocol -
mandated l aboratory  values and vital signs should therefore only  be reported as AEs if they  fulfil

If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the ass ociated l aboratory  resul t/vital sign will  
be considered as addit ional information. Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator uses the 
clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (e.g. anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptom s, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated 
param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion as 
compared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to 
the disease under study , see sect ions 8.3.9 and8.3.10 .
When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred, when pos sible, to recording a list 
of signs and symptoms. Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, 
dyspnea, breathlessness and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when:
oThe sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Appendix B
oThe subject prematurely  discontinues IP due to the sign or symptom
oThe sign or symptom is new to the subject or not consistent with the subject’s preexist ing 
asthma history  (defined as wit hin 1 year of Visit 1 in predecessor study), as judged by the 
Invest igator.
Asthma exacerbation should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if it fulfills any  of the above 
criteria.
8.3.8 Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an event of scient ific and medical interest towards 
improving the understanding of the IP. An AESI may  be seri ous or non -serious. For this study ,

8.4.2 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca.
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of learning 
of the pregnancy . Any  cases of pregnancy  during the treatm ent or fo llow
-up  
 period will be recorded in the specific eCRF module.
Abnorm al pregnancy outcom es (e.g., spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopi c pregnancy ) are considered SAEs.
8.4.2.1 Maternal exposu re
If a subject beco mes pregnant during the course of the study, invest igational product should be 
discontinued immediately .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicio n that the 
investigat ional product under study  may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive 
medicat ion. Congenital anomalies/birth defects and spontaneous misca rriages shoul d be reported

Appropriate drugs , such as epinephrine, H1 and H2 antihistamines, and corticosteroids, as well 
as medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions, must be immediately  available when 
IP is being administered.  Study  site personnel  must be trained to recognize and tr eat anaphylaxis 
(Lieberman et al . 2010 ). Details on anaphylaxis management are provided in Appendix E. 
Anaphylaxis will be defined as a serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may  cause death 
(Sampson et al . 2006 ). Anaphylaxis t ypically manifest as 1 of 3 clinical s cenari os:
1.The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue or both and at least one of the fo llowing: a) respiratory  com promise; or b) 
reduced blood pressure or symptoms of end -organ dy sfunct ion 
2.Two or more of the following that occur rapidly  after exposure: involvement of the 
skin/mucosal t issue, respiratory  com promise, reduced blood pressure or associated 
symptoms and/or persistent gastrointest inal symptom s
3.Reduced blood pressure after exposure.
Subjects will have had a pre -assessment (i.e., vital signs and lung funct ion) pri or to IP 
administration. For visits invo lving IP administration, subjects will be observed for a minimum 
of 1 hour after IP administration for any  such reactio n. 
If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis 
of serum  tryptase. The sample will be tested at the local lab or central lab where applic able.

predecessor studies, and that 90% of those continue into the LTE study , approximately  975 
subjects (860 from D5180C00007 and 115 fro m D5180C00009) are anticipated to enter the LTE 
study . Furtherm ore, assuming annual dropout rates during the LTE of  (in subjects

described above. Unless otherwise specified, all presentations will be split by predecessor study, 
and data will not be pooled across the 2 predecessor studies.
9.3 Populations for analyses
For purposes of analysis, the following populat ions are defined: 
Population Description
Safety analysis set All subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose o f 
investigational product in any of the predecessor studies , irrespective 
of their protocol adherence and continued participation in any of the 
studies, and regardless of their enrolment into the LTE study.
Subjects will be assigned according to their ran domized treatment. 
However, if a subject randomised to placebo receives an incorrect 
treatment, all data after the date the incorrect treatment was received 
within that time period (predecessor study, LTE study) will be 
excluded from the analysis, and list ed separately
Full analysis set All subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
investigational product in any of the predecessor studies , irrespective 
of their protocol adherence and continued participation in any of the 
studies, and regardless of their enrolment into the LTE study.
Subjects will be assigned according to their randomized treatment
In addit ion, to the populat ions defined above, a subset (safet y analysis set -long term  extensio n: 
“SAF-LTE”, full analysis set -long term  extensio n: “FAS -LTE”) of each populat ion will be 
defined which includes only subjects who enrolled and received at least 1 dose of IP in the LTE 
study . As these are based on subjects who complete the predecessor study , it may be subject to 
select ion bias e specially for measures o f asthma control, where less severe subjects may be more 
likely  to com plete the predecessor study  and enro ll into the LTE study; these populat ions will be

9.4 Statistical analyses
There will be two DBLs in this study . The primary DBL will be conducted after the last subject 
completes Week 104, and the final DBL will be conducted once all subjects have completed the 
last follow -up visi t  All analyses of the primary  and secondary  objectives will be 
perform ed based on the primary  DBL data. 
Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. A comprehensive SAP will be 
developed and finalized before primary  database lock and will describe the subject populat ions 
to be included in the analyses, an d procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious 
data.  Addit ional analyses assessing the impact of COVID -19 will also be included in the SAP. 
This sect ion is a summary of the planned statist ical analyses of the primary and secondary 
endpo ints.  Any  deviati ons fro m this plan will be reported in the clinical study  report.
Unless otherwise specified, all presentations will be split by predecessor study , and data will not 
be pool ed across the 2 predecessor studies. In additio n, where relevant, presentations may be 
split by  time period (i.e. Week 0 to Week 52/48, Week 52/48 to Week 104,).  
 
An overall summary o f subject di sposi tion will be presented for the safet y analysis set usi ng the 
relevant treatm ent groups. The summary will present the number and percentage subjects who 
completed and prem aturely  discontinued IP and study  from enro lment in the predecessor studies 
until end of the LTE study. 
 The number and percentage of 
subjects completing the predecessor studies but not enrolling into the LTE study  will also be 
presented.
Dem ographics and key  subject chara cteristics at predecessor study entry will be summarized for 
the safet y and SAF -LTE analysis sets by  relevant treatm ent groups. 
Relevant medical history /current m edical condit ions at predecessor study  entry  will be

deviat ions will be summarized overall  (Week 0 to Week 104) and by  time period (Week 0 to 
Week 52/48, Week 52/48 to Week 104) for the SAF and SAF -LTE analysis sets. The definit ions 
of each category  of important protocol  deviat ion will  be fully specified in the SAP, and will 
include (but may  not be limi ted to): subjects who entered the LTE study  without fulfilling key  
entry  criteria; subjects who received prohibited or restricted concomitant medicat ions during IP 
treatm ent in the LTE study , subjects who received the incorrect study  treatm ent or study  dose at 
any time during the LTE study .
9.4.1 Definition of baseline and change from baseline
In general, the last measurement on or prior to the date of rando mizat ion in the predecessor study  
will serv e as the baseline measurement for efficacy endpo ints. The last measurement on or prior 
to the first dose of predecessor study  treatm ent will  serve as the baseline measurement for safet y 
endpo ints. If there is no value prior to randomizat ion (or the first d ose of study  treatm ent for 
safet y endpo ints), then the baseline value will not be imputed, and will be set to missing. 
Further details regarding baseline definit ions will be provided in the SAP.
Change from baseline is defined as the abso lute difference b etween the m easurement at the 
relevant post- randomizat ion time po int and the baseline value.
9.4.2 Safety analyses
All safet y analyses will be performed on the safet y analysis set. Key  safet y analyses will be 
repeated using the SAF -LTE analysis set.
The primary  object ive of the study  to eval uate the long -term safet y and tol erabili ty of 
tezepel umab in severe asthma subjects will be assessed through on -treatm ent AEs (including 
AESIs, as defined in Section 8.3.8 ) and SAEs. AEs, AESIs and SAEs will be summarized using 
exposure adjusted incidence rates (i.e., number of subjects reporting events divided by person -
time at ri sk) to account for the variabilit y in follow-up.  
 
 
The definit ion of on -treatm ent AEs and post -
treatm ent AEs will be defined in the SAP.
The treatment groups for addressing the primary object ive will be “Rando mized Tezepelumab” 
and “Rando mized Placebo” using the safet y analysis set. Supportive analysis of key safet y data 
will be presented for the “Tezepelumab Predecessor+Tezepelumab LTE” and “Placebo 
Predecessor+Placebo LTE” treatment groups using the SAF -LTE analysis set. Summaries for 
these 4 treatm ent groups will be pro vided overall (Week 0 to Week 104) and by t ime period

9.4.3 Efficacy analyses
All efficacy analyses will be performed primarily on the Full analysis set. Key  efficacy  analyses 
may be repeated using the FAS -LTE analysis set. 
The secondary  objective of the study  is to assess the long -term effect of  210 m g tezepel umab SC 
Q4W on asthma exacerbat ions in adult and adolescent subjects with severe uncontrolled asthma 
compared wi th placebo. To assess this object ive, the annualized asthma exacerbat ion rate in the 
tezepel umab group will be compared to that seen in the placebo group in the hypothetical 
scenario that other biologic treatments are not available. This approach assumes that the response 
after start of another bio logic is different from the response for subjects who complete their 
rando mized treatm ent, therefore only  data collected up until the init iation of the other bio logic 
treatm ent will be included in the analysis. A different approach may be considered depending on 
the number and pattern of drop -outs. Further details will be provided in the SAP.
The annualized asthma exacerbat ion rate i n the tezepelumab group will be co mpared to that seen 
in the placebo group using a negat ive bino mial m odel. The response variable in the model will 
be the number of asthma exacerbat ions experienced fro m baseline in the predecessor study  until 
Week 104, covariates and factors included in the model will include at least treatment group, 
history  of exacerbat ions and stratifying variables (as in the predecessor studies). The logarithm 
of the subject’s corresponding time at risk for exacerbat ion during the predecessor and LTE 
studi es will be used as an offset variable in the model to adjust for subjects having different 
follow-up times during which the events occur. Time during an exacerbat ion and the 7 days 
following an e xacerbat ion in which a new exacerbation cannot occur, will not be included in the 
calculat ion of t ime at risk for exacerbat ion. Marginal annual asthma exacerbat ion rates will also 
be presented, over the ent ire treatm ent peri od (i.e. across both the predece ssor and LTE studies).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 (144 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Appendix BAdverse event definitions and additional safety information
B 1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
study  subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have a causal  
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign 
(e.g. an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
The term  AE is use d to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration 
of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including run -in or washout 
periods, even if no Study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of serious a dverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i .e., run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -subject hospi talisati on or prol ongat ion of exist ing hospitalisat ion 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty.  
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may  require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
B 3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would re sult in the subject’s 
death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might 
have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure).
B 4 Hospitalisation
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0
AstraZeneca
Tezepelumab -D5180C00018
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116 (144 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is n ot in i tself a seri ous AE, al though the reasons for 
it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subjec t was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
B 5 Important medical event or medical treatment
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations w here important medical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi talizat ion, disabilit y or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These 
shoul d usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. Examples of such events are:
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation bu t requi ring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (e.g., neutropeni a or anaemia requi ring bl ood transfusi on, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
B 6 Intensity rating scale:
1.mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2.moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
3.severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensit y 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe intensit y need 
not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix B
2. On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B
2.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117 (144 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there is
a ‘reasonable possibilit y’ that an AE may have been caused by the drug.
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the 
dose of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy such 
as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environm ental  factors.
Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally reco mmend or support a re -
challenge.
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if perfo rmed) has confirmed the 
relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to sugges t a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough information 
to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the case, it is likely 
that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘ not rel ated.’
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 118 (144 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant or 
has the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error:  
occurred
was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
did not occur, but circumst ances were recognized that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n
Dispensing error e.g. medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the participan t
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it shoul d be at room  
temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IRT errors)
Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IRT errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IRT -including those which lead to one of the above 
listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) e.g.  forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging

evaluation of Hy’s Law
D 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropr iately report 
Potenti al Hy’s law (PHL) cases and cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive 
guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance on managing liver 
abnorm alities can be found in Sect ion 7.1of the Clinical Study  Protocol .
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The Investi gator i sresponsible for determining whether a subject meets potential 
PHL cri teria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; this 
includes samples taken at scheduled study  visit s and other visits including central and all local 
laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visits; for exam ple, PHL cri teria 
could be m et by  an elevated ALT from  a central  laboratory  and/or el evated TBL from  a local 
laboratory .
The Investig ator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate 
elevations in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  theinvest igational pr oduct. 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting 
Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review 
and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting proces ses.

IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e., on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified time frame wit hin which the elevations 
in transaminases and TBL must occur.
D 3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory  
data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in iso lation or in 
combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3×ULN
AST ≥ 3×ULN
TBL ≥ 2×ULN
Central  laboratori es being used:
When a subject meet any  of the i dentificat ion criteria, in i solation or in combinat ion, the central 
laboratory  will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (and also to the AstraZeneca 
representative).  
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local  laboratory  reports where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory
Com plete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the subject meets PHL c riteria (see Appendix D 2for definit ion) by 
reviewing laboratory  reports from  all previ ous visits (incl uding both central  and l ocal 
laboratory  results)
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:

Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Appendix D 2for definit ion) by 
reviewing laboratory  reports from  all previ ous visits
Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  CRF
D 4 Follow -up
D4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will :
Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided 
in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
D4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:
Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting Study  treatm ent 
(See Section 8.4)
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will report the case as an SAE of 
Potenti al Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y assessment 
‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting
For subject that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not required to 
submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s condit ion
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and the 
continuous review of data.  Subsequent to this contact the Investigator will:
Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. 
Com pletes foll ow-up SAE Form as required. 
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event an d perform  diagnosti c investi gations as discussed 
with the Study  Physician .  This includes deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s 
law lab kit should be used.
Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available

The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in orde r to review available data and agree on whether there 
is an alternative explanat ion for meet ing PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to 
ensure timely  analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date of 
PHL cri teria was m et.  The AstraZeneca Glo bal Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safet y 
Physician will also be invo lved in this review together with other subject matter experts as 
appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow. Where there i s an agreed alternative explanat ion for the ALT or AST and 
TBL el evations, a determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made 
and subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria f or a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly  with the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AstraZeneca standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send SAE (report ter m ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes.  
oThe ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
oAs there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 15 cal endar days in obtaining the informat ion necessary  
to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an infor med decisio n can be made:
oProvi de any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of ‘Potential Hy’s 
Law, (report term now ‘Hy’s law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related 
to IMP and seriousness criteria is medically  important, according to CS P process 
for SAE reporting.

E 1 Introduction
As wi th any antibody , allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World Healt h 
Organizat ion has categorized anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups, which are clinically 
indist inguishable: immuno logic [IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated (eg, IgG and immune 
complex mediated) and nonimmuno logic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria for 
defining an aphylaxis for thi s study  are listed in section E 2. A guide to the signs and symptoms 
and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided in sect ion E 3. Appropriate drugs, such as 
epinephrine, ant ihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat anaphylact ic 
reacti ons must be immediately available at study  sites, and study  personnel should be trained to 
recogni ze and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. 
If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis 
of serum  tryptase.
E
2 Clinical Criteria for Defining Anaphylaxis and Immune Complex 
Disease
Anaphylaxis
In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the fo llowing 3 cri teria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with invo lvement of the sk in, 
mucosal t issue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue-
uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
(a) Respiratory  com promise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hy poxemia).
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunct ion 
(eg, hy potoni a [collapse], syncope, incont inence).
2. Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapidly  after exposure to a likely allergen for that 
subject (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin -mucos al tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula).
(b) Respiratory  com promise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hy poxemia).

incont inence).
(d) Persi stent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy  abdominal  pain, vomi ting).
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours): 
Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease fro m that 
subject’s baseline.
Immune Complex Disease
Immune com plex disease or Hy persensi tivity Type III i s evoked by  the deposi tion of  antigen-
antibody  or anti gen-antibody -complement com plexes on cell surfaces, with subsequent 
involvement of breakdown products of complement, platelets, and polymorphonuclear 
leukocy tes, and development of vasculit is; serum sickness and nephrit is is co mmo n.
E 3 Signs and Symptoms and Management of Acute Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal mult i-system  allergic reacti on in which som e or all  
of the fo llowing signs and symptoms occur: 
Diffuse ery thema
Pruri tus
Urticaria and/or angioedema
Bronchospasm
Laryngeal edema
Hypotensi on
Cardi ac arrhy thmias
Feeling of impending doom

Immediate intervention
1. Assessment of airway , breathing, ci rculation, and adequacy  of mentati on
2. Administer epinephrine intramuscularly  every  5-15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as 
necessary , depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control 
signs and symptoms and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as 
respi ratory  distress, hypotension, shock and unconsciousness.
Possibly appropriate, subsequent measures depending on response to epinephrine
(e) Place subject in recumbent posit ion and elevate lower extremit ies.
(f) Establish and maintain airway.
(g) Administer oxygen.
(h) Establish venous access.
(i)Norm al saline IV for fluid replacement.
Spec ific measures to consider after epinephrine injections, where appropriate
(j)Consider epinephrine infusio n.
(k) Consider H1 and H2 ant ihistamines.
(l)Consider nebulized β2 agonist [eg, albuterol (salbutamo l)] for bronchospasm 
resistant to epinephrine.
(m)Consider syste mic corticosteroids.
(n) Consider vasopressor (e.g. dopamine).
(o) Consider glucagon for subject taking β -blocker.
(p) Consider atropine for symptomat ic bradycardia.
(q) Consider transportation to an emergency  depart ment or an intensive care facilit y.
(r) For cardi opulm onary arrest during anaphylaxis, high -dose epinephrine and prolonged 
resuscitat ion efforts are encouraged, if necessary .

adapted from GINA 20 18
F 1 Guidance to Step Down of Background Medication
Consider stepping down when asthma symptoms have been well controlled and lung 
funct ion has been stable for 3 or more months, starting from Visit 1. If the subject has 
risk factors for exacerbat ions or fix ed ai rflow limi tation, do not step down without close 
supervisio n.
Approach each step as a therapeutic trial. Engage the subject in the process; document 
their asthma status (symptom control, lung function and risk factors); provide 
clearinstructi ons; and ensure the subject has sufficient medicat ion to resume their 
previous dose if necessary; monitor symptoms; and schedule a fo llow-up visit.
Stepping down ICS doses by  25-50% at 3 -month intervals is feasible and safe for most 
subjects.

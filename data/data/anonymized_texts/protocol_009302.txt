Version  Version 1.5 
06-May-2021  Investigational 
Device  RHA®4 injected with a ( 25G x 2” ) 
cannula into the NLF. The brand of 
cannula ( i.e., Softfil, Dermasculpt, or 
TSK)  used for injection is up to the 
discretion of the Treating Investigator 
(TI), providing the cannula is 
registered for use by the US FDA and 
that the cannula bore is 25G x 2” long . 
The injection  technique  is left to the 
discretion of the TI.  Study Number  TEO -RHA -2001  
Phase  IDE Pivotal  Control Device  Approved RHA® 4 injected with the 
provided TSK 27G x ½” sharp needle.  
Indication  Injection into the deep dermis to 
superficial subcutaneous tissue for 
the correction of moderate to severe 
dynamic facial wrinkles and folds . Study Sites  Multicenter , 3 to 4 US sites 
Title  A randomized, controlled, single -blinded, within -subject (split -face), multicenter, prospective 
clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using the dermal filler RHA®4 injected 
with a cannula or with a sharp needle for the treatment of moderate to severe nasolabial folds . 
Sponsor  TEOXANE  SA, Rue de Lyon 105, CH - 1203 Geneva , Switzerland  
Study 
Duration  12 to 16 weeks for each subject.  
Anticipated study length is ~24 
weeks (8W enrollment + up to 16W 
f/u), but  may be extended depending 
on the COVID -19 public health 
emergency .  Number of 
Subjects  At least 50 subjects treated with 
cannula and sharp needle with at least 
20% of subjects presenting Fitzpatrick 
skin type IV to VI including 10% of 
subjects presenting Fitzpatrick skin 
type V and VI. 
Treatment 
Groups  Each enrolled subject will receive injections o f RHA®4 with a cannula into the nasolabial fold 
(NLF) of the left or right side of the face, and injections of the control device (sharp needle) into 
the contralateral NLF.  
Study Design  This is a randomized, controlled, single -blinded, within -subject (split -face), multicenter, 
prospective study to investigate whether RHA®4 injected in NLFs with a cannula ( 25G x 2” long ) 
is non -inferior to RHA®4 injected in NLFs with a sharp needle ( 27G x ½” ) for the correction of 
moderate to severe NLFs as determined by the Blinded Live Evaluator (BLE) using the NLF -
WSRS (validated NLF Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale) at 12 weeks from last treatment . 
At screening, the Treating Investigator (TI) and Blinded Live Evaluator (BLE) will evaluate 
subjects’ NLF se verity to confirm eligibility and to establish a pre -treatment score for assessing 
aesthetic improvement (i.e., moderate to severe bilateral nasolabial folds ; grade 3 or 4 on the five -
point NLF -WSRS ; symmetrical in terms of grade ). BLE and TI must independ ently agree that the 
criterion  is met; however, strict concordance of severity  is not required.  
At Visit 1, RHA®4 injected with cannula will be administered in a random sequence (first or second 
injection) and side of the face (left or right NLF) and RHA®4 injected with a sharp needle will be 
administered to the other side. The TI  will administer study devices and will be unblinded to 
treatment allocation. Blinded assessments of effectiveness will be conducted by the BLE  (Blinded 
Live Evaluator).  
Subje cts then attend Visit 2 (4 weeks following initial treatment) and will receive touch -up 
treatments (if necessary) using a needle or cannula as per the subject’s initial treatment assignment. 
Subjects receiving touch -up treatments at Visit 2 will attend Vis it 2b (4 weeks following touch -up 
treatment); subject not receiving touch -up treatment will not attend Visit 2b.

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 5 of 67 1. Subjects will receive a safety follow -up call from the study site within 3 -days of initial treatment, 
and if applicable, within 3 days of touch -up treatment.  
Before and 30 minutes after injection, as well as at each study visit, assessments of visual 
disturbances (i.e., Snellen visual acuity, confrontational visual field test, ocular motility) will be 
conducted.   
2. Subjects will then attend sc heduled in -office study visits at 8 and 12 weeks following last treatment 
where safety and effectiveness assessments, including photography, AEs, visual assessments,  
device symmetry assessments, concomitant medications, NLF severity (NLF -WSRS), FACE -Q, 
GAIS and subject satisfaction, will be conducted.  
Subjects who present with an unresolved clinically significant device -related AE at the last study 
visit will attend an optional visit or phone -call follow -up (discretion of the TI) from the study staff 
within 4 weeks  of last study visit. Follow -up of the clinically significant device -related AE will 
continue until the AE is resolved or the TI determines that additional follow -up is no longer 
necessary.  
Hypothesis  RHA®4 injected in NLFs with a cannula is non -inferior to RHA®4 injected in  the NLFs with a 
sharp needle for the correction of moderate to severe NLFs as determined by the NLF -WSRS 
(validated NLF Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale) at 12 weeks from last treatment . 
A change from Baseline in the NLF -WSRS of ≥1 -grade will be considered clini cally meaningful, 
and the non -inferiority margin for change in NLF -WSRS  between nee dle and cannula  will be 0.5 
grade.  The formal hypothesis set to be tested is a s follow:  
Ho:  µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  > 0.5 
Ha:  µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  < 0.5  
where µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  represents the mean difference in change from Baseline between needle and 
cannula.  
Objectives  1. Demonstrate the non -inferiority of RHA®4 injected in the NLF s with a cannula versus the 
control (RHA®4 injected in NLF with a sharp needle) at 12 weeks from last treatment  for the 
correction of moderate to severe NLFs. Assessment of non -inferiority will be based on the 
change from Baseline in NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks  as rated by the Blinded Live Evaluator 
(BLE) at each investigative site.  
2. Evaluate the safety of RHA®4 injected in NLF with a cannula versus the control up to 12 
weeks from last treatment .

Device 
Administration  Depth of injection: Study device will be administered into the deep dermis to the superficial 
subcutaneous tissue at the discretion of the TI.  
Injection technique: The injection technique (e.g., linear threading (retrograde or anterograde), 
cross hatching, fan like administration, multiple puncture) will be at the discretion of the TI and 
will be recorded in the eCRF. [NOTE: Cross -hatching is a “needle only” injectio n technique]  
Injection volume: The maximum volume per administration of a study device into a single NLF 
is 3.0 mL (max 3.0 mL for right side, and max 3.0 mL for left side)  for a maximum volume of 6 
mL per session.  
Blinding  Due to the visual and sensory differences between the cannula and sharp needle, it is not feasible 
to mask the TI or the subject. However, the  BLE wil l be blinded to the treatment allocation.  
Furthermore, to ensure that the BLE remains masked and that all assessors remain unbia sed when 
making their assessments, the BLE, TI and subject will not be allowed to refer to each other’s 
efficacy assessments.  
All subjects will be instructed to not discuss their study treatment, AEs, or CTRs with the BLE.  
Randomization  A randomization algorithm will provide equal balancing for the side of the face and the order of 
injection (i.e., left or right / 1st or 2nd order).  
Visit 
Procedures  The NLF -WSRS will be assessed by the BLE at Baseline (pre-injection ) and 12 weeks following 
last treatment (initial or touch -up), and by the TI at Baseline (pre-injection ) and at all follow -up 
visits (i.e., Week s 4, 8 and 12  following last treatment ). 
The GAIS will be assessed by the BLE at Week 12, and by the TI and subject at all follow -up 
visits. Subject satisfaction and FACE -Q will be assessed at all follow -up visits .  
Subject Safety Assessments will be conducted at all scheduled in -office study visits. Adverse 
Events (AEs) will be obtained from signs and symptoms reported by the subject in the 4-week  
post-treatment CTR diary or detected during phone and in -office follow -up visits. Diary CTR data 
will be counted and evaluated separately from AE data. CTRs that are recorded on the last day of 
diary will be automatically elevated to the status of AE.  
Symmetry will be assessed by the BLE at Baseline pre -injection and 12 week s following last 
treatment , and by the TI and subjects at Baseline pre -injection and at all follow -up visits.  
Assessment of visual acuity/function will be assessed at Visit 1 (pre - and post -injection), Visit 2 
(pre-and post -touch -up if applicable) as well as at all other follow -up visits . 
Before initial treatment at Visit 1 and at each scheduled in -office follow -up visit, the Investigator s 
will perform a live assessment of both the subjects’ left and right NLF using the NLF -WSRS as a  
guide for grading severity and 2D photography.   
Refer to the Study Summary Tables and the Study Schematic for a schedule of activities.

Primary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoint  The primary effectiveness endpoint will be aesthetic improvement from pre -injection as assessed 
by the NLF -WSRS (BLE) at 12 weeks (V4)  following last treatment (initial or touch -up). The 
primary hypothesis is that RHA®4 used in conju nction with cannula is non -inferior to RHA®4 with 
sharp needle. An NLF -WSRS change  from Baseline  of >1 grade will be considered clinically 
significant. A non -inferiority margin of 0.5 grade difference in change from Baseline  between 
cannula and needle will be used to test the primary hypothesis.  
In order to confirm assay sensitivity at 12 weeks, the proportion of responder of ≥1 grade point on 
the NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks for the group injected with a needle (control) is required  to be  ≥70%  
(when compared to pre -treatment) . 
Secondary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoints  Secondary effectiveness objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness of RHA®4  used  in in 
conjunction with the use of a cannula (25G  x 2”) for treatment of moderate to severe nasolabial 
folds using the following endpoints:

Statistical 
Methods  Analysis Populations: The Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  Population will consist of all subjects who were 
randomized. Subjects will be summarized and analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The Per Protocol ( PP) Population will consist of all study subjects who 1) met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, 2) successfully completed the study and 3) experienced no major 
protocol violations/deviations that could affect efficacy assessments.  
The Safety ( SAFT ) Population will consist of all study subjects who were randomized and received 
treatment with the study device. Subjects will be summarized and analyzed according to treatment 
received.

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 9 of 67 Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The primary endpoint of NLF -WSRS change from Baseline at 12 
weeks (BLE ) will be analyzed in a non -inferiority statistical model using the PP Population with a 
0.5 margin  for the difference between cannula and needle . Expressing the difference between 
treatment groups as the mean of change from Baseline in RHA®4 injected with needle minus mean 
change from Baseline in RHA®4 injected with cannula, the one-sided 97.5% confidence limit must 
be <0.5 to conclude non -inferiority. A paired t -test will be used to calculate the conf idence interval.  
In order to confirm assay sensitivity at 12 weeks, the proportion of responders of ≥1 -grade point 
on the NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks for the group injected with a needle (control) is required to be 
≥70% (when compared to pre -treatment).  
A sensit ivity analysis will be done using the ITT population. M ultiple imputation will be used for 
missing observations. Specifically, missing change from baseline in NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks will 
be imputed using the regression method with treatment group as the independent variable  and with 
age and NLF -WSRS at earlier timepoints as covariates . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : All statistical inference tests will be performed at the same 
significance level (α) of 0.05. For categorical and continuous variables, the tw o groups will be 
compared using two -sided parametric or non -parametric tests for paired data, as appropriate. For 
continuous variables, the Shapiro -Wilk test will be used to assess normality. If data are normally 
distributed, testing will be conducted using the Student t -test, while testing will be conducted with 
the Wilcoxon  signed -rank test if not normally distributed. The ITT population will be used for 
summaries and comparisons . No imputation will be performed; analyses will utilize available data 
as observed . 
Safety Assessments will be summarized for the SAFT population using descriptive statistics: 
frequencies and percentages for categorical assessments, and means, variability, and ranges for 
continuous assessments.  
• AE type (i.e., preferred term) and frequency over the duration of the study.  
• AE intensity over the duration of the study, measured as incidence of severe AEs.  
• AE duration measured as days from AE start date to AE end date.  
• Post-injection Common Treatment Response from the 4-week  patient CTR diary: incidence, 
severity, and duration will be described.  
• Visual assessments over the duration of the study (i.e., Snellen visual acuity, confrontational 
visual field test, ocular motility).  
• Injection Site pain immediately after treatment (i.e., 0 minutes), and at 5, 30 and 60 minutes 
post-treatment will be described.  
Other than subject -level AEs,  safety assessments will be descriptively compared between RHA®4  
injected  in NLF with a cannula and RHA®4  injected in NLF with a sharp needle. Descriptive 
comparisons between treatment groups will be limited to treatment -emergent AEs.  
Sample Size  Assuming a mean difference of 0 between RHA®4 (Cannula) and RHA®4 (Needle), and assuming 
a SD of 0.75, non -inferiority for each device tested using a bilateral 97.5% CI and a non -inferiority 
upper bound of 0.5, a sample size of 38 subjects for each treatment group is required for 80% 
power to detect non -inferiority for RHA®4. As this is a split -face study, 38 subjects will provide a 
sample size of n=38 for each treatment group.  
Assuming a 20% drop -out rate, a minimum of 50 subjects (38 / 0.8 = 47.5) will be required .

1.1 Background  
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a long -chain, repeated dimer, N -acetyl glucosamine  and D -glucuronic 
acid polymer and is a major component of the extracellular matrix. HA is widely present in all 
animal species and does not differ from one species to another. Due to this extended compatibility, 
non-human HA can be used in humans without unacceptable adverse effects.  Due to its natural 
viscoelastic and hydrogel properties, HA is widely used as matrix in tissue regeneration and 
particularly in dermal defect reconstruction.  
It was demonstrated that by chemically crosslinking the molecule, HA  becomes resistant to 
degradation and its persistence in tissues is increased.1,2 This does not affect the carboxylic and N-
acetyl functions of the molecule and allows modification of the rheological and physical properties 
of HA while maintaining the bioc ompatibility of the basic polymer.3 
Dermal fillers in general, and hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers specifically, are aesthetic devices  that 
are not used for the diagnosis or treatment of any specific disease state . Rather, they are used for 
the treatment of age -related wrinkles/folds and facial volume loss.  Specific use data are published 
on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) website.  Based on Teoxane’s knowledge of 
the aesthetic industry, it is likely that most HA dermal f iller procedures are performed by 
dermatologists, aesthetic nurses, and/or physician assistants rather than by plastic surgeons . 
However, as use statistics are not available from the various dermatological societies, the data 
provided below are likely an u nderestimation of the total number of dermal filler procedures 
performed in the U.S.  It is not expected that the demographics of this indication would be 
substantially different from the ASPS data.  
The following data for 201 9 were extracted from the ASPS website  in August  2020 
(https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/plastic -surgery -statistics ): 
• 16.3 M cosmetic minimally invasive procedures, up 2% from previous year  
• 2.72 M procedure s with any dermal filler, up 1% from previous year  
• 2.16 M procedures with HA, up 1% from previous year  
• 36% of all HA filler procedures were in patients ≥ 55 years old  
• 3% of all HA filler procedures were in males  
While d ata are not available from ASPS regarding race or ethnic -specific subgroups , data from 
various HA dermal fillers clinical trials indicate that the majority of  subjects are Caucasian 
females.  Historically, approximately 20 -25% of subjects enrolled in dermal filler studies have 
been Fitzpatrick skin types IV -VI (as per FDA requirements for minimum enrollment of darker 
skin type subjects in these studies ). As suc h, the percentage of darker skin types treated in dermal 
filler studies is not necessarily representative of real world experience for patients seeking many 
dermal filler aesthetic procedures/indications.  
RHA4 dermal filler  is a device containing colorles s, biodegradable, sterile, biocompatible,  
crosslinked HA of non -animal origin (i.e., bacterial fermentation using Streptococcus 
zooepidemicus ). Crosslinking is performed using 1,4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to form 
a gel . RHA4 contains 0.3% w/w of lidocaine hydrochloride, a drug substance widely used for its 
anesthetic properties (i.e., it block s the origin and transmission of nervous influx at the point of 
injection by stabilizing the neuronal membrane).

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 18 of 67 RHA4 is intended for injection into the deep dermis to superficial subcutaneous tissue of the face 
to correct  moderate to severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds , such as NLFs . RHA4 has 
received PMA approval for this indication per P170002 in October 2017.  
1.2 Rationale for Stud y 
While RHA4 (injected with a sharp needle) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
NLFs, the use of a cannula for injecting RHA4 has not yet been approved by the FDA.  
In the current study, RHA4 injected with a sharp needle is being compared to RHA4 injected 
with a cannula in a non-inferiority pivotal study designed to support a PMA application (FDA) for 
using a cannula for the injection of RHA4. The clinical results using RHA®4 will also be 
applicable to approved products for the same indication: RHA®2 and RHA®3. Effectively RHA®4 
is representative and the worst case of the full range of products, RHA®2, RHA®3 and RHA®4 in 
terms of raw material and manufacturing processes, level of crosslinking, injection depth, pain at 
time of injection, needle and cannula dimensions  and responder rates at the primary endpoin t.  
1.3 Hypothesis  
RHA®4 injected in NLFs with a cannula is non -inferior to RHA®4 injected in the NLFs with a 
sharp needle for the correction of moderate to severe NLFs as determined by the NLF -WSRS 
(validated NLF Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale) at 12 weeks from last treatment . 
A change from Baseline in the NLF -WSRS of ≥1 -grade will be considered clinically meaningful, 
and the non -inferiority margin for change in NLF -WSRS will be 0.5 grade  between needle and 
cannula . The formal hypothesis set to be tested is as follows:  
Ho:  µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  > 0.5 
Ha:  µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  < 0.5  
where µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  represents the mean difference in change from Baseline between needle and 
cannula.

The study is designed to achieve the following objectives:

The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki, and the 
United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) applicable to clinical studies (45  CFR Part 
46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, and 21 CFR Part 312 ). In addition, the study will be conducted 
in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements relevant to the use of new 
medical devices  in the United States . 
The sites’ Principal Investigator  (also referred to as the  Treating Investigator [TI] , both terms are 
used interchangeably) is responsible for ensuring the privacy, safety and welfare of the subjects 
during and after the study, and must ensure that personnel are trained and immediately available 
in case of a medical emergency. The TI must be familiar with the background and requir ements of 
the study and with the properties of the study device as described in the Investigator ’s Brochure 
and package inserts . The Principal Investigator at each site has the overall responsibility for the 
conduct and administration of the study at their  site, and for contact with study site management, 
and local authorities . ethica CRO  will facilitate and manage all interactions between the site and 
the IRB.   
3.1 Variations to the Protocol  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior approval 
of the FDA and the IRB except  1) when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects 
or when the change involves only logistics or administration , or 2) minor administrative or 
typographical corrections.  The sites’ Principal Investigator s and the Sponsor must sign any 
protocol amendments.  
3.2 Investigational Sites  
Three (3) to Four (4) U.S. investigational sites will participate in this study. Each site will obtain 
written approval from a Central IRB prior to recruitment and enrollment of any subject into the 
study. Any changes to the study procedures must be made with the mutual agreement o f the 
Principal Investigator and the Sponsor, documented in an amendment to the protocol, and 
approved by the reviewing IRB.  
Each site will have one TI who will be responsible for administering all study treatments,  assess ing 
safety, and conduct ing subjec t assessments , and a BLE who will conduct live NLF -WSRS , 
symmetry  and GAIS assessments at selected visits. TIs and BLEs  will be specialists in the fields 
of cosmetic dermatology or plastic surgery and will have extensive experience with dermal fillers. 
The TI will function as the site’ s Principal Investigator.  Additionally, each site will have a study 
coordinator.  
If a sit e has 2 or more BLEs, the site will ensure that the same BLE performs assessments for a 
given subject.  
Each site will have identified a local eye specialist (i.e., ophthalmologist) who will examine 
subjects immediately in case of ophthalmic symptoms following any injection or during follow -
up visits.  
3.3 Training and Certification on the NLF Wrinkle  Severity Rating Scale  (NLF -WSRS ) 
The study will use a validated 5-grade photonumeric scale  measuring the  severity of NLFs. All 
assessors (i.e., TI and BLE ) will be certified on the use of the NLF -WSRS . Specifically, a ll

4.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, controlled, single -blinded, within -subject (split -face), multicenter, 
prospective study to investigate whether RHA®4 injected in NLFs with a cannula ( 25G x 2” long ) 
is non -inferior to RHA®4 injected in NLFs with a sharp needle ( 27G x ½” ) for the correction of 
moderate to severe NLFs as determined b y the Blinded Live Evaluator (BLE) using the NLF -
WSRS (validated NLF Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale) at 12 weeks following last treatment  (i.e., 
initial or touch -up). 
At screening, the Treating Investigator (TI) and Blinded Live Evaluator (BLE) will evaluat e 
subjects’ NLF severity to confirm eligibility and to establish a pre -treatment score for assessing 
aesthetic improvement (i.e., moderate to severe bilateral nasolabial folds; grade 3 or 4 on the five -
point NLF -WSRS; symmetrical in terms of grade). BLE an d TI must independently agree that the 
criterion is met; however, strict concordance of severity is not required.  
At Visit 1, RHA®4 injected with cannula will be administered in a random sequence (first or 
second injection) and side of the face (left or right NLF) and RHA®4 injected with a sharp needle 
will be administered to the other side. The TI  will administer study devices and will be unblinded 
to treatment allocation. Blinded assessments of effectiveness will be conducted by the BLE  
(Blinded Live Ev aluator).  
Subjects then attend Visit 2 (4 weeks following initial treatment) and will receive touch -up 
treatments (if necessary) using a needle or cannula as per the subject’s initial treatment assignment. 
Subjects receiving touch -up treatments at Visit 2 will attend Visit 2b (4 weeks following touch -up 
treatment); subject s not receiving touch -up treatment will not attend Visit 2b.  
Subjects will receive a safety follow -up call from the study site within 3 -days of initial treatment, 
and if applicable, within  3 days of touch -up treatment.  
Before and 30 minutes after injection, as well as at each study visit, assessments of visual 
disturbances (i.e., Snellen visual acuity, confrontational visual field test, ocular motility) will be 
conducted.  
Subjects will then attend scheduled in -office study visits at 8 and 12 weeks following last treatment 
where safety and effectiveness assessments, including photography, AEs, visual assessments,  
device symmetry assessments, concomitant medications, NLF severity (NLF -WSRS ), FACE -Q, 
GAIS and subject satisfaction, will be conducted.  
Subjects who present with an unresolved clinically significant device -related AE at the last study 
visit will attend an optional visit or phone -call follow -up (discretion of the TI) from the stud y staff 
within 4 weeks of last study visit. Follow -up of the clinically significant device -related AE will 
continue until the AE is resolved or the TI determines that additional follow -up is no longer 
necessary.  
4.2 Study Design Rationale  
4.2.1 Study Population  
At least 50 subjects will be enrolled  and receive study treatment . The study population includes 
female and male subjects who are 22 years old.  Additionally, enrolment will be comprised of at 
least 20% of subjects (i.e., 10 subjects) presenting with Fitzpatrick Skin Type s IV-VI including  at 
least 10% of subjects (i.e., 5 subjects) with Fitzpatrick Skin Type V  and VI (at least two subjects  
of each Fitzpatrick Skin Type V and VI will be enrolled) . See Section 5 for a full description of

4.2.2 Primary Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be aesthetic improvement from pre -injection as assessed 
by the NLF -WSRS (BLE) at 12 weeks (V4) following last treatment  (initial or touch -up). The 
primary hypothesis is that RHA®4 used in conjunction  with cannula is non -inferior to RHA®4 with 
sharp needle. An NLF -WSRS change  from Baseline  of >1-grade will be considered clinically 
significant. A non -inferiority margin of 0.5 grade difference in change from Baseline  between 
cannula and needle will be us ed to test the primary hypothesis.  
In order to  confirm assay sensitivity at 12 weeks, the proportion of responders of ≥1 -grade point 
on the NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks for the group injected with a needle (control) is required to be 
≥70% (when compared to pre -treatment).

All subjects who are randomized  will receive a 3-digit subject number, starting at 001. Subject 
numbers will be assigned in ascending order and will be coupled with the site identification number 
for unique identification of each subject. The subject number will be used to identify the subject 
throughou t the study. Subjects withdrawn from the study will retain their subject number; new 
subjects will be allocated a new subject number.  Screen Failures will be entered in the eCRF.  
Upon qualifying for treatment, subjects will be randomized for the side of the face  and the order 
of injection of study devices (i.e., left or right / 1st or 2nd order).  
Subjects will be considered “enrolled” at the time of consent, and  will be considered “enrolled and 
randomized” at the time of randomization . The required sample size is based on “enrolled and 
randomized” subjects . If an enrolled subject withdraws from the study prior to being randomized, 
he/she may be replaced.  
Due to t he visual and sensory differences between the cannula and sharp needle, it is not feasible 
to mask the TI or the subject. However, the  BLE wil l be blinded to the treatment allocation.  
Furthermore, to ensure that the BLE remains masked and that all assessor s remain unbiased when 
making their assessments, the BLE, TI and subject will not be allowed to refer to each other’s 
efficacy assessments. All subjects will be instructed to not discuss their study treatment, AEs, or 
CTRs with the BLE.  
The TI with the support of its study staff will secure the treatment allocation and any other record 
of study treatment from potential discovery by the BLE. Any instance where the blind is opened 
to the BLE will be documented in writing.

7.1 Study Devices  
RHA® 4: A sterile, biodegradable, biocompatible, viscoelastic, clear, colorless, homogenized gel 
implant. It consists of crosslinked hyaluronic acid produced by fermentation of Streptococcus 
zooepidemicus , formulated to a concentration of 23 mg/g and 0.3% w/w lidocaine in a physiologic 
buffer. It is supplied in individual treatment syringes with 27G ½ inch disposable sterile needles.  
For additional information, please refer to TEO -RHA -2001 Investigator’s Brochure.  
Cannulas for Injection : The brand of cannula (i.e., Softfil, Dermasculpt, or TSK) used for 
injection is up to the discretion of the Treating Investigator (TI), providing the cannula is 
registered for use by the US FDA and that the cannula bore is 25G x 2” long.  
The cannula s will not be part of the RHA® 4 package and labeling . The  cannulas will be provided 
to the TI separately and labelled for the clinical study purposes. The cannulas will be made 
available in their original packaging with a TEOXANE SA sticker on it, which wi ll include the 
study reference.  
The cannulas will be used for RHA® 4 administration, which will be initiated by an entry point 
made manually with the sharp “pre -hole needle” (also called the “puncture needle”) so that the 
cannula (attached to the syringe) may be carefully inserted and maneuvered until the desired tissue 
plane is reached. The pre -hole needles will be supplied sterile and together with the cannulas in 
their packaging. The choice of the  brand of the  cannula used for RHA® 4 administration is le ft to 
the TI’s discretion  and the cannula selected will be recorded into the eCRF  . 
7.2 Injection of Study Devices  
At Visit 1, each randomized subject will receive injections of  RHA4 injected with cannula into 
the NLF of the left or right side of the face, and injections of the control device (i.e. RHA4 
injected with a sharp needle ) into the contralateral NLF . 
At Visit 2, if deemed necessary by the TI, subjects will receive touch -up treatments at 4 weeks  
following the initial treatment. If both NLFs require touch -up, both will be treated. If only one 
NLF requires touch -up, only that one NLF will be treated. Touch -up will be injected with the same 
method as initial treatment assigned to the side of the treat ed NLF (needle or cannula).  The type 
of cannula used for Visit 1 injections must be used for the Visit 2 touch -up injections.  
If a touch -up injection is not administered, the scheduling of subsequent study visits will be based 
on Visit 1 (i.e., from the last study treatment). If a touch -up injection is administered, the 
scheduling of subsequent study visits will be based on Visit 2. 
The subject will be instructed to avoid touching the treated area for 6 hours after treatment, after 
which the area can be washed gently with soap and water. Subjects should be advised not to wear 
make -up 12 hours after injection.   
7.2.1 Injection Depth  
Study devices will be admini stered into the deep dermis to superficial subcutaneous tissue, at the 
discretion of the TI ; however, the depth of injection will be the same on both sides.  
7.2.2 Injection Technique  
The injection technique (e.g., linear threading  (retrograde or anterograde) , cross hatching, fan like 
administration, multiple puncture, etc.)  will be at the discretion of the TI . Technique(s) used for

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 28 of 67 each side will be recorded  in the eCRF . [NOTE: Cross hatching is a “needle only” injection 
technique].  
Devices will be injected using the  needle that is provided within the standard packaging of the 
device  on the left or right side of the face. T he TI is not permitted to use a needle of differe nt 
gauge , length  or brand . On the contralateral side, devices will be injected using a small cannula 
(25G x 2” long ; Softfil, Dermasculpt, or TSK brand cannulas ). 
7.2.3 Supplementary Anesthesia  
RHA4 contains lidocaine. Additional anesthesia is prohibited (e.g., EMLA, dental blocks, ice, 
etc.). Ice may be used at the discretion of the TI for post -injection treatment for pain or discomfort, 
but only after all injection pain assessments for both sides of the face have been completed (i.e., at 
60 minutes post -injection).  
Use of ice will be recorded as a concomitant treatment on the Concomitant Treatment eCRF . 
7.2.4 Visual Assessment s 
The subject will undergo three visual assessment tests to detect rare and unintentional injection 
into a blood vessel. Subjects must be instructed to wear the same corrective eyewear  (if applicable) 
at each visit.  
Each site will have identified a local eye  specialist ( i.e., ophthalmologist) who will examine 
subjects immediately in case of ophthalmic symptoms after an injection or during follow -up visits.  
The following assessments will be performed at each visit at the study site by the TI, or an 
appropriate ly trained study coordinator, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant:  
• Snellen visual acuity  
• Confrontational visual fields tests  
• Ocular motility  
These visual assessments will be performed:  
• Prior to initial treatment (to serve as Baseline)  
• 30 minutes pos t-injection  
• Visit 2  (before and  30 minutes after touch -up treatment  if applicable ) 
• Visit s 2b, 3 and 4  
• Unscheduled visit  
Only subjects with vision acuity of 20/40 or better, and normal peripheral vision and ocular 
motility will be included. Should any of the vision assessments suddenly worsen after the injection 
of the filler, the TI must examine the subject to exclude vascu lar injection and contact an eye 
specialist if necessary.  
At any time during the study, if the vision assessments show a change from Baseline  defined as 
either one of the following:  
• Snellen acuity test: any change of 1 line or more  
• Confrontational visual field  test: change to peripheral vision  
• Ocular motility: change to ocular motility

evaluated by an eye specialist to evaluate if the re sult is related to a vascular injection of the dermal 
filler or not.  
If the referral to the eye specialist confirms that the subject had the filler injected into a blood 
vessel, the subject will be withdrawn and the need of stopping the study will be revie wed.  
7.2.5 Injection Sequence  
Upon qualifying for treatment, subjects will be randomized for the side of the face  and the order 
of injection using cannula or needle  (i.e., left or right / 1st or 2nd order).  
The sequence of injections will be performed as follows:  
1. Inject right (or left)  NLF then immediately  commence pain assessments;  
2. Inject left (or right) NLF then immediately commence pain assessments . 
7.2.6 Treatment Volume Allowance  
The maximum volume per administration of a study device into a single NLF is 3.0 mL (max 3.0 
mL for right side, and max 3.0 mL for left side)  for a maximum volume of 6 mL per session.  
7.3 Labeling, Packaging and Storage  
Supplies of RHA4 will be provided to the sites  in bulk  (i.e., individual kits per subject will not 
be provided) . External packaging  (carton)  will be labeled with study information (i.e., study 
number, study Sponsor, name and address of TEOXANE , quantity, “CAUTION: Investigational 
device . Limited by US Federal  law to investigational use”, etc.) . There may be one or two blisters 
inside each carton.  Each blister will contain one syringe and two needles.  Each blister is unique to 
a subject and must not be used for more than one subject. The Tyvek lid on the bliste r will include:  
• Study number: TEO -RHA -2001

throughout the treatment period, including the name of the t reatment/procedure, must be recorded 
in the eCRF with end dates, if applicable. Use of prohibited treatment/procedures must be recorded 
in the eCRF up to the extent of the prohibited time period indicated above. Furthermore, previous 
use of facial aestheti c treatment/procedures must be recorded for up to 1 year prior to the Baseline 
visit.  
In the event such prohibited therapies are administered during the study period, the Medical 
Monitor will be contacted to discuss the details of the event. Subject partic ipation will not 
automatically be discontinued. At a minimum, the event will be documented by the site staff as a 
protocol deviation, as instructed by the Medical Monitor. Depending upon the nature of the 
prohibited therapy and the timing relative to the d etermination of the primary endpoint, the 
Medical Monitor may make a decision to discontinue the subject.  
The decision to administer a prohibited medication/treatment is done with the safety of the study 
participant as the primary consideration. If the per missibility of a specific medication/treatment is 
in question, the Medical Monitor should be contacted before the prohibited medication/treatment 
is administered.  
7.5.1 Prohibited Treatment  and Procedures  
Subjects  must not undergo any type of facial or cosmetic procedure  below the orbital rim , including 
but not limited to dental, plastic or reconstructive surgery; non -ablative procedures; botulinum 
toxin injections; laser resurfacing; dermabrasion; lipo -injection; or chemical peel  at any time 
during this  study . Other necessary therapies that will not interfere with the response to treatment 
may be provided to the subject  at the discretion of the TI. 
The following medications/procedures have either restrictions  for usage, or are prohibited during 
the course of  the study and appropriate wash out periods noted below must be respected:  
Dermal fillers used below the orbital rim :  
• Bioresorbable fillers  (e.g., HA, collagen, autologous fat, etc.)  ≥12 months  
• Permanent fillers  (e.g., PMMA, polyacrylamide, silicon, etc.) or semi -
permanent fillers (e.g., polylactic acid, calcium hydroxylaptite, 
hydroxyethylmethacrylate, etc.).  Any previous use prohibited

• Botulinum toxin injection s  
• Clinically significant oral or maxillofacial surger y that may interfere with 
study assessments or procedure s (e.g., craniofacial surgery, 
reconstructive therapy,  implants, dentoalveolar surgery, etc.). ≥6 months  
≥12 months  
Investigational drugs/ devices : 
• Exposure to any other investigational drug/device  ≥90 days 
Other medications:  
• Exposure to a drug or supplement that prolongs bleeding times (e.g., non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory, anticoagulant, high-dose Vitamin E, St. 
John’s Wort, fish oil , corticosteroids ) 
• Additional anesthesia during injections is prohibited (e.g., EMLA, dental 
blocks, ice, etc.).  Ice may be used at the discretion of the TI for post -
injection treatment for pain or discomfort, but only after all injection pain 
assessments for both sides of t he mouth have been completed (i.e., at 60 
minutes post -injection).  ≥7 days before treatment  and 
≥7 days after treatment  
The subject will be instructed to avoid touching the treated area for 6 hours after treatment, after 
which the area can be washed gently with soap and water. Additionally, subjects should be advised 
to not use make -up below the infraorbital rim prior to st udy visits, or during the 12 hours following 
injection . 
The subject will be instructed to avoid exposing the treated area to excessive sun, ultraviolet lamp, 
and extreme temperatures (e.g., cold weather, sauna) at least within the first 24 hours after the 
injection, or until the initial swelling and redness have resolved. Exposure to any of the above may 
cause or exacerbate and/or extend the duration of the temporary redness, swelling, and/or itching 
at the treatment site. The subject will be instructed not  to fly or exercise within the first 24 hours 
after injection.

8.1 Electronic Case Report Form  
Treatment and follow -up of subjects will be recorded in a 21 CFR part 11 compliant eCRF.  Data 
will be first recorded in to the medical record and  study specific source document worksheets prior 
to entry into the eCRF.  The study coordinator will refer to these worksheets in conjunction with 
the medical record in order to complete data entry int o the eCRF.  
In order to review and electronically sign the eCRF, the T I and BLE will each have an individual 
login  password that will al low them to view only the data that they have  generated.  The TI and 
BLE  must ensure that they electronically sign for completed eCRF s on a timely basis.  
8.2 Subject Diar ies and Questionnaires  
Subjects will record Common Treatment Responses (CTRs) for 4 weeks  post-injection  using 
electronic  diaries.  
The electronic CTR diary will also record the occurrence of any visual disturbances (including, 
but not limited to: any loss of vision, blurr iness , double vision, pain in or around the eye, blindness, 
blind spot or shadow in the visual field, trouble moving eyes, etc.). Subjects will be instructed to 
report immediately such events to the investigational site or to their health care practitioner.  
Subjects will complete  paper -based  questionnaires, and data recorded by the subjects  will be 
entered  in the eCRF  by the study coordinator . 
If a subject is unable to complete an electronic CTR diary, a paper diary will be provided.  
8.3 Photography  
Calibrated photographs will be taken at Visit 1 (p re- and post -injection ) and at Visit s 2 (pre- and 
post-injection if touch/up) , 2b, 3, and 4, and at any unscheduled visits  according to a standardized 
protocol incorporating appropriate quality control processes  (i.e., Canfield Scientific Inc.) .  
The photograph s taken by the TI or designee will include the whole face and cropped as necessary 
after the images are transferred. The TI will be trained prior to screening of first subject at the site.  
The subject will be asked to sign a separate photography release fo rm to specify whether he/she 
allows other uses of the photographs (e.g., publications, promotion). The subject’s decision will 
be then tracked in a separate photography release log kept at the site.

Severe  4 Very deep nasolabial fold – Prominent 3 -dimensional feature  
Extreme  5 Extremely deep and long nasolabial fold – Skin redundancy  
Left and right sides assessed individually. To qualify for the study, subject s must have NLF -WSRS 
grades of 3 or 4 (at rest as determined by the TI  and BLE ; symmetrical in terms of grade ). Half -
point grades will not be ac cepted.  
9.3.1.2  Global Aesthetic Improvement  Scale  
GAIS will be assessed by the TI , BLE  and the subject using the Visit 1 pre -injection photograph 
and the subjective 5 -grade scale as detailed in Table 3 below. Left side and right side will be 
assessed individually. Subjects will be instructed: “Compare your pre -injection photograph to the 
photograph provided to you and rate the degree of aesthetic improvement by using the following 
scale”. The TI  and BLE  will complete the assessment using the same pre -injection photograph 
(photograph will be labeled with “left side” and “right side").

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 38 of 67 9.4 Safety  
Safety will be evaluated through a 4-week patient Common Treatment Response ( CTR ) diary that 
captures post-injection signs/symptoms , measures of injection site pain  and AE reporting based on 
phone follow -ups and clinic visits.  Safety assessment will also include visual assessment tests 
performed at Visit 1 (before and 30 minutes post -injection , including referral to a n eye specialist 
[i.e., ophthalmologist ] if a visu al disturbance is noted post injection ), Visit 2 (before and 30 
minutes post -touch -up injection) , and at Visit s 2b, 3 and 4 (or unscheduled visit) . 
9.4.1 Patient Common Treatment Response Diary  
The study coordinator  will provide subject s with instructions for daily recording of his/her 
observations of the CTRs of the study treatments into an electronic diary for the first 4 weeks  after 
each treatment . The diary will be activated after treatment and will be discussed during the 3-day 
post-injection telephone follow -up. Subjects should complete the diary at approximately the same 
time each day  (i.e., AM or PM ).  
The subject diary will capture the following CTRs  that typically occur following the injection of a 
dermal filler ; specifically, redness, pain, tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps /bumps, bruising, 
itching,  discoloration , and “other” . The CTR diary will include a detailed glossary describing all 
signs/symptoms listed in the diary. Subjects will record the presence and the severity of each 
observed sign/symptom as: none, mild, moderate, or severe.  
In addition, the CTR diary will capture the occurrence of the following AEs *:  
• Visual Disturbance  (loss of vision, blurriness, double vision, pain in or around the eye, 
blindness, blind spots, shadow in visual field, problems moving eyes)  
• Skin changing color around eyelids  
• Crusty or scabby skin around eyelids  
• Headache  
• Fever  
• Dizziness  
• Confusion  
• Weakness/numbness in arms or legs  
• Change s to consciousness  or alertness  
• Difficulty speaking/speech impairment  
• Face droop  
• Changes to chewing and drinking  
• Chest discomfort with irregular heartbeat  
• Sensitivity to hot/cold liquids and foods  
* The CTR diary will instruct subjects as follows: “If you experience any of these events, contact 
your study doctor. If you are unable to reach the study doctor, immediate ly seek medical attention.”  
9.4.2 3-Day Telephone Follow -up 
The subject will be contacted by telephone by the investigational site approximately 3 days  
following study injections and will be queried regarding health status and AEs. Information 
gathered will be documented in the progress notes and upon confirmation at the next clinic visit, 
data will be entered into the eCRF.  The investigational site  must attempt at least twice to contact 
the subject. All failed attempts will also be documented in the study notes .

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 39 of 67 9.4.3 Vision Assessments  
Subjects will undergo three vis ion assessment tests to detect rare and unintentional injection into 
a blood vessel. The following assessments will be performed by the TI, or an appropriately trained 
study coordinator, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant:  
Snellen visual acuity : The TI or designee will use the provided chart and place it on a wall or an 
easel at a distance defined on the chart. If the subject normally wears eyeglasses or contact lenses, 
he/she will be asked to use them during testing. The subject will cover one eye with his/her hand 
without pressing on it, and the TI or designee will ask the subject to read the letters out loud from 
the largest to the smallest and then repeat with the other eye. The TI or designee will record the 
visual acuity for each eye in the e CRF.  
Confrontational visual fields tests : If applicable, the TI or designee will ask the subject to remove 
his/her hat or anything that could interfere with their peripheral vision and then sit approximately 
1 m away and directly in front of the subject. I f possible, the TI or designee will adjust the seat to 
be at eye level with the subject. The subject will be asked to gently cover his/her left eye with the 
left hand and to fix his/her gaze directly on the TI’s left eye throughout the test. The TI or desi gnee 
will then close his/her right eye and maintain fixation on the subject’s eye. The TI or designee will 
then raise his/her left hand and hold up 1, 2, or 5 fingers consequently in the inferior temporal 
edge, inferior nasal edge, superior temporal edge, and superior nasal edge of the TI’s visual 
quadrant. The test will be then repeated with the other eye and ability to distinguish the numbers 
by the subject in each quadrant will be noted.  
Ocular motility : The TI or designee will first assess the eye align ment of the subject in primary 
gaze and then will ask him/her to move the eyes in an “H” pattern using a finger or a light. The TI 
or designee will then assess and note the ability of the eyes to move in all directions  
9.4.4 Injection Site Pain  
Injection pain wi ll be self -assessed by the subject using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain Scale 
Ruler (see figure 2 below). Each NLF will be assessed individually. The VAS Pain Scale Ruler 
has two sides. Using the side that shows faces and is labeled “Pain Assessment Tool ”, subjects 
will move the slider to the location that represents their level of pain. The site will use the other 
side of the ruler to determine the VAS score (expressed in units of mm).  
Figure 2.  VAS Ruler  
 
Injection Site Pain during injection will be assessed immediately after each NLF injection and at 
5, 30 and 60 minutes post -injection of each side.  The occurrence of injection site pain is not to be 
considered an AE unless it is in excess to that typically observed following injection of a dermal 
filler ( as determined by the TI) .

All women of childbearing potential who participate in the study should be counseled on the need 
to practice adequate birth control and on the  importance of avoiding pregnancy during study 
participation by using effective birth control methods (e.g., oral contraceptive, condom, IUD, 
injectable contraceptive, diaphragm or vasectomized partner). Male subjects have no contraceptive 
restrictions . Wo men should be instructed to contact the TI or study staff immediately if pregnancy 
occurs or is suspected.  
Pregnancy testing will be conducted prior to administration of the study device on every woman 
of childbearing potential. A woman who is found to be pregnant at Visit 1 will be excluded from 
the study and considered to be a screen failure.  
A woman who becomes pregnant during the study after the first injection will not receive further 
injections and will be followed for safety purposes. The assessments  scheduled for the Exit visit 
are required to be performed as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancies  will be recorded using the Pregnancy Form and will not be considered as an AE.  
9.4.6 Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to 
the study device (s) will be recorded in the eCRF . Subjects  will be questioned for the occurrence 
of any new or worsening signs or symptoms at each visit by the following methods:  
• Information volunteered by the subject  
• Open ended and non -leading questions such as: Have you had any health problems since 
your last visit ? 
• Observation by the investigational team, other care providers or relatives  
9.4.6.1  Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered the study device and which 
may, but does not necessarily , have a causal relationship with th e device . An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable  or unintended sign (for example an abnormal labo ratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the use the study device, whether or not considered related to 
that device . 
AEs may include, but are not limited to, subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered 
by the subject, solic ited via the diary and subject interviews, uncovered by review of concomitant 
medications or therapies, and/or observed by the study site staff . The TI will determine the 
description (sign, symptom, or diagnosis), onset, resolution, seriousness, severity, cause and action 
taken for any event .  
CTRs will not be considered A Es unless the duration and/or severity exceed what is typically 
observed following injection of a dermal filler, and  are clinically significant as determined by the 
TI. CTRs will be reviewed by TI to ensure that CTRs are elevated to the status of an AE as 
appropriate , and will determine AE severity and the relationship to the study devices . CTRs that 
are present on day 28 of the diary (or on the last recorded day of the diary) will by default be 
elevated to the status of an AE, regardless of TI assessment.  
If a subject complete s ≥75% of the diary (i.e., ≥21 days) the diary will be processed as if it were 
fully completed and a CTR recorded on the last day of the diary will be considered as an AE. 
However, if a subject completes 20 days of the diary or less, the consideration whether any CTR

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 41 of 67 presents at the last recorded day of the diary is to be elevated to an AE will be as per the judgement 
of the TI.  
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to the study injections are not considered AEs. 
Recurring symptoms associated with pre -existing conditions are n ot considered AEs unless they 
have a clinically significant increase in severity and/or frequency , as determined by the TI . 
Clinically significant a bnormal laboratory tests (if applicable) must be recorded as an AE.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and /or development occurring at a physiologically 
appropriate time that do not vary significantly from the frequency or severity expected, for 
example , the onset of menses or menopause, are not to be considered AEs. 
9.4.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
AESI are defined as any new vis ual disturbances including, but not limited to, any loss of vision, 
blurriness, double vision, pain in or around the eye, blindness, blind spot or shadow in the visual 
field, trouble moving eyes, ocular hypotonia, ptos is, etc. that occurs after any administration of the 
filler.  
9.4.8 Vascular Occlusion Adverse Events  
When vascular occlusion involves vessels of the eye, the event should be handled as a medical 
emergency. The injection should be stopped at once and the patient should be transferred to a 
previously identified eye specialist ( i.e., ophthalmologist) .  
Sympt oms may include unilateral vision loss, ocular pain, headache, nausea/vomiting, lack of 
extraocular movement, ptosis, and exotropia ( one or both eyes deviate outward).   
Treatment varies from observation to digital massage, intraocular pressure -lowering age nts such 
as acetazolamide and mannitol, IV methylprednisolone, oral corticosteroids, oxygen and carbon 
dioxide therapy, antibiotics, mechanical and chemical thrombolysis, anterior chamber 
paracentesis, or anticoagulants.  
9.4.9 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and U nexpected Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  
A SAE  is defined as any unfavorable medical occurrence that meets any of the following:  
1. Results in death . 
2. Is life -threatening:  “Life-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe . 
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization:  Planned and 
routine hospital admissions for pre -exist ing conditions are not considered SAEs and do not 
require reporting as an AE unless the condition has worsened beyond what would reasonably 
be expected for that subject. If a subject experiences an addition al AE that prolongs a pre -
planned hospitalization this is considered to be an SAE and should be reported as an SAE. 
Pre-planned admissions must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  resulting from a pregnancy that occurred during the 
study .

threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
interventio n to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above should usually be considered 
serious.  
A UADE  is defined as any device -related AE that meets any of the following:  
1. Is not identified in nature, severity  or frequency in current literature on the product . 
2. Is life threatening, even if temporary in nature . 
3. Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
4. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude perm anent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
5. Any device malfunction that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
if the malfunction were to recur.  
9.4.10  Causality Assessment  
The TI’s assessment of an AE ’s relationship to the study device is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event will be reported. The TI will assign 
the causality assessment according to his/her clinical experience  and the subject’s description of 
the event . The Sponsor will be responsible for the final causality judgment . The causal relationship 
should be classified according to the follo wing criteria (not all variables need to be present to be 
indicative of relationship to the device):  
Definitely related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE is more likely explained by the study device or procedure than by another cause . 
• The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the study device . 
Probably related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE is more likely explained by the study device or procedure than by another cause . 
Possibly related:  
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE could have been due to another equally likely cause . 
Probably not related : 
• There is another more likely cause of the AE.  
Definitely not related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is not reasonable . 
• There is another obvious cause of the AE .

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 43 of 67 9.4.11  Severity Assessment  
For events reported on the AE eCRF, the TI will determine the severity classification based on 
his/her clinical experience and by using the following definitions of severity (n ote: a “severe” AE 
is not the same as a  SAE):  
• Mild:  Symptoms are barely noticeable or do not make the subject uncomfortable. The AE 
does not influence performance or functioning. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed 
for relief of symptom(s).  
• Moderate: Symptoms are of sufficient severity to make the subject uncomfortabl e. 
Performance of daily activities is influenced. Treatment of symptom(s) with prescription 
drugs or therapies may be needed.  
• Severe:  Symptoms are of sufficient severity to cause the subject severe discomfort. 
Performance of daily activities is compromised . Treatment for symptom(s) with prescription 
drugs or therapies may be needed.  
The maximal severity for the AE will be recorded, even if the AE presented as being less severe 
at some point during the event.  
9.4.12  Device Malfunction  
Device malfunction is a failu re of the device to perform in accordance with its intended purpose 
when used in accordance with the IFU/IB or protocol . A device malfunction may or may not be 
associated with an AE. If it is, the AE or UADE should be reported separately.  
For any event involving suspicion of device malfunction, the sponsor request that the TI return the 
study or the control device (when possible) for further evaluation.  
9.4.13  Safety  Reporting  
It is the TI’s responsibility to oversee the safety of the investigation at his/her site. This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment by the TI and appropriate reporting of all safety events 
as noted previously.  
The site should follow all applicable governance, including FDA  regulations, FDA guidance, a nd 
IRB requirements for notification of all types of AEs.  
The TI or designee must report to TEOXANE any of the following events:  
• SAEs, including death reports and UADEs, AESIs – using the SAE/UADE/AESI  Report 
form  
• Device malfunctions – using the Device Malfunction Report Form  
• Pregnancies – using the Pregnancy Form  
• New findings/updates in relation to already reported events  
These events must be reported immediately but no later than within 24 hours of first becoming 
aware of them by completing, signing, and d ating the applicable form, verifying the accuracy of 
the information recorded in the form with the source documents and the eCRF, and sending the 
applicable form to TEOXANE by e -mail to: medical@teoxane.com  
9.4.13.1  All Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be re corded from the time of informed consent until the last 
study visit, or until  30 days following the last study treatment. The TI will assess all AEs and

relationship to the study device.  
If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the study participants. All Device Related 
AEs occurring after study device administration will be followed until the event has resolved or 
stabilized or until follow -up is no longer possible  or the TI deems it unnecessary . 
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting AEs to the relevant governing authorities in the time 
frame applicable according to international and local law.  
9.4.13.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Unexpected Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  
All SAEs and UADEs that occur after the time of informed consent through 7 days after subject 
completion of the study, or within 4 weeks following the last study treatment, must be reported to 
TEOXANE  within 24 hours of awareness. Initial reports must be m ade by contacting TEOXANE  
as per the following: Complete the SAE/UADE/AESI Report Form and submit by email to 
medical@teoxane.com . It is the site’s responsibility to perform the following:  
• Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from 
colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject.  
• Provide TEOXANE  with a complete, written case history, including copies of supporting 
reports (e.g., progress notes, l aboratory reports) and a statement as to whether the event was 
or was not related to the use of the study device.  
• With the assistance of ethica CRO , notify the governing IRB of the SAE or UADE in 
accordance with the requirements of SAE reporting stipulated  by the governing IRB.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The TI will report SAEs on the (S)AE report form within 24 hours of awareness and complete the 
eCRF within 48 hours of awareness.  TEOXANE will handle the SAE report according to the 
process described in the SMMP.  
Any missing or additional relevant follow -up information concerning the SAE should be sent to 
the sponsor or designee as soon as possible, together with the following information, at a 
minimum: initial report, AE, date of occurrence,  subject identification, study ID, and site number; 
this will allow the follow -up information to be linked to the initial SAE report. Specific information 
may be requested by opening queries in the eCRF or via e -mail communication.  
Should the SAE fulfill t he criteria of an MDR reportable event  (for RHA®4 injected with the needle 
only as it is FDA approved ), TEOXANE will provide further information to the TI within 7 
working days of receipt of the SAE report form to allow the TI to report the event to the reviewing 
IRB as applicable.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Reporting  
The TI will report UADEs on the SAE /UADE  report form within 24 hours of awareness and 
complete the eCRF within 48 hours of awareness.  
TEOXANE will handle the UADE report according t o the process described in the SM MP, 
including evaluation of the UADE and reporting of the UADE to the FDA, all reviewing IRBs, 
and participating TIs within 10 working days of awareness.  
Since a UADE is a reportable event, TEOXANE will provide further info rmation to the TI within

IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the TI first learns of the 
event. The TI must adhere to all  reporting requirements for his/her IRB as applicable.  
Study Hold Due to UADEs  
If the Medical Monitor  determines that an UADE(s) presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the 
Sponsor shal l put on hold all investigation or parts of investigations presenting that risk as soon as 
possible. The study hold shall occur no later than 5 working days after the Sp onsor makes this 
determination and not later than 15 working days after the Sponsor first received notice of the 
effect. The Sponsor will not resume a n on hold  investigation without IRB  and FDA approval.  
9.4.13.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest  (AESI) Reporting  
All AESIs need to be reported within 24 hours of awareness using the SAE /UADE/AESI  report 
form and recorded in the eCRF within 48 hours of awareness.  TEOXANE will handle the AESI 
report according to the process described in the SMMP.  
The report must include depth of injection, injection volume, symptoms that were observed, time 
to onset, time to resolution, and any intervention(s) that were implemented . All AESIs will be 
evaluated carefully by TEOXANE and the study medical monitor. Follow -up actions will be 
decided on case -by-case basis and documented.  
TEOXANE will handle the AESI report according to the process described in the SMMP, 
including evaluati on of the AESI and reporting of the AESI to the FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and 
participating TIs within 10 working days of awareness.  
As the AESI are considered as reportable event to the FDA, TEOXANE will provide further 
information to the TI within 7 worki ng days of receipt of the AESI report form to allow the TI to 
report the event to the reviewing IRB as applicable.   
9.4.13.4  Device Malfunction s Reporting  
Device malfunctions will be reported using the Device Malfunction Report form and supply 
information relevant to the event.  
If a device malfunction results in an AE/SAE/UADE/AESI, it needs to be reported as such.  
If a device malfunction does not result in an AE/SAE/UADE but according to the TI may have 
caused or contributed to death or serious  injury, or would likely cause or contribute to death or 
serious injury if the malfunction was to recur, he/she will complete the device malfunction form 
within 24 hours of awareness and record it in the eCRF within 48  hours of awareness.  
If a device malfu nction does not fulfill any of the aforementioned criteria, the TI will record it in 
the eCRF within 7 calendar days of awareness.  
TEOXANE will handle the device malfunction report according to process described in the 
SMMP. 
Should the malfunction fulfill the criteria of a reportable event, TEOXANE will provide further 
information to the TI within 7 working days of receipt of the device malfunction report form to 
allow the TI to report it to the reviewing IRB as applicable.  
9.4.14  MDR Reportable Events  
MDR reporta ble events are events that reasonably suggest that a marketed device  (RHA®4 injected

and the malfunction of the device or a similar device that they market wou ld be likely to cause or 
contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.  The Sponsor will review 
all reported SAEs, UADEs and AESIs in order to determine if they are MDR reportable events. 
Upon Sponsor confirmation that an MDR rep ortable event has occurred, the Sponsor will report 
the event to the FDA as per 21 CFR 803.10, 21 CFR 803.50, and/or 21 CFR 803.53.  
9.4.14.1  Pregnancy  
The TI must report pregnancy to TEOXANE  within 48 hours of learning of it using the specific 
pregnancy form and send it to the same e -mail address as for SAE reporting.  
Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, elective abortion due to a 
congenital abnormality, or a comp lication of pregnancy  or a congenital abnormality diagnosed at 
any time during the pregnancy or postpartum  are considered SAEs and must be reported as such. 
An elective abortion of a normal pregnancy without complications is not considered an SAE.  
Every ef fort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition 
of the infant. It is the responsibility of the TI to obtain this information within 28 calendar days 
after the initial notification and approximately 28 calendar days p ostpartum. The need for safety 
follow -up until birth will not hold up the study database lock. If the study is completed and/or the 
study database is locked before the postpartum follow -up is expected, the TI will notify 
TEOXANE  of the outcome of the pregn ancy only via e -mail: medical@teoxane.com  and the 
pregnancy notification will be processed accordingly outside the eCRF.  
In addition to the above, if the TI determines that the pregnancy meets seriousness criteria, it must 
be reported also as an SAE (in addition to reporting the pregnancy itself) .

10.1 Completion  
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all the 
assessments or has experienced an event that precludes further participation in the study.  
10.2 Withdrawal  
A subject will be  withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
- Lost to follow -up; 
- Withdrawal of consent;  
- The Principal Investigator believes that for safety reasons (e.g. , AE, concurrent illness) that 
it is in the best interests of the subject to be withdrawn from study participation;  
- The subject’s attending physician  requests that the subject be withdrawn from the study;  
- The Principal Investigator or the Sponsor, for any reason, stops the study or stops the 
subject’s participation in the study.  
Protocol deviations will not lead to automatic withdrawal unless they indi cate a significant risk to 
the subject’s safety. All major protocol deviations must be discussed promptly with the Medical 
Monitor . 
A subject may be  withdrawn from the study, in consultation with the Medical Monitor , for any of 
the following reasons:  
- Lack of compliance to study procedures;  
- A major protocol deviation or violation;  
- Poor visit attendance.  
Should a subject decide to withdraw after administration of a study device(s), or should the 
Principal Investigator decide to withdraw the subject, the Principal Investigator (or designate) will 
complete and report the observations up to the time of withdr awal.  
All subjects who are withdrawn from the study will be requested to come in to complete their next 
scheduled clinic  visit. The next scheduled visit may be brought forward to facilitate this. A 
complete evaluation at the time of the subject ’s withdrawa l should be made.  Additionally, subjects 
who withdraw from the study will be requested to allow continued safety monitoring , either via 
telephone interviews  or clinic visits, whichever is more appropriate.  
The reason and date of withdrawal must be noted on the eCRF. If the reason for withdrawal is an 
AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will continue until resolution or until an 
appropriate medical judgment concerning the cause or importance has been made. The specific 
event or test result(s) must be recorded on the eCRF.  
10.3 Stopping Rules  
In the case of the following SAE occurring, patient enrollment and treatment of subjects at that 
site will be suspended until a root -cause investigation (including the Medical Monitor 
consultation), is  performed:  
• Anaphylactic reactions or severe allergic reactions  
• Vascular embolic event leading to skin necrosis

section), if confirmed and judged clinically signifi cant by the eye specialist (i.e., 
ophthalmologist)  
• Stroke  
• Cerebral ischemia or cerebral hemorrhage leading to stroke, skin necrosis, and damage to 
underlying facial structures  
Administration of hyaluronidase should be considered for any device related SAE( s) reported and 
should be recorded on the eCRF of the subject as concomitant treatment.  
If the cause of the event was anticipated  (e.g., the Investigator did not properly follow the study 
protocol), the study site may resume after appropriate corrective ac tions have been successfully 
implemented (e.g., retraining of the TI or change of the TI).  
If the cause of the event was unanticipated  (UADE) , the TI will follow the procedure as noted in 
Section 9.4.13.2. T he entire study must be immediately suspended, and subject enrolment and/or 
treatment will be stopped. The study enrolment will remain on -hold until the event can be properly 
characterized and an appropriate treatment strategy to avoid this unanticipated e vent be devised.  
The subjects already enrolled will continue to be followed for safety and efficacy assessments.  
The study may resume if the underlying problem can be addressed and the safety of subjects can 
be ensured. The IRB(s) will be notified if the s tudy is stopped, and permission to resume the study 
will be obtained from the FDA and IRB prior to restarting as described in Section 9.4. 13.2.

11.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be aesthetic improvement from pre -injection as assessed 
by the NLF -WSRS (BLE) at 12 weeks  (V4)  following last treatment . The effectiveness of RHA®4 
will be demonstrated if RHA®4 used in conjunction with cannula is statistically non -inferior to 
RHA®4 with sharp needle  as assessed by the BLE at 12 weeks after the last treatment . 
In order to confirm assay sensitivity at 12 weeks, the proportion of responders of ≥1 -grade point 
on the NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks for the group injected with a needle (control) is required to be 
≥70% (when compared to pre -treatment).  
11.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The following secondary effectiveness endpoints will be explored:  
1) NLF -WSRS (BLE) responders (change from Baseline of ≥1 -grade) at 12 weeks following last 
treatment.  
2) NLF -WSRS (TI) change from Baseline at 4, 8 and 12 weeks following last treatment .

12) Number of treatment sessions to obtain optimal cosmetic result.  
13) Treatment volume to obtain optimal cosmetic result.  
14) Ease of injection (initial injection).  
11.3 Safety Endpoints  
The following safety endpoints will be explored:  
1) AEs across the duration of the study (incidence, intensity, and duration) . 
2) AEs of Special Interest (AESI) across the duration of the study (i.e., visual disturbances such 
as loss of vision, blurriness, double vision, pain in or around the eyes, blindness, blind spot or 
shadow in the visual field, trouble moving eyes, ocular hypotonia, ptosis, etc.) . 
3) Post-injection Common Treatment Response (4 -week CTR diar y; incidence, intensity, and 
duration) . 
4) Visual assessments (Snellen visual acuity, confrontational visual field test, ocular motility) at 
Visit 1 (pre - and post -injection), Visit 2 (pre - and post -injection  [if Touch -Up]) as well as at 
all other follow -up visits.

Three subject analysis populations are defined: Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population, Per Protocol (PP) 
Population, and Safety (SAFT) Population. All analysis populations will be defined and 
determined prior to database closure and unblinding for the final analysis.   
11.4.1  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT Population will consist of all subjects who were randomized. The ITT princ iple will be 
followed in that subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned as per the 
randomization schedule. Furthermore, all subjects in the ITT Population will be included in the 
analysis, regardless of availability of data at the time point of interest.  The ITT Population will be 
the primary population used for effectiveness analyses  of secondary efficacy endpoints . 
11.4.2  Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP Population will consist of all study subjects who 1) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, 2) 
successfully completed the study and 3) experienced no major protocol violations/deviations that 
could affect efficacy assessments. The decision whether a protocol violation/deviation is relevant 
for the exclusion of subjec ts from the PP Population will be made in a data review meeting prior 
to breaking the study blind. The PP Population will be the primary population used for 
effectiveness analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint.  Major protocol deviations that will result  
in a subject being excluded from the PP population are as follows:  
a) Failure to meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria as defined in the study protocol;  
b) Missing NLF -WSRS score (BLE) at Visit 1;  
c) Missing NLF -WSRS (BLE) at Visit 4 (Week 12); 
d) Visit 4 (Week 12) occurring outside a window of 84±14 days* from the last study treatment 
(i.e., Visit 1 or Visit 2);  
e) Study treatment not received at Visit 1;  
f) Missed Visit 2 (i.e., no opportunity for the subject to receive touch -up treatment);  
g) Study device injection volu me that exceeds 6.0 mL per injection session ( right NLF  + left 
NLF ), 3.0 mL right side , or 3.0 mL left side . 
* The study protocol stipulated a window of 84±7 days; however, to be considered a major protocol deviation that 
affects the PP population, the visit must occur outside a window of ±14 days.  
11.4.3  Safety (SAFT) Population  
The SAFT Population will consist of all study subjects who were randomized and received 
treatment with the study device.  The SAFT Population will be the primary populat ion used for 
effectiveness analyses of the safety outcomes . 
11.5 Sample Size Considerations  
In a previous NLF split -face study that compared RHA®4 and Perlane -L® ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in 120 
subjects , and that used the same validated NLF -WSRS Scale as being utilized in the current study, 
the mean (SD) change from Baseline in NLF -WSRS score at 24 -weeks post -treatment (BLE 
assessment) was -1.34 (0.57) for RHA®4  and -1.16 (0.62) for Perlane -L®. The mean difference 
(RHA®4 minus Perlane -L®) in change from Baselin e in NLF -WSRS scoring at 24 -weeks post -
treatment  was -0.18 with a 95% CI of -0.29 to -0.07; from this, we can estimate that the SD of the 
difference was 0.61.

CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 51 of 67 While it can be assumed that these data from [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] can be applied for NLF -WSRS 
assessments (BLE) at 12 -weeks in the current study , to conservatively accommodate the difference 
in observation periods, the SD of the difference will be set to 0.75.  
Assuming a mean difference of 0 between RHA®4 (Cannula) and RHA®4 (Needle), and assuming 
a SD of 0.75 , non -inferiority for each device tested using a bilateral 97.5% CI and a non -inferiority 
upper bound of 0.5, a sample size of 38 subjects for each treatment group is required for 80% 
power to detect non -inferiority for RHA®4. As this is a split -face study , 38 subjects will provide a 
sample size of n=38 for each treatment group.  
Assuming a 20% drop -out rate, a minimum of 50 subjects (38 / 0.8 = 47.5) will be required.  
11.6 General Considerations  
Data will be listed by treatment group and subject number. Safety and efficacy data will be 
summarized by treatment group . Descriptive statistics will consist of  mean, standard deviation, 
minimum /maximum for continuous variables, and frequency and percent for discrete variables.  
A full description of the statistical methods planned for this study will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved by the study Sponsor prior to the 
last subject’s last visit. All programs for data output a nd analyses will be written in SAS version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  
Missing Values  
There will be no missing values for the primary effectiveness endpoint analysis as the PP 
population will be employed. For the ITT analysis of the prim ary effectiveness endpoint, multiple 
imputation will be used for missing observations. Specifically, missing change from baseline in 
NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks will be imputed using the regression method with treatment group as the 
independent variable  and with age and NLF -WSRS at earlier timepoints as covariates . Number of 
imputations will equal the percentage of subjects with missing data, rounded up to an integer. 
Results will be combined using the Rubin method ( Rubin DB. Multiple Imputation for 
Nonresponse in  Surveys. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1987) . 
No imputation will be performed for secondary effectiveness endpoints or safety outcomes; 
analyses will utilize available data as observed.  
Discontinuation and Drop -Outs  
Dropouts will not be replaced. All avail able data from dropouts will be included in analyses using 
the ITT population. Subject disposition will summarize the number of subjects enrolled in the 
study, subjects who discontinued from the study and reasons for discontinuation.  
Interim Analysis  
There  will be no interim effectiveness analysis.  
Poolability of Investigative Sites : To assess site poolability  for the test of the primary null 
hypothesis that the mean difference in NLF -WSRS change from baseline between needle and 
cannula is 0, “difference” will be analyzed as the dependent variable in an ANOVA with “site” as 
the categorical independent variable.  If “site” is not significant at the 0.20 level, a paired t -test (or 
Wilcoxon signed rank test) will be used to test the null hypothesis. If “site” is significant at the 
0.20 level, a random effects general linear model will be used, with “site” as a rando m effect and 
no fixed effects; in this model, the test of the intercept is the test of the null hypothesis.

Any material disruption to the study due to COVID -19 will be addressed, as appropriate, in post -
hoc sentivity anslyses.  
11.7 Effective ness Analysis  
11.7.1  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of NLF -WSRS change from Baseline at 12 weeks  as rated by the BLE will 
be analyzed in a non -inferiority statistical model using the PP population with a 0.5 margin  for the 
difference between cannula and needle . A sensitivity analsyis will be done using the ITT 
population. Expressing the difference be tween treatment groups as  the mean of change from 
Baseline in  RHA®4 injected with needle minus change from Baseline in RHA®4 injected with 
cannula, the one-sided 97.5% confidence limit must be < 0.5 to conclude non -inferiority. A paired 
t-test will be used  to calculate the confidence interval to account for dependence.  The formal 
hypothesis set to be tested is:  
Ho:  µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  > 0.5 
Ha:  µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  < 0.5  
where µ Δ(needle  – cannula)  represents the mean difference in change from Baseline between needle and 
cannula.  
In order to confirm assay sensitivity at 12 weeks, the proportion of responders of ≥1 -grade point 
on the NLF -WSRS at 12 weeks for the group injected with a needle (control) is required to be 
≥70% (when compared to pre -treatment).  
Based on past experience , change from Baseline is expected to be normally distributed. However, 
if the normality assumption for the paired t -test is not met based on the Shapiro -Wilk test, a 
normalizing data transformation will be applied and confidence intervals will then be bac k-
transformed to assess non -inferiority.  
11.7.2  Secondary Endpoints  
All statistical inference tests will be performed at the same significance level (α) of 0.05.  For 
categorical and continuous variables, the two groups will be compared using two -sided parametric 
or non -parametric tests for paired data, as appropriate.  For continuous variables, the Shapiro -Wilk 
test will be used to assess normality. If data appear normally distributed, testing will be conducted 
using the Student t -test, while testing will be conduc ted with the Wilcoxon  signed -rank test if not 
normally distributed.  
11.8 Safety Analysis  
The SAFT P opulation will be used to summarize the safety of  the study devices and will consist 
of all treated subjects. The primary safety analysis is the calculation of  the incidence of CTRs and 
adverse events in the study period . Point estimates for all CTRs, AEs and SAEs will be presented 
and two -sided exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the overall incidence of AEs 
and SAEs . Tables will  be generated which summarize AEs by investigator assessments of both 
relationship to treatment and severity.  
11.8.1  Adverse Events (A Es) 
Safety outcomes will be incidence rate of A Es, including UADEs, types of AEs and their severity 
and relationship to study treatment .

v.1.5; 06-May-2021                         Page 53 of 67 AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. 
These events, irrespective of relationship to study medication, will be summarized by MedDRA 
system organ class  (SOC)  and MedDRA preferred term  (PT). The number of subjects reporting an 
AE, the number of A Es, and percentages of subjects in each category will be summarized. A Es by 
severity and relationship to study will be summarized in a similar way. Serious A Es will be 
summarized separately.  Speci fically, t he following AE incidence tables will be provided:  
• All and possibly * related A Es sorted by SOC  
• All and possibly * related A Es sorted by decreasing frequency  
• SAEs: All and possibly * related SAEs sorted by seriousness criterion  
• SAEs: All and possibly * related SAEs sorted by SOC  
• UADEs: All and possibly * related  UADEs  sorted by SOC  
• Death: All and possibly * related  deaths  sorted by SOC  
* definitely probably, possibly  
Incidence rates with two -sided exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the overall 
incidence of AEs and SAEs  
Statistical analysis will also be performed to evaluate the potential imp act of the injection 
technique on the AE incidence rates . 
11.8.2  Injection Site Pain  
Injection site pain, as measured using a 100 mm VAS,  at each post -treatment time point (i.e., 
immediately after injection and 5, 30 and 60 minutes)  will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum).

12.1 Informed Consent  
This study will be conducted in compliance with 21 CFR Part 50 for informed consent. Written 
informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any procedures or assessments are 
done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are explain ed. It will 
also be explained to the subject that they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw 
from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
Written and/or oral information about the study in a language understandab le by the subject will 
be given to all subjects. The information provided must include an adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards, compensation and/or honoraria, and 
insurance arrangements in force.  
The subject’s willingness to participate in the study will be documented in writing on a consent 
form, which will be signed by the subject with the date and time of that signature indicated. The 
site will keep the original consent forms and copies will be given to the s ubjects.  
See also Section  9.1.  
12.2 Health Authorities and IRBs  
The Principal Investigator will ensure that the conduct of the study conforms to the Declaration of 
Helsinki, the Belmont Report, and with national laws and regulations for clinical research.  
Before starting this study, the protocol will be submitted to the FDA  and central IRB for evaluation. 
As required, the study will not start before the IRB  and the FDA give approval.  
12.3 Confidentiality Regarding Study Subjects  
The Principal Investigator must assure that the privacy of the subjects, including their personal 
identity and  all personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In eCRFs and other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor, subjects will not  be identified by their names, but by an 
identification code (e.g. , subject or screen number).  
The site monitor, properly authorized persons on behalf of the Sponsor’s quality assurance unit, 
or competent authorities may scrutinize personal medical information for the purpose of verifying 
data recorded on the eCRF. Perso nal medical information will always be treated as confidential, 
according to local privacy regulations.

13.1 Protocol Amendments  
No amendments to the protocol will be implemented without the prior written consent of the 
Sponsor . Should an amendment be necessary, the reviewing IRB  and FDA may require review 
and approval prior to its implementation.  
13.2 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
13.2.1  Information to Study Personnel  
The Principal Investigator , with the assistance of ethica CRO , is res ponsible for ensuring that all 
study personnel are qualified for their designated roles and for provid ing information about the 
study to all staff members involved in the study or in any element of subject management, both 
before starting the practical performance of the study and during the course of the study (e.g. , when 
new staff become involved).  
The ethica CRO  site monitor is responsible for initiating the site, conducting interim monitoring 
visits, ensuring site compliance with the protocol and closing out the site at the end of the study. 
Additional information available during the study should be given  as agreed upon, either by the 
Principal Investigator or the site monitor, and always when new staff members become involved 
in the study.  
13.2.2  Study Monitoring  
ethica CRO  clinical monitors will conduct approximately 2-3 on-site or remote interim monitoring 
visits at each study site in order to ensure compliance to the protocol , applicable regulations,  and 
ICH-GCP, and to ensure safety of the subjects  and maintenance of adequate and accurate clinical 
records.  A dedicated close -out visit wil l also be conducted at each site.  
Monitoring functions will be performed in compliance with GCP  and the study specific Monitoring 
Plan. The Principal Investigator agrees to allow the site monitors, and other authorized Sponsor 
personnel, access to the clinical supplies, the investigational agent dispensing and storage area, 
subject medical records, laboratory data, and other source documentation of the study subjects.  
Source Document works heets for all  subjects and eCRFs  will be reviewed in detail by the site 
monitor to ensure data integrity . If errors or omissions are found in the course of a data audit, or if 
clarification of data is required, the eCRFs and/or worksheets in question will be corrected by the 
study coordinator and confirmed /signed for by the TI or BLE , as appropriate . Data clarification or 
query forms may be generated for omissions or clarifications, to be completed and returned to the 
site monitor.  
The dates of monitoring v isits will be recorded by the site monitor in a sign -in log to be kept at the 
site. The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the study coordinator and Principal 
Investigator will be available, the source documentation will be available, and a suitable 
environment  for on -site visits will be provided for review of study -related documents.  
The TI and assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the site monitor to resolve any problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concern ing any data discrepancies detected in the course of 
these monitoring visits.  
As part of the supervision of the study progress other Sponsor personnel may accompany the site 
monitor on visits to the study site.

According to ICH Guidelines on GCP, the Sponsor (or its designate) may audit the investigational 
site to compare raw data, source data, and associated records with the interim (if applicable) or 
final report of the study to assure that data have been accurately reported . 
The Principal Investigator must accept that regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection to 
verify compliance of the study with GCP.  The Principal Investigator should notify the Sponsor 
and ethica CRO  no later than 24 hours upon notification of being au dited by the FDA  or IRB.  
13.3 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical study protocol, GCP, or Manual of 
Procedures requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the Principal 
Investigator,  or the study site staff. As a result of deviation s, corrective actions are to be developed 
by the site and implemented promptly.  It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance 
to identify and promptly report deviations to ethica CRO.   
All deviations from the protocol must be addressed i n study subject source documents. A 
completed copy of the ethica CRO  Protocol Deviation Form  must be maintained in the regulatory 
file, as well as in the subject’s source document. Protocol deviations must be sent to the IRB per 
its guidelines.  
The protoco l must be rigorously adhered to; however, exceptions will be made in emergency 
situations when the protection, safety, and well -being of the subject requires immediate 
intervention based on the judgment of an Investigator.  
Protocol deviations are termed as Major or Minor, as defined below:  
• Minor Protocol Deviation:  any difference or departure in the conduct of a study from the 
criteria and/or procedures prescribed in the IRB approved protocol which does not  affect 
the participant’s rights, safety, welfare, and/or the integrity of the study and resultant data.  
deviations may result from action or inaction of the participant, investigator or staff.  
1. Deviation has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants;  
2. Deviation has no substantiv e effect on the value of the data collected (i.e., the 
deviation does not confound the scientific analysis of the results);  
3. Deviation did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s) and;  
4. The deviation did not result in or require any substantive action to be taken or result 
in any change to the subject’s condition or status (i.e., did not affect the subject’s 
participation in any way, did not result in a change to the subject’s emotional or 
clinical condition, did not ca use an adverse experience or require a change to the 
clinical care of the subject, etc.)  
• Major Protocol Deviation:  Any difference or departure from the criteria and/or 
procedures prescribed in the IRB approved protocol that affects the participant’s rights , 
safety, welfare, increases the risk/benefit ratio, or compromises the integrity of the study’s 
data.  
1. Deviation resulted in or required a substantive action to be taken or resulted in a 
change to the subject’s condition or status;

participants;  
3. Deviation has damaged the scient ific integrity of the data collected for the study;  
4. Deviation is evidence of willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s);  
5. Deviation involves serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state or local 
research regulations;  
6. There h ave been repeated minor protocol deviations from the same 
investigator/research staff;  
7. There has been a failure to follow action ordered to correct minor protocol deviations.  
Protocol deviations that will result in a subject being excluded from the Per-Protocol population 
are detailed in protocol Section 11.4.2.

14.1 Source Data  
The site is required to maintain adequate and accurate medical records designed to record all 
observations and other data pertinent to the study  for each study subject . Source documentation is 
generally considered to be the document on which the information or data point was first recorded. 
Source documentation may include a subject ’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, and 
the site’s  study files as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as X -rays, laboratory tests, and 
electrocardiograms . 
Source Document Worksheets will be prepared by ethica CRO Inc. for this purpose and serve as 
part of the source record for a subject's study -related data. The Source Document Worksheets  will 
allow for the collection of the following information and allow for  verification of subject identity 
throughout the study : 
a. Subject’s name ; 
b. Subject’s contact information ; 
c. The date that the subject entered the study and the subject number assigned ; 
d. The study title and/or the protocol number of the study and the Sponsor’s name ; 
e. A statement of the ICF process and the date that informed consent , HIPAA  and California 
Experimenta l Research Subject’s Bill of Rights (if applicable)  were signed ; 
f. Records of previous and current dermatological treatments and/or therapies ; 
g. Dates of all subject visits ; 
h. NLF -WSRS , GAIS, FACE -Q, S atisfaction  assessments , Symmetry, and pain at time of 
injection  (and at 5, 30 and 60 minutes after injection) ; 
i. 4-week  patient CTR diaries ; 
j. Study device injection volumes and injection techniques ; 
k. All prescription and non -prescription concurrent medications, therapies, and treatments (up 
to 30 days prior to enrollment through the final study visit) and any changes to the list of 
medications ; 
l. Visual assessments  
m. Occurrence and status of any A Es; 
n. The d ate the subject exited the study, and a notation as to whether the subject completed the 
study or reason for discontinuation ; 
o. The results of urine pregnancy testing, if performed . 
Pertinent records related to the study (e.g., the subject’s medical chart) will be made available to 
the Sponsor representative on request with due precaution to protect the privacy of the subject. If 
applicable (i.e., SAE reporting), personal identifying information (except subject initials) will be 
redacted on any photocopies of relevant medical records and replaced with the unique subject 
number before submission to the Sponsor. The TI will protect the confidentiality of all subjects’ 
records within appl icable federal, state and local laws.  
A subject identification code list will be maintained in order to allow unambiguous identification 
of each subject included in the study. This list should contain the subject’s full name, date of birth, 
dates of partic ipation and identification number as per local  regulations.

authorities, ensuring the data is held confidentially at the site after completion of the study.  A note 
will be made in the hospital or clinical medical records, if appropriate, that the subject is 
participating in a clinical study.  
The eCRF and subject s’ medical records will be reviewed by ethica CRO , representatives from 
TEOXANE  SA, the IRB , and/or the  FDA to the extent permitted by regulations.  
14.2 Case Report Form  
In this study the case report form will be an eCRF. The study coordinator must complete the eCRF 
for each subject within a timely manner of the visit occurring.  
The site monitor will r eview the completed eCRF  for accuracy, completeness and consistency with 
source documentation  (i.e., medical records, source document worksheets, etc.) . The site monitor 
will submit requests for correction/clarification of data (e.g., queries) to the study  coordinator 
when inconsistencies are identified during monitoring and source data verification or during the 
edit check process.   
All corrections and alterations of eCRF data must be made by the study coordinator in a timely 
manner and according to the in structions provided. Completed eCRFs  for each visit  (i.e., those 
reviewed by ethica CRO  and with no remaining queries) should then be reviewed and 
electronically signed by the  TI. In order to  review and electronically sign the eCRF, the TI will 
each have his/her own login that  will allow them to view only the data that they have generated.  
A full audit trail detailing corrections and alterations made to the eCRF will be maintained.  
Upon study completion, a softcopy of the eCRF for each subject will be provided to the site. 
14.3 Archiving of Study Documentation  
Essential documents are any records that demonstrate the compliance of the subject, Investigator s, 
Sponsor, and site monitor with the study protocol, with standards of GCP, and with all applicable 
regulatory requirements. Essential documents (including but not limited to study -related 
correspondence (including emails), subject records, subject privacy documentation, reco rds of the 
distribution and use of  study devices , and copies of eCRFs should be retained and available for 
audit by the Sponsor’s auditor and regulatory authorities until at least 2 years after the latest among 
the following scenarios:  completion or termin ation of the study, the last approval of a marketing 
application, no pending or contemplated marketing applications, or formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of RHA4. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, 
if mandated by  the applicable regulatory requirements, by conditions imposed by the IRB, or by 
an agreement with the Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Principal 
Investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
The Sponsor mu st be notified in writing if the Principal Investigator chooses to store the records 
at a different physical address than the site address or if the Principal Investigator wishes to 
relinquish ownership of the data so that mutually agreed -upon arrangements  can be made for 
transfer of ownership to a suitably qualified, responsible person.

APPENDIX A: ADJUS TMENTS OF VISITS AND ASSESSMENTS DUE TO 
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF COVID -19 
1. General Guidance  
Subject safety and preserving the integrity of the data are of the highest priority. Any federal, state 
and local rules, guidances, or laws shall be followed.  
Study visits and procedures should be followed per -protocol whenever possible. Any specific 
chan ges in study conduct that deviate from the protocol should be communicated to the sponsor 
via reporting to the site’s Clinical Research Associate (CRA), Clinical Project Manager (CPM), 
and IRB, as applicable. All protocol  deviations which occur as a result  of COVID -19 disruptions  
(including remote visits) , will be differentiated from other deviations and must be documented on 
the appropriate reporting forms/source document, and clearly annotated “protocol deviations due 
to COVID -19 illness/restrictions/ etc.”. If the subject is unable or unwilling to come to the site due 
to COVID -19, the TI needs to ask for the reasons and document them in the source documents.  
The TI is responsible for ensuring subjects’ safety and for monitoring all active subjects per 
protocol. TI must ensure that study subjects are kept informed of changes to the study and 
monitoring plans that could impact them.  
Should a subject develop any symptoms that could be related to COVID -19 or any other acute 
infection disease, the subject will b e instructed to:  
• Contact the TI as soon as possible  
• Contact their general physician to be examined and determine the course of action 
according to the standard of care.  
The TI or designee will follow -up with the subject as needed but at least within 72 hou rs of 
awareness to obtain an update on the subject’s health and to obtain information on whether 
COVID -19 has been diagnosed or not. If the subject has been diagnosed with COVID -19, the event 
will be reported as an AE.  
2. Adjustment of Study Visits  
Telemedicine is understood as a possible solution due to COVID -19 disruption and it is not 
mandatory; if the situation allows it, study visits should be done in person.  
On-site Study Visit: If the local situation allows for conduct of on -site study visits, the TI and 
study personnel must take all necessary steps/precautionary measures at the site to minimize or 
eliminate immediate hazards of viral transmission within and/or outside the clinic al site premises.  
Before any research activities occur on -site, both subjects and research staff should be screened 
for symptoms or risk of COVID -19 infection. Subjects should be pre -screened by phone before 
their on -site study visit.  
If the local situati on only allows for completion of some study procedures, the TI will prioritize 
the research activities that absolutely require an in -person visit in order to maintain the viability 
and integrity of the research (e.g., device injections, injection pain VAS,  BLE assessments). The 
TI may consider conducting the other assessments (e.g., medical history review, subject

However, all efforts should be made to cond uct all assessments at the scheduled visits, if possible.  
Remote Study Visit: If the local situation does not allow for an on -site study visit to be conducted 
or if a subject does not wish to come to the study site, a remote study visit may be conducted vi a 
video conferencing in lieu of an on -site visit. Phone call may also be used to perform some 
assessments if a subject has no video conferencing capabilities.  
To preserve the primary endpoint, the mandatory in -clinic visits are Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 2 
(touch -up), and Visit 4 (Week 12).  
The TI or study personnel who will conduct remote visits must be trained on how to conduct real -
time video conferencing visits. Also, procedures should be put in place to maintain the subject’s 
privacy, as would be done f or a clinical visit:  
• Before the scheduled date of the visit:  
o The site personnel should determine if the subject can accommodate  for video 
conferencing (e.g., internet access, PC, smartphone, video conference apps, etc.).  
o The TI or site personnel conducting the remote visit should obtain the subject’s verbal 
consent before proceeding with the visit and document it in the source document. The 
TI or personnel should also explain to the subject how the visit will be conducted.  
o The site personnel shoul d send all required study material to conduct the visit to the 
subject (e.g., study questionnaires, UPTs, etc.).  
o A test call may also be completed with the subject prior to the appointment.  
• On the day of the scheduled visit:  
o Both the investigator/site del egate and the subject should confirm their respective 
identities with one another before engaging in a real -time video conference visit. For 
example, the site personnel will state their name and role and the subject may be 
identified by using two subject i dentifiers (e.g., name and date of birth) and a photo 
ID. 
o The date and time of the real -time video interaction, the location of the subject, and 
the location of the TI or site personnel conducting the remote visit should be 
documented in the source document.  
o Remote collection of data by TI or delegate will be conducted as described in section 
3 below.  
3. Adjustment of Study Assessments  
Informed consent: The following process will be followed for consenting a prospective subject 
remotely:  
• Each subject w ill be provided with a copy of the IRB -approved consent form to aid in the 
consent discussion before the consent process begins. The consent form may be provided 
to a prospective subject by mail or e -mail.  
• The TI and/or site delegate will participate in t he consent process via video conference. All 
parties must introduce themselves and their role in the consenting process.

invited to ask any questions and to have t hem addressed by the study team.   
• If the subject is interested in joining the research study, the subject will be asked to sign 
the consent document. The personnel conducting the consent process must verify that the 
subject physically signed the consent d ocument by viewing via video conference  and then 
obtain a photo or scanned copy of the signed consent form before proceeding with study 
assessments.  
• In order to obtain the required signatures from the TI and person conducting the consent 
process on the sam e day, the site will either sign a separate copy of the informed consent 
form or ask the subject to send a copy of the signed ICF by e -mail.  
• The site should ensure to obtain all signature pages from the subject and to document the 
consent process in the s ource document. The site should also file in the source document 
all signed components as one combined document and provide a copy to the subject.  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria: The list of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed via video 
conference  or phone call with the subject to confirm that they are eligible for the study. Data will 
be documented in the source documents and eCRF.  
For potential subjects in a high -risk population for COVID -19 (e.g., 60 years old and older, with 
comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory system issues, etc.), deferring 
participation should be considered to minimize risks of exposure.  
UPT (if applicable): UPTs cannot be conducted remotely.   
Demographics: Demographic information will be collected via video conference or phone call 
from the subject at the remote screening visit and will be documented in the source documents and 
eCRF.  
Medical and surgical history / Concomitant medications: Medical history and concomitant 
medications will be  reviewed via video conference or  phone call at each remote visit and reported 
in the source documents and eCRF.  
Photography: Standardized photographs can be performed by the subject using a specific 
Canfield tool for visits not associated  with the primary outcome ( i.e., Visits 2, 2b, and 3) . 
Randomization: Randomization is performed before initial treatment . Therefore, subjects will be 
required to present themselves at the clinic for randomization.   
Injection: Injections of study devices cannot be a dministered remotely. Therefore, subjects will 
be required to present themselves at the clinic for study treatments:  
• Initial Treatment (Visit 1): In order to participate in this study, subjects must agree to 
travel to the clinic to receive their initial tr eatment with the study devices.  
• Optional Touch -Up Treatment (Visit 2): If the TI deems a touch -up appropriate, subjects 
must agree to travel to the clinic to receive their touch -up treatment with the study devices .

subject at each remote study visit. Any AE/SAE (including suspected / confirmed COVID -19 
cases) elicited by a subject during a remote visit / phone call must be immediately captured, and 
all att empts should be done to capture the necessary clinical and medical information. Reporting 
of AEs and SAEs to the Sponsor and IRB should follow the protocol procedure and IRB 
requirements.  
Vision Assessments: Vision assessments  cannot be performed remotely.  However  an ophthalmic 
follow -up questionnaire completed by the TI. Any abnormal vision related symptoms or signs 
noted in the questionnaire require IMMEDIATE and EMERGENT referral to the designated on -
call ophthalmologist. The results are  documented in th e source documents and eCRF  
TI Assessments (NLF -WSRS, GAIS, and Symmetry): All TI assessments may be conducted 
remotely via video conference with the subject and results documented in the source documents 
and eCRF.  
BLE Assessments (NLF -WSRS, GAIS, and Symm etry): The primary effectiveness endpoint 
will be aesthetic improvement from pre -injection as assessed by the NLF -WSRS (BLE) at Visit 4. 
As such, the BLE assessment of the NLF -WSRS at Visit 1 and Visit 4 cannot  be conducted 
remotely. Therefore, subjects wi ll be asked to travel to the clinic at those visits in order for the 
BLE to perform a live NLF -WSRS assessment. GAIS and Symmetry BLE assessments may be 
conducted remotely via video conference with the subject and results documented in the source 
documents  and eCRF.  
Subject Assessments (FACE -Q, GAIS, Patient Satisfaction, Symmetry): All subject 
assessments will be contained in a single questionnaire booklet that will be sent by email to the 
subject for completion at each remote visit. In order to perform th e GAIS, the subject’s baseline 
photo will also be provided by email. The subject will be asked to mail or e -mail the completed 
questionnaire booklets to the site after each remote visit.  
Provide 4 -week CTR e -diary to subject: After each treatment, the stud y coordinator will activate 
the e -diary and train the subject on proper use and completion. Training may be done on -site or 
remotely per subject’s preference. The subject will complete the e -diary over the next 4 weeks.

Version 1.0 Page 7 of 28                                                         05-May-2025 1.0 INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to outline the primary statistical analyses for the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to Optimize Post-Operative Recovery (COPE) trial. We will adhere to the CONSORT 2010 guideline when reporting the results of COPE. The structure of this statistical analysis plan follows the Guidelines for the Content of Statistical Analysis Plans in Clinical Trials.1 Additional SAPs will be developed for secondary analyses of trial data.  The primary objective of the COPE trial is to determine if cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), versus usual care, reduces the prevalence of moderate to severe Persistent Post-Surgical Pain (PPSP) over 12 months post-fracture in participants with an open or closed fracture of the appendicular skeleton.   The secondary objectives of the COPE trial are to determine if CBT, versus usual care: 1) increases physical functioning over 12 months post-fracture, 2) improves mental functioning over 12 months post-fracture, 3) accelerates return to function over 12 months post-fracture, 4) reduces pain severity over 12 months post-fracture, 5) reduces pain interference over 12 months post-fracture, and 6) reduces the proportion of participants using opioid class medications at 6 and 12 months post-fracture in patients with an open or closed fracture of the appendicular skeleton.            2.0 TRIAL POPULATION 2.1 Patient Flow through the Trial The number of patients screened, included, and excluded will be presented in a flow diagram (Figure 1). The figure will include the number of participants who were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups. It will also include the number of participants who were subsequently deemed ineligible by the Central Adjudication Committee.    We will summarize the number of patients excluded by reason (Table 1) and the number of participants deemed ineligible by the Central Adjudication Committee by reason (Table 2).   Participants deemed ineligible by the Central Adjudication Committee will not be included in any analysis, as per guidance from Fergusson et al.2   Figure 1 will include participant follow-up and the number of participants who were lost to follow-up, along with the reason, over the course of the trial.    2.2 Participant Demographics, Injury, and Fracture Characteristics, and Surgical and Perioperative Care Details We will use descriptive measures to summarize participant demographics, baseline information, injury, fracture characteristics, surgical, and perioperative care details of the sample stratified by treatment group (Tables 3 and 4). We will use means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous data, and categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. We will examine key baseline differences between those who stopped the CBT program early and those who did not.  We will not statistically test for differences in these characteristics between treatment groups (Section 3.2). The potential clinical importance of any imbalance between treatment groups will be noted.   

We will also look at levels of compliance by key baseline factors including the subgroup analysis factors, participant age (<60 versus ≥60), and injury severity (defined as an Injury Severity Score [ISS] greater than or equal to 9).  The data will be presented as frequencies and percentages (Tables 5 and 6).  2.4 Outcome Completion Rates We will report on the outcome completion rates at each follow-up visit. The data will be presented as frequencies and percentages (Table 7).    3.0 ANALYSIS 3.1 Analysis Methods The primary and secondary analyses will be conducted following intention-to-treat (ITT) principles, ensuring that participants are analyzed in their originally assigned treatment groups, regardless of adherence or protocol deviations. The date on which the participant’s fracture(s) occurred will be used as the starting point for all time-to-event analyses.   We will use multiple imputations to account for missing data in the analyses and minimize potential bias under the assumption that the data are missing at random (MAR). This approach will allow for the uncertainty associated with missing values to be properly accounted for, improving the robustness of statistical inferences.3 Additionally, as we anticipate high rates of early withdrawal, we will account for this in the analyses, if needed.  3.1.1 Primary Analysis We will use a mixed effects log-binomial model to determine the association between CBT treatment and moderate to severe PPSP (score of ≥4/10) over 12 months post-fracture.  The choice of using a PPSP score of ≥4/10 for the primary analysis was based on scores of less than 4 being defined as ‘mild’ pain, and so less important to patients. Prevalence of moderate to severe PPSP will be our dependent variable. Only the highest PPSP score at each visit will be included for participants with multiple fractures. CBT treatment status, stratification variables (clinical site, sex, at least one open fracture versus no open fracture(s), military, veteran or first responder versus others, and greater illness beliefs [defined as Somatic Pre-Occupation and Coping [SPOC] score ≥48] versus lesser illness beliefs [SPOC score <48]), and time of assessment (continuous measure in days) will be included in the model as fixed effects, with patients entered as a random intercept. A time-by-treatment interaction term will also be added to the model, allowing the treatment effect to vary over time. If the interaction between treatment and time is significant (p<0.05), indicating the effect of treatment varying over time, we will report the average treatment effect across 12 months and the treatment effect for each time point of variation. If the interaction between treatment and time is not significant (p≥0.05), suggesting a constant treatment effect over the study period, we will report the average treatment effect. Results will be reported using marginal standardization as adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and p-value (Table 8).  

The SF-36 is an established, reliable and validated health status measure.4–6 It measures HRQoL through an 8-domain profile of functional health and well-being, physical and mental health summary measures (PCS and MCS).  The SF-36 PCS and MCS are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible. SF-36 PCS and MCS scores will be included as the dependent variable in each corresponding model. CBT treatment status, stratification variables, and time of assessment (continuous measure in days) will be included in the models as fixed effects, with patients entered as a random intercept. The models will also be adjusted for baseline SF-36 PCS and MCS scores, accordingly, as well as including a time-by-treatment interaction term. If the interaction between treatment and time is significant (p<0.05), indicating the effect of treatment varying over time, we will report the average treatment effect across 12 months and the treatment effect for each time point of variation. If the interaction between treatment and time is not significant (p≥0.05), suggesting a constant treatment effect over the study period, we will report the average treatment effect. Results will be reported using marginal standardization as adjusted mean differences (aMDs) with 95% CIs and p-values (Table 8).   2) Return to Function: We will use Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to explore the association between: 1) CBT treatment status and returning to ≥80% of pre-injury functioning, 2) CBT treatment status and returning to full function with respect to work, 3) CBT treatment status and returning to full function with respect to leisure activities, and 4) CBT treatment status and returning to full function with respect to responsibilities around the home. These return to function components are measured using the Return to Function questionnaire, which has been used in a previous fracture trial7 documents when participants return to work, household activities, and leisure activities without limitations, as well as when they achieve 80% of their pre-injury function. Participants will be censored at their last documented follow-up visit. The analyses will adjust for stratification variables and the results will be reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs and p-values (Table 9).  3) Pain over Time: We will use cumulative logit modeling to explore the association of 1) CBT treatment status and Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Average Pain Severity scores over 12 months and 2) CBT treatment status and BPI-SF Pain Interference scores over 12 months. The BPI-SF assesses the severity of pain and its impact on function.8 All items are rated on a 0-10 scale, with higher scores indicating greater pain severity and interference. BPI-SF Average Pain Severity and BPI-SF Pain Interference scores will be included as the dependent variable in each corresponding model. CBT treatment status, stratification variables, and time of assessment (continuous measure in days) will be included in the models as fixed effects, with patients entered as a random intercept. The models will also be adjusted for baseline BPI-SF Average Pain Severity and BPI-SF Pain Interference scores, accordingly, as well as include a time-by-treatment 

If the interaction between treatment and time is significant (p<0.05), indicating the effect of treatment varying over time, we will report the average treatment effect across 12 months and the treatment effect for each time point of variation. If the interaction between treatment and time is not significant (p≥0.05), suggesting a constant treatment effect over the study period, we will report the average treatment effect. Results will be reported using marginal standardization as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% CIs and p-values (Table 8).  4) Opioid Use: We will use logistic regression modeling to explore the association between CBT treatment status and opioid use status. Two separate models will be created to analyze opioid use status (yes versus no) at both 6 months and 12 months. Opioid use status will be included as the dependent variable and each model will be adjusted for stratification variables. Results will be reported as ORs with 95% CIs and p-values (Table 8).   3.2 Subgroup Analyses To explore for treatment effect heterogeneity on trial outcomes, we will use the same analytical approach as specified for the primary outcome above but include a treatment by subgroup interaction term in the model. If we have enough participants to conduct reliable subgroup analyses, we will report results by the prespecified subgroups, which consist of: (1) sex (indicated as male or female), (2) the presence or absence of an eligible open fracture, (3) veteran/military/first responder status (as self-reported by the participant), and (4) SPOC Scores (defined as ≥48 or <48).  Towards the end of the trial, prior to unblinding, site location (Canada or the United States) was added as a subgroup in the analyses to assess its potential role as an effect modifier. Results will be reported using marginal standardization and stratified by the subgroup as aORs with 95% CIs, and the interaction p-values in a forest plot and table (Table 10). These analyses will be approached and reported in accordance with best practices and guidelines for subgroup analyses.9–13 For subgroup effects that show a statistically significant test of interaction (p≤0.05), we will use ICEMAN criteria to guide inferences about the credibility of our subgroup analyses.13   Subgroup Analyses Overview Objective  Hypothesis  Subgroup Analysis 1  Males versus females  CBT will be associated with a larger reduction in the prevalence 
of PPSP  in females compared to males . Subgroup Analysis 2  Any open fracture versus no 
open fracture  CBT will be associated with a larger reduction in the prevalence 
of PPSP  in participants with open fractures compared to 
participants with only closed fractures.  Subgroup Analysis 3  Military, veteran, and first 
responders versus other patients  CBT will be associated with a larger reduction in the prevalence 
of PPSP in participants who are employed by the military, 
veterans, or first responders.  Subgroup Analysis 4  

scores  CBT will be associated with a larger reduction in the prevalence 
of PPSP  in participants with higher versus  lower SPOC scores.  Subgroup Analysis 5  Site location (Canada versus  the 
United States)  CBT will be associated with a larger reduction in the preva lence 
of PPSP in participants from sites located in Canada.   3.3 Sensitivity and Exploratory Analyses We will conduct the following additional analyses to explore the robustness of our findings:  1. Assess if CBT, versus usual care, reduces the prevalence of any severity of PPSP over 12-months post-fracture (Table 11).  2. A sensitivity analysis limited to the primary outcome to compare those participants randomized to the CBT intervention at the primary site, defined as the site with the highest CBT compliance (Table 11)    3. Assess the primary outcome in only those participants randomized to the CBT intervention who fully adhered to: 1) at least three CBT modules and 2) at least six CBT modules (Table 11), limiting data to the primary site only, defined as the highest enrolling site.   These analyses will help determine whether greater engagement with CBT is associated with improved outcomes. The exploratory and sensitivity analyses will follow the same analysis methods as described for the primary outcome, including appropriate regression models and adjustments for stratification variables.  3.4 Harms The number and percentage of patients experiencing treatment-related serious adverse events and fracture-related complications will be presented by treatment arm (Table 12). No formal statistical testing will be undertaken.  3.5 Statistical Software All analyses will be performed using R (version 4.4.3 or newer, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).  

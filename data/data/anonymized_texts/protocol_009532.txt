Protocol Title:   A Phase 2 Open -Label Study of the Efficacy and Safety of ABT -199 (GDC -0199) in 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Subjects w ith Relapse or Refractory to B -Cell Receptor Signaling 
Pathw ay Inhibitor Therapy
Objective s:
Prim ary Objective:
The primary objective o f this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax monotherapy in 
subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) relapsed after or refractory to treatment with B -cell 
Receptor Signaling Pathway Inhibitors.  Efficacy will be measured by overall response rate (ORR).

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP), 
progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
Exploratory Objectives:
Time to Next Anti -CLL Treatment (TNT) and Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Status.  Health 
Economic and Patient -Reported Outcome Measures will include the EORTC QLQ C30 and EORTC 
QLQ CLL16 (a measure of health -related quality of life specific to CLL) and the EQ- 5D-5L (mea sure of 
general health status with visual analogue scale).
Note:  S tudy objectives, with the exception of Safety ,will not apply to the Extended Access period 
which will begin 2 years after last subject enrolled.
Investigators:   Investigator information o n file at AbbVie.
Study Site s:  Approximately 15 US research sites.
Study Population:   Relapsed or refractory CLL subjects after BCR Signaling Pathway Inhibitors.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 120.

Methodology:
This is an open -label, non -randomized, multicenter, Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
venetoclax in approximately 120 subjects w ith relapsed or refractory CLL after BCR Signaling Pathway 
Inhibitor (BCR PI) Treatment (specifically Ibrutinib, and Idel alisib).  Tw o arms and an expansion cohort 
will be implemented:  Arm A is designed to enroll approximately 40 subjects with relapsed or refractory 
CLL after Ibrutinib treatment, Arm B is designed to enroll approximately 20 subjects w ith relapsed or 
refract ory CLL after Idelalisib treatment and the Expansion Cohort is designed to enroll approximately 
60 subjects w ith relapsed or refractory CLL after either Ibrutinib or Idelalisib treatments.  Screening 
must be performed within 28 days of study drug administr ation.  PET/CT scans and bone marrow  
aspirate and biopsy must be performed within 28 days prior to study drug administration.  For subjects 
enrolled under Arm A and Arm B, restaging CT/MRI scans will be performed at Week 8, Week 24 and 
every 12 w eeks there after for a period of 1 year from enrollment and at the subject 's Final Visit.  For 
subjects enrolled under the Expansion Cohort, restaging CT/MRI scans will be performed at Week 12, 
Week 36 and at the subject 's Final Visit.  All subjects w ill have study v isits conducted on Day 1 of each 
week from Week 1 through Week 5, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, and then every 12 w eeks 
thereafter.  A Disease Assessment for clinical response by physical exam and hematologic assessments 
will be performed at Screening , Week 5 Day 1 (or Day 1 of the initiation of 400 mg of venetoclax) and 
beyond.  When an investigator has determined that a subject should discontinue the study, a Final Visit 
will be conducted as well as a 30 -Day Safety Follow -Up.  If the subject is disco ntinued from the study 
due to toxicities attributable to ABT -199, additional Follow -Up Visits will be conducted as clinically 
appropriate until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the adverse event is achieved and progression is 
documented.
Diagnosis an d Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:   CLL Subjects w ith Relapsed or Refractory to 
B-cell Receptor Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Therapy.

Survival Assessment(s)
Survival information will be collected up to 5 years after the last subject has been enrolled.
Richter 's Transform ation and Second Primary Malignancies Assessment
Richter 's transformation and second primary malignancies information will be collected up to 5 years 
after the last subject has been enrolled.
Extended Access:  For subjects continu inginto the Extended Access period of the trial, AbbVie w ill 
provide venetoclax until 5 years from the date of last subject enrolled, until dis ease pro gression , or until 
a subject chooses to receive commercial supply of VENCLEXTA .
Investigational Product: Venetoclax
Dose s: Single daily doses QD starting with 20 mg; dose increment s will 
proceed w eekly →50 mg → 100 mg →200 mg →400 mg as tolerated .  
Expansion Cohort subjects with bulky disease who are non -responders 
at the Week 12 Disease Assessment may be permitted to escalate 
venetoclax to 600mg dose.
Mode of Adm inistration: Oral
Duration of Treatm ent:  Subjects may continue receiving study drug for up to 5 years from the date of 
the last subject enrolled provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease 
progression, and do not meet any of the criteria for subject discontinuation.  The anticipated median 
treatment duration is ≥ 24 months.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Response will be assessed by the investigator, based on laboratory results, physical examinations, 
CT/MRI scans and bone marrow  examinations, using the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for 
Tumor Response.  An Independent Review Committee (IRC) w ill eval uate disease progression and 
response based on overall response rate, duration of response, time to progression and progression free 
survival. Subject treatment management will be based on review by the local investigator and/or site 
staff.
All measurable disease must be documented at screening by physical examination, laboratory testing, 
and PET/CT scan (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated).
During the study, subjects will be assessed at each visit by a physical examination and laboratory testing.  
Clinical Disease Assessments will take place at Screening (baseline), on Week 5 Day 1 (or Day 1 of 
initiation of 400 mg of venetoclax) Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, Week 36 and then every 
12weeks thereafter until disease progression, death, discontin uation from the study or study completion.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Radiographic scans will be performed in addition as described below :
For subjects enrolled under Arm A and Arm B, a CT/MRI scan must be performed at Screening, 
Week 8, Week 24 and every 12 w eeks thereafter for a period of 1 year from enrollment and at the 
subject 's Final Visit –CT scan is not needed for subjects continuing in the Extended Access period of the 
trial.  For subjects enrolled under the Ex pansion Cohort, a CT/MRI scan must be performed at 
Screening, Week 12, Week 36 and at the subject 's Final Visit – CT scan is not needed for subjects 
continuing in the Extended Access period of the trial.  If a subject has study drug interrupted for more 
than 3 days (i.e., adverse event), the site must contact the AbbVie study team or AbbVie medical 
monitor to adjust the subject' s visit schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case by case basis. Subjects 
should have the same method of imaging performed thro ughout the study for consistency.  For 
determination of CR, both the CT/MRI and bone marrow  are required to be free of disease.  If a subject 
exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, 
spleen o r lymph nodes on physical exam and or changes in the peripheral blood count), a CT/MRI scan 
and/or bone marrow must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD.
Confirmation of CR by Bone Marrow  Examination will be performed as described below: 
Once CR is determined by clinical and radiographic criteria, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is 
performed for confirmation.  If the marrow  is hypocellular, a repeat examination should be performed 
after 4 w eeks, or once the peripheral blood counts have recovered.  
Exploratory MRD will be performed as described below :
A peripheral blood specimen will be collected at Screening from all subjects to determine individual 
disease characteristics, and follow  up samples will be collected at Week 24 and after a confirmed 
CR/CRi/PR for analysis of MRD levels.  MRD will be assessed using recommended methodologies 
(flow  cytometry, PCR and/or sequencing).  MRD negativity w ill be defined as the presence of less than 
one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (or below  10–4) in either peripheral blood and/or bone marrow .
Pharm acokinetic:
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for venetoclax at designated time points throughout the study.  
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the apparent clearance (CL/F) a nd the apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F), may be determined using a population PK approach.  Additional 
parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Exploratory Biom arkers:
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and respo nse may be evaluated in this study with the goal of 
defining the relationship between various disease markers and disease status that may predict the 
subject 's response to therapy.  Assays to determine Bcl -2 gene amplifications and translocations, 
modifica tions of TP53 and NOTCH 1 and genomic profile for mutations before and after treatment may 
be performed.  In addition, mutational analysis of genes that may be associated w ith resistance and 
response to ibrutinib and B -cell receptor targeted agents includi ng but not limited to mutations of BTK 
(C481S), PLC gamma and other genes linked to B -cell receptor activation may also be evaluated.  If 
necessary, aliquots from PK samples will be utilized for pharmacodynamics analyses.  Exploratory 
research analyses may not be included in the clinical study report.
Pharm acogenetic:
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the subject 's response to venetoclax.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Safety:
Adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, 12 -lead ECG, and laboratory assessments 
will be evaluated.  Guidelines for the management for TLS are provided.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The follow ing efficacy endpoints will be analyzed:  Overall Response Rate (ORR), Duration of 
Response (DOR), Time to Progression (TTP), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) 
and Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity rate.
Overall Response Rate
The proportion of subjects w ith overall response (per the investigator a ssessment) will be calculated for 
all subjects based on IWCLL NCI -CWG criteria.  In addition, a ninety -five percent (95%) confidence 
interval based on binomial distribution will be constructed for the calculated ORR.
Duration of Response
Duration of respon se will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response per 
investigator assessment to the earliest recurrence or PD per investigator assessment.  If a subject is still 
responding then the subject 's data w ill be censored at the date of the subject 's last available clinical 
disease assessment.  For subjects who never experienced response, the subject' s data will be censored on 
the date of enrollment.  Duration of response will be analyzed by Kaplan -Meier methodology using data 
for all enroll ed subjects.  Median duration of response will be calculated and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval will be presented.
Time to Progression
Time to progression will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose (date of enrollment 
if not dosed) to the date of earliest disease progression (per the investigator assessment).  All disease 
progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject w as taking study 
drug or had previously discontinued study drug.  If the subject does not experience disease progression, 
then the data will be censored at the date of the last available disease assessment.  TTP will be analyzed 
by Kaplan -Meier methodology using data for all enrolled subjects.  Median time TTP will be calc ulated 
and 95% confidence interval for median time TTP w ill be presented.
Progression -Free Survival
Progression -Free Survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of 
earliest disease progression (per the investigato r assessment) or death.  All disease progression will be 
included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject w as taking study drug or had 
previously discontinued study drug.  If the subject does not experience disease progression or death, the n 
the data will be censored at the date of the last disease assessment.  PFS will be analyzed by Kaplan 
Meier methodology using data for all dosed subjects.  Median PFS time will be calculated and 95% 
confidence interval for median PFS time will be present ed.
Overall Survival
Overall survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of death for 
all dosed subjects.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be censored at the date of last study visit 
or the last known date to be alive, whichever is later.  OS will be analyzed by Kaplan -Meier 
methodology using data from all dosed subjects.  Median time survival will be calculated and 95% 
confidence interval for the median time survival will be presented.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Additional Exploratory Efficacy Analyses
Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Status
MRD negativity will be defined as less than one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (or below  10–4) on 
peripheral blo od and/or bone marrow  based flow  cytometry and/or nucleic acid based methods.  Rate of 
MRD status will be defined as the proportion of subjects who have MRD negativity status.  
Ninety -five percent (95%) confidence intervals based on the binomial distributi on will be provided.
Time to Next Anti -CLL Treatment
Time to next anti -CLL treatment will be defined as the number of days from the date of the first dose of 
venetoclax to the date of first dose of new non -protocol anti -leukemia therapy (NPT) or death from any 
cause.  For subjects who did not take NPT, the data w ill be censored at the last known date to be free of 
NPT.  TTNT w ill be analyzed by Kaplan -Meier methodology using data for all dosed subjects.  Median 
TTNT time will be calculated.
Pharm acokinetic/Pharmacodynamic:
An analysis may be performed using a nonlinear mixed -effect population modeling approach with 
NONMEM software to describe the disposition of venetoclax, to identify significant covariates and 
explore relationship betw een ph armacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by combining data from this 
study with other venetoclax clinical studies.  Additional analyses may be performed if useful in the 
interpretation of the data.
Health Econom ic and Patient Reported Outcom e (PRO) Measures
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ 
CLL16, the EQ -5D-5L utility score, and the EQ- 5D-VAS score, including mean change from baseline to 
the visits identified in Table 5 (Week 1 Day 1, Week 24 Day 1, ever y 12 w eeks starting with Week 24 
and Final Visit).  Only the EORTC QLQ C30 w ill be utilized in the Expansion Cohort.
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study who took at least one dose 
of study drug.  For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory 
test results and vital signs will be explored for trends and summarized.

3.0 Introduction
Bcl-2 Family Proteins
The Bcl- 2 famil y proteins are important regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.  
The Bcl- 2 oncogene was first identified in follicular lymphoma where the t(14;18) 
chromosomal translocation results in significant over -expression of the protein in B -cells.  
The Bcl- 2 famil y of genes encodes a family of closely related proteins that possess either 
pro-apoptotic or anti -apoptotic activity  and share u p to four Bcl -2 Homology  (BH) 
domains.1-4  Many  hematologic malignancies are highl y dependent upon the anti -apoptotic 
protein Bcl -2 for survival.  Over -expression of Bcl -2 is associated with tumor initiat ion, 
disease progression, and drug resistance, and is thus a compelling target for anti -tumor 
therap y.  Bcl -2 is overexpressed in acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic ly mphocy tic 
leukemia (CLL) is a genetic disease where the microRNAs miR15a and miR16- 1 that 
negativel y regulate the transcription of Bcl -2 are deleted or down regulated, resulting in 
uncontrolled expression of Bcl -2.5,6
Venetoclax in vitro/in vivo Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Pro file
Venetoclax is a potent, selective and orall y bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Bcl -2 
that binds with > 1,000 -fold higher affinit y for Bcl -2 (K i< 0.010 nM) than for Bcl -XL
(Ki–48 nm) or Mcl -1 (K i> 444 nM).7
In vitro, venetoclax demonstrated broad cell killing activity  against a panel of ly mphoma 
and leukem ia cells including B -cell follicular ly mphomas (FLs), mantle cell ly mphomas 
(MCL s), diffuse large B -cell ly mphomas (DLBCLs), and acute my eloid leukemias 
(AML s).  Venetoclax was especiall y potent against cell lines expressing high levels of 
Bcl-2.  Leukemia and l ymphoma cell lines bearing the t(14;18) translocation were 
significantl y more sensitive to venetoclax than non -mutated cell lines.
Venetoclax inhibited subcutaneous murine xenograft growth of human tumor cell lines 
derived from acute l ymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Non- Hodgkin 's Lymphoma 
(NHL).  The drug was also active in a model of disseminated ALL. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
21
The pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax was evaluated in multiple animal species.  In 
mouse, rat, monkey  and dog, the venetoclax pharmacokinetic pr ofile was characterized b y 
low plasma clearance and low volumes of distribution.  Half -lives ranged from 2.2 hours 
in monkey  to 12 hours in dog.  Food had a marked effect on the oral bioavailability  in 
dog.
Venetoclax has high protein binding to human, rat , dog, and monkey  plasma proteins 
(>99.9%).  In rats, venetoclax was widely distributed into liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, 
lungs, small intestine, and white fat, but was poorly distributed in testes, brain, muscle, 
and bone.  Metabolism was the major route of elimination with biliary  excretion of the 
parent drug play ing the secondary  role in rats.  Venetoclax showed moderate metabolic 
stability  in in vitro hepatic sy stems across species tested, except for low to moderate 
stability  in dog hepatocy tes.
Vene toclax is a CYP3A4 substrate and both venetoclax and its major human metabolite, 
M27, are predominatel y metabolized by  CYP3A4 in vitro.  Therefore, CYP3A4 inhibitors 
or inducers are expected to cause changes in venetoclax and M27 exposures.  At the 
400mg QD dose, venetoclax and M27 are not predicted to be perpetrators of the major 
CYP or UGT enzy mes, and venetoclax is predicted to weakl y inhibit UGT1A1.  
Venetoclax and M27 are predicted to cause clinical interaction via inhibition with drugs 
that are subst rates of P -gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran) and BCRP (e.g., rosuvastatin).  
Venetoclax is predicted to inhibit OATP1B1 and cause weak interaction with drugs that 
are substrates of this transporter (e.g., statins).
Venetoclax exhibited potent activity against patient- derived CLL cells treated ex vivo, 
killing these cells with an average concentration required for 50% effect (EC 50) of 
0.006 µM (n = 35; note that not all subject samples are from venetoclax trials).  
Venetoclax was equally  potent against the subs et of CLL samples bearing the high- risk 
17p deletion, with an average EC 50of 0.008 µM (n = 5), indicating that venetoclax may 
have a significant utility  in treating subjects with this high -risk disease.

Venetoclax Preclinical Toxicology
The nonclinical to xicology  of venetoclax has been evaluated in repeated -dose studies in 
mice and dogs with up to 4 weeks of once dail y oral dosing (and with 4- week recovery  
periods) and in dogs with 2 weeks of dosing (18 -week recovery  period); safety  
pharmacology  studies (c ardiovascular, neurofunctional, and pulmonary ); and in genetic 
toxicity  tests (Ames and in vitro chromosome aberrations assay s).  The primary toxicities 
associated with venetoclax administration included effects on the hematologic system 
(lymphocy tes and r ed blood cell parameters) in mice and dogs and on the male dog 
reproductive s ystem.  There was no evidence of genotoxicity  of venetoclax.  A severely  
toxic dose (STD10) was not identified in mice up to and including the top dose of 
600mg/kg/day  (overall m ean AUC 0-24= 91.5 µg•hr/mL  and C max= 7.2 µg/mL).  In dogs, 
the highest non- severel y toxic dose (HNSTD) was 150 mg/kg/day , but due to overlapping 
exposures between the mid and high doses, the HNSTD was defined as the mid dose of 
50mg/kg/day  (overall mean AUC 0-24= 472 µg•hr/mL  and C max= 27.4 µg/mL ).
Venetoclax causes decreases in circulating l ymphocy tes and l ymphocy tes in ly mphoid 
tissue.  After 4 weeks of dosing, the l ymphocy te effects were reversible or partially  
reversible in the mouse but generall y were less reversible in the dog at the end of a 
4-week recovery  period.  However, in a 2 -week dog study  focused on l ymphocy te 
recovery  over an extended (18 -week) period, reversibility  of lymphocy te effects were 
demonstrated.  Immunophenoty ping was used to a ssess changes in peripheral blood 
lymphocy te subsets (i.e., mature T cells, helper T cells, cy totoxic T cells, and mature 
Bcells).  At the end of the 18
-week recovery period, both total and ly mphocy te subset 
counts returned to within range of baseline and control values, and all effects on ly mphoid 
tissue reversed.  The venetoclax -related decreases in ly mphocy tes in blood and ly mphoid 
tissues are considered pharmacologically  mediated and non -adverse.8
Additional hematological effects of venetoclax treatment included reversible decreases in 
red blood cell parameters (primarily , hematocrit and hemoglobin co ncentration) in mice 
and dogs. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
23
The decreases in red cell parameters were adverse only at the high dose levels in the 
4-week studies (i.e., at 600 mg/kg/day  in mice and at 150 mg/kg/day  in dogs, but all red 
cell parameters were reversible at the end of a 4- week recovery  period.
Effects on both l ymphocy tes and red cell mass are readil y monitored in subjects.
Male dog reproductive effects consisted of markedly  reduced numbers of spermatogonia 
in the testes at all venetoclax dose levels after 4 weeks of dosing, with progression to 
severe decreases in the numbers of all germ cells in testes during the 4 -week recovery  
period.  Male mice did not have testicular changes associated with venetoclax 
administration.  The translatability  of the testicular findings in dogs to humans is 
unknown, but this change may  be related to venetoclax pharmacology , as one or more 
members of the Bcl -2 family  of proteins play  a role in spermatogenesis.9-11  In view of the 
potential treatment benefits of venetoclax, this finding is anticipated not to impact the 
treatment of subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies.
Dogs at the high dose of 150 mg/kg/day  in the 4 -week study had clinical signs of itching 
and swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and forepaws and/or hindpaws.  
Most of the animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected.  The clinical signs were mi ld to 
moderate in severity , transient and sporadic in occurrence, and were absent during the 
recovery  period.  The swelling reactions were observed after the first dose in 3 dogs, and 
therefore not consistent with drug -induced immediate (IgE -mediated, Ty peI) 
hypersensitivity ; however, other immune -mediated mechanisms could be involved.  
Although the basis for the swelling reactions was not established, there were no signs of 
anaph ylaxis.  Any  occurrences of swelling reactions in patients can be monitored a nd 
treated.
In an ongoing 9 -month chronic toxicity  study  of dogs with venetoclax, hy popigmented 
(white) facial hair was observed after approximately 3 months of dosing (ongoing stud y 
AbbVie R&D/12/384).  The finding was limited to the mid and high doses (6 and 
20mg/kg/day ), and was observed in both males and females.  Evidence from Bcl -2 
knockout mouse (bcl -2-/-) studies indicates that hair hy popigmentation is consistent with

M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6

the pharmacological effect of Bcl -2 functional loss, and occurs due to loss of ha ir follicle 
melanocy tes dependent on Bcl -2 for survival.12  A dedicated ph ysical examination of the 
skin and extensive ophthalmic examinations determined that pigmentation of the skin and 
in the ey e (particularl y in the iris and fundus) appears unaffected.  The potential for 
development of white (hypopigmented) hair in humans is unknown.
In an anesthetize d dog cardiovascular model given intravenous doses of venetoclax, mild 
reductions in my ocardial contractility  (maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure 
[dP/dt max]:  –6% to – 13%) and cardiac output ( –11% to –19%) were observed at plasma 
concentrations of ≥ 16 µg/mL and ≥ 32 µg/mL , respectively .  However, no effects on 
blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were observed relative 
to baseline or controls in either the anesthetized dog stud y or in the conscious dog 
cardiovasc ular stud y using telemeterized animals at maximum drug concentrations of 
46µg/mL  and 16 µg/mL, respectivel y.
Venetoclax was tested in a battery  of safet y pharmacology  assay s and produced no effects 
in central nervous sy stem/neurobehavioral, or respiratory studies in mice at oral doses up 
to 600 mg/kg.  In dogs, mild reductions in cardiac contractility  and cardiac output were 
observed at plasma concentrations of ≥ 16 µg/mL.  However, no effects on blood 
pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) param eters were observed in dogs at a 
maximum drug concentration of 46 µg/mL.
On the basis of nonclinical safet y pharmacology and toxicology evaluations of 
venetoclax, and on the basis of nonclinical and human studies of related antiapoptotic 
Bcl-2 family  prote in inhibitors, potential mechanism -based toxicities may  include 
lymphopenia and neutropenia,13signs of tumor ly sis, reduction in red cell mass, decreased 
spermatogenesis, skin swelling, and hair h ypopigmentation.  Thrombocy topenia has not 
been observed in toxicology  studies in mice and dogs.  These findings are consistent with 
venetoclax as a Bcl -2 speci fic (Bcl -
XLsparing) inhibitor.  Consequently , 
thrombocy topenia is not expected to be a dose limiting toxicity  (DLT) clinically .

Venetoclax is a CYP3A4 substrate and both venetoclax and its major human metabolite, 
M27, are predominatel y metabolized by  CYP3 A4 in vitro.  Therefore, CYP3A4 inhibitors 
or inducers are expected to cause changes in venetoclax and M27 exposures.

Venetoclax Clinical Data
As of 28 November 2015, based on the available data in the AbbV ie and 
Genentech/Roche clinical databases, a total of 1662 subjects have been exposed to at least 
1 dose of venetoclax in the oncology  and immunology  development programs.  A total of 
1498 oncology  subjects had data available in AbbVie and Genentech/Roche studies as of 
28 November 2015.  Of these 1498, 935 subjects had CLL/small l ymphocy tic leukemia 
(SLL), 346 subjects had NHL, 115 subjects had MM, and 102 had AML.  An additional 
66subjects were health y volunteers.  A total of 564 oncology  subjects receive d the drug 
as monotherap y, 933 received the drug in combination with other therapies, and 1 subject 
received venetoclax as a single dose in a DDI study who did not re -enroll into a 
subsequent monotherap y clinical study .  As of 28 November 2015, an additional 
98subjects were exposed to at least 1 dose of venetoclax in the AbbVie immunology  
study , Study  M13 -093, 
Venetoclax doses in clinical studies have ranged from 20 mg to 1200 mg.  Multiple 
ongoing Phase 1/2 AbbVie and Phase 1/2/3 Genentech/Roche clinical studies are 
evaluating safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics, and efficacy  of venetoclax as 
monotherap y or in combination with other therapies (rituximab [R], obinutuzumab 
(GA101) [G], rituximab or obinutuzumab plus CHOP [cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, and prednisone; R -CHOP or G -CHOP, respectivel y], BR, bendamustine plus 
obinutuzumab [BG], bortezomib plus dexamethasone, azacitidine or decitabine, and 
cytarabine) in subjects with hematologic malignancies.  Additionally , two Phase 3 studies 
are ongoing:  one stud y in relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL exploring the combination of 
venetoclax and rituximab against BR and one Phase 3 study  in first -line CLL exploring  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
26
the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab against obinutuzumab plus 
chlorambucil.
Based on the mechanism of action, nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the 
safet y profile of ven etoclax is well described.  The most common adverse drug reactions 
across all indications are nausea, diarrhea, hematological effects, and serious and/or 
opportunistic infections.  The important risks identified with venetoclax administration 
based on nonc linical and clinical data are tumor l ysis sy ndrome (T LS) and neutropenia, 
particularl y in the CLL indication.  Infection is a potential risk.  Other adverse events 
commonly  observed with venetoclax include nausea, diarrhea, and other hematological 
effects (including, anemia, thrombocy topenia, and ly mphopenia).  In addition, as 
venetoclax is being evaluated in subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease who had 
previously been treated with various cy totoxic agents, second primary  malignancies are 
closely being monitored.
Tumor ly sis sy ndrome (TLS) is an important risk, particularl y in subjects with R/R CLL.  
As a result of on -target effects, the potential for TLS with venetoclax was identified early  
in the program when the initial 3 subjects with CLL/SLL received starting doses of 
100mg or 200 mg and experienced TLS, which was reported as an adverse event for 
each.  Subsequently , 2 fatal events in the setting of TL S and another event of clinical TL S 
in subjects with CLL /SLL occurred in December 2012.  Aft er comprehensive review of 
all safet y data available from studies with venetoclax, a revised dosing regimen with a 
ramp -up period of 5 weeks and enhanced TLS prophy laxis and monitoring measures were 
implemented in all CLL studies.  A subsequent analy sis of data from subjects with 
CLL/SLL following the implementation of proph ylaxis measures, who completed 
monotherap y indicated a marked reduction in severity and frequency of TLS when 
compared to the previous anal ysis.  None of the subjects experienced an y ser ious 
(including fatal) or nonserious event of clinical TLS (CTL S) or laboratory  TLS (LTLS) or 
had study  treatment discontinued because of TLS.  Overall, the clinical data strongl y 
support that the risk of TLS with venetoclax in CLL/SLL subjects is highest when

initiating venetoclax dosing, especially with a higher initial dose of venetoclax, as well as 
being greater in subjects with a large tumor burden.
Additional safet y and efficacy data are described in detail in the I nvestigator Brochure.14
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia is a ly mphoproliferative disorder, characterized b y 
progressive accumulation of monoclonal, small, mature -appearing CD5+B cells in 
peripheral blood, bone marrow, and secondary l ymphoid organs.  It is the most common 
form of leukemia in adults in the Western World, accounting for approximately 30% of all 
leukemias.15  Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia primarily  affects elderl y individuals; 
however, approximat ely one third of patients are less than 60 y ears of age at diagnosis.16  
It is currently estimated tha t annuall y approximately 15,000 people will be diagnosed with 
CLL in the United States, and that almost 4,500 individuals will die of the disease.17  In 
Europe, CLL accounts for approximately  30% of all leukemias in adults with a reported 
age standardized incidence rate of 3.79 per 100,000 individuals (for CLL/SLL) in the 
years 2000 –2002.15,18  The approximate 5- year survival rate for patients with CLL is 
73%.19  
CLL presents with a variable clinical course.  Approximately one -third of patients 
have indolent disease with prolonged median survival that does not require treatment, and 
die of causes unrelated to disease.  Another third have an initial indolent phase that is 
followed b y rapid progression of the disease requiring therap y.  The remaining third have 
aggressive disease and require treatment at the time of diagnosis.  Chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia patients will often have compromised bone marrow reserve due to their 
underly ing disease.  The principal complication of CLL is immunodeficiency  related to 
myelosuppression and as a result, infection is the major cause of death in patients with 
CLL.20
Standard chemotherapeutic options for CLL cause significant immune suppression and 
myelosuppression, are not well -tolerated b y the elderly population and have not 
consistently  offered survival advantage.  Treatment decisions for patients with CLL are 
made on the basis of considerations such as age, clinical stage, expected survival, and  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
28
anticipated toxicities.  With the notable exception of allogeneic stem cell transpl antation, 
CLL is currentl y an incurable disease, despite good initial responses to chemo 
immunotherapy .  Nonetheless, globally  access to allogeneic stem cell transplant and/or 
clinical trials is limited, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to h ave increased 
toxicity  and reduced antitumor activity .
Study Rationale
During recent years, evidence accumulated suggesting that signaling via the BCR could 
have an important role in the development of CLL and that it could determine the clinical 
heterogeneity  of the disease.  The advent of new therapies that target the signalosome 
brings new evidence in favor of this view.  Clinical trials with drugs that inhibit SYK 
kinase (Fostamatimib), reversible pan -Src kinase (Dasatinib), the BTK inhibitor A VL 292 
and PI 3Kinase inhibitor SF1126 and others, are underway .  Ibrutinib (IMBURVI CA) and 
idelalisib (Zy delig) are currentl y approved for relapsed CLL patients.  These drugs cause 
rapid response with reduction in lymph node size and splenic mass accompani ed by 
increased PB l ymphocy tosis likely  reflecting that microenvironment modulation could 
prevent these cells from receiving the survival signals delivered b y the 
microenvironment.21  However, in earl y trials of Ibrutinib, approximately  10% of the 
patients developed progressive disease.  Few of these patients developed resistance after 
achieving partial r esponse lasting ≥ 6 months.  Distinct single nucleotide variations were 
noted in these patients.22
The mechanism of action of venetoclax is independent of the BCR pathway.23  Briefly, 
venetoclax inhibits Bcl -2 allowing the release of BIM, which includes oligomerization of 
pro-apoptotic molecules such as BAK and BAX which triggers rapid apoptosis.  The 
clinical data to date with venetoclax monotherap y shows strong activity  in refractory  CLL 
indicating tha t it might be beneficial in a population that is refractory  to these newer 
therapeutic agents.

3.1 Differences Statement
This is a Phase 2 study  of venetoclax monotherap y for patients who have progressed or 
developed recurrence after treatment with BCR signali ng kinase inhibitors.  Safety  data 
and preliminary  efficacy  responses in the CLL population from the Phase 1 trial support 
this Phase 2 trial.  All subjects will be evaluated for histologic transformation (HT) to 
high grade l ymphoma at screening with a pos itron emission tomography using 
18F-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) and subsequent biopsy  of PET avid areas to exclude 
subjects with histological and immunophenoty pical confirmation of HT.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
The preliminary  clinical data of venetoclax monotherap yin subjects with CLL/SLL, MCL  
and NHL have shown a favorable benefit to risk ratio drug during Stud y M12-175.  In 
Arm A (CLL and SLL) 47 of 52 (90%) evaluable subjects achieved a best response of CR.  
CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery  (CRi), or part ial response (PR):  12 (21%) 
subjects experienced CR/CRi and 35 (63%) subjects experienced PR of which 30 were 
confirmed.
Additional safet y and efficacy data can be found in the current Investigator Brochure.
The encouraging preliminary  data from the ongoi ng venetoclax studies in R/R CLL 
indicate that venetoclax may be beneficial in subjects with relapsed CLL after multiple 
treatment regimens.
Refer to Appendix Gfor COVID- 19 (coronavirus disease 2019) -related processes.
4.0 Study  Objectives
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of venetoclax
monotherap y in subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) relapsed after or 
refractory  to treatment with B -cell Receptor Signaling Pathway  Inhibitors (specificall y 
Ibrutinib or Idelalisib).  Efficacy  will be measured by  overall response rate (ORR). 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6

The secondary  objectives are to evaluate the duration of response, time to progression 
(TTP ), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Additional exploratory  objectives will be evaluated.  Time to next anti -CLL treatment 
(TNT) and minimal residual disease (MRD) will be assessed in the peripheral blood and 
bone marrow (BM) b y flow cy tometry  and PCR.  Health Economic and Patient -Reported 
Outcome Measures will include the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 
(ameasure of health- related quality  of life specific to CLL) and the EQ 5D 5L  (measure 
of general health status) including EQ -5D- VAS.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is an open -label, non -randomized, two arm, multicenter study  to determine the 
efficacy  and safet y of venetoclax (GDC -0199) monotherap y in subjects with Chronic 
Lym phocy tic Leukemi a (CLL) relapsed/refractory to treatment with B -cell Receptor 
Signaling Pathway  Inhibitors (specifically  Ibrutinib and Idelalisib) sponsored by  AbbVie 
in collaboration with Genentech/Roche.
This study  is designed to enroll approximately  120 subjects who ha ve CLL that is 
refractory  to treatment with ibrutinib and/or idelalisib, has relapsed on treatment or 
experienced progression after discontinuation of either one of these agents.
Two arms and an expansion cohort will be implemented to enroll as follows:  
●Arm A with approximately 40 subjects that have ibrutinib -resistant with 
relapsed or refractory  CLL.
●Arm B with approximately  20 subjects that have idelalisib -resistant with 
relapsed or refractory  CLL.
●Expansion Cohort with approximately  60 subjects that ha ve either 
ibrutinib- resistant or idelalisib -resistant with relapsed or refractory  CLL.  
Subjects who have received both agents and an y additional interim therapy   
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6

will be enrolled into the corresponding arm based on their most recent 
treatment.
Subjects in this study  will be enrolled at approximately  15 research sites.
The study  was designed to enroll approximately  120 subjects to meet scientific and 
regulatory  objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with 
ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there 
is a possibility  that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
Dosing Schedule Overview (All Subjects)
Venetoclax will be administered orall y once dail y (QD), continuousl y.  Each dose of 
venetoclax should be taken with approximately  240 mL  of water within 30 minutes after 
the completion of breakfast or the subject 's first meal of the day .  To mitigate the risk for 
TLS, a lead -in period of 5 weeks will be employ ed with step wise dose increments.  For 
tumor ly sis sy ndrome prophy laxis, all subjects will be classified into 3 risk categories 
based on the risk for developing TLS prior to venetoclax administration.
Subjects in low risk category  and medium risk category  with CrCl ≥80 ml/min and low 
tumor burden will begin the lead -in period in the outpatient setting with an initial dose of 
20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day  1.  If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or 
lab TL S occur within 24 hours, the same dose will be con tinued until Day  7 in the 
outpatient setting.  Subjects with no laboratory abnormalities suggestive of L TLS will 
escalate to a dose of 50 mg venetoclax on Week 2 Day  1 in the outpatient setting.
Medium risk subjects with CrCl < 80 mL /min and/or higher tumor burden (i.e., AL C 
>100 × 109/L or multiple bulky  nodes) may  be admitted to the hospital at the investigator 
discretion to begin the lead- in period with an initial dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 
Day 1.  If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or lab TLS occur within 24 hours, 
the same dose will be continued until Day 7 in the outpatient setting.  Subjects with no 
laboratory  abnormalities suggestive of LTL S will escalate to a dose of 50 mg venetoclax
on Week 2 Day  1 in the outpatient setting.   
Subjects may  be hospitalized prior to the

firstdose of 50 mg if they continue to have Cr Cl < 80 mL /min and/or higher tumor 
burden (i.e., AL C > 100 × 109/L or multiple bulky nodes) at the investigator 's discretion.
All high risk subjects will be admitted to the hospital and begin the lead -in period with an 
initial dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day  1.  If no significant findings suggestive 
of clinical or lab TLS occur within 24 hours, the same dose will be continued until Day 7 
in the outpatie nt setting.  Subjects will be hospitalized prior to the first dose increment to 
50mg beginning on W2D1.  Each subject 's risk status may  be reassessed prior to 
subsequent dose escalations per the guidelines in Section 6.1.7.1 , Prophy laxis and 
Management of Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome.
If no significant findings occur within 24 hours at dose escalation, the study drug will be 
continued at the same dose from Days 2 through 7 in the outpatient setting.  If there is 
indication of lab or clinical TL S, the study  drug dose will be held until resolution of all 
findings.  TLS management will be implemented as appropriate.  If aggressive correction 
of electrol ytes was performed, the next dose of venetoclax can only be given when 
electrol ytes have been stable without an y further treatment for at least 24 hours.
A lower starting dose to the lead- in regimen may  be implemented for individual subject(s) 
at particularl y high risk for TL S.  For these individual cases, a discussion must occur 
between the investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor.

Dosing Schedule Details
Lead -In Period (All Subjects)
Every  subject will receive an initial dose of 20 mg on Week 1, Day  1 of the lead -in 
period.
If one or more electrol yte changes (from the 0 hour pre -dose value) suggestive of TL S 
occurs within 24 hours of the 20 mg dose, no additional venetoclax doses will be 
administere d until resolution.  See Appendix D, Recommendations for Initial 
Management of Electrol yte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
(TLS), for procedures to follow.  If aggressive correction of electrol ytes was performed, 
the subsequent dose of venetoclax can onl y be given when electrol ytes have been stable 
without any  further treatment for at least 24 hour.   Upon resolution of laboratory
abnormalities, the subject will remain on the 20 mg dose through Week 1 (e.g., Week 1 
Day 2 –Week 1 Day  7).
Subjects who had drug interruptions may  escalate to 50 mg after they  have been on a 
20mg dose for 7 day s.
After a week at 50 mg, weekl y dose incr ements will be implemented as follows:  
100mg→200 mg →400 mg (or additional lead -in steps to designated 400 mg dose) as 
tolerated.

Expansio n Cohort:  Modified Dose Ramp -Up for Select High Risk Subjects Only 
For subjects in the Expansion Cohort, a modified lead in period may  be implemented if a 
high risk subject has clinical signs of progression during the screening period, to allow 
dose esca lation to 400 mg by  Week 3 Day  1.  A discussion between the investigator and 
the AbbVie medical monitor must occur prior to approval of this modified lead -in period.  
These subjects will be admitted to the hospital and begin the lead- in period with an initial 
dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day  1.  If no significant findings suggestive of 
clinical or lab TLS occur within 24 hours, the dose will be increased to 50 mg on Week 1 
Day 2.  If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or lab TLS occur with in 24 hours 
the same dose will be administered for two days prior to the next dose increment.  The 
dose of venetoclax will be further increased to 100 mg on Week 1 Day  4 and will be 
continued through Week 1 Day  7.  If there are no significant findings sugg estive of 
clinical or lab TLS that occur within 24 hours at this dose level, then the venetoclax dose 
will be increased to 200 mg on Week 2 Day  1.  Subjects will remain in the hospital for at 
least 24 hours after reaching the 200 mg dose.  If no significan t findings suggestive of 
clinical or lab TLS occur within 24 hours, then the subject will continue at the 200 mg 
dose through Week 2 Day 7.  Subjects will be hospitalized the night before venetoclax 
dose is to be increased to 400 mg on Week 3 Day  1 and rem ain in the hospital at least till 
the post dose 24 hours lab results are reviewed b y the investigator and show no concerns 
for TL S related electrol yte changes. 
Subjects enrolled into the Expansion Cohort with bulky  disease at study  entry  who are 
non-respo nders or subjects who show signs of clinical progression after completing the 
ramp up to 400 mg either by  clinical disease Assessment or by  CT/MRI scan between 
Week 6 to Week 12 may  be permitted to escalate venetoclax to 600 mg dose.  A 
discussion between the investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor must occur prior to 
this dose escalation.
For all dose escalations, laboratory  values for subject management must be reviewed in 
real time b y the investigator and prior to the subject 's next dose to ensure appropriate 
subject management.  Based upon the laboratory values, the subject may continue dosing,  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

may need to hold dose until resolution, may  require hospitalization for further monitoring 
or may  need additional post -dose laboratory  checks.  (See Appendix D, Recommendations 
for Initial Management of Electrol yte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Ly sis 
Syndrome [TL S], for procedures to follow.)
Refer to Section 6.1.7.1, Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome, 
for additional details on TLS prophylaxis.
Option to Continue Venetocl ax Treatment

subject enrolled provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease 
progression, and do not meet an y of the criteria for subject discontinuation. 
(Section 5.4.1).   
Extended Access
AbbVie will provide ven etoclax for monotherap y use until 5 y ears from the date of the 
last subj ect enrolled, until dis ease progression , or until a subject chooses to receive 
commercial suppl y ofVENCL EXTA .
For subjects continuing into the Extended Access period of the trial, venetoclax will be 
dispense dat the Final Visit that will occur prior to 31Dec2018. Extended Access visits 
will continue every  12 weeks (+/ –7 day s)until disease progression or until a subject 
chooses to receive commercial suppl y of VENCLEXTA .  Extended Access visits will 
include s tudy drug administration ,collection of AEs/SAEs and concomitant medication 
information, hemoglobin , hematocrit , absolute neutrophil count ,absolute lymphocy te 
count, p latelet count s and white blood cell counts , disease progression ,and dispensing 
and coll ection of subject diaries.  All other procedures for disease assessments will be 
performed as standard of care.

5.2 Selection of Study  Population
Subjects must undergo screening procedures within 28 days prior to initial study drug 
administration including disease assessment with PET/CT and bone marrow aspirate.
Histologic transformation to high grade lymphoma needs to be excluded at screening with 
a positron emission tomograph y using 18F -fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG).  Subjects with 
(FDG) uptake on PET scan above maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 
10will be excluded, unless confirmed b y biops y of the suspicious area to rule out 
Richter 's transformation and other malignancies.  Additionally , subjects who have 
CD38+, ZAP 70+, TP 53 mutated and unmutated IGHV CLL whose PET has SUV max 
between 7 – 9 with at least one of the following parameters:  B s ymptoms, nodal diameter 
> 5 cm, and/or unexplained lactate deh ydrogenase (LDH) elevation will need biopsy of 
the suspicious site.  I f the biopsy  is not feasible due to an inaccessible lesion or if the 
subject has declined to undergo the biops y, the subject will be excluded from the study.  
Subjects with histological and immunophenoty pical confirmation of Richter 's 
transformation with a high grade l ymphoproliferat ive disease will be excluded from the 
study .24
Adult male and female subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and who do not meet an y

a. Subjects will undergo screening procedures withi n 28 days prior to the first study drug administration.
b. All protocol-related serious adverse events and nonserious adverse events must be collected from the signing of the study -specific informed consent until study drug 
administration.
c. A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at Screening and the 30 Day Follow -
Up Visit.  A symptom directed physical examination may be performed at every 
other visit.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Physical Examination, for more details.
d. Urine pregnancy test must be obtained at Week 1 Day 1, if it has been > 7 days since obtaining the serum pregnancy results at Screening.
e. There is no 72 hour window for t hese samples.  Refer to Section 6.1.7.1 , Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Recommendations for Initial 
Management of Electroly te Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS).
f. For subjects who discontinue venetoclax monotherapy but have not had an event of disease progression, post treatment follow -up visits will be performed every 3 months for 
a period of 3 years after the last subject has enrolled in the study until discontinuation from the study due to disease progression requiring al ternative therapy or upon a 
subject' s refusal of the Post -Treatment visits.
g. Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at scr eening at the discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent evaluation of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) will be 
made as clinically indicated for subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.
h. If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination without an 
increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria), a CT/MRI scan may be performed wit hin 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD as described in Section 5.3.3.2 .
i. All measurable disease must be documented at screening by laboratory test ing, physical examination, CT scans (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), and bone marrow 
examinations. For all subsequent disease assessments, only PE and laboratory testing is required unless confirmation of CR is required. If confirmation of CR is required a 
CT/MRI and Bone Marrow will also be completed.
j. Screening sample will assess individual disease characteristics and the Week 24 sample will measure disease burden.  MRD will be assessed in peripheral blood and bone 
marrow for subjects achieving CR/CRi at the 8 week confirmatory visit.  After Week 24, for subjects that achieve a radiographic PR, MRD will be asses sed in peripheral 
blood. MRD for these subjects (radiographic PR/CR/CRi) will continue to be assessed in the peripheral blood at 1 2 weeks interval visits until 2 consecutive negative MRD 
levels are reported.  A final MRD status will be assessed in bone marrow aspirate once MRD negativity is achieved in two cons ecutive peripheral blood samples.
k. The Health Economic and Patient Repor ted Outcomes questionnaires should be administered and completed prior to any other study procedures being performed at these
visits.  Refer to Section 5.3.8 , Health Economic and Patient -Reported Outcome Measures, for further information.  Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire 
assessing the information they were provided for the Patient Information Card and the Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patie nt Information Brochure, at the Week 2 Day 1 visit.

l. The Week 24 scan may be performed within 2 weeks before or after the Week 24 scheduled visit provided that it has b een at least 8 weeks since the subject 's last scan.  
CT/MRI scans should be performed at Week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter for a period of 1 year from enrollment.   Post-treatment CT or MRI scans are collected only if 
they are performed by the PI 's disc retion or as part of standard of care.  MRI should be performed if CT with contrast is contraindicated (refer to Section 5.3.1.1 ).
m. A CT/MRI scan will be performed after a response of CR/CRi is determined by clinical criteria (PE/labs) for confirmation.  For confirmation of CR, both the CT and/or MRI 
scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.  It is recommended that the CT scan is performed f irst, and if this does not confirm a CR, then a BM biopsy should not be 
obtained.
n. For subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi (with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around 1.5 –2 cm) may also have a bone marrow performed.  If bone marrow 
was performed to confirm a CR or for any clinical indication close to Week 24, then it should be performed within a week of th e Week 24 Day 1 CT/MRI scans.  Subjects 
who have MRD negativity confirmed in peripheral blood on 2 consecutive peripheral blood sam ples need to have a confirmation by bone marrow.
o. Survival information (i.e., the date/cause of death, post treatment cancer therapies, etc.) will be collected every 3 months for a period of 5 years after the last subject has 
enrolled into the study.
p. For subjects continuing into the Extended Access period of the trial, visits will include study drug administration ,AEs/SAEs and concomitant medication information, 
hemoglobin , hematocrit , absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, p latelet count s and white blood cell counts , disease progression and dispensing and collection 
of subject diaries .  All other procedures for disease assessments will be performed as standard of care.
q. Hematology will include hemoglobin, hematocrit, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, platelet counts and white blood counts for subjects continuing into 
the Extended Access period of the trial.
r. CT scan not needed for subjects continuing into the Extended Access period of the trial.

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
All study  procedures outlined in Table 4and Table 6are discussed in detail in this section, 
with the exception of adverse event info rmation (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study  data 
will be recorded on eCRFs with the exception of the pregnancy  reporting forms, which 
will be re corded on paper CRFs.
Procedures performed at Screening will serve as baseline, unless repeated on Week 1 
Day 1 prior to dosing; in which case the latter will serve as baseline.  The schedule of 
study  visit procedures is based on subject stud y drug adminis tration.  Scheduled study  
visits and/or procedures will need to be altered if there is an interruption in study drug 
administration.  I f stud y drug administration is interrupted for more than 3 days 
(i.e., adverse event), the site will contact the AbbVie s tudy team or AbbVie Medical 
Monitor to adjust the subject 's visit schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case b y case 
basis.
Subjects who signed informed consent, have had at least one study procedure conducted, 
and are determined to be a screen failure, will not proceed in stud y.  All of the data from 
the screening procedures will be collected into the EDC regardless of subjects 'enrollment 
into the study .
Refer to Appendix Gfor COVID- 19-related processes for this section.
Informed Consent
Signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject or the subject 's legally  
acceptable representative before an y stud y-specific procedures are undertaken or before 
any prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this 
study .  Informed consent is also required for pharmacogenetic (PG) sampling and a 
portion of the pharmacodynamic (PD) samp le collections.  Details about how informed 
consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.

Physical Examination
Acomplete physical examination , including height, will be performed at Screening and 
at the 30- Day Follow- Up Visit.  The complete PE should include an evaluation of head, 
eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, 
respiratory , gastrointestinal, and neurological sy stems.
Clinically  significant changes fro m baseline that are unrelated to disease will be 
documented in the source documentation and eCRFs as Adverse Events.
A symptom directed physical examination may be performed at all other visits (other 
than Screening and 30 Day  Follow -Up visit) and should be limited to sy stems of primary  
relevance- that is, cardiovascular, respiratory  and/or those associated with symptoms.
Physical Examination (Disease Assessment)
All Phy sical Examinations (complete or s ymptom -directed) should also include the 
evaluation of the presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes in two dimension 
(cervical, supraclavicular, axillary , inguinal and femoral nodes), hepatomegaly , and 
splenomegal y.  These should be noted on all examinations irrespective of being present or 
absent.  Refer to Section 5.3.3.1 for additional information pertaini ng to methods of 
measurement.
If during ph ysical examination, signs or sym ptoms suggestive of Richter 's Syndrome are 
observed, further assessments (i.e., nodes, biopsy, PET scan) should be considered to 
exclude or confirm the transformation.
All phy sical e xaminations may  be performed within 72 hours before or after the scheduled 
visit starting with Week 8 Day  1.

b. Creatinine clearance should be assessed using Cockcroft- Gault equation or a 24 -hour urine collection.
c. For samples analyzed locally, at room temperature, rasburicase causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in 
blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The 
following special sample handling proce dure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation.  Uric acid 
must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into pre -chilled tubes containing heparin anticoagulant.  
Immediately immerse plasma samples for uric acid measurement in an ice w ater bath .  Plasma samples must 
be prepared by centrifugation in a pre -cooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be maintained in an ice 
water bath and analyzed for uric acid within four hours of collection.
d. Prior to rasburicase administration per protocol, test to be performed per label.
e. Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) samples are to be collected and sent to the central laboratory for archiving

●Screening 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
77
●Final Visit
●As clinically  indicated
The ECG results will be used by  the investigator for subject safety  assessments, includin g 
adverse event determination and management and termination of subjects from the study .  
ECG results will be summarized as follows:
●normal ECG
●abnormal ECG –not clinically  significant
●abnormal ECG –clinically  significant
●unable to evaluate
Any ECG report that is both abnormal and clinically  significant will be faxed to the 
Oncology  Safet y Management Team via the contact information provided in Section 6.1.5
within 5 business day s of obtaining the results.  The QT interval measurement will be 
documented in the eCRF only  if a "prolonged QT "is observed.  Correction by  the 
Fridericia formula (QTcF) is preferred; however, correction b y othe r methods may  be 
acceptable based on discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor.  The original ECG 
tracing will be retained in the subject 's records at the study  site.
Assessment of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)
Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at screening b y either two -dimensional 
echocardiogram or a Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Subsequent evaluation of LVEF will be made as clinically indicated for 
subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.
Disease Assessments
For all subjects, clinical response will be assessed by the investigator based on anal ysis of 
clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  laboratory  values) and ph ysical examination.  I n 
addition, upon achieving a clinical respon se of (CR/CRi), a CT scan of involved anatomic 
regions (or MRI if CT is medically  contraindicated) and bone marrow aspirate and biops y  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

will be performed for confirmation.  Subjects will be evaluated against the 2008 Modified 
IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for Tumor Response including CT imaging (or MRI ).
Disease Assessment will be performed at the following visits:
Screening
Week 5 Day  1 (or Day  1 of initiation of 400 mg dose)
Week 8 Day  1
Week 12 Day  1
Week 16 Day  1
Week 24 Day  1
Week 36 Day 1 and every  12 weeks th ereafter (e.g., Weeks 48, 60, 72, etc.) until 
disease progression, death, discontinuation from the study or stud y completion.
Approximately  8 weeks after the CR /CRi criteria is first met (if applicable)
Final Visit
Post Treatment Follow -Up Visits
Response criteria definitions are outlined in Section 5.3.3.1 .
Note :  Disease assessments may  be performed 72 hours before or after, starting with 
Week 8 Day  1.
Radiographic Imaging
A PET and CT scan with contrast must be performed within 28 day s prior to study  drug 
administration for all subjects.  CT must be of diagnostic qualit y with contrast to serve as 
a baseline for future comparisons.  CT scans (with contrast) including neck, chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis will be performed to assess response to treat ment.  MRI  of the 
abdomen and pelvis with a non -contrast CT scan of the neck and chest may be used 
instead in subjects for whom CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., subjects with 
contrast allergy  and impaired renal clearance).  Subjects should h ave the same imaging 
modality  performed throughout the stud y for consistency and direct comparison.   
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
79
Interpretation of the PET -CT scans for all subjects including screen failures will be 
collected in the EDC.
When CR/CRi is determined by clinical criteria at any  time during the stud y, a CT/MRI  
scan must be performed for confirmation (refer to Table 10).  If the CT/MRI scan 
confirms a CR, then a BM biopsy is also required.  For confirmation of CR, both the 
CT/MRI  scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.   
When PR is determined by  clinical criteria b y changes in disease assessment they  must be 
confirmed b y a repeat clinical assessment at least 8 w eeks after the clinical criteria for 
response are first met. 
If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
denovo enlargement of liver, spleen or l ymph nodes on phy sical examination) without an 
increase in ly mphocytes meeting PD criteria, a CT/MRI  scan must be performed within 
2weeks to confirm or rule out PD, as described in Section 5.3.3.2 according to Modified 
IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for Tumor Response.
Clinical data and radiographic scans will be interpreted according to 2008 Modified 
IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for Tumor Response (refer to Table 10).  In addition to being 
reviewed b y the investigator and/or site staff, an independent review will be performed to 
assess tumor response and disease progression.  The independent review facility  will 
provide ins tructions regarding the preparation and shipment of the data.  Interpretations 
from the independent review will not be sent to the site.  Subject treatment management 
will be based on review by  the local investigator and/or site staff.  Local assessments w ill 
be used for endpoints.
If a subject has study  drug interrupted for more than 3 day s (i.e., adverse event), the site 
must contact the AbbVie study  team or AbbVie medical monitor to adjust the subject 's 
visit schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case by  case basis.  CT/MRI scans will be 
performed within 3 day s of the following visits:

prior to sending to AbbVie.
Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies for biomarker assessments should be split from this 
sample whene ver possible and when deemed feasible by  the investigator.  If the subject 
wishes to participate in the optional biomarker testing, a separate consent form will need 
to be signed.
The order of collections from the bone marrow aspirate and biops y should be 1) clinical 
assessment, 2) MRD assessment and, 3) biomarker assessment.
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Assessment
MRD28will be assessed in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow aspirate using a 
recommended methodology  (flow cy tometry , PCR, and/or sequencing) to define CLL 
event for all subjects at:
●Screening for baseline assessment (peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate)
●Week 24 (Peripheral Blood, All Subjects)
●Week 36 (peripheral blood Expansion Cohort subjects only )
●Upon achieving CR/CRi (peripheral blood and bone marrow) at the 8 we ek

5.3.2 Drug Concentration Measurements
5.3.2.1 Collection of Samples for A nalysis
Blood samples (3 mL) for venetoclax (and possible metabolite[s]) assay will be collected 
in K 2EDTA containing tubes by venipuncture in appropriately labeled tubes at the times 
listed in Table 6.
A total of approximately  11 blood samples (approxi mately  33 mL) will be collected.  The 
PK collection performed 8 hours post dose after each dose increment, may  be taken up to 
1hour before or up to 20 minutes after, to allow for processing if necessary.
The date and time of each blood sample collection w ill be recorded to the nearest minute 
on the eCRF.  The date and time (to the nearest minute) of each venetoclax dose and 
whether or not the venetoclax dose was taken within 30 minutes after the completion of 
breakfast (or subject 's first meal of the day ) will be recorded on the scheduled venetoclax
PK day s and for the 2 day s prior to every  scheduled venetoclax PK day .  Sites will ensure 
that all information is captured through source documents (site or subject calendar/diary  
provided b y AbbVie).
5.3.2.2 Handling/P rocessing of Samples
Blood and plasma samples must be protected from direct sunlight during collection, 
processing and storage.  Immediately after collection, the blood samples for venetoclax 
will be inverted 8 to 10 times to ensure good mixing of the bloo d and anticoagulant, and 
will be placed in an ice bath.  Within 1 hour of blood draw, the blood samples will be 
centrifuged using a refrigerated centrifuge (2° to 8°C) to separate the plasma at 1100 to 
1600 × g for approximately  10 to 15 minutes.  The plas ma samples will be transferred 
using plastic pipettes into a 2 mL  Greiner tube labeled with the drug number name, assay  
type, type of sample (plasma), the protocol number, the subject number, the study week 
and day , and the planned time of sampling relativ e to dosing and then frozen at –20°C or 
colder.  The entire process should be completed within 2 hours of draw.  Samples should 
be maintained at –20°C or colder until shipped to the central laboratory .

5.3.2.3 Disposition of Samples
The frozen plasma samples for v enetoclax (and possible metabolite[s]) assay will be 
packed in dry  ice sufficient to last during transport and shipped from the study  site to the 
central laboratory  according to instructions included in the Laboratory  Manual for this 
study .  An inventory  of the samples included will accompan y the package.  The central 
laboratory  will be responsible for shipping the plasma samples to AbbVie or designated 
laboratory  for testing.
5.3.2.4 Measurement Methods
Plasma concentrations of venetoclax will be determined by the Drug Anal ysis Department 
at AbbVie using a validated method.  Other potential metabolites of venetoclax may be 
analyzed with either a validated or non -validated assay .
5.3.3 Efficacy  Variables
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of venetoclax 
monotherap y in subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) relapsed after or 
refractory to treatment with B -cell Receptor Signaling Pathway  Inhibitors.  Efficacy  will 
be measured b y overall response rate (ORR).
The secondary  objec tives are to evaluate the duration of response (DOR), time to 
progression (TTP) progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
Additional exploratory  objectives will be evaluated.  Minimal residual disease (MRD) is 
assessed in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) b y flow cy tometry , PCR and/or 
sequencing.  Health Economic and Patient- Reported Outcome Measures will include the 
EORTC QL Q-C30 and EORTC QL Q CLL16 (a measure of health related quality  of life 
specific to CLL) and the EQ -5D-5L (measure of general health status) including 
EQ-5D-VAS.  For Expansion Cohort subjects, only  the EORTC QLQ -C30 will be 
performed.
Analy ses of these endpoints are described in Section 8.0.

5.3.3.1 Primary  Variables
For disease assessments, response will be assessed by  the investigator based on analys is 
of clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  laboratory values), complete ph ysical 
examination, CT scan of involved anatomic regions (or MRI  if CT is medically  
contraindicated), bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.  Subjects will be evaluated against the 
2008 Modified I WCLL NCI -WG Criteria for Tumor Response27with the addition of CT 
imaging (or MRI).
At Screening, all measurable disease must be documented by  laboratory  testing 
(hematologic status), physical examination, PET/CT and bone marrow.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed no more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  All the other tumor assessments after baseline should be performed within 
7days after the scheduled visit.  During the study , subjects will have a disease assessment 
at Screening, Week 5 Day 1 (or Day  1 of initiation of 400 mg dose) and bey ond by  a 
physical examination and laboratory  testing.  When a CR/CRi response is determined b y 
clinical criteria at an y time during the stud y, a CT scan or MRI must be performed within 
8 weeks for confirmation.  For determination of CR, both the CT/MRI  scan and bone 
marrow are required to be negative.  If the scans confirm a CR, then a BM biopsy is 
required for confirmation of the CR.
If a sub ject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
denovo enlargement of liver, spleen or l ymph nodes on phy sical examination) without an 
increase in ly mphocy tes meeting PD criteria, then additional assessments including 
contrast enhanced CT scan (or MRI) and/or bone marrow must be performed within 
2weeks to confirm or rule out PD.
Methods of Measurement
Disease response and progression will be assessed by  anal ysis of peripheral blood, clinical 
examination, radiographic scans and bone marrow aspirate and biops y. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
96
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Details on the anal ysis of peripheral blood required to assess r esponse are provided in 
Section 5.3.1.1 , Study  Procedures.
A full phy sical examination should be performed to assess the extent of disease 
involvem ent.  All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a 
ruler or calipers.  Clinical lesions will only  be considered measurable when they  are 
superficial (e.g., palpable ly mph nodes).  The diameter, in two planes, of the largest 
palpable nodes in each of the following sites should be measured:  cervical, 
supraclavicular, axillary , inguinal, and femoral.  The presence of hepatomegal y and 
splenomegaly  should be performed.
The 12 largest bi -dimensional lesions should be recorded in the eCRF.  
●Target Lesions:  A maximum of 12 target lesions may be selected (up to 
6nodal and 6 extranodal).  Target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in 
LDi at baseline), clearl y measurable and suitable for consistent, reproducible 
measurement in at le ast two perpendicular dimensions.  Target extranodal 
lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters at baseline.
● Non- Target Lesions:  A maximum of 10 non -target lesions can be selected.  
Non- target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in L Di at baseline).  
Non- target extranodal lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters.  
Nodal and extranodal lesions that were not selected as target lesions at baseline 
can be followed as non- target lesions.
Computed tomograph y (CT) is the preferred method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment.  CT scans (with contrast) should include neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis scans.  CT scans for response assessment may  be limited to areas of prior 
involv ement only , if required by  local regulatory  authorities.  Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) may  be used if CT is medically  contraindicated (e.g., severe contrast 
allergy ).  If MRI s are used instead of CT scans, MRI s should be used consistently   
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
97
throughout th e stud y.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 5 mm 
or less in slice thickness contiguousl y.  Spiral CT should be performed b y use of 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm; this specification applies to the regions of the neck, 
chest , abdomen and pelvis at baseline and follow ups.  The 12 largest bi- dimensional 
lesions should be recorded in the eCRF (6 nodal and 6 extra nodal).
For accurate overall response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure 
tumor lesions.
Detai ls on bone marrow biopsy  and aspirate are provided in Section 5.3.1.1 , Study  
Procedures.
In addition to being reviewed b y the investigator and/or s ite staff, an independent review 
will be performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical data and 
radiographic scans will be interpreted according to 2008 Modified I WCLL NCI -WG 
Criteria for Tumor Response (refer to Table 10).  The independent review facility  will 
provide instructions regarding the preparation and shipment of the imaging data.  
Interpretations from the independent re view for individual subjects will not be sent to the 
site.  Subject treatment management will be based on review b y the local investigator 
and/or site staff.
Tumor Response Criteria
Complete Remission (CR)
CR requires all of the following criteria:
●Peripheral blood l ymphocy tes (evaluated by  blood and differential count) 
below 4 × 109/L (4000/µL)
●Absence of ly mphadenopathy  (nodes > 15 mm in longest diameter or an y extra 
nodal disease) b y physical examination and CT scan
●No hepatomegal y or splenomegaly by physical examination (as determined by  
measurement below the relevant costal margin) 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
98
●Absence of disease or constitutional sy mptoms (B sy mptoms:  unexplained 
fevers > 38° C or 100.4 °F, drenching night sweats, > 10% bod y mass weight 
loss in the preceding 6 months)
●Blood counts above the following laboratory  values:
○Neutrophils > 1.5 × 109/L [1500/µL ] (without the need for exogenous 
growth factors)
○Platelets > 100 × 109/L [100,000/µL ] (without the need for platelet 
transfusion or exogenous growth factors)
○ H emoglobin > 110 g/L [11 g/dL ] (without the need for blood transfusions 
or exogenous ery thropoietin )
●Bone marrow at least normocellular for age, < 30% of nucleated cells being 
lymphocy tes.  Ly mphoid nodules should be absent.  Bone marrow aspirate and 
biopsy should be performed after CR/CRi has been achieved.  If the bone 
marrow is h ypocellular, a repeat determination should be made in 4 weeks or 
when peripheral blood counts have recovered.  A marrow biops y should be 
compared to a pre -treatment marrow if avai lable.  Subjects who are otherwise 
in a complete remission, but bone marrow nodules can be identified 
histologically  should be considered to be nodular PR (nPR).  
Immunohistochemistry  should be performed to define whether these nodules 
are composed of prim arily T cells or ly mphocy tes other than CLL cells, or 
CLL cells.
Complete Remission with Incomplete Marrow Recovery (CRi)
Subjects who fulfill the criteria for CR (including bone marrow) but who have persistent 
cytopenia (anemia or thrombocy topenia or neu tropenia) apparentl y unrelated to CLL but 
related to drug toxicity  will be considered CRi.  The marrow evaluation described above 
should be performed with scrutiny and not show any clonal infiltrate.
Partial Remission (PR)
To be considered a PR at least 2 of the following must be met: 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

The goal of confirmation of overall response is to avoid overestimating responses.  In 
cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear when 
reporting the outcome that the response(s) is (are) not confirmed.

To be assigned a status of PR changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed b y 
repeat assessments.  These must be performed at least 8 weeks after the clinical criteria 
for response are first met.
5.3.3.2 Secondary  Variables
Disease progression according to 2008 Modified IWCLL NC I-WG Criteria for Tumor 
Response is characterized by  at least one of the following:
●Appearance of any  new lesion, such as enlarged ly mph nodes (> 1.5 cm), 
splenomegaly , hepatomegal y, or other organ infiltrates.  An increase b y 50% 
or more in greatest determined diameter of an y previous site.
●An increase in the previously  noted enlargement of the li ver or spleen b y 50% 
or more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly  or splenomegal y.
●An increase in the number of blood ly mphocy tes by  50% or more with at least 
5,000 B l ymphocy tes per microliter.  The increase should be assessed against 
the best respon se while on study .
●Transformation to a more aggressive histology  (e.g., Richter 's Syndrome).  
Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be confirmed by lymph node biopsy .  
For subjects experiencing disease progression due to Richter 's Syndrome while 
on stud y, supplemental data may  be collected.
●Occurrence of cy topenia (neutropenia, anemia or thrombocy topenia) 
attributable to CLL.
5.3.4 Safety  Variables
The following safet y evaluations will be performed during the stud y:  adverse event 
monitoring, vital signs, phy sical examination, 12 -lead ECG, and laboratory  assessments.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Plasma concentration of venetoclax will be tabulated.  Values for the PK parameters of 
venetoclax , including the apparent clearance (CL/F), and the apparent volume of  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
103
distribution (V/F), may  be determined using a population PK approach.  Additional 
parameters may  be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.6 Pharmacogenetic Variables
DNA samples may  be analy zed for genetic factors contributing to the subject 'sresponse to 
venetoclax in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safet y.  Such genetic factors may 
include, for example, drug metabolizing enzy mes, drug transport proteins, CLL 
prognostic markers and Bcl -2 family  members.  Some genes currently insufficie ntly 
characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of anal ysis.  
These samples may  be analy zed as part of a multicenter, multi -study  project to identify  
genetic factors involved in the response to stud y drugs.  The samples may  also be used for 
the development of diagnostic tests related to venetoclax (or drugs of this class).  The 
results of pharmacogenetic anal yses may  not be reported with the study  summary .
5.3.7 Biomarker Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy  and response m ay be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of defining the relationship between various disease markers and disease 
status.  Biospecimens collected during the course of this study  will be banked and used in 
the future to investigate new scientific ques tions related to this study .  The samples may  
also be used for diagnostic test development.  AbbVie (or a designated laboratory) will 
store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect 
confidentiality .  The samples will be retain ed while research on venetoclax (or drugs of 
this class) continues but no longer than 20 y ears.
Examination of the plasma and serum components of subjects on this venetoclax clinical 
trial may  reveal patterns of cell -free nucleic acids, proteins/peptides or metabolites that 
may be further evaluated in future clinical studies to determine an y prognostic value and 
any correlation with clinical response.  Plasma and serum samples may  also be anal yzed 
for predictive or drug -responsive markers.  In the event tha t any plasma and serum 
samples are unused, remaining samples will be banked for use in diagnostic test 
development efforts. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
104
DNA meth ylation regulates gene expression (inactivates certain genes and their normal 
role); aberrant meth ylation of specific genes is associated with cancer development and 
poor clinical outcome.  Genes with variable meth ylation status that are known to have 
prognostic implications may  be assessed in the trial.  These anal yses may  examine 
putative stratification markers for correlation for efficacy .
Genetic amplification, chromosomal loss and/or mutational/methy lation status of various 
genes represent genetic lesions potentially  associated with subject outcome.  Nucleic 
acids, protein expression, and/or mutational/methylation analysis may be conducted on 
CLL cells isolated from blood, tissue from tumor samples and/or DNA/RNA extracted 
from serum from subjects participating in this study to assess modifications in genes 
(e.g., which may  include but will not be limited to the Bcl -2 family , p53, notch and other 
genes associated with resistance to B -cell receptor targeted agents such as BTK and 
PLCγ), which may  prove to be informative.  Additionally , comprehensive sequencing of 
CLL cells isolated from the blood or bone marrow aspirate may al so be performed.  The 
sequencing may  be used to identify  the mutation status of genes associated with CLL as 
well as sequencing of the tumor associated immunoglobulin gene as a method to monitor 
disease burden.  FISH may  be conducted on tissue from tumor s amples and/or CLL cells 
from subjects participating in this study  to assess amplifications and translocations in the 
Bcl-2 gene and other alteration in genes associated with CLL, which may  prove to be 
informative.  The potential relationship between amplif ication/loss/mutation/methy lation 
of these genes and the clinical outcome in these subjects may be examined as a subject 
stratification tool.  Biospecimens collected during the course of this stud y may be banked 
and used in the future to investigate new sc ientific questions related to this study .
5.3.8 Health Economic and Patient -Reported Outcome Measures
The EORTC QLQ -C30 consists of a Global Health Status/QoL  scale, a Financial 
Difficulties scale, five Functional scales (Cognitive Functioning, Social Functionin g, 
Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Role Functioning), and eight S ymptom 
scales/items (Fatigue, Insomnia, Appetite L oss, Pain, Constipation, Diarrhea, Dy spnea,  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
105
and Nausea and Vomiting).  For Expansion Cohort subjects, only the EORTC QL Q-C30
will be performed.
Each of these domains will be calculated as per the EORTC scoring manual, and 
summarized (mean, std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in 
each of these values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify  any 
statistically  significant differences versus baseline.
The five EORTC QLQ CLL16 domains (Fatigue, Treatment Side Effects and Disease 
Symptoms, Infection, Social Activities, Future Health Worries) will be summarized 
(mean, std. dev., median ) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these 
values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify an y statistically  
significant differences versus baseline.29
EQ-5D-5L and EQ -5D-VAS
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L) is a generic preference instrument that has been 
validated in numerous populations.  The EQ -5D-5L hasfive dimensions:  mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression.  These dimensions are 
measured on a five level scale:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems.  The EQ -5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale 
(VAS) to assess the subject 's overall health.30
Each of the five dimensions of the EQ -5D-5L, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and overall 
utility  score will be calculated using the EuroQol scoring manual, and summarized (mean, 
std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these values 
(final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify an y statistically significant 
differences versus baseline.30

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time.  In addition, the 
investigator will discontinue a subject from the study at an y time if the investigator 
considers it necessary  for any  reason including:
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject;
●The subject 's response to therap y is unsatisfactory, as evidenced b y 
progression of disease while on study  drug;
●The subject requires radiotherap y, cancer -related surgery  as a result of tumor 
progression, or alternate anti -neoplastic agents during the stud y period;
●Nonc ompliance with the protocol.
Subjects with disease progression may  continue to receive study  treatment when, in the 
opinion of the investigator, it is in the subject 's best interest to stay  on the study  drug.  
Disease progression will be captured in EDC p er iWCLL NCI- WG criteria as described in 
Section 5.3.3.2 of the protocol.  The subject will be monitored per stud y procedures 
described in Section 5.3.1.1 or more often if the investigator considers it necessary .
The investigator will inform AbbVie prior to discontinuing a subject from the study by 
contacting the Clinical Team Leader as identified in Section 7.0.  All subjects will be 
included for anal ysis of safet y data.  Subjects who with draw from the study will not be 
replaced unless they  are not evaluable.
Refer to Appendix Gfor COVID- 19-related processes for this section.
Post Treatment Follow -Up Visits
For subjects who discontinue venetoclax therap y, but do not discontinue the study 
(i.e., have not had an event of progression, do not require alternate therap y, etc.), Post 
Treatment Follow -Up visits will be performed every  3 months until discontinu ation from 
the study  (e.g., disease progression, alternative therapy  is required, or a subject 's refusal of  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
107
the Post -Treatment visits) for a period of 3 years after the last subject has enrolled on the 
study .
Final Visit
Upon discontinuation from the study , the reason(s) for discontinuation will be recorded in 
EDC and a Final Visit will be performed.  The Final Visit procedures as listed in Table 4
and Table 6should be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study .
At the Final Visit, the subject 's calendars/diaries are to be ret urned to the site and 
appropriatel y filed with the subject' s source documents.
30 Day Safety Follow -Up Visit
A Safet y Follow -Up Visit should be performed for all subjects approximately  30 day s 
following discontinuation of study  drug and then as clinically  appropriate for safet y 
assessment.  The subject will be followed until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the 
adverse event is achieved.
A Safet y Follow -Up Visit does not need to be performed for subjects who had a Final 
Visit conducted > 30 days after discontinuation of study  drug and did not require 
additional adverse event follow -up.  If the subject refuses or is unable to attend the Safet y 
Follow -Up Visit, this should be noted in the subject 's source documentation.
Survival Follow -Up
Survival informa tion (i.e., the date and cause of death, post -treatment cancer therapies, 
etc.) will be collected via telephone calls and/or clinical visits at 3 -month intervals after 
the last study  visit for a period of 5 y ears after the last subject has enrolled on the study .
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the stud y, the administration of study  drug must be 
discontinued immediately.  The investigator must report a pregnancy  within 1 working  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
108
day of the site being aware to one of the AbbVie representatives listed in Section 6.1.5 or 
Section 7.0.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at an y study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by eith er part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately 
notify  the investigator b y telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatm ents A dministered
Each dose of venetoclax will be taken with approximately  240 mL of water within 
30minutes after the completion of breakfast or the subject 's first meal of the day .
In cases of vomiting, if vomiting occurs within 15 minutes of taking the dose and all 
tablets are intact, another dose may  be given.  Otherwise, no replacement dose is to be 
given.  In cases where a dose is missed or forgotten, the subject should take the dose as 
soon as possible, ensuring the dose is taken within 8 hours of th e missed dose with food.  
Otherwise, the dose should not be taken.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
There is no randomization schedule for this study .  Subjects will be assigned at Screening, 
a unique consecutive su bject number.  All subjects will be enrolled using an I xRS.  Before 
the study  is initiated, each site will be provided with the I xRS user instructions, which 
provides direction on how to use the I xRS via the web or the telephone.  Since this is an 
open -label stud y, subjects will maintain the same subject number regardless of the number 
of re-screens and through the duration of the stud y.  The site, in conjunction with the  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
110
sponsor, will be responsible for assignment of all unique subject numbers at Screening
and dose assignments if the subject is not a screen failure.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the dose for this study  is discussed in Section 5.6.4.  Each dose of venetoclax
will be taken with approximately  240 mL of water.  All subjects will be trained to 
self-administer venetoclax orally  QD within 30 minutes after the completion of breakfast 
or the subject' s first meal of the day .
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open -label, two arm study .
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
the protocol.  T he stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
To document compliance with the treatment regimen, subjects will be instructed to return 
all unused tablets and/or containers, even if empt y and an y other stud y related i tems as 
necessary , to the study  coordinator at scheduled study  visits.  Compliance will be 
monitored and documented by  the study  coordinator on the appropriate form.  The study  
coordinator will question the subject regarding adherence to the dosing regimen , record 
the number of tablets and/or containers returned, the date returned and determine 
treatment compliance before dispensing new stud y drug to the subject.  Compliance below 
80% will require counseling of the subject b y study site personnel.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
Documentation of the receipt of supplies will be supported b y a signed and dated Proof of 
Receipt or similar shipping document in I xRS.  A current (running) and accurate  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
111
inventory  of study  drug will be kept by  the site and will include lot n umber, Proof of 
Receipt number(s), container numbers, blister pack numbers, and the date on which study  
drug is administered to the subject.
An overall accountability of study drug will be performed in I xRS and verified by  AbbVie 
or the designated monitor( s) throughout the stud y and at the study  site closeout visit.  
Upon completion or termination of the study , all original containers (containing partiall y 
used or unused stud y drug) will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions from 
AbbVie or the des ignated monitor(s).  If pre -arranged between AbbVie and the site, 
destruction of used and unused study drug containers will be performed at the site.  Empty 
containers will be destroyed at the site.  Labels must remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussio n and Justification of Study  Design
Antiapoptotic BCL -2 family  members are associated with tumor initiation, disease 
progression, and drug resistance, and thus are compelling targets for antitumor therap y.  
Venetoclax is a novel orally  bioavailable small m olecule BCL -2 family protein inhibitor 
that binds with high affinity  to Bcl -2 and with lower affinity  to other Bcl -2 family  
proteins BCL -xL and BCL -w.  The mechanism of action of venetoclax is independent of 
the BCR signaling and TP53 pathway.  Briefl y, venetoclax inhibits BCL -2 allowing the 
release of BIM, which includes oligomerization of pro -apoptotic molecules such as BAK 
and BAX which triggers rapid apoptosis independent of TP53 and BCR pathway s.
Preliminary  data indicate that ongoing venetoclax first-in-human Study  M12 -175 had a 
strong efficacy  signal in oncology  subjects.  In the CLL Arm A, 47 of 52 (90.2%) 
evaluable subjects achieved a best response of complete response (CR), CR with 
incomplete bone marrow recovery  (CRi), or partial response (PR):  1 2 (21%) subjects 
experienced CR/CRi, and 36 (63%) subjects experienced PR (of which 30 were 
confirmed).  Subjects with high- risk CLL had a response rate of 82% in del (17p) and 
78% in fludarabine -refractory  disease.  Three of the 4 high -risk disease subjec ts who 
achieved CR/CRi had no detectable MRD.  One subject with SLL after disease 
progression on Idelalisib had PR on venetoclax for 11 months prior to developing PD.

5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
There are no control groups in th is study .
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory  procedures will be utilized 
in this study .
5.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
Subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL will be selected to participate in this study .  
Subjects must have relapsed or be refractory to Ibrutinib or I delalisib containing regimen.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose of 400 mg was selected on the basis of the data in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL 
subjects from the ongoing venetoclax first-in-human Study  M12 -175.  A time -to-response 
model and a logistic -regression model were developed using data from Study  M12 -175 to 
understand the relationship between the response outcome and the final target venetoclax
dose.  Both models fou nd that a faster response was achieved with a higher final target 
dose.  Further analy sis focused on comparing 400 mg and 600 mg as the final target dose 
showed a minimum difference on the overall response rate (i.e., percentage of subjects 
with partial re sponse or better).  With doses below 400 mg QD, however, a longer (and 
clinically  unfavorable) duration will be needed to achieve the same response rate.  Since 
there is no strong difference between 400 mg and 600 mg as the final dose, the 400 mg 
dose was selected as the minimum effective dose.
To mitigate the risk for TLS, a lead -in period of 5 weeks will be employ ed to escalate 
venetoclax dose to the final treatment dose of 400 mg.  All high risk subjects will be 
admitted to the hospital and begin the lea d-in period with an initial dose of 20 mg 
venetoclax on Week 1 Day  1 and first dose of 50 mg on Week 2 Day  1.  Low risk subjects 
and medium risk subjects with Cr Cl ≥ 80 mL /min will begin lead -in-period as 
outpatients.  I f no significant findings suggestiv e of clinical or lab TLS occur within  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

113
24hours, the same dose will be continued until Day 7 in the outpatient setting.  A dose of 
50 mg venetoclax will be administered on Week 2 Day  1.  After a week at 50 mg, weekl y 
dose increments will be implemented as follows:  100 mg →200 mg →400 mg (or 
additional lead- in steps to designated 400 mg dose) as tolerated.  
Expansion Cohort 
subjects with bulky  disease that are non -responders either b y clinical or radiographic 
Disease Assessment bet ween Week 6 to Week 12 or subjects who show signs of clinical 
progression after completing the ramp up to 400 mg may be permitted to escalate 
venetoclax to a 600 mg dose.
The maximum dose in this study  is 400 mg, however currentl y the established maximum 
clinical dose of venetoclax is not to exceed 1200 mg/day for a duration not to exceed 
48months based on genotoxicity  studies.
6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any  written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the ph ysical charact eristics, identity , quality , purit y, potency, durability , 
reliability , safet y, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.  Medical complaints are further detailed in the Adverse Events Section.  For 
adverse eve nts, please refer to Sections 6.1through 6.1.7.4 .
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the stud y.  The investigator will assess and record 
any adverse event in detail including the dat e of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/sy mptom , severity , time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study  drug, and any  action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possi bility "of being associated with study  drug, the 
investigator will provide an " Other cause "of the event.  For adverse events to be 
considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse 
events, whether in response to a query ,observed by  site personnel, or reported 
spontaneously  by the subject will be recorded.

All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated i n the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, (meets protocol specific crite ria [see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity  
management]) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment -emergent adverse eve nt is defined as any  adverse event reported by  a subject 
with onset or worsening from the time that the first dose of venetoclax is administered 
until 30 day s have elapsed following discontinuation of study  drug administration.

6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious 
adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality  if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y 
length of time or prolongs the subject 's hospital stay .  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study  subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requirin g 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
based on medical judgment may  jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent an y 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, 
life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of 
hospitalization, congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  elec tive 
or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.  For deaths related to disease progre ssion 
(coded to malignant neoplasm progression), the date and cause of death will be recorded 
on the appropriate case report form, however, the event will be considered expected for 
the purpose of determining expedited reporting requirements to regulatory authorities.  If 
the cause of death is unknown at the time of reporting, "unexplained death "should be 
recorded on the eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available "unexplained death "
should be replaced b y the established cause of death.
Hospitaliz ation of a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV h ydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophy laxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), 
unless there is an additional reason for hospitalization or an additional criterion fo r 
seriousness other than hospitalization (e.g., abnormal post -dose TL S laboratories that 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, etc.).
Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study population (CLL) at some 
frequency  independent of drug exposure.  These are discussed here as Adverse Events 
commonly  associated with CLL or progression of CLL.  Such events include known 
consequ ences of the underly ing disease or condition under investigation (e.g., s ymptoms,  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
117
disease progression) and events unlikely to be related to the underl ying disease under 
investigation but common in the study population independent of drug therapy  
(e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderl y population).
These events are listed in Appendix E.
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combination s and are considered 
expected for reporting purposes.
Although exempted from expedited reporting to Health Authorities and IRBs as 
individual cases, if an event commonly associated with CLL or progression of CLL meets 
seriousness criteria (as defined in Se ction 6.1.1.2 ) it must be reported to AbbVie within 
24hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.  For deaths related to 
disease progression (coded to malignant neoplasm progression), the date and cause of 
death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form, but the event will not be 
expedited as an individual case safet y report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.
6.1.2 Adverse E vent Severity
The investigator will rate the severit y of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.0).27  If a reported adverse event increases in severit y, the initial adverse event 
should be given final outcome date and a new adverse event must be reported to reflect
the change in severit y.  The dates on the AE 's cannot overlap.  For all reported serious 
adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental eCRFs also need to be updated 
to reflect an y changes due to the increase in severity.  For adverse events n ot captured b y 
the Common Terminology  Criteria, the following should be used:
Grade 1 The adverse event is transient and easil y tolerated by the subject (mild).
Grade 2 The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject 's 
usual act ivities (moderate).
Grade 3 The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject 's usual 
activities and may  be incapacitating (moderate to severe). 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
118
Grade 4 The adverse event is life -threatening requiring urgent intervention (severe).
Grad e 5 The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe).
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study  drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study  drug and the adverse even t.
For causality  assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated. "  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated. "  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator 's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an "Other cause "of event must be provided by  the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All protocol -related serious adverse events and nonserious adverse events must be 
collected from the signing of the stud y-specific in formed consent until study drug 
administration.
In addition, all adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 
30days following discontinuation of study  drug administration have elapsed will be 
collected, whether solicited or sp ontaneousl y reported by the subject. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
119
Serious and nonserious adverse events occurring after the stud y-specific informed consent 
is signed but prior to the initial dose of venetoclax will be collected onl y if they are 
considered b y the Investigator to be cau sally  related to the study -required procedures.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 3.

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study  drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify  Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made 
aware of the serious adverse event b y entering the serious adverse event data into the 
electronic data capture (EDC) sy stem.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site 
having access to the RAVE®system or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non -CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance and Oncology Safet y Management within 24 hours of the site being 
made aware of the serious adverse event.

6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the study  must 
be discontinued (Section 5.4.1 ).
All subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken throughout 
the study  and for 30 day s after discontinuing study drug.  Information regarding a 
pregnancy occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the pregnancy  will be 
collected.  In the event of a pregnancy occurring in the partner of an enrolled subject, 
written informed consent for release of medical information from the partner must be 
obtained prior to the colle ction of an y pregnancy -specific information and the pregnancy  
will be followed to outcome.
Male subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken by their 
female partners.  If the subject 's partner should become pregnant during the st udy, this 
should also be reported and data may  be collected.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a serious adv erse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the 
site becoming aware of the event.

6.1.7 Toxicity  Management
6.1.7.1 Prophy laxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Sy ndrome 
(TLS)
There is a potential for tumor ly sis sy ndrome in subjects, affected by  hematolog ic 
malignancies especially  in those with bulky  disease, elevated pretreatment lactate 
dehy drogenase (LDH) levels, elevated leukocy te count, renal d ysfunction, and 
dehy dration.
In response to the events of TL S reported in the Phase 1 studies in subjects wit h diagnosis 
of relapsed or refractory  CLL treated with venetoclax monotherapy or in combination 
with an anti -CD20 antibody , an extensive review of the safet y data was performed across 
all CLL trials in January  of 2013.  These clinical data suggest that siz e of baseline lymph 
nodes is a risk factor for TL S, with larger l ymph nodes resulting in increased risk.  I n 
addition, creatinine clearance of ≤ 80 mL/min at Screening was identified as a risk factor 
for TL S.  Data anal yses have resulted in development of three risk categories, listed 
below.  Risk category  for an individual patient is determined upon study  entry .
A detailed description of risk factors for developing tumor l ysis following treatment with 
venetoclax is available in the current Investigator 's Brochure.
A "TLS Prophy laxis and Monitoring Checklist "will be completed throughout the lead -in 
period to ensure proper TLS proph ylaxis measures.
Refer to table in Appendix Ffor laboratory  and clinical TL S.
For TLS proph ylaxis, all subjects enrolling into the study will be classified into 3 risk 
categories based on the tumor burden prior to venetoclax administration.  The tumor 
burden assessed b y the nodal disease and absolute ly mphocy te count at Screening will be 
used to define each category  as described below:

6.1.7.1.2 TLS Prophy laxis Guidelines
The section below describes the management of subjects throughout dosing based on their 
risk factors for developing TLS identified upon study  entry .
First Dose of Venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg
TLS prophy laxis must be initiated in all subjects irrespective of their TLS risk category 
prior to the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  
●An oral agent to reduce the uric acid level (e.g., allopurinol) to be initiated at 
least 72 hours prior to dosing.  Treatment may  need to be continued for up to 
5weeks based on the ongoing risk of TLS development.  Subjects allergic to 
allopurinol must use another uric acid reducer.
●Oral h ydration consisting of fluid intake of 1.5 to 2 L  per day  starting a t least 
48 hours prior to the start of treatment for all subjects prior to first dose, at all 
subsequent dose increment steps and continued for at least 24 hours after 
dosing until all of the chemistry  laboratory  values remain within ULN.  Oral 
hydration i s recommended bey ond 24 hours post -dose for subjects who 
demonstrate an y laboratory changes. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
124
●Serum chemistry  and hematology  laboratory  samples (low risk and medium 
risk subjects to be treated in the outpatient setting) must be drawn an ytime 
within 72 hours prior to first dose.  For subjects who will receive outpatient 
dosing, the 0 hour pre -dose chemistry  and hematology  lab results may  be used 
for dosing decisions on Day  1 of each week during the lead -in period.  For 
subjects who will be hospitalized and wi ll receive inpatient dosing, the 
chemistry  and hematology  labs must be drawn upon admission the night 
before first dose of venetoclax .  All electrolyte values should be reviewed and 
not demonstrate an y clinically significant abnormalities prior to the firs tdose 
of venetoclax in order to keep the treatment on schedule.
●If clinicall y significant laboratory abnormalities are observed in this baseline 
laboratory  assessment, the first dose of venetoclax must be delay ed until 
resolution and initiate TLS manageme nt per the protocol Appendix D, 
Recommendations for Initial Management of Electroly te Abnormalities and 
Prevention of Tumor Lys is Sy ndrome (TLS) mus t be initiated.  If aggressive 
correction of electrolytes was performed, the initial dose of venetoclax can 
only be given when electroly tes have been stable without any further treatment 
for at least 24 hours.  If needed, subjects may  continue to receive a dditional 
prophy lactic treatment prior to the initiation of dosing.
Additional TL S prophy laxis and monitoring procedures are tailored to the individual TL S 
risk category as follows:
Subjects in Low Risk Category
Subjects in the L ow Risk category  may  begin the lead -in period in the outpatient setting if 
there is no indication to hospitalize.
●For subjects who are unable to maintain adequate oral hydration, IV h ydration 
of 1.5 to 2 L  is recommended in the outpatient setting on D1 of the 20 mg and 
50mg dose t o assure the full amount of hy dration is achieved.  For subjects in 
whom volume overload is considered a significant risk, hospitalization should 
be considered.

Re-Assessment of Risk Category for Subjects with Lymph Nodes < 10 cm:
Subjects classified in the high- risk TLS category  at Screening due to an absolute 
lymphocy te count ≥ 25 × 109/L AND a measurable ly mph node with the largest diameter 
≥ 5 cm but less than 10 cm by  radiologic assessment may  have a re -evaluation of their 
TLS risk category  based on their most r ecent ALC for dose escalations after 50 mg.  
Based on those results, one of the following two options may  be implemented:
●If the subject 's ALC decreases to  25 × 109/L, the subject may  be 
re-categorized as medium -risk for TLS and follow the TL S management
guidelines for the medium -risk category  for subsequent dose escalations of 
venetoclax during the Lead -In Period.

reaching the 600 mg dose in the outpatient setting.
Any subject, who at an y dose level develops clinically significant electrolyte 
abnormalities must have their subsequent venetoclax dose interrupted until the electrol yte 
abnormalities resolve.  Electrol yte changes should undergo aggressive management and 
further monitoring as per Appendix D, Recommendations for Initial Management of 
Electrol yte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Ly sis S yndrome (TLS).  If aggressive 
correction of electroly tes was performed, the next dose of venetoclax can only  be given 
when electroly tes have been s table without any further treatment for at least 24 hours.  
The subject may  resume dosing based on a risk assessment (including tumor burden 
status), as determined b y the investigator.  All subjects must receive the intended dose for 
at least 7 consecutive days before increasing to the next higher dose.

6.1.7.2 Management of Neutropenia
Based on clinical observations with the 1stgeneration Bcl- 2 inhibitor, navitoclax and in 
vitro colony -forming assay s to assess Bcl -2-selective inhibitor effects on granulocy te 
precursors, it is possible that subjects treated with venetoclax might experience 
neutropenia.  Subjects with a history of neutropenia, who have received multiple prior 
therapies and/or have significant bone marrow involvement, may
 be at particular high 
risk. If determined to be clinically indicated b y the treating ph ysician in compliance with 
ASCO guidelines,32G-CSF may  be administered during dosing of venetoclax .  The use of 
G-CSF support is strongly recommended for subjects with Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC 
<500/μL ).  If the subject presents with febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia for 
more than one we ek despite the use of optimal G -CSF support, venetoclax dosing should 
be interrupted until ANC recovery  to > 500/μL .  Venetoclax may then be re -initiated at a 
lower dose as defined in the following table.  Subjects not responding to G -CSF despite 
venetocla xinterruption should undergo further evaluation to determine the etiology of the 
neutropenia.  If study drug administration is interrupted (i.e., adverse event), the site will 
contact the AbbVie study team or AbbVie Medical Monitor to adjust the subject
'svisit 
schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case b y case basis.

discretion, including appropriate proph ylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocy stis 
infections.  Potential for drug- drug interactions should be considered.  Most anti -fungals 
are excluded and other commonly  used agents may  be cautionary  or prohibited due to 
drug-drug interactions.  Please refer to Table 1and Appendix Cfor a description of 
excluded and cautionary  medications/food items.
6.1.7.4 Management of Decrease in Sperma togenesis
Based on findings in a preclinical study , there is a potential for decreased 
spermatogenesis.  Male subjects should consider sperm banking before treatment with 
venetoclax if they  are considering preservation of fertility .

8.1.2 Efficacy  Endpoints Per Investigator A ssessment
8.1.2.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoints
The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be overall response rate (ORR) –the proportion of
subjects with an overall response (per the investigator assessment) will be calculated for 
all subjects based on IWCLL NCI -WG criteria.
In addition, the ninety -five percent (95%) confidence interval based on binomial 
distribution will be constructed for t he calculated ORR.
The assessment of ORR will be performed independently  for Arm A, Arm B and the 
Expansion Cohort.  I n the Expansion Cohort assessment of ORR will be performed 
independentl y for ibrutinib failure and idelalisib failure subjects.  Subjects who have not 
had a confirmed response prior to the data "cutoff "date defined in Section 8.1.3 will be 
considered to be non- responders.
8.1.2.2 Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints
Key secondary  efficacy  endpoints will include duration of response, time to progression, 
progression -free survival, and overall survival.
Duration of response will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response 
(CR or PR) to the earliest recurrence or PD.  If a subject is still responding, then the 
subject' s data will be censored at the date of the subject 's last available disease 
assessment.  For subjects who never experience response, the subject 's data will be 
censored on the date of enrollment.  Duration of response will be anal yzed by  
Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data for all enrolled subjects.  Median duration of 
response will be calculated and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be 
presented.
Time to progression (TTP) will be defined as the number of days from the date of 
firstdose or enrollment if not dosed to the date of earliest disease progression.  All disease 
progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
143
taking the stud y drug or had previousl y discontinued the study drug.  If the subject does 
not experience disease progression, then the data will be censored at the date of last 
available disease assessment.  Data for patients who receive non- protocol, CLL t herap y 
prior to disease progression will be censored at the last disease assessment prior to 
receiving non- protocol therap y.  Data for subjects without any disease assessments 
performed after the baseline visit will be censored at the time of enrollment plus 1 day .  
TTP will be analy zed by  Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data for all subjects enrolled.  
Median time TTP will be calculated and 95% confidence interval for median time TTP 
will be presented.
Progression -free survival (PFS) will be defined as the number of day s from the date of 
first dose to the date of earliest disease progression or death.  All disease progression will 
be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was taking the stud y 
drug or had previously discontinued the study  drug.  If the subject does not experience 
disease progression or death, then the data will be censored at the date of last disease 
assessment.  Data for patients who receive non -protocol, CLL therap y prior to disease 
progression will be censored at t he last disease assessment prior to receiving non- protocol 
therap y.  Data for subjects without any disease assessments performed after the baseline 
visit will be censored at the time of enrollment plus 1 day.  PFS will be analyzed b y 
Kaplan -Meier methodolo gy using data for all subjects enrolled.  Median time PFS will be 
calculated and 95% confidence interval for median time PFS will be presented.
Overall survival (OS) will be defined as number of days from the date of first dose to the 
date of death for all dosed subjects.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be 
censored at the date of last study  visit or the last known date to be alive, whichever is 
later.  OS will be anal yzed by  Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data from all enrolled 
subjects.  Med ian time survival will be estimated and 95% confidence interval for the 
median time survival will be presented.

8.1.3 Efficacy  Endpoints Per Independent Review Committee
An Independent Review Committee (I RC) will evaluate disease progression and response.  
The f ollowing efficacy  endpoints, described in Section 8.1.2 , will be summarized based 
on this I RC review:  overall response rate, duration of response, time to progression, and 
progression -free survival.
8.1.4 Timing of Efficacy  Endpoints and Safety  Evaluations
The date when 60 subjects in the Expansion Cohort have completed their Week 36 disease 
assessment, or after all enrolled subjects have discontinued venetoclax , whichever is 
earlier, will be defined as the data "cutoff "date for the efficacy  anal yses.  Efficacy  and 
safet y data up to and including this date will be collected.  Exact data cutoff date for the 
efficacy  anal ysis will be detailed in a statistical analy sis plan (SAP) which will be signed 
off prior to the data c ut-off date.  During this data collection period, active subjects will 
continue to receive venetoclax , as applicable.  When data collection is complete and all 
data management quality assurance (QA) and quality  control (QC) procedures are 
performed, the cl inical database data will be extracted for documentation and statistical 
analyses.  An y active subjects will continue to receive venetoclax until they discontinue or 
for up to 2 y ears from the date of the last subject enrolled in study .  Once the last enro lled 
subject discontinues/completes the study, the study will be considered complete ,and all 
remaining data will be collected and entered into the clinical database.
8.1.5 Pharmacokinetics
An anal ysis may  be performed using a nonlinear mixed -effect population m odeling 
approach with NONMEM software to describe the disposition of venetoclax , to identify  
significant covariates and explore relationship between pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacod ynamics b y combining data from this study with other venetoclax clinical 
studies.  Additional analyses may be performed if useful in the interpretation of the data.

Time to next anti -CLL treatment will be defined as the number of days from the date of 
the first dose of venetoclax to the date of first dose of new non- protocol anti -lymphoma 
therap y (NPT) or death from any cause.  For subjects who did not take NPT, the data will 
be censored at the last known date to be free of NPT.  TTNT will be anal yzed by  
Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data fo r all enrolled subjects.  Median TTNT time will 
be calculated and 95% confidence interval for median TTNT time will be presented.
The rate of MRD negativity  in subjects will be an exploratory  endpoint.  This rate will be 
defined as the proportion of subjec ts who had MRD negativity  status.  Ninety- five percent 
(95%) confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution will be provided.
Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcome measures will include the EORTC 
QLQ- C30 and QLQ CLL16 (a measure of health r elated quality  of life specific to CLL) 
and the EQ- 5D-5L (measure of general health status) and EQ -5D-VAS.  Descriptive 
statistics will be calculated for the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QL Q CLL16, the 
EQ-5D-5L utility  score, and the EQ -5D-VAS score including m ean change from baseline 
to each assessment as well as the final visit.  Additionally, the EORTC QLQ -C30 and 
EORTC QL Q CLL16 will be administered through post -treatment.  The results obtained 
for each instrument will be explored for trends and summarized a s appropriate.

value pre -G-CSF administration will be the baseline.  The percentage of subjects 
experiencing a shift from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to maximum post- baseline grades of 
3to 4, and from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to final post -baseline grades of 3 to 4 will be 
summarized.
Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing NCI  CTCAE Grade 3 to 4 blood 
chemistry  and hematology  values will be provided.  All measurements collected, 
regardless of the number of day s after the last dose of study  drug, will be included in these 
listings.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
There is no planned h ypotheses testing on the primary endpoint overall response rate 
(ORR).  ORR will be presented by  a point estimate and it s corresponding 95% confidence 
interval.  A sample size of 20 subjects would ensure that the distance of true rate will be 
within 23% of the observed rate with 95% confidence and a sample size of 60 subjects 
would ensure that the distance of true rate will be within 14% of the observed rate with 
95% confidence.

Appendix G. Summary of COVID -19 Processes
Section Title Language Added
3.2 Benefits and 
RisksConsidering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk 
to subjects participating in this study has been re -evaluated.  Subjects 
receiving venetoclax may be at an increased risk for COVID -19 infection 
or experience serious illness if infected.  Management of these adverse 
events will be made on a case- by-case basis with consideration of 
benefit/risk.  How ever, based on the population and disease being 
studied and the anticipation that COVID -19 related risks are not 
expected to differ substantially betw een study subjects and the broader 
population of subjects receiving treatment for CLL, no change to the 
benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study is expected.
5.2.3 Prior and 
Concomitant 
TherapyA vaccine for COVID -19, though not yet available at the time of 
protocol amendment vers ion 6.0, may be allowed when available after 
documented communication with the AbbVie TA MD.
5.3.1.1 Study 
ProceduresDuring the COVID- 19 pandemic, it has been necessary to employ 
mitigation strategies to enable the investigator to ensure patient safety 
and continuity of care.  Acceptable mi tigation strategies are identified 
below  and throughout the protocol.
Study visits may be impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  This may 
include changes such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative 
locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study 
procedures, among others.  Additional details are provided in the 
subsequent section.  Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of 
subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study.  If 
visits cannot be conduc ted onsite due to travel restrictions or other 
pandemic -related reasons, follow  the updates below  on how to proceed.
COVID -19 Pandemic- Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, if it is not possible for all study 
procedures to be performed as specified due to travel restrictions or other 
reasons, the following modifications are allowed:
Some study visits and/or activities may be performed by 
phone/virtually.
Some study visits and/or activities may be performed by a local 
clinic /hospital/laboratory.  All procedures performed at local 
facilities must be performed by appropriately qualified personnel.
Study visits and/or activities should be performed as scheduled 
whenever possible.  If it is not possible to do so due to the 
pandem ic, the following modifications are allowed:
oIf an activity is missed during a virtual visit, perform the 
activity at the earliest feasible opportunity.
oNOTE:   If a subject tests positive for COVID -19 or if there is

Section Title Language Added
strong suspicion of COVID -19 (based on s ymptoms, travel 
history, or close contact with a case), the investigator should 
evaluate the benefit/risk of venetoclax being interrupted until 
the infection has resolved or has been ruled out.  There are no 
time limits for venetoclax interruption as long as no permanent 
study discontinuation criteria have been met.  The investigator 
should contact the AbbVie TA MD prior to reintroducing 
venetoclax in research participants previously diagnosed with 
COVID -19.  See also Section 5.4.1 , Discontinuation of 
Individual Subjects, for additional detail.
Informed Consent
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, it is possible that additional protocol 
modifications not outlined in this pro tocol may become necessary.  If 
this situation arises, in addition to the study informed consent, additional 
verbal consent may be obtained prior to these adaptations or substantial 
changes in study conduct in accordance w ith local regulations.
Clinical Laboratory Testing
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of 
the COVID -19 pandemic prevent the subject from having blood 
draw n for laboratory testing at the study site, if possible, arrange for 
subjects to have laboratory w ork done at a local lab, hospital, or 
other facility.  Local lab results should be obtained along with 
reference ranges and kept within the subjects 'source documentation.  
Local lab results should be review ed by  the investigator as soon as 
possible and befo re venetoclax is administered.
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration 
may be continued provided the investigator has reviewed all prior 
laboratory results and confirms and discusses with the subject that 
there is no safety conc ern for the subject to continue use of the study 
drug in the absence of current labs.  The subject should be 
scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible.
5.4.1 Discontinuation 
of Individual 
SubjectsCOVID -19 Pandemic- Related Acceptable Protocol Modification
The investigator should contact the sponsor medical contact before 
discontinuing a subject from the study for a reason other than "planned 
per protocol ,"to ensure all acceptable mitigation steps have been 
explored.
Interruption/Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to COVID -19 Infection
During the Study Drug Dosing Period, a subject w ith confirmed (viral 
test positive) or suspected COVID -19 infection can only be dosed with 
study drug if the following COVID -19 viral clearance criteria are met:
Symptomatic subjects:  At least 2 negative viral tests in a row, 
≥24hours apart after at least 10 days have passed since recovery, 
defined as resolution of fever withou t use of antipyretics and

improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of 
breath)
Asymptomatic subjects:  At least 2 negative viral tests in a row , 
≥24 hours apart after at least 10 days have passed since prior 
positive result (note:  subjects who develop symptoms will follow  
guidance above for symptomatic subjects)
Delays in study drug dosing due to the above COVID- 19 testing 
guidance for subjects must be discussed with the Abb Vie medical 
contact, along with the possibility of premature dis continuation from the 
study drug dosing period.  Frequency or timing of COVID -19 testing and 
intervals between testing for the above viral clearance criteria may be 
adjusted to account for epidemiologic trends, updated information 
regarding infectivity, and local/institutional guidelines.
5.5.1 Treatments 
AdministeredDirect -to-patient (DTP) Shipment of Study Drug
If a subject is unable to come to the study site to pick up their study drug 
due to COVID- 19, a direct -to-patient (DTP) study drug shipment can be 
made from the study site to the subject if allowed by local regulations.  
AbbVie will submit any required notifications to the regulatory authority 
as applicable.
Study drug may be shipped from the study site directly to the stud y 
subject 's home if all the following criteria are met:
Direct -to-patient (DTP) shipment of study drug is allowed by local 
regulations and the relevant ethics committee
Study drug can be administered by the subject (or subject 's 
caregiver) at home
Subject agrees to have the study drug shipped directly to their home
oShipments may also include other study supplies (e.g., drug 
dosing diaries).  Instructions will be provided by AbbVie as to 
how a study site can initiate a DTP shipment using Marken, a 
global ven dor selected by AbbVie to provide this service when 
necessary.  Shipments of study drugs from the study site to a 
subject 's home will be appropriately temperature controlled 
(qualified shipper or temperature monitoring) within the labeled 
storage condition s.  Signature is required upon delivery; due to 
COVID -19 related social distancing, this may be provided by 
the courier after delivery.  Documentation of the shipment is to 
be retained by the clinical site.
AbbVie will not receive subject identifying infor mation related to 
these shipments, as the site will w ork directly with the courier.
The study site is responsible for meeting IRB/IEC reporting 
requirements related to DTP shipments of study drug, and for obtaining 
consent to provide delivery information t o the courier and documenting

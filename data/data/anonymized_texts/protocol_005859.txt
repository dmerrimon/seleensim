Non-Technical Summary
Provide a non-technical summary of the project that  can be
understood by non-scientists ( 250 words max ):
REOPENING HS#2014-1217 TO FINALIZE DATA ANALYSIS AND
COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT WRITING. Original non-technical summary
below: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also known as total knee
replacement, has been associated with a signi �cant pain burden in the
postoperative period. Methods to manage pain associated with this
operation have in the past included injecting pain medication into the
epidural space of the spinal cord, around a peripheral nerve, around the
space surrounding the joint, or a combination of pain management
techniques. In recent years, the femoral nerve block (injection of pain
medication around the peripheral nerve, speci �cally the femoral nerve) has
been proposed as an effective way to manage pain while sparing many of
the undesirable side effects of narcotic pain medications. Traditional
techniques of the femoral nerve block involve the injection of pain
medication around the peripheral nerve at the level of the groin area. A
nerve block at this point in the path of the femoral nerve affects all of the
musculature of the front part of the thigh as well as the nerves responsible
for sensation to the majority of the knee joint. The femoral nerve block
performed at the level of the groin provides an excellent level of pain relief
at the knee joint, but is also associated with weakness of the quadriceps
muscle. The resultant quadriceps weakness can both slow the physical
therapy process and be a risk factor for post-operative falls. Participation in
physical therapy is a critical component of the rehabilitation process and is
started as soon as tolerated by the patient. The ideal pain management
technique would provide the same degree of pain relief as the femoral
nerve block while preserving the strength in the front part of the thigh
muscles. One suggested technique to achieve both of these goals is the
injection of a large volume dilute local pain medication mixture around the
joint during surgery. This has been used as a substitute to provide pain
relief around the joint while maintaining strength in the quadriceps muscle
and the ability to participate in physical therapy. This technique however,
does not last long since the medication disperses away from the joint
space. A variation of the femoral nerve block in the lower thigh, within a
space called the adductor canal, has been demonstrated to provide
equivalent amounts of pain relief as a proximal femoral nerve block along
with preservation of motor function to the quadriceps muscle. What is not
as well-established is whether the combination of injecting pain medication
directly around the joint space in the knee along with a single injection of
pain medication in the adductor canal in the lower thigh can improve pain
scores and extend the duration of pain relief provided compared to only an
injection around the joint space.
Background & Purpose of Research
Describe the purpose, specific aims or objectives an d specify
the hypotheses or research questions to be studied:
Subject Population(s)
Targeted subject populations/data sources ( check that apply ):
Adults
Subjects who are unable to communicate in EnglishThe purpose of the proposed research is to determine t he effect of a single injection adductor
canal block (ACB) on pain scores within 24 hours pos t total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study
will compare three groups of patients: those who receive  the ACB and local periarticular
infiltration, those who receive placebo ACB and local  periarticular injection, and those who
receive the ACB and placebo periarticular injection.
The present study is a three-arm randomized clinical t rial of:
•A.   Local periarticular infiltration (injection of dilute local anesthetic) + Placebo ACB (nerve
block performed with normal saline)
•B.   Local periarticular infiltration (injection of dilute local anesthetic) + ACB (nerve block
procedure performed with local anesthetic)
•C.   ACB (nerve block performed with local anesthetic)
The primary objective being to compare the efficacy of  all groups ( A), (B) and ( C) with each other
with respect to 24 hr. post operative pain. The arm ( A) was included to address the efficacy of
local infiltration only in comparison with groups (B ) and (C).  Comparison of group (B) vs. (C) is
also of primary interest of the study.
The current “standard of care” has not been established  for Total Knee Arthroplasty.  Nationwide
there are large variations in postoperative pain manageme nt methods for total knee arthroplasty
including lumbar epidural, intrathecal opioids, fem oral nerve block with and without sciatic nerve
block, local infiltration, local wound catheters, a nd adductor canal blocks.  All three arms are well
within acceptable standard practice for postoperative  pain management for this population1.
The objective will be to answer the following research questions:
• Does the addition of an adductor canal block to a periarticular injection improve
postoperative pain scores in TKA patients at specific time intervals?
• Does the addition of an adductor canal block to periarticular injection decrease opioid use in
TKA patients?
• Is there a difference in maximum pain scores and/or opioid consumption between those
receiving adductor canal blocks only versus those receiving local infiltration analgesia.

Pre-Screening without Consent
Under the revised Common Rule, an IRB may approve a prop osal for the investigator to
obtain information or biospecimens to screen, recruit , or determine eligibility of prospective
subjects for a research study without informed consen t. In other words, the revised Common
Rule removes the pre-2018 Common Rule requirement for an IRB to approve a waiver of
informed consent for these types of activities. Thi s change harmonizes with FDA.  
[Refer to 45 CFR 46.116(g) of the  revised Common Rule .]
Will the study team obtain information or biospecimens to
screen, recruit, or determine eligibility of prospe ctive
subjects ?
Yes
Pre-Screening Activities ( check all that apply ):

Partial Waiver of HIPAA
A Partial Waiver of HIPAA Authorization is Requested.
Does the use or disclosure of personal health infor mation
involve more  than minimal risk?
No
Would the granting of the waiver adversely affect pri vacy
rights and welfare of the individuals whose records  will be
used or disclosed?
No
Explain (justify) the above answer:
TIP! Consider the following:
•Are there are other federal, state, or local laws that  provide rights to potential subjects
to require informed consent
•How will the study team prevent adverse affects to subj ects' privacy rights and ensure
their welfare
All research personnel are aware of and been trained in UCI/HIPAA policies
and practices. Info collected during this time will only be used for pre-
screening and a subject will sign a HIPAA Authorization prior to further use
of their PHI.
Could the research practicably* be conducted withou t a
waiver of HIPAA authorization?
IMPORTANT! *Practicably means capable of being done ; it should not be determined by
considerations of convenience, cost, or speed.
No
Explain why research could not be done if authorization was
required:
TIP! Consider the following:
•Demonstrate that it is impracticable to perform the  research, and not just impracticable
to obtain consent.
•Would scientific validity be compromised through bia s, have an impact on study power,
etc. if consent was required
•Would there be ethical concerns or increased risk/har m to subjects if consent were
required
•Are there pragmatic limitations that make it impossibl e for the study team to consent
subjects such as insufficient time, an inability to  identify subjects, an inability for staff
to consent the number of subjects needed, etc
The study team will need access to medical records to properly identify
and pre-screen subjects for the trial.
Could the research practicably* be conducted withou t access
to, use or disclosure of the personal identifiers l isted in the
PHI question?

Power analysis/Sample size determination: A power analysis was
performed using a 2-sided 2-sample t-test with a signi �cance level of 0.017
to encounter for 3 pairwise comparisons to be performed for the primary
outcome. From our clinical data, we observed an average max pain score
value of 6.1 +/- 1.9 for arm (a), and we expect the max pain score will be
4.1 for arm (c) and 2.1 for arm (b). We calculated that 21 patients in each
group (total of 63) will provide the study an 82% power to detect a
difference of 2 in average max pain score between the treatment groups,
and a 96% power to detect a difference of 2.5.

Safety Monitoring Plan
UCI IRB requires that all clinical investigations involving greater than minimal  risk  to
subjects develop a data and safety monitoring plan to  assure the safety and welfare of the
research subject/patient.
This is aligned with with NIH requirements and with f ederal regulations that require that IRBs
assure that the research plan makes adequate provision f or monitoring the data collected to
ensure the safety of subjects/patients.
For clinical protocols involving a test article, it is common to have an independent Data
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
Please read the applicable HRP webpage  for further guidance.
Does this protocol require a Safety Monitoring Plan ?
YesFor secondary outcomes, ANCOVA will be applied and post hoc  pairwise comparisons will be
performed if a significant group difference was obse rved and multiple comparison adjustment
will be performed.  If the data is found to be violated with parametric assumption, appropriate
non-parametric method will be applied.

Package Insert rather than pasting or transcribing t he relevant information in the following
agent information questions.
REQUIRED!  Submit the Investigator Brochure or Package Insert in  the Attachments
section.
Specify the p roduct description:
Ketorolac (Toradol) is a non-steroidal anti-in �ammatory drug used as an
analgesic for short-term management of moderate to severe pain.
Specify the clinical pharmacology:
Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-in �ammatory drug (NSAID)
that exhibits analgesic activity in animal models. The mechanism of
action of ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely
understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.
The biological activity of ketorolac tromethamine is associated with the
S-form. Ketorolac tromethamine possesses no sedative or anxiolytic
properties. Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and [+]R-
enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having analgesic activity.
Specify the i ndications for use:
Ketorolac is used for short-term management (up to 5 days) of
moderately severe acute pain that otherwise would require narcotics. It
most often is used after surgery.
Specify the dosage and guidelines for administratio n
(Optional ):
Treatment should be started with ketorolac injection. Tablets are used
only if treatment is continued after patients begin to eat and drink. The
total duration of therapy should not exceed 5 days because of the
potential for gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects. The
recommended adult intravenous single dose is 15 to 60 mg. Multiple
intravenous doses of 15 or 30 mg every 6 hours, not to exceed 60 or 120
mg a day, also may be used. Following intravenous therapy, the
recommended dose is one or two tablets initially followed by 1 tablet
every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 40 mg daily. The smaller dose is used for
patients with poor kidney function or those older than 65 years.
Specify the dosage and administration in this invest igation
(if different from approved):
N/A
Specify the toxicity and known side effects:
Common side effects from ketorolac include rash, ringing in the ears,
headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea,
constipation, heartburn, and �uid retention. NSAIDs reduce the ability of
blood to clot and therefore increase bleeding after an injury. Ketorolac
may cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and intestines, particularly
with use for more than �ve days.
Specify the precautions and contraindications:
Do not take if allergic to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-in �ammatory
drugs-NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib); or if you have any
other allergies. tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history,
especially of: asthma (including a history of worsening breathing after
taking aspirin or other NSAIDs), bleeding or clotting problems, blood
disorders (such as anemia), heart disease (such as previous heart
attack), high blood pressure, liver disease, growths in the nose (nasal
polyps), throat/stomach/intestinal problems (such as bleeding,
heartburn, ulcers), stroke, swelling of the ankles/feet/hands. This
medication may infrequently make you more sensitive to the sun. Avoid
prolonged sun exposure, tanning booths, and sunlamps. Use a sunscreen
and wear protective clothing when outdoors. Older adults may be more
sensitive to the effects of the drug, especially bleeding in the stomach/
intestines or kidney problems. Using high doses for a long time may
increase this risk. Before using this medication, women of childbearing
age should talk with their doctor(s) about the bene �ts and risks (such as
miscarriage). Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you plan to become
pregnant.

Specify the p roduct description:
Naropin (ropivacaine) is used as a long-acting local anesthetic for
surgical anesthesia and acute pain management.
Specify the clinical pharmacology:
: Ropivacaine is a member of the amino amide class of local anesthetics
and is supplied as the pure S-(-)-enantiomer. Local anesthetics block the
generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by
increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing
the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of
the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to
the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve
�bers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain,
(2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle
tone.
Specify the i ndications for use:
surgical anesthesia, epidural block for surgery, major nerve block, local
in�ltration, acute pain management, and epidural continuous infusion or
intermittent bolus (postoperative or labor).

Risk Assessment
Risks and Discomforts
1. Describe and assess any reasonably foreseeable r isks and
discomforts associated with each procedure for each  subject
population — physical, psychological, social, legal or other.
2. If this study will involve the collection of iden tifiable private
information, even temporarily, for which the disclos ure of the
data outside of the research could reasonably place  the
subjects at risk, include the risk of a potential b reach of
confidentiality.
A bullet point list is recommended.
EXPEDITED/FULL COMMITTEE ONL Y:  Include an assessment of their expected frequency
(e.g., common – 65%, less common – 40%, unlikely – 5 %, rare - <1%) and the seriousness
(mild, moderate, severe).RISK ASSESMENT
a) The main intervention of this study is a peripher al nerve block.  The most common
complication of nerve blocks are:
 
1.Vascular injury or hematoma: Inadvertent puncture of adjacent vascular structures can lead
to perineural hematoma and is more likely to occur in patients who are anticoagulated. The
majority of vascular punctures resolve with direct pressure to the block injection site.
2. Infection. Infection risk for single shot peripheral nerve block is negligible.
3.Nerve injury. Neurologic injuries after single shot peripheral nerve blocks are uncommon
with rates reported on the order of 1 in 10,000 blocks to 0.9 in 1000 blocks.
4.Allergic reaction to local anesthetic. Uncertain incidence.
5.Intravascular injection. Inadvertent intravascular injection of local anesthetic may lead to
local anesthetic toxicity depending upon the volume injected or injection into an adjacent
vessel.
 
b) There is a chance of breach of confidentiality. Th ere will be a unique code assigned to each
participating patient and only necessary informatio n for pain assessment will be obtained. Only
the lead investigator and approved UCIMC study team mem bers will have access to identifiable
information for organization purposes only. All data  will be de-identified before any statistical
tests and/or publications.
 
The potential benefits of receiving the nerve block a re improved pain control and ambulation
during the first 24 hours following surgery.
Discuss what steps have been taken and/or will be ta ken to
prevent and minimize any risks/potential discomforts  to
subjects:
Con�dentiality Certi �cates
Specify whether a confidentiality certificate been issued
for the study:
No
Potential Bene �ts
Is there the prospect of a direct benefit anticipat ed for
subjects?
YesThe steps taken to prevent and minimize any risks/potenti al discomforts to eligible subjects in all
experimental groups include routine monitoring applie d before, during, and after the
administration of the nerve block. Ultrasound guidan ce will be utilized for the adductor canal
block, aiding in the avoidance of critical structures such as blood vessels. The nerve block
technique will be standardized and limited to the thre e listed co-researching anesthesiologists
with expertise in performing the nerve block. All pa rticipating patients in each of the
experimental groups of the present study will be rand omized to receive at least one intervention
to reduce pain in the postoperative period. All patien ts will be either given sedation or be under
anesthesia when the interventions are performed as th is is the standard of care protocol when
performing a peripheral nerve block. Throughout the s tudy, a periodic review of the data will be
performed to assess whether or not there any large ch anges in postoperative pain scores and to
evaluate if a protocol revision is required.
 
Screening records will be destroyed for patients that are not enrolled and subject identifiable
data will be protected for the subjects enrolled in the study.
Describe the potential benefits subjects may expect  to
receive from participation in this study:
The potential bene �ts of receiving the nerve block are improved pain
control and ambulation during the �rst 24 hours following surgery.
Specify the expected potential societal/scientific
benefit(s) of this study:
Potential societal/scienti �c bene �ts from the present study would
include improved pain control and ambulation during the �rst 24 hours
following surgery for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients.

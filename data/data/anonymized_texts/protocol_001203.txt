Name of Test Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP):  Fremanezumab  
EudraVigilance (EV) code for the IMP, if applicable:  SUB181665  
Type of the Study:  Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability Study (Phase  3) 
Indication:  Preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age)  
Is this study conducted to investigate the New Use of an approved, marketed product?  Yes 
Number of Inves tigational Centers Planned:  Approximately 85  
Countries Planned:  6 to 10 countries  
Planned Study Period: Quarter (Q)1 2020 to Q2 2024  
Number of Patients Planned (total):  Approximately 230 randomized  episodic migraine (EM) 
patients.  
Study Population: Female and male patients aged 6 to 17 years (inclusive) with a diagnosis of 
migraine for at least 6  months before screening, consistent with  the International Classification 
of Headache Disorders, 3rd revision (ICHD -3) criteria ( Headache Classification Committee of the 
IHS 2013 ), and a history of ≤14  migraine days per month in each of the 3  months prior to 
screening,  prospectively confirmed by review of headache data recorded  daily in an electronic 
headache diary device during a 28 -day baseline period.  
Because headache consortium guidelines recommend preventive therapies for patients with EM 
occurring on 4 or more days per month due to the frequency of headaches and high degre e of 
disability, approximately 30% of EM patients using no more than 2 migraine preventive 
medications for any condition at the time of study enrollment will be allowed to remain on the 
medication if the medication has at least moderate evidence of efficac y for migraine ( Silberstein 
et al 2012 ). Patients on concomitant preventive medications must have been on a stable, 
well-tolerated dose for at least 2 months prior to screening (visit 1), without anticipated changes 
during the  study. A list of migraine preventive medications allowed for any condition for the 
duration of the study is presented in  Appendix  C. Randomization w ill be stratified by patients 
with and without preventive medications.

10 Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints  
Objectives  Endpoints  
The primary objective  of the study 
is to evaluate the efficacy of 
fremanezumab as compared to 
placebo for the preve ntive treatment 
of episodic migraine (EM).  The primary efficacy endpoint  is the mean change from baseline 
(28-day baseline period) in the monthly average number of migraine days 
during the 12 -week period after the first dose of study drug.  
A secondary objective  is to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability of 
fremanezumab in the preventive 
treatment of EM.  The safety and tolerability endpoints  are as follows:  
• occurrence of adverse events throughout the study , 
including local injection site reaction/pain  
• abnormal standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
findings  
• changes from baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate), 
height, and weight measurements  
• changes from baseline in clini cal laboratory (serum 
chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) test 
results  
• abnormal physical examination findings  
• suicidal ideation and behavior as suggested by the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
A secondary objective  of the s tudy 
is to further demonstrate the efficacy 
of fremanezumab as compared to 
placebo for the preventive treatment 
of EM.  The secondary efficacy endpoints  are as follows:  
• mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline period) in 
monthly average number of headache  days of at least 
moderate severity during the 12 -week period after the first 
dose of study drug  
• proportion of patients reaching at least 50% reduction in the 
monthly average number of migraine days during the 
12-week period after the first dose of study d rug 
• mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline period) in the 
monthly average number of days of use of any acute 
headache medications during the 12 -week period after the 
first dose of study drug  
• mean change from baseline (day 1) in migraine -related 
disabil ity score, as measured by the Pediatric Migraine 
Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) questionnaire, at 
12 weeks after administration of the first dose of study drug  
• mean change from baseline (day 1) in quality of life, as 
measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory

General Study Design:  This is a 4 -month, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
2 different doses (dependent on patients’ body weight) of subcutaneous (sc) fremanezumab and 
placebo. Enrollment will include male and female patients (6 to 17  years of age, inclusive).  
An interim analysis with blinded sample size re -estimation will be conducted by evaluating the 
pooled variability (standard deviation [SD]) of the primary endpoint using the total number of 
patients regardless of the treatment assignment once 50% (±10%) of patients have completed at 
least 3  months of treatment or have withdrawn from the study early.  
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio between fremanezumab and placebo treatment 
groups:  
• monthly sc administration of fremanezumab  
• monthly sc administration of matching placebo  
The dose of fremanezumab to be administered will be determined by the patient’s weight at 
randomization (visit  2): 
• Patients weighing ≥45.0  kg will receive monthly sc administration of fremanezumab 
at 225  mg. 
• Patients weighing <45.0  kg will receive monthly sc administration of fremanezumab 
at 120  mg. 
The enrollment target  is approximately 230 EM patients, with a goal of approximately 20% of 
those patients in the 6 - through 11 -year-old age group.  
The study consists of a screening visit, a 28 -day baseline period, and a 12 -week (84 -day) 
treatment period, including a final eva luation at week 12 (end -of-treatment [EOT] visit, 
approximately 4 weeks [28 days] after the final dose of study drug).  
Blinded treatment will be administered sc once monthly (approximately every 28 days) for a 
total of 3 doses. Randomization and first trea tment administration will occur at visit 2 (day 1), 
and additional doses will be administered at visits 3 and 4 (approximately every 28 days) until 
the third dose is completed. Final study assessments will be performed at visit 5 (EOT visit), 
approximately  28 days after the third (last) dose of study drug. Overall, patients will participate 
in the current study for up to 4 months ( including a 28 -day baseline period and a 12 -week, 
double -blind treatment period ).

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
13 Approximately 30% of EM patients will be allo wed to remain on no more than 2 migraine 
preventive medications for any condition, provided the medication is recognized to have at least 
moderate evidence of efficacy or is commonly used. Additional details on concomitant 
medication information are provid ed in Appendix  C. Patients must have been on a stable, 
well-tolerated dose of this preventive medication for at least 2  months prior to screening (visit 1) 
and would be expected to remain on this medication fo r the duration of the study. For the 
remaining approximately 70% of EM patients, these medications are not allowed for migraine or 
for any other indications. As -needed (PRN) use of these medications are allowed during the 
course of the study. PRN use of th ese medications should be reported in the electronic case 
report form as concomitant medications. Patients should be trained and should not report PRN 
use of these medications in the electronic headache diary. PRN use is defined as any treatment 
regimen ou tside of the prescribing information or local treatment guidelines.  
Patients will be allowed to use acute medications to treat acute migraine attacks, as needed, with 
the exception of medications containing opioids and barbiturates.  
Upon completion of the  final study assessments, all eligible patients will be offered enrollment in 
a long -term safety and tolerability study (Study TV48125 -CNS -30084), consisting of 9  months 
(36 weeks) of open -label treatment and 5 months of follow -up commencing from the last study 
drug administration. In the long -term safety extension study, patients rolling over from the 
current study will be weighed at visit  2 and will receive monthly fremanezumab with dose 
adjusted per weight category (225 mg in patients ≥45.0 kg or 120  mg in patients <45.0  kg). 
Patients who do not complete this study and patients who complete this study but do not wish to 
continue treatment may enroll in Study TV48125 -CNS -30084 for the purpose of attending a 
follow -up visit for safety and ADA assessments ap proximately 5  months (150 days 
[5 half-lives]) after receiving the last dose of study drug.  
Study procedures and assessments with their time points are shown in Table  1. The study 
schematic diagram is shown in Figure  1. 
In the case that a patient is not able to go to the investigational center or the in vestigational 
center staff are not able to see patients at the investigational center, certain 
assessments/procedures, as detailed in  Table  1, may be p erformed remotely.  
Brief Summary of Study Design for the Trial Registry(s):  
Method of Randomization and Blinding: The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for 
staff involved in bioanalytical analyses), and patients will be blinded to treatment assig nment. A 
computer -generated master randomization list will be provided to drug packaging facilities. 
Packaging vendor(s) will package active and placebo into single -visit kits according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice procedures. The active drug and placebo  kits for each dose will be 
identical in appearance and will contain 1 pre -filled syringe (PFS) (for the 225  mg dose and its 
matching placebo) or 2 vials (for the 120  mg dose and its matching placebo). Adequate kit 
supply for upcoming study visits will be managed by interactive response technology (IRT) and 
kept (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C) on site.  
This is a randomized study. Randomization will be stratified by country, sex, puberty status 
(Tanner staging scale, see Section  7.5), and preventive medication use at baseline (Yes/No). 
Each patient will undergo randomization in a 1:1 ratio within the stratum to which he or she 
belongs to receive fremanezumab or placebo, as assigned by the IRT. The IRT will manage

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
14 initial drug supply,  maintenance of adequate study drug supplies on site, and study 
randomization centrally. At the time of each study visit, the IRT will be queried, and site 
personnel will retrieve and administer a 1.5  mL volume for patients weighing ≥45.0  kg at 
randomizati on (visit  2) or a 0.8  mL volume for patients weighing <45.0  kg at randomization 
(visit  2) from each PFS or 2 vials contained in the appropriately numbered kit(s).  
Investigational Medicinal Products: Dose, Pharmaceutical Form, Route of Administration, 
and A dministration Rate:  Pre-filled syringes or single -use vials (active or placebo) will be 
contained in uniquely numbered kits and stored (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C) on site. Active 
PFS/vials will contain 150 mg/mL of fremanezumab, and placebo PFS/vials will  contain the 
same vehicle and excipients as those for active injections. Each kit will contain 1  PFS (1.5  mL) 
or 2 single -use vials (2  mL vials each containing 0.5 mL).  
Study drug will be administered by qualified study personnel as sc injections approxim ately 
every 4 weeks (28 days) for a total of 3 doses, as follows:  
• Patients with body weight ≥45.0  kg at randomization (visit  2) who are randomized to 
receive fremanezumab will receive 225  mg of fremanezumab as 1  active injection 
(225 mg/1.5  mL) at visits 2, 3, and 4.  
• Patients with body weight ≥45.0  kg at randomization (visit  2) who are randomized to 
receive placebo will receive a single 1.5 mL placebo injection at visits 2, 3, and 4.  
• Patients with body weight <45.0  kg at randomization (visit  2) who are r andomized to 
receive fremanezumab will receive 120  mg of fremanezumab as 1  active injection 
(120 mg/0.8  mL) at visits 2, 3, and 4.  
• Patients with body weight <45.0  kg at randomization (visit  2) who are randomized to 
receive placebo will receive a single 0. 8 mL placebo injection at visits 2, 3, and 4.  
Fremanezumab is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. The recommended 
sc injection sites follow the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center Patient Education 
Materials ( NIH Clinical Center Patient Education Materials 2016 ). The suggested injection site 
locations for sc administration are the following: back of upper arms, lower 
abdomen/belly/waistline, and front of thig hs. The sc injection and location will be recorded for 
each administration visit (visits  2, 3, and 4).  
A 1.5  mL volume (patients weighing ≥45.0  kg at randomization [visit 2]) or 0.8  mL (patients 
weighing <45.0  kg at randomization [visit 2]) from each visi t kit(s) (the full dose given with a 
PFS or taken from the vials) must be injected sc for administration to be considered complete. 
Patients randomized to the placebo group will receive volume -matched doses of placebo.

Statistical Considerations  
Samp le Size Rationale:  The sample size planned is approximately 220 patients (110 evaluable 
patients completing the study per treatment group). Assuming a treatment difference of 1.8 days 
(reduction in monthly average number of migraine days) and a common SD o f 4.31, a sample 
size of 110 patients per treatment group gives at least 87% power for the study to succeed at an 
alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a 4% discontinuation rate, approximately 230 patients 
(115 patients per treatment group)  will be randomized . Patients will be randomized to receive 
either monthly sc administration of fremanezumab or placebo.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
20 Analysis Sets  
Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set:  The intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized 
patients.  
In the ITT analysis set, treatment wil l be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were 
randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually received.  
Safety Analysis Set:  The safety analysis set will include all randomized who receive at least 1 
dose of IMP.  
In the safety analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment patients actually 
received, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized.  
Full Analysis Set:  The full analysis set will include all patients in the ITT population who 
receive at l east 1  dose of study drug and have at least 10 days of diary entries postbaseline for 
efficacy assessments on the primary endpoint . 
Per-Protocol Analysis Set:  The per -protocol analysis set will consist of all patients in the Full 
Analysis Set  who have comp leted the study without any important deviations such as, important 
inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations, important deviation or omissions of the IMP 
administration, or unexpected drug concentration findings, and who have at least 75% diary 
compliance a fter the start of treatment.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline 
(28-day baseline period) in the monthly average number of migraine days during the 12 -week 
period after the first dose of study drug, wi ll be analyzed using an analysis of covariance method. 
The model will include treatment, sex, puberty status, region, baseline weight category (<45.0  kg 
or ≥45.0 kg) , and preventive medication use at baseline (Yes/No) as fixed effects and baseline 
number o f migraine days as a covariate. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be 
constructed for the least squares mean differences between the fremanezumab group and the 
placebo group. An interim analysis with blinded sample size re -estimation will be con ducted by 
evaluating the pooled variability (SD) of the primary endpoint using the total number of patients 
regardless of the treatment assignment once 50% (±10%) of patients have completed at least 3 
months of treatment or have withdrawn from the study ea rly. For the purpose of this study, a 
migraine day will be defined as a calendar day where the patient reports either of the following:  
• headache pain that lasts ≥2 hours and is accompanied by ≥1 migraine symptom(s)  
• the patient used acute migraine -specific  medication (triptans or ergots) to treat a 
headache of any severity or duration  
The detailed algorithm for deriving migraine days will be described in the statistical analysis 
plan.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: The same analysis used for the primary efficacy endpoint 
will be performed for the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints. For the proportion of 
responders, defined as at least 50% reduction from baseline in the monthly average number of 
migraine days, a logistic regression model will be used with the following factors: treatment, sex, 
region, puberty status, baseline weight category (<45.0 kg or ≥45.0 kg), and preventive 
medication use at baseline (Yes/No). The odds ratio, 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, 
and p -value for the treatme nt comparison will be presented.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
21 Sensitivity Analysis: A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted 
by using multiple imputation method for missing data. Sensitivity analysis using Mixed -Effect 
Model Repeated Measure  method al so will be conducted for change from baseline to months 1 
through 3 in migraine days. The details will be described in the statistical analysis plan . 
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity:  A fixed -sequence (hierarchical) testing procedure will 
be implemented to control the Type 1 error rate at 0.05. The sequence of comparisons will start 
with the analysis of the primary endpoint and will follow with the secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Analysi s of Exploratory Endpoints:   
 
Safety Analyses: Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set.  
Safety assessments and time points are provided in Table  1. 
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDR A). Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class 
category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall 
and by severity), adverse events determined by the investigator to be r elated to test IMP  (and/or 
PFS) (ie, reasonable possibility) (defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and by 
severity), serious adverse events , serious adverse device effects, protocol -defined adverse events 
of special interest , and adver se events and adverse device effects causing withdrawal from the 
study. Summaries will be presented by treatment group and for all patients. Patient listings of 
serious adverse events , serious adverse device effects , adverse events , and adverse device effe cts 
leading to withdrawal will be presented.  
Changes in laboratory, ECG, and vital signs measurements data will be summarized 
descriptively. All values will be compared with predefined criteria to identify potentially 
clinically significant values or chang es, and such values will be listed.  
Suicidal ideation and behavior will be measured using the C -SSRS. Data for patients with 
positive findings will be listed.  
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive 
statistics. Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated 
with study drug.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided for actual values and changes fro m baseline to each time point. For categorical 
variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of serious 
adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and potentially clinically significant 
abnormal values (c linical laboratory or vital signs) based on predefined criteria will be provided 
as well.  
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the cli nical study report.  
Assessment of Local Tolerability and Pain and Tolerability Analysis: Assessment of 
injection site will be performed after administration of each dose of study drug, before the patient

22 leaves the investigational site. Injection site reac tions will be recorded as adverse events 
according to the following severity assessment criteria:  
• Assessment of injection site erythema, induration, and ecchymosis will be recorded 
after administration of each dose of study drug according to measurements: 5 to ≤50 
mm (mild), >50 to ≤100 mm (moderate), and >100 mm (severe).  
• Injection site pain will be recorded using the 11 -point numerical rating scale and will 
be mapped to  mild, moderate, or severe, according to patient’s self -report of pain 
intensity.  
• Appropriate treatment may be provided if necessary, in which case it must be 
recorded as concomitant m edication.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration results (fremanezumab) will 
be tabulated descriptively at each planned sampling time point by weight cutoff.  
In addition, the most appropriate population pharmacokinetic model will b e developed. This 
analysis will be reported separately, as appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis: The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
relationship may be estimated by compartmental techniques. The pharmacokinetic parameters 
will be based on  fremanezumab measurements. The pharmacodynamic measures will be the 
efficacy/safety responses.  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship may be estimated using the most 
appropriate model after comparing different candidate models for their quality  of fit. If 
performed, this analysis will be reported separately.  
Immunogenicity Analysis:  
Summary of immunogenicity results will be provided, and the incidence of immunogenicity will 
be calculated. The impact of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetic profile, drug efficacy, and 
clinical safety will be evaluated if data allows. This analysis will be reported separately.  
Planned Interim Analysis:  
An interim analysis with blinded sample size re -estimation will be conducted by evaluating th e 
pooled variability (SD) of the primary endpoint using the total number of patients regardless of 
the treatment assignment once 50% (±10%) of patients have completed at least 3 months of 
treatment or have withdrawn from the study early.

33 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION   
1.1. Introduction   
Fremanezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) Δa/kappa  monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) derived from a murine precursor. In September 2018, fremanezumab was approved in the 
United States of America (US) for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults and marketed 
under the trade name AJOVY®. Fremanezumab has also been approved in the European Union 
(EU) and a number of countries worldwide. Fremanezumab is a potent, selective c alcitonin 
gene -related peptide (CGRP) binder and blocks both CGRP isoforms (α - and β -CGRP) from 
binding to the CGRP receptor. While the precise mechanism of action by which fremanezumab 
prevents migraine is unknown, it is believed that blocking CGRP preven ts activation of the 
trigeminal system. Fremanezumab is highly specific for CGRP and does not bind to closely 
related family members (eg, amylin, calcitonin, intermedin, and adrenomedullin). Two mutations 
were introduced into the constant region of the fre manezumab heavy chain to limit antibody 
effector functions. This loss of function prevents fremanezumab from stimulating 
antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity and triggering complement -mediated lysis; these 
activities can lead to unwanted consequen ces, such as cell lysis, opsonization, and cytokine 
release and inflammation ( Armour et al 1999 , Zeller et al 2008 ).  
The safety and tolerab ility of fremanezumab (intravenous [ iv] doses of 0.2 to 2000 mg and 
subcutaneous [sc]  doses of 225 to 900 mg) as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of 225 to 
900 mg sc and iv have been well characterized in the Phase 1 development program in adults.  
Furth ermore, the safety and effectiveness of fremanezumab have been demonstrated in 2 
Phase  2b studies and 3 Phase 3 studies in adult patients with migraine. The 2 Phase 2b studies 
were  a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2b study of 2 sc dosing regimens of 
fremanezumab (monthly fremanezumab at 900 mg or fremanezumab at 675 mg followed by 
monthly fremanezumab at 225  mg) in patients with chronic migraine (CM) and a randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlle d Phase  2b study of 2 sc dosing regimens of fremanezumab 
(monthly fremanezumab at 675 or 225 mg) in patients with episodic migraine (EM).  
Two completed, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 studies (Studies 
TV48125 -CNS -30049 in CM and TV481 25-CNS -30050 in EM) and 1 completed, randomized, 
double -blind Phase 3 long -term safety study (Study TV48125 -CNS -30051 in migraine [EM and 
CM]) were conducted to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of various dose 
regimens of fremanezuma b in the preventive treatment of migraine. Additional studies within the 
migraine development program of fremanezumab include the completed Phase 3b study (Study 
TV48125 -CNS -30068) in patients from the EU and US to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
frema nezumab in migraine patients who have failed multiple preventive medications, 2 ongoing 
Phase 2b/3 studies in Japanese and Korean EM and CM patients (Studies 406 -102-00002 and 
406-102-00001, respectively), and 1 ongoing long -term safety study (Study 406 -102-00003) in 
CM and EM to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fremanezumab. One Phase 4 study (Study 
TV48125 -MH-40142) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fremanezumab in 
adult patients with migraine and comorbid major depressive disorder.

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
34 The pediatric migraine development program includes a completed Phase 1, single -dose, 
open -label study with administration of single sc doses of 75 mg in pediatric migraine patients 6 
to 11 years of age, inclusive (Study TV48125 -CNS -10141).  
Fremanezumab is  further studied for the preventive treatment of persistent posttraumatic 
headache  (PPTH) in 1 Phase 2 study (Study TV48125 -CNS -20024) that is comparing the 
efficacy and safety of the sc dose regimen of fremanezumab versus placebo in patients with 
PPTH. Fr emanezumab was being studied for the preventive treatment of cluster headache (CH) 
in 3 Phase 3 studies: Study  TV48125 -CNS -30056 in patients with episodic CH, Study TV48125 -
CNS -30057 in patients with chronic CH,  and a long -term safety Study  TV48125 -CNS -30058 in 
CH. All 3 studies were terminated by Teva because a prespecified futility analysis showed that 
the primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of CH 
attacks during the 12 -week treatment period was unlikely to be met.  
Migraine is a prevalent condition characterized by attacks of headache and associated symptoms 
(such as nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia). Among populations of children of all ages, 
migraine prevalence ranges from 8% to 11% ( Abu-Arefeh and Russell 1994 , Abu-Arafeh et al 
2010 , Laurell et al 2004 , Ozge et al 2013 , Stovner and Andree 2010 ). The prevalence of migraine 
is substantially lower among children younger than 7  years, ranging from 1% to 3% ( Lewis 
2009 ). The prevalence of migraine in children younger than 12 years is less than one -third of the 
prevalence among adolescents ( Fendrich et al 2007 , Ozge et al 2013 , Stovner and Andree 2010 , 
Unalp et al 2007 ). Therefore, the prevalence of migraine increases throughout childhood, with 
estimates for adolescents comparable to the 12% to 15% prevalence estimates cited for adult 
populations ( Buse et al 2013 , Burch et al 2015 , Stovner and Andree 2010 , Victor et al 2010 ). 
Migraine has been classified by headache frequency in the International Classification of 
Headache Disorders, 3rd revision (ICHD -3) and is described as EM, which is defined as 
headaches occurring on less than 15 days per  month, and CM, which is defined as headaches on 
at least 15 days per month for at least 3  months, with the features of migraine on at least 8 days 
per month ( Headache Classification Committee of th e IHS 2013 , Lipton and Silberstein 2015 ).  
Treatment options for migraine include non -pharmacological biobehavioral strategies and 
pharmacological strategies. Topiramate is the only migraine prevent ive medication approved for 
pediatric populations, but it is not approved in all regions of the EU and is limited to adolescents 
ages 12 through 17. Non -pharmacological strategies for adults and children with migraine 
include sleep hygiene, exercise, dieta ry modifications, biofeedback, and stress management 
(O’Brien et al 2012 , Silberstein 2000 ). Pharmacologic agents used for the treatment of migraine 
can be classified as acute (ie, to alleviate the acute migraine attack) or prophylactic (ie, 
preventing headache recurrence). Preventive therapy is indicated for all individuals with CM and 
for those with EM that have high frequency of attacks ( Lipton and Silberstein 2015 ). If given 
during CM, prophylactic treatments could revert the patients to EM and continue to provide 
benefit after remission is achieved ( Manack et al 2011 ). Most specialists require that a child 
experience a minimum of 1 headache per week or 3 to 4 headaches per month to justify 
prophylactic medication. Children who report intensive and prolonged headaches (lasting more 
than 48 hours), even if infrequent, may also be offered prophylactic therapy ( Kacperski 2015 ). It 
is recommended that an adequate trial of at least 6 to 8 weeks should be sustained bef ore 
abandoning a treatment ( Kacperski 2015 ).

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
35 Overall, authorized medications for the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine in children 
and medications that are being used off -label in children have limited evidence to support their 
use, require ongoing patient monitoring, or are associated with undesirable or intolerable adverse 
effects ( Barnes 2015 , Kacperski 2015 ). Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a safe and 
effective prophylactic treatment for EM and CM in the pediatric population.  
The purpose of the study is to determine whether fremanezumab is safe and eff ective in the 
preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients with EM.  
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies   
Brief summaries of nonclinical pharmacokinetics and t oxicology studies and clinical studies are 
provided in the following sections. More detailed information is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
1.2.1.  Nonclinical Studies   
The safety of fremanezumab was established in repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats for the 
duration of 3 months and in chronic toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys for the duration of 
6 months. Both the iv and sc routes were tested with dose administration o nce every week. 
Reproduction toxicity studies consisting of fertility and early embryonic development in rats, 
embryo -fetal development in rats and in rabbits, and pre - and postnatal development in rats were 
conducted. In support of the pediatric clinical program, juvenile toxicity studies in rats were 
conducted.  
The pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab were consistent with a typical humanized IgG2 
molecule with a low plasma clearance, low steady state volume of distribution, and a long 
elimination half -life in both rats and monkeys.  
 
 
 
 
Fremanezumab was administered to rats and monkeys by the iv or sc route for up to 3 months in 
duration and by sc route in the 6 -month chronic toxicity study in monkeys.  
 
 
 
 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were also included in the general toxicology studies, in addition 
to the stand -alone safety pharmacology studies (cardiovascular in monkeys and respiratory and 
central n ervous system in rats).  
 
  
In an  embryo -fetal development study in rabbits, sc injection of dosing fremanezumab to 
pregnant rabbits was well tolerated and did not induce any maternal toxicity at any dose level. 
No evidence of embryo -fetal toxicity was noted in any dose group. In addition , in a combined 
fertility and embryo -fetal development study in rats, no treatment -related effects were noted on 
VV-00040232 v20.0

36 estrus cycle, mating behavior, reproductive performance, or on embryo -fetal survival and 
development in any of the experimental animals’ tested  dose levels. Additionally, no treatment 
related findings were noted in a pre - and postnatal development study in rats.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, no toxicological concerns were identified, and the program is considered supportive for 
repeated (monthly) administration of fremanezumab in pediatric subjects.  
Further details may be fou nd in the current  IB.  
1.2.2.  Clinical Studies   
Overall in the fremanezumab migraine clinical development program, 2853 patients with 
migraine and 474 healthy subjects have received at l east 1 dose of fremanezumab in the 
completed clinical studies. In addition, 142 and 380 patients in the 3 CH Phase 3 blinded studies 
(TV48125 -CNS -30056, TV48125 -CNS -30057, and TV48125 -CNS -30058) were treated with 
placebo and fremanezumab, respectively.  
The adult migraine clinical development program is composed of 15 studies with healthy 
subjects and patients with migraine (EM and CM): 9 Phase 1 studies, 2 Phase 2b studies (double -
blind, placebo -controlled), 3 Phase 3 studies (2 double -blind, placebo -controlled studies and 1 
long-term, double -blind safety study [Study TV48125 -CNS -30051], and 1 Phase 4 study). All 
studies have been completed .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Six studies in  adult migraine patients (2 Phase 2b studies, 3 Phase 3 studies, and 1 Phase 4 study) 
examining the safety and efficacy of fremanezumab have been completed. The Phase 2b CM 
study (Study  LBR -101-021) was a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , 
placebo -controlled, parallel -group study comparing 3 sc monthly doses of fremanezumab

1.2.2.1.  Clinical Pharmacology Studies   
Two relevant clinical pharmacology studies have been completed: a Phase 1 bioequivalence 
study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 225  mg of fremanezumab administered sc using an 
autoinjector referenced to a PFS (TV48125 -BE-10145) in healthy adult subjects, and a Phase 1, 
single -dose, open -label study with administration of single sc doses of  in pediatric 
migraine patients 6 to 11 years of age, inclusive (Study TV48125 -CNS -10141).  
1.2.2.2.  Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies   
The safety and tolerability of fremanezumab have  been studied in all of the studies in the adult 
migraine clinical development program (ie, 9 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, 2 Phase 2b 
studies, and 3  Phase 3 studies in patients with migraine. Additional studies are the Phase 3b 
FOCUS study [TV48125 -CNS -30068], the Japanese [Otsuka] registration studies, and the Phase 
4 UNITE study [TV48125 -MH-40142]). Safety results from these studies are presented in the 
IB. 
Based on the safety results of the completed studies, the safety profile was assessed to in clude 
the following events as identified risks qualifying as adverse drug reactions: injection site 
induration, injection site erythema, injection site pruritus, injection site rash, and injection site 
pain. None of the identified risks was serious or cons idered as an important risk . 
No clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs measurements, or 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings have been observed in any of the studies to date.  
1.3. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks to Patients   
1.3.1.  Known and Potential Benefits and Risks of the Test Investigational Medicinal 
Product(s)  and/or Device   
1.3.1.1.  Identified Risks   
The identified risks of fremanezumab are the following:  
• Injection site induration  
• Injection site erythema  
• Injection site pruritus  
• Injection site rash  
VV-00040232 v20.0

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
38 • Injection site pain  
None of these risks impact the benefit -risk profile.  
1.3.1.2.  Important Potential Risk   
Mild and moderate drug hypersensitivity events were observed infrequently and with similar 
incidence in placebo and fremanezumab in the clinical development program, but no anaphylaxis 
or severe hypersensitivity reactions were seen. However, it cannot be excluded that severe events 
may occur in the future. For addit ional details, refer to the IB.  
Based on the available efficacy and safety data for fremanezumab, the benefit -risk profile is 
favorable.

2.1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints   
The primary and secondary study objectives and endpoints are as follo ws: 
Objectives  Endpoints  
The primary objective  of the study is to 
evaluate the efficacy of fremanezumab as 
compared to placebo for the preventive 
treatment of episodic migraine (EM).  The primary efficacy endpoint  is the mean change from 
baseline (28 -day baseline period) in the monthly average 
number of migraine days during the 12 -week period after the 
first dose of study drug.  
A secondary objective  is to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of fremanezumab in the 
preventive treatment of EM.  The secondary safety and tolerability endpoints  are as 
follows:  
• occurrence of adverse events throughout the 
study , including local injection site reaction/pain  
• abnormal standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) findings  
• changes from baseline in vital signs (systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and 
respiratory rate), height, and weight measurements  
• changes from baseline in clinical laboratory 
(serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and 
urinalysis) test results  
• abnormal physical examination findings  
• suicidal ideation and behavior a s suggested by the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS)  
A secondary objective  of the study is to 
further demonstrate the efficacy of 
fremanezumab as compared to placebo for the 
preventive treatment of EM.  The secondary efficacy endpoints  are as  follows:  
• mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline 
period) in monthly average number of headache 
days of at least moderate severity during the 
12-week period after the first dose of study drug  
• proportion of patients reaching at least 50% 
reduction in the  monthly average number of 
migraine days during the 12 -week period after the 
first dose of study drug  
• mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline 
period) in the monthly average number of days of 
use of any acute headache medications during the 
12-week perio d after the first dose of study drug  
• mean change from baseline (day 1) in migraine -
related disability score, as measured by the

• mean change from baseline (day 1) in quality of 
life, as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory (PedsQL), at 12 weeks after 
administration of the first dose of study drug  
A secondary objective  of the study is to 
evaluate the immunogenicity of 
fremanezumab and the impact of antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs) on clinical outcomes in 
patients exposed to fremanezumab.  • proportion of patients developing ADAs 
throughout the study. The impact of ADAs on 
safety  and efficacy will be analyzed if the number 
of ADA -positive patients allows.  
2.1.1.  Justification of Primary Endpoint   
This design is consistent with the recommendations of the Interna tional Headache Society (IHS) 
for controlled trials of preventive drugs in migraine ( Tfelt -Hansen et al 2012 ). 
By definition, the IHS diagnostic criteria for EM include patients who suffer 6 to 14 headache 
days per month and/or treat the headache with an acute migraine -specific medication. Headache 
and migraine days are defined differently in the protocol. For the inclusion criteria, the minimal 
requirement for migraine days during a 28 -day baseline  period is 4. This requirement is 
consistent with migraine preventive treatment guidelines and also with the Teva adult EM study 
inclusion criteria.  
As per the guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment of EM of the IHS, Teva 
considers that t he most appropriate primary endpoint to capture is the change from baseline on 
the monthly average number of migraine days. Pain is a very subjective experience, and its 
perception changes among patients. Therefore, it is most important to capture the indi vidual 
manifestation and perception of migraine in every patient examined. Patients will subjectively 
rate their headaches as mild, moderate, or severe and record this information using the electronic 
headache diary device. This endpoint (decrease from bas eline on the monthly average number of 
migraine days) is a classical endpoint used in most prior studies of EM, and it is recommended 
by the IHS ( Tfelt -Hansen et al 2012 ). This is the same primary e ndpoint used in the adult 
migraine clinical development program, which showed significant results. Consistent with past 
trials in EM and the recommendation of the IHS, migraine day or probable migraine day requires 
meeting the ICHD -3 criteria or days treat ed with acute migraine therapies (triptans or ergot 
compounds). Teva will follow these guidelines and recommendations.

42 3. STUDY DESIGN   
3.1. General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram   
This is a 4 -month, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 different doses (dependent on patients’ 
body weight) of sc fremanezumab and placebo. Enrollment will include male and female patients 
(6 to 17  years of  age, inclusive).  
An interim analysis with blinded sample size re -estimation will be conducted by evaluating the 
pooled variability (standard deviation [SD]) of the primary endpoint using the total number of 
patients regardless of the treatment assignment once 50% (±10%) of patients have completed at 
least 3  months of treatment or have withdrawn from the study early.  If the pooled SD is <4.8, 
there will be no change in enrollment; if the pooled SD is >5.2, the sample size will increase to  
approximately  400 patients; and if the pooled SD is between 4.8 and 5.2, the sample size will 
increase to approximately 340 patients total.  
The total duration of the study is planned to be 51  months (from Q1 2020 to Q2  2024).  
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 rati o between fremanezumab and placebo treatment 
groups:  
• monthly sc administration of fremanezumab  
• monthly sc administration of matching placebo  
The dose of fremanezumab to be administered will be determined by the patient’s weight at 
randomization (visit  2): 
• Patients weighing ≥45.0  kg will receive monthly sc administration of fremanezumab 
at 225 mg.  
• Patients weighing <45.0  kg will receive monthly sc administration of fremanezumab 
at 120 mg.  
The enrollment target is approximately 230 EM patients, with a goal o f approximately 20% of 
those patients in the 6 - through 11 -year-old age group.  
The study consists of a screening visit, a 28 -day baseline period, and a 12 -week (84 -day) 
treatment period, including a final evaluation at week 12 (end -of-treatment [EOT] visit , 
approximately 4  weeks [28 days] after the final dose of study drug).  
Blinded treatment will be administered sc once monthly (approximately every 28 days) for a 
total of 3 doses. Randomization and first treatment administration will occur at visit 2 (day 1), 
and additional doses will be administered at visits 3 and 4 (approximately every 28 days) until 
the third dose is completed. Final study assessments will be performed at visit 5 (EOT visit), 
approximately 28 days after the third (last) dose of study dr ug. Overall, patients will participate 
in the current study for up to 4 months (including a 28 -day baseline period and a 12 -week, 
double -blind treatment period).  
Patients will be allowed to use acute medications to treat acute migraine attacks, as needed,  with 
the exception of medications containing opioids and barbiturates.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
43 Upon completion of the final study assessments, all eligible patients will be offered enrollment in 
a long -term safety and tolerability study (Study TV48125 -CNS -30084), consisting of 9 months 
(36 weeks) of open -label treatment and 5 months of follow -up commencing from the last study 
drug administration. In the long -term safety extension study, patients rolling over from the 
current study will be weighed at visit  2 and will receive mont hly fremanezumab with dose 
adjusted every 3 months per weight category (225 mg in patients ≥45.0 kg or 120  mg in patients 
<45.0  kg). Patients who do not complete this study and patients who complete this study but do 
not wish to continue treatment may enro ll in Study TV48125 -CNS -30084 for the purpose of 
attending a follow -up visit for safety and ADA assessments approximately 5  months (150 days 
[5 half -lives]) after receiving the last dose of study drug.  
Study procedures and assessments with their time point s are shown in Table  1. The study 
schematic diagram is shown in Figure  1. 
The end of study is defined as the d ate the last patient attends the EOT/early withdrawal visit

45 3.2. Planned Number of Patients and Countries   
The number of evaluable patients is planned to be approximately 220 (110 evaluable patients 
completing the study per treatment group). Details on definition of evaluable patients and sample 
size are given in Section 9. 
The total number of randomized patients planned is approximately 230.  
The study is planned to be conducted in 6 to 10 countries in approximately 85 investigational 
centers. The study i s expected to start in Q1 2020 and last until Q2 2024.  
3.3. Justification for Study Design and Selection of Population   
A multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, par allel-group design is 
appropriate, given the objectives of this study. This design is consistent with the 
recommendations of the IHS for controlled trials of preventive drugs in migraine ( Tfelt -Hans en 
et al 2012 ). Furthermore, this study is planned and designed in accordance with International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E11 Guidance - Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Pediatric Population, 2017.  
Migraine is a condition that sta rts from childhood or adolescence and progresses into adulthood. 
Among populations of children of all ages, migraine prevalence ranges from 8% to 11% 
(Abu-Arafeh et al 2010 , Abu-Arefeh and Russell 1994 , Laurell et al 2004 , Ozge et al 2013 , 
Stovner and Andree 2010 ). Additionally, there is an unmet need for the treatment of migraine in 
pediatric patients as there are limited therapy options available for this patient population. 
Throughou t Teva’s development program for adults, fremanezumab had demonstrated 
statistically and clinically significant superior efficacy over placebo. It is also well tolerated in 
the adult migraine population. Given the progression of the disease and the knowled ge gained 
from the adult population, it is reasonable and important to evaluate fremanezumab in the 
pediatric population.  
Because headache consortium guidelines recommend preventive therapies for patients with EM 
occurring on 4 or more days per month due t o the frequency of headaches and high degree of 
disability, patients using no more than 2 migraine preventive medications for any condition at the 
time of study enrollment will be allowed to remain on the medication if the medication has at 
least moderate evidence of efficacy for migraine ( Silberstein et al 2012 ). Patients on concomitant 
migraine preventive medications must be on a stable dose for at least 2 months prior to screening 
(visit 1), without anticipated changes durin g the study. A list of migraine preventive medications 
allowed for any condition for the duration of the study for approximately 30% of patients is 
presented in  Appendix  C. The total number of patients receiving concomitant migraine 
preventive medication during the study will be approximately 30% of the total number of 
patients randomized. Randomization will be stratified by patients with and without pr eventive 
medications.  
3.4. Stopping Rules for the Study   
There are no formal rules for early termination of this study. During the conduct of the study, 
serious adverse events will be reviewed (Section  7.1.7 ) as they are reported from the 
investigational centers  to identify safety concerns.  
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
46 The study may be terminated by the spon sor for any reason at any time. For example, the 
sponsor should terminate the study in the event of the following:  
• new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safety issues that invalidate the 
earlier positive benefit -risk assessment  
• discontinuation of the development of the investigational medicinal product (IMP)  
If the study will be stopped, the patients that are terminated early will be followed according to 
Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient (Section  4.3). 
3.5. Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments   
Study procedures and assessments w ith their time points are presented in Table  1. Detailed 
descriptions of each method of procedures and assessments are provided in Section  6 (efficacy 
assessments), Section  7 (Assessment of Sa fety), and Section  8 (Assessment of Pharmacokinetics 
and Immunogenicity). Study procedures and assessments by visit, including unscheduled visits,

i Puberty status (Tanner staging scale, see Section  7.5) will be assessed at randomization (visit 2) and EOT either by patients’ self report or by physical 
examination according to the Tanner staging card provided.  
j Patients will be randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 2 fremanezumab doses (based on body weight).  
k Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed in triplicate at any time during the visit, prior to study drug administration.  
l The method for measuring temperature in an individual patient must be the same at each timepoint.  
m Inquiries about adverse events w ill be made before and after study drug administration.  
n Serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis.  
o Females who are po stmenarchal or ≥12 years of age only. Serum β -HCG tests will be performed at screening (visit 1) and visit 5; urine β -HCG tests will be 
performed at all visits. Inquire and record start/stop date of menstrual period at each visit.  
p Eligible patients will be given an electronic headache diary device and they or a parent/caregiver will be trained in its use  and compliance requirements on the 
day of screening. Patients or parents/caregivers will com plete electronic headache diary entries about the previous day daily beginning on day -27 through the 
EOT/early withdrawal visit. If the patient is unable to complete the diary themselves, then a parent/caregiver will complete the diary for them.  
q The C -SSRS will be completed by a qualified rater trained to administer the scale at the investigational center based on discussion  with the patient/caregiver at 
the time points described. Any patient w ho demonstrates suicidal ideatio n and/or any suicidal behavior at any point during the study should be withdrawn from 
the study and discontinued from study treatment. In addition, if a patient endorses suicidal ideation or behavior at any poin t during the study (including during 
screening), the investigator must explain to the patient/caregiver the need for follow -up with a mental health professional and make any necessary referrals.

− The patient is in custody due to an administrative or a legal decision or is in 
residential treatment.  
− The patient/care giver is unable to be contacted in case of emergency.  
− The patient has any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, 
makes the patient inappropriate for inclusion in the study.

attenuated vaccine.  
t. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to the active substan ce or to any of the 
excipients of the study drug.  
u. The patient has a current or past medical history of hemiplegic migraine.  
4.3. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient   
Each patient is free to withdraw from the study or discontinue from IMP at any time, without 
prejudice to their continued care. Patients must be withdrawn from the study if any of the 
following events occur:  
• Patient withdraws consent or requests discontinuat ion from the IMP or withdrawal 
from the study for any reason.  
• Patient develops an illness that would interfere with his/her continued participation.  
• Patient is noncompliant with the study procedures and assessments or administration 
of IMPs in the opinion of the investigator.  
• Patient takes prohibited concomitant medications chronically.  
• A female patient has a confirmation of pregnancy during the study from a positive 
pregnancy test.  
• The sponsor requests withdrawal of the patient.  
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
54 • Patient experiences an adverse event or other medical condition indicating to the 
investigator that continued  participation is not in the best interest of the patient.  
• Any patient who demonstrates suicidal ideation and/or any suicidal behavior at any 
point during the study should be withdrawn from the study and discontinued from 
study treatment.  
Patients should b e treated with standard of care after withdrawal from or termination of the study 
as appropriate.  
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on patients in the case of withdrawal from the 
study or discontinuation from IMP. Results of any evaluation s and observations, together with a 
narrative describing the reason(s) for withdrawal from the study or discontinuation from IMP, 
must be recorded in the source documents. The case report form (CRF) must document the 
primary reason for withdrawal from the study or discontinuation from IMP.  
See Appendix  H for information regarding how the study will define and address lost to 
follow -up patients to hel p limit the amount and impact of missing data.  
If the reason for withdrawal from the study or discontinuation from IMP is an adverse event 
and/or clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will be continued as 
applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of 
a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP [and/or PFS] 
or study procedure is made). The specific event or test result (including r epeated test results, as 
applicable) must be recorded both on the source documentation and in the CRF; both the adverse 
events page and the relevant page of the CRF will be completed at that time . 
The patient will be monitored as applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until 
the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause 
unrelated to the test IMP or study procedure is made). The investigator must inform the Study 
Leader as soon as p ossible of each patient who is being considered for withdrawal due to adverse 
events. Additional reports must be provided when requested.  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study for multiple reasons that also include adverse events, the 
relevant page of t he CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event. An 
exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that in the opinion of the 
investigator is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but that require s the use of a 
prohibited medication, thereby requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason 
for discontinuation would be “need to take a prohibited medication,” not the adverse event.  
All protocol -specified procedures/assessments sho uld be performed at the EOT/early withdrawal 
visit (see  Table  1). Patients who withdraw from the study or have an early termination will be 
invited to enter the long -term safety extension (within Study TV48125 -CNS -30084) for the 
purpose of safety follow -up and evaluating ADA approximately 5  months (150  days 
[5 half-lives]) after receiving the last dose of study drug in this study.  
In the case of patients  lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the patient must be made and 
documented in the patient’s medical records and transcribed to the CRF.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
55 4.3.1.  Study -Specific Patient Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures   
In the following circumstances for patients with abnormal hepatic laboratory values (eg, ALT, 
AST, ALP, gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, or International Normalized Ratio 
[INR]), IMP should be discontinued immediately:  
1. any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3× the ULN, combined with INR >1.5× the ULN or 
total bilirubin ≥2× the ULN  
2. any increase in ALT or AS T to ≥3× the ULN, which is accompanied by symptoms 
clearly associated with impaired liver function (eg, vomiting, nausea, fever, rash, or 
eosinophilia) and not deemed related to other diseases (eg, vomiting or nausea triggered 
by migraine)  
3. any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥5 but <8× the ULN, which is persistent for 
≥2 weeks of repeated measurements  
4. any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥8× the ULN  
5. in any case where monitoring of liver enzymes cannot be performed according to the 
protocol guidance  
The pat ient must be withdrawn from the study drug if the patient experiences a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis.  
Additionally, IMP should be discontinued if the patient experiences an adverse event or other 
medical condition indicating to the inves tigator that continued participation is not in the best 
interest of the patient.  
4.4. Replacement of Patients   
A patient who is randomized/enrolled but does not complete the treatment period will not be 
replaced.  
Study enrollment assumes up to a 4% discontinuation rate The number of patients randomized 
(230) was selected to achieve the estimated 220 patients completing the study (110 patients per 
treatment group).  
4.5. Rescreening   
A patient who is screened but not enrolled (eg, because study eligibility criteria were not met 
[inclusion criteria not met or exclusion criteria met]) due to any of the following reasons : 
technical issues (eg, diary malfunction), out of visit 2 window due to an emergency situation (eg, 
pandemic or potential pandemic), a change in the patient’s medical background, a modification 
of study inclusion and exclusion criteria, or upon the sponso r’s discretion on a case -by-case 
basis, may be considered for rescreening 1 time. If the history of migraine classification (EM or 
CM) as taken by the investigator differs from the classification determined by the diary data 
(28-day baseline period), the p atient may be rescreened one time; this information should be 
recorded in the CRF.  
Patients may have individual parameters retested at the discretion of both the investigator and the 
sponsor .

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
56 Patients may be rescreened once if the repeated values for the laboratory, vital sign, or ECG 
screening criteria are within acceptable limits as ju dged by the investigator or if repeated values 
show normalization of the out -of-range values, but their initial baseline period has expired.  
If the patient is rescreened, an informed consent form (ICF) will need to be re -signed, and a new 
screening number will be assigned.  
4.6. Screening Failure   
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomized in the st udy. A minimal set of screening failure information 
will be entered in the CRF. Minimal information includes but is not limited to demography, 
screening failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse events.

57 5. TREATMENTS   
5.1. Investigational Medicinal Products Used in the Study   
Investigational medicinal product is defined as the test IMPs and matching placebo IMPs to the 
respective test IMPs.  
5.1.1.  Test Investigational Medicinal Product   
The formulation of fremanezumab to be used for clinical investigations in the pediatric 
population will be identical to the sc formulation of fremanezumab that will be used in the 
clinical program for adults. Information on the test IMP and placebo are shown in Table  2.  
Additional details may be found in the IB for fremanezumab.  
5.1.1.1.  Starting Dose and Dose Levels   
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio betwe en fremanezumab and placebo treatment 
groups:  
• monthly sc administration of fremanezumab  
• monthly sc administration of matching placebo  
The dose of fremanezumab to be administered will be determined by the patient’s weight at 
randomization (visit  2): 
• Patien ts weighing ≥45.0  kg at randomization (visit 2) will receive monthly sc 
administration of fremanezumab at 225 mg.  
• Patients weighing <45.0  kg at randomization (visit 2) will receive monthly sc 
administration of fremanezumab at 120  mg. 
(Note: For this study,  monthly dosing refers to dosing approximately every 4 weeks [28 days].)  
The recommended sc injection sites follow the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical 
Center Patient Education Materials ( NIH Clinical Center Patient Education Materials 2016 ). The 
suggested injection site locations for sc administration are the following: back of upper arms, 
lower abdomen/belly/waistline, and front of thighs. The sc injection and location will be 
recorded for each administration visit (visits 2, 3, and 4).  
A 1.5  mL volume (patients weighing ≥45.0  kg at randomization [visit 2]) or a 0.8  mL volume 
(patients weighing <45.0  kg at randomization [visit 2]) from each visit kit(s) (the full dose given 
with a PFS or  taken from the vials) must be injected sc for administration to be considered 
complete. Patients randomized to the placebo group will receive volume -matched doses of 
placebo.

 60 5.2. Preparation, Handling, Labeling, Stor age, and Accountability for 
IMPs   
5.2.1.  Storage Conditions and Handling   
Fremanezumab should be stored refri gerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in the original 
container until it is used. Protect from light. Do not freeze, and do not use if frozen. Do not shake 
vigorously. Refrigerated fremanezumab remains suitable for use until the expiration date printed 
on the primary container and/or  carton. Do not use fremanezumab if the liquid is cloudy, 
discolored, or contains visible flakes or particles. Fremanezumab should be equilibrated to room 
temperature for 30  minutes prior to administration.  
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for all IMPs received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of 
the IMPs.  
Further guidance is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.2.2.  Labeling   
Supplies of IMPs will be labeled according to the current International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing 
Practice and w ill include any locally required statements. If necessary, labels will be translated 
into the local language.  
5.2.3.  Accountability   
Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing  the contents of the shipment, return 
instructions, and any applicable forms.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMPs and other study materials 
from the sponsor are correctly received, recorded, handled, and stored safely and p roperly in 
accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or national and/or local regulations, and 
used in accordance with this protocol.  
Only patients enrolled in the study may receive IMPs and only authorized staff at the 
investigational center m ay supply or administer IMPs. All IMPs must be stored in a secure, 
environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the 
labeled storage conditions or appropriate instructions with access limited to the investigator an d 
authorized staff at the investigational center.  
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final  disposition records).  
A record of IMP accountability (ie, IMP and other study materials received, used, retained, 
returned, or destroyed) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, 
with an account given for any discrepancies. E mpty, partially used, and unused PFS and vials of 
IMP will be destroyed at the investigational center in accordance with investigational center 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or will be disposed of, retained, or returned to the 
sponsor or designee pe r sponsor instructions.

5.3.2.  Justification for Use of Placebo Investigational Medicinal Product   
A multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group design is 
appropriate, given the objectives of this study. Furthermore, this design is consistent with the 
recommendations of the IHS for controlled trials of preventive drugs in migraine ( Tfelt -Hansen 
et al 2012 ). 
The use of a placebo rather than an active comparator is justified in this study because o f the 
limited availability of a suitable comparator. Topiramate is the only migraine preventive 
medication approved for pediatric populations, but it is not approved in all regions of the EU and 
is limited to adolescents ages 12 through 17, so this medicat ion would be off -label for those 
subjects ages 6 through 11.  
5.4. Treatment After the End of the Study   
Upon completion of the final study assessments, all eligible patients will be o ffered enrollment in 
a long -term safety and tolerability study (Study TV48125 -CNS -30084), consisting of 9  months 
(36 weeks) of open -label treatment and 5 months of follow -up commencing from the last study 
drug administration. In the long -term safety extens ion study, patients rolling over from the 
current study will be weighed at visit  2 and will receive monthly fremanezumab with dose 
adjusted per weight category (225 mg in patients ≥45.0 kg or 120  mg in patients <45.0  kg). 
Patients who do not complete this study and patients who complete this study but do not wish to 
continue treatment may enroll in Study TV48125 -CNS -30084 for the purpose of attending a 
follow -up visit for safety and ADA assessments approximately 5  months (150  days 
[5 half-lives]) after rece iving the last dose of study drug.  
5.5. Restrictions   
Medications prohibited before and/or during the study are described in Section  5.6 and the 
exclusion criteria (Section  4.2). Restrictions with regard to pregnancy and required laboratory 
values are provided in the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section  4.1 and Section  4.2, 
respectively). Restrictions regarding contraception methods are detailed in the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (Section  4.1 and Section  4.2, respectively) and are also described in 
Appendix  G.  
Patients must remain at the site, for safety observation, for at le ast 30 minutes after injection or 
longer if deemed necessary by medical judgment.  
There are no additional restrictions in this study.

 64 5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Therapy   
All prior therapy, medication, or procedure (ie, procedures for the treatment of migraine [eg, 
nerve blocks]) for the treatment of migraine a patient has had during their lifeti me will be 
recorded on the CRF. In addition, all concomitant medications taken during the study will be 
recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage will be recorded. The 
sponsor will encode all therapy and medication according to the  World Health Organization drug 
dictionary.  
The following medications are prohibited for regular chronic use during the study: opioids 
(including codeine), barbiturates (including Fiorinal®, Fioricet®, or any other combination 
containing butalbital), and l amotrigine.  
Approximately 30% of EM patients will be allowed to remain on no more than 2 migraine 
preventive medications in Appendix  C for any condi tion, provided the medication is recognized 
to have at least moderate evidence of efficacy or is commonly used. Additional details on 
migraine preventive  medication information are provided in Appendix  C. For chronic use of 
these medications for any indication, patients must have been on a stable, well -tolerated dose of 
this migraine preventive medication for at least 2 months prior to screening (visit 1) and would 
be expected to remain on this medication for the duration of the study. For the remaining 
approximately 70% of EM patients, these medications are not allowed for migraine or for any 
other indications. As -needed (PRN) use of these medications a re allowed during the course of 
the study for any indications and do not have to have established dosing regimens. PRN use of 
these medications should be reported in the electronic case report form as concomitant 
medications. Patients should be trained and  should not report PRN use of these medications in 
the electronic headache diary. PRN use is defined as any treatment regimen outside of the 
prescribing information or local treatment guidelines.  
Patients will be allowed PRN use of to use acute medications  to treat acute migraine attacks, as 
needed, with the exception of regular use of medications containing opioids and barbiturates.  
The chronic use of concomitant therapies not listed in Appendix C for any indication is allowed 
throughout the course of the study. All patients must have been on a stable dose of these 
concomitant medications for at least 2  months prior to screening (visit 1) and would be expected 
to remain on this medication for the duration of the study. PRN use of medications for adverse 
events or intercurrent acute situations are allowed.  
Patients must have received all recommended age -appropriate vaccines according to local 
standard of care and schedule prior to screening. Live attenuated vaccines (eg, intranasal flu 
vaccine, and measles, m umps, and rubella vaccine) are disallowed within the 12 -week period 
prior to screening. If a medical need arises during the study, the patient may receive a live 
attenuated vaccine.  
All concomitant medications taken during the study, including over -the-counter medications, 
vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and 
start and stop dates of administration. All patients will be questioned about concomitant 
medication use at each visit.  
Concomitant medicati on and treatment will be recorded until visit 5.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 65 5.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance   
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. If the investigator or the 
sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator 
and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn from the study. The 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Instituti onal Review Board (IRB) should be notified.  
5.8. Randomization and Blinding   
This is a double -blind study. The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff involved in 
bioanalytical analyses), and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. A computer -
generated master randomization list will be provided to drug packaging facilities. Packaging 
vendor(s) will package active and placebo into single -visit kits according to Good Manufacturing 
Practice procedures. The active drug and placebo kits for each dose will be identical in 
appearance and will contain 1 PFS (for the 225 mg dose and i ts matching placebo) or 2 vials (for 
the 120  mg dose and its matching placebo). Adequate kit supply for upcoming study visits will 
be managed by interactive response technology (IRT) and kept (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C) on 
site.  
This is a randomized stud y. Randomization will be stratified by country, sex, puberty status, and 
preventive medication use at baseline (Yes/No). Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment 
groups by means of a computer -generated randomization list. The specifications for 
randomization will be under the responsibility and oversight of Teva Global Statistics. Each 
patient will undergo randomization in a 1:1 ratio within the stratum to which he or she belongs to 
receive fremanezumab or placebo, as assigned by the IRT. The IRT wil l manage initial drug 
supply, maintenance of adequate study drug supplies on site, and study randomization centrally. 
At the time of each study visit, the IRT will be queried, and site personnel will retrieve and 
administer a 1.5  mL volume for patients wei ghing ≥45.0  kg at randomization (visit  2) or a 
0.8 mL volume for patients weighing <45.0  kg at randomization (visit  2) from each PFS or 
2 vials contained in the appropriately numbered kit(s).  
The sponsor’s clinical personnel (and delegates) involved in the  study will be blinded to the 
identity of the IMPs until the database is locked for analysis and t he IMP assignment is known. 
However, if a prioritized sample analysis is needed, bioanalytical and clinical pharmacology 
personnel may be unblinded.  
In the e vent of an emergency, it will be possible to determine to which treatment group and dose 
the patient has been allocated by accessing the Randomization and Trial Supply Management 
(RTSM) system. All investigational centers will be provided with details of h ow to access the 
system for code breaking at the start of the study. The Medical Monitor or equivalent should be 
notified following unblinding. Any unblinding of the IMP performed by the investigator must be 
recorded in the source documents.  
5.9. Maintenance of  Randomization and Blinding   
5.9.1.  Maintenance of Randomization   
Patient randomization codes will be maintai ned in a secure location at the service provider 
contracted to generate the codes. At the time of analysis (after the end of study), after receiving

assignment a ccording to the processes defined in the relevant SOP.

Blinded pharmacokinetic data may be assessed during the study. For patients who have 
pharmacokineti c sample bioanalysis or data analysis conducted, the individuals responsible for 
sample bioanalysis and other responsible personnel will know who received test IMP and who 
received placebo IMP during the study (of those patients only). Personnel responsibl e for 
bioanalysis will be provided with the randomization code to facilitate the analysis. However, the 
personnel responsible for bioanalysis and pharmacokinetic data analysis will not have access to 
clinical safety and efficacy data and will provide conce ntration data to other personnel in a 
manner that will not identify individual patients (ie, a dummy patient identifier will be linked to 
the concentration data of an individual patient).  
In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy, or in cases when know ledge of the IMP 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s 
IMP assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations. Individual randomization 
codes, indicating the IMP assignment for each randomi zed patient, will be available to the 
investigator(s) or pharmacist(s) at the investigational center via the RTSM, both via telephone 
and internet. Breaking of the treatment code can always be performed by the investigator without 
prior approval by the spo nsor; however, the sponsor should be notified following breaking of the 
treatment code. The patient’s IMP assignment should not be revealed to the sponsor . 
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and the event will be 
recorded on the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully 
documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. 
Assignment of IMP should not be recorded in any study documents or source document.  
In blinded studies, for an adverse event defined as a SUSAR (ie, reasonable possibility; see 
Section  7.1.6), Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) may independently request 
that the blind code be broken (on a case -by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements. 
The report will be provided in an unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, 
blinding will b e maintained for the investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct 
of the study, and analysis and reporting of the data.  
5.9.3.  Data Monitoring Committee   
There will be no  Data Monitoring Committee in this study.  
5.10. Total Blood Volume   
The total blood volume to be collected for each patient in this study is approximately 48  mL. See 
Appendix  J.

 67 6. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY   
Data from any efficacy assessments performed after the s pecified time will not be collected on 
the CRF; in the event, however, that such data are collected, these data will not be analyzed.  
6.1. Assessments of Efficacy   
6.1.1.  Electronic Headache Diary   
The primary efficacy endpoint (and some secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints as well) 
will be derived from headache variables collected daily using an electronic he adache diary 
device. Eligible patients and parents/caregivers will receive comprehensive training from site 
personnel on the use of the electronic headache diary device. Site personnel will also instruct 
patients and parents/caregivers on the requirement f or timely and daily completion of the 
electronic diary. Patients will complete an electronic headache diary. If the patient is unable to 
complete the diary themselves then a parent/caregiver will complete the diary for them.  
On each day, the patient or parent/caregiver will be asked to record diary data for the previous 
24-hour period. Patients and parents/caregivers may be asked about their (child’s) performance 
at school and when doing household chores (ie, functional assess ments). Patients or 
parents/caregivers who report headache on the previous day will answer questions about the 
headache (ie, the number of hours with headache, headache severity, presence of associated 
symptoms, and use of acute migraine medications). Addi tional details regarding the questions 
patients or parents/guardians will answer can be found in the electronic headache diary training 
manual.  
If a patient or parent/caregiver fails to complete the diary for the preceding day, the patient will 
be prompte d to enter the missed day’s information the next time he/she accesses the electronic 
diary, provided no more than 48 hours have elapsed since the end of the missed day. If more than 
48 hours have elapsed since completion of a diary day, the patient or pare nt/caregiver will not be 
allowed to enter diary information for that day, and it will be considered a missed day.  
Rating of headache severity and headaches lasting ≥2 hours for each day will be completed in the 
electronic diary.  
If headache is reported, t hen headache severity will be subjectively rated by the patient or 
parent/caregiver on an 11 -point numerical rating scale, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most 
severe pain. Each headache severity rating from the 11 -point numerical rating scale will be 
mapped to mild (1 to 3), moderate (4 to 6), or severe (7 to 10) for endpoint analyses ( McCaffery 
and Beebe  1989 ). Patients or parents/caregivers will also record whether photophobia, 
phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting are present,  and they will record any migraine medications 
(name of drug, number of tablets/capsules, and the dose in milligrams per tablet/capsule) taken 
on each day. Diary compliance of less than 75% after the start of treatment will be recorded as a 
protocol deviat ion. 
6.1.2.  Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment   
The PedMIDAS questionnaire is a 6 -item instrument to assess migraine -related disability in 
pediatric patients, which can be self-administered by the patient or administered by a caregiver. 
It has been validated in patients aged 4 through 18 years ( Hershey et al 2001 ) and includes 
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 68 questions related to the impact of headac he on school performance, disability at home (eg, 
inability to do chores or homework), and social/sport functioning.  
6.1.3.  Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale   
The PGI -I scal e is a 7 -item questionnaire designed to assess the patient’s global impression of 
improvement. It aims at evaluating all aspects of patients’ health and determining if there has 
been an improvement or not. The patient has to select the 1 response that give s the most accurate 
description of his/her state of health (overall status).  
The patient is instructed to select a response option on a 7 -point scale in which a score of 1 
indicates that the patient's condition is “very much better,” a score of 4 indicate s that the 
participant has experienced “no change,” and a score of 7 indicates that the participant is “very 
much worse.”  
• 1=Very much better  
• 2=Much better  
• 3=A little better  
• 4=No change  
• 5=A little worse  
• 6=Much worse  
• 7=Very much worse  
6.1.4.  Pediatric Quality of L ife Inventory   
The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 is a brief 23 -item health -related quality of 
life instrument that evaluates quality of life in 4  areas of funct ioning: physical, emotional, social, 
and school functioning. The PedsQL  4.0 has 4  age ranges: toddlers (2 through 4 years), young 
child (5 through 7 years), child (8 through 12 years), and adolescent (13 through 18 years). This 
study will use the young chi ld, child, and adolescent formats. The PedsQL version that will be 
used for the patient for the duration of the study will be based on the age of the patient at visit 2 
and will not change during the course of the study.  
The PedsQL  4.0 asks respondents to indicate how much of a problem each item has been during 
the past month. For the child and adolescent self -report (8 through 18 years of age) and the 
parent report forms, respondents use a 5 -point Likert scale to rate the item severity (0=never a 
problem;1 =almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; 4=almost 
always a problem). For younger children (5 through 7 years of age), a simplified 3 -point Likert 
scale, anchored with a happy and a sad face, is used (0=not at all a problem; 2=some times a 
problem; 4=a lot of a problem) to increase further the developmental sensitivity of the measure.  
The PedsQL  4.0 yields a total quality of life score and 2  summary scores: Physical Health 
Summary Score and Psychosocial Health Summary Score. To obtai n scores, items are reverse 
scored, transformed to a 0 through 100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), and averaged; 
total scores near 0 indicate lower quality of life, while scores approaching 100 indicate higher 
quality of life.

 69 7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
In this study, safety will be assessed by qualified study personnel by evaluating reported adverse 
events , clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, ECG findings, physical 
examination findings (including body weight and height measurements), suicidal ideation and 
behavior (as suggested by the C -SSRS), and use of concomitant medication . 
7.1. Advers e Events   
7.1.1.  Definition of an Adverse Event   
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical inv estigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or 
laboratory paramet er that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study, or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the IMP. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing con dition will 
be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present 
before study entry and do not worsen during this study will not be considered adverse events.  
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the fo llowing:  
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre -existing conditions (Note: A condition recorded as pre-existing that 
is intermittently symptomatic [eg, headache] and that occurs during this study should 
be recorded as an adverse event.)  
• drug/drug or drug device  interactions  
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures of this study  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse 
event, require medical  treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or are considered by 
the investigator to be clinically significant (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results at 
the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study 
drug are not cons idered adverse events.)  
Migraine exacerbations, including acute headache, requiring headache medications will be 
collected as part of the efficacy assessment in this study. Migraine exacerbations (including acute 
headache) should be recorded as an adverse event only if the presentation and/or outcome is 
more severe than would typically be expected from the normal course of the disease in a 
particular patient or if they are severe enough to require hospitalization of the patient, in which 
case they are recor ded as serious adverse events.

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 70 7.1.2.  Definition of an Adverse Device Effect   
An adverse device effect is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical 
device or a co mbination product. This includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device, including any event resulting from user error 
or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. This definition includes events 
related to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to 
events related to investigational medical devices.  
7.1.3.  Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events   
For adverse event recording, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period from 
signature of the ICF through completion of visit 5 or the early withdrawal visit (for patients who 
withdraw from the study for any reason). Adverse events will be collected at each visit via 
adverse event inquiry.  
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be r ecorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severity of the event or judged 
relationship to the study drug  (and/or PFS) . For serious adverse events  and protocol -defined 
adverse events of special interest for expedite d reporting to GPSP , the Serious Adverse Event 
and Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest Form  must be completed, and the 
serious adverse event and the protocol -defined adverse events of special interest  must be 
reported immediately (see Secti on 7.1.7.4.1 ). The investigator does not need to actively monitor 
patients for adverse events once the study has ended. Serious adverse events occur ring after the 
defined study period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of 
them, following the procedures described in Section  7.1.7.4.1 .  
At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events by asking an open -ended question such as, “Have you had any unusual symptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a d iagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be 
recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, also 
on the serious adverse event form.  
The clinical course of each adverse event wil l be monitored at suitable intervals until it resolves, 
stabilizes, or returns to baseline; until the patient is referred for continued care to another health 
care professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug (and/or PFS) or 
study procedure is made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24  hours), action 
taken regarding study drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentatio n and transcribed onto the CRF.  
The relationship of each adverse event to study drug and study procedures, and the severity and 
seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded, as described 
below.  
Further details are giv en in the Safety Monitoring Plan.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 71 7.1.4.  Recording and Reporting of Adverse Device Effect   
Adverse device effects ( Figure  2) must be recorded on both the source documentation and the 
CRF.  
The investigator and sponsor will record all relevant information regarding every adverse device 
effect/serious adverse device effect and device defici ency and will categorize each as guided in 
Figure  2. 
The investigator should make an initial determination whether the adverse event may be related 
to a device deficiency.  
Figure  2: Decision Tree for Adverse Events and Adverse Device Effects Classification   
 
AE=adverse event; ADE=adverse de vice effect; CRF=case report form; IEC=Independent Ethics Committee; 
IRB=Institutional Review Board; SADE =serious adverse device effect; SAE=serious adverse event . 
7.1.5.  Severity of an Adverse Event   
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the following:  
• Mild: No limitation of usual activities  
• Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities  
• Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities  
7.1.6.  Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal Product  
and/or Device   
The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP (and/or PSF) is characterized as described  in 
Table  3.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 72 Table  3: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the IMP  and/or Device   
Term  Definition  Clarification  
No reasonable 
possibility  
(not related)  This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the IMP  (and/or PFS) . The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“no reasonable possibility” if it is  clearly due to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the IMP  (and/or PFS) . 
• It could readily have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental  or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to 
the IMP  (and/or PFS) . 
• It does not reappear or worsen when the IMP  
(and/or PFS)  is re-administered.  
Reasonable 
possibility  
(related)  This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection 
with the administration of IMP 
(and/or PFS) cannot be ruled out 
with certainty.  The relationship of an  adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following 
apply:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the IMP  (and/or PFS) . 
• It cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the pat ient’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear after 
discon tinuation of the IMP  (and/or PFS) , yet an 
IMP (and/or PFS) relationship clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP  
(and/or PFS) . 
IMP=investigational medicinal product.  
7.1.7.  Serious Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Device Effects   
For recording of serious adverse events  and serious adverse device effect s, the study period is 
defined for each patient as that time period from signature of the ICF to visit 5 (EOT visit). 
Serious adverse events and serious adverse device effects occurring in a patient after the end of 
study should be reported to the sponsor i f the investigator occurring in a patient after visit 5 
(EOT visit) should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, 
following the procedures described in Section  7.1.7.4.1 . 
7.1.7.1.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event   
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes or actions:  
• results in death  
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 73 • is life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which 
means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay were required 
for treatment of an adverse event or that they occurred as a consequence of the event  
Hospitalizations scheduled before the patient signed the ICF will not be considered 
serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the pre -existing condition 
during the patient’s participation in this study.  
• results in persistent or significant disab ility/incapacity (refers to a substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization but may je opardize the patient and may require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in 
hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any 
suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an 
important medical event . 
All occurrences of possible drug -induced liv er injury that meet Hy’s law criteria, defined as all 
of the below, must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor as a serious adverse event:  
• ALT or AST increase of >3×  the ULN  
• total bilirubin increase of >2×  ULN  
• absence of initial findings of choles tasis (ie, no substantial increase of ALP)  
An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.  
Refer to Appendix  I for guidance regarding monitoring patients with elevated liver function tests.  
7.1.7.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Device Effect   
A serious adverse device effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event (Section  7.1.7.1 ). 
7.1.7.3.  Expectedness   
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the  relevant 
reference safety information by its specificity, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safety information for this study is the IB.  
The sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department will determine the e xpectedness for all serious 
adverse events.  
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 74 For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the reference safety information document at 
the moment of the occurrence of the SUSAR applies.  
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect is a serious adver se device effect that, by its 
nature, incidence, severity, or outcome, has not been listed in Appendix  K (Appendix Table 1 
and Appendix Table 2).  
7.1.7.4.  Reporting a Serious Adverse Event   
7.1.7.4.1.  Investigator Responsibility   
To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occ ur during the study, 
regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported to the sponsor 
by the investigator. The event must be reported within 24  hours of when the investigator learns 
about it.  Completing the serious adverse ev ent form and reporting the event must not be delayed, 
even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to actively monitor 
patients for adverse events once this study has ended.  
Serious adverse events occurring to a patient afte r the last administration of IMP of that patient 
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them.  
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safety officer (LSO) or designee (a 
contract research organiz ation [CRO] in a country without a sponsor LSO) (contact  information 
is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section); the LSO will forward the report 
to the sponsor’s GPSP.  
The following information should be provided to record the event ac curately and completely:  
• study number  
• investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number  
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event  
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the IMP (no 
reasonable po ssibility, reasonable possibility)  
Additional information includes:  
• age and sex of patient  
• date of first dose of IMP  
• date and amount of last administered dose of IMP  
• action taken  
• outcome, if known  
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of relatedness  
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 75 • concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and regimens) and 
treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data  
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known  
• for an adverse event res ulting in death  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to IMP)  
− autopsy findings (if available)  
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the  relationship of the event to the IMP, study 
procedures, and underlying disease.  
Additional information (follow -up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded by the investigator within 24  hours of when it beco mes known to 
the same address as the initial report.  
For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP will distribute the Council for International Organizations 
of Medical Sciences form/Extensible Markup Language file to the LSO/CRO for submission to 
the competent authorities, IEC/IRBs, and investigators, according to regulations.  The 
investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with 
national and local regulations.  
Blinding will be maintained for the people who are  involved directly in the study. Therefore, in 
case of a SUSAR, only the LSO or CRO personnel involved with safety regulatory submissions 
will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded 
report.  
Note: Although  pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event, but using the pregnancy form (see 
Section  7.2). 
7.1.7.4.2.  Sponsor Responsibility   
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study procedures, 
the sponsor will t ake appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored 
clinical studies of fremanezumab and the appropriate competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate).  
In addition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and  IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other action may be required, including the following:  
• altering existing research by modifying the protocol  
• discontinuing or suspending the study  
• modifying the existing consent form and informing all study participants of new 
findings  
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 76 • modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as 
related to fremanezumab  
7.1.7.4.3.  Reporting a Serious Adverse Device Effect   
The process and contact details for serious adverse device effect reporting are the same as for 
serious adverse event reporting provided in Section  7.1.7.4 . 
Events shall be reported to the IEC/IRB by the investigator and to the regulatory authorities by 
the sponsor using the appropriate form according to national and local regulations.  
The investigator should use Appendix  K (Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Table 2) to make an 
initial determination whether the serious adverse event may be related to a device deficiency  
7.1.8.  Protocol -Defined Adverse E vents of Special Interest   
Adverse events of special interest for pediatric patients are not listed in the Pediatric 
Investigation Plan or Pediatric Study Plan. For purposes of th is protocol, the following are 
considered protocol -defined adverse events of special interest to be sent to the sponsor’s GPSP 
for evaluation: ophthalmic -related adverse events of at least moderate severity and severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic react ions. Hypersensitivity reactions will be monitored using the 
diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis as outlined by the 2006 Joint National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Second Symposium on Anaphylaxis 
(Sampson et al 2006 ). The clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis are provided in 
Appendix  D. In the event of suspected anaphylaxis, vital signs (including oxygen saturation and 
respiration rate) will be measured.  
The process for reporting a protocol -defined adverse event of interest is the same as that for 
reporting a serious adverse event ( Section  7.1.7.4 ). Protocol -defined adverse events of special 
interest to be reported to GPSP can be either serious or nonserious, according to the cri teria 
outlined in Section  7.1.7.1 . 
7.1.9.  Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event   
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, deviations from the protocol are 
allowed based on the investigator’s clinical judgment . To ensure patient safety, after the event 
has stabilized or treatmen t has been administered ( or both), the investigator or other physician in 
attendance must contact the physician identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact 
Information section of this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, 
in consultation w ith the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in 
the study.  
7.2. Pregnancy   
Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn fr om the study.  
All pregnancies of females participating in the study and consenting female partners of males 
participating in the study that occur during the study or within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in this study are to be reported immedia tely to the individual identified in the Clinical 
Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol, and the investigator must provide 
the sponsor LSO/CRO with the completed pregnancy form. The process for reporting a

(Section  7.1.7.4 ). 
The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between 
screening and baseline, provided no protocol -related procedures were applied.  
All female patients (or  consenting female partners of male patients participating in the study) 
who become pregnant will be monitored  for the outcome of the pregnancy (including 
spontaneous, elective, or voluntary abortion) . If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(healt h of the infant up to 8  weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of 
any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be 
reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication 
of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.  
Consenting female partners of men participating in the study who become pregnant will be asked 
to sign an ICF.  
If the pregnancy in the female participating in the study and/or the consenting female partners of 
males participating in the study does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be 
taken:  
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event.  
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.  
• For an elective abortion not due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as  an adverse event.  
7.3. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investigational Medicinal Products   
Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study pr otocol should be reported 
in the patient’s source documents, regardless of whether or not an adverse event occurs as a 
result.  
The following are types of medication errors and special situations:  
1. Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing , dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the health care professional, 
patient, or consumer.  
2. Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration 
or cumulatively, which is above the ma ximum recommended dose according to the 
authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. Any dose of 
IMP (whether the test IMP, reference IMP, or placebo IMP), whether taken intentionally 
or unintentionally, in excess of that pre scribed must be immediately reported to the 
sponsor.  
3. Misuse: Situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in 
accordance with the authorized product information.

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 78 4. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP which  is accompanied by 
harmful physical or psychological effects.  
5. Off-label use: Situations where an IMP is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in 
accordance with the authorized product information.  
6. Occupational exposure: Exposure to an IMP, as a resu lt of one’s professional or 
non-professional occupation.  
7. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions which occur in infants following exposure to 
a medicinal product from breast milk.  
7.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests   
Details on sample handling, storage, shipment, and analysis are given in Appendix  N and in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
7.4.1.  Serum Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, and Urinalysis   
All clinical laboratory tes t results outside of the reference range will be judged by the 
investigator as belonging to one of the following categories:  
• abnormal and not clinically significant  
• abnormal and clinically significant  
A laboratory test result that is judged by the investig ator as clinically significant will be recorded 
both on the source documentation and the CRF as an adverse event and monitored as described 
in Section  7.1.2 . An adverse event may include a laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality (once 
confirmed by repeated testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, the 
temporary or permanent withdrawal of IMP or medical treatment, or furt her diagnostic work -up. 
(Note: Abnormal laboratory or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient 
from entering the study or receiving IMP are not considered adverse events.)  
In addition, potentially clinically significant values  will be predefined by the sponsor for selected 
laboratory parameters and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
Clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be 
performed at the time points detailed  in Table  1. In case of suspected hepatitis, HIV, or Lyme 
disease, a blood sample may be taken at screening at the discretion of the investigator. Base line 
is screening (visit 1).  Clinical laboratory tests will be performed using the central laboratory. 
Specific laboratory tests to be performed are listed below ( Table  4). Note, reflex tests (eg, red 
blood cell [RBC] shapes, RBC morphology, and other microscopic findings) may be triggered 
automatically.

7.4.2.  Other Clinical Laboratory Tests   
7.4.2.1.  Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Tests   
Serum β -HCG tests will be performed for all female patients who are postmenarchal or 
≥12 years of age at screening (visit  1) and visit 5; urine β -HCG tests will be performed at all 
visits ( Table  1). Any patient who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. 
Procedures for reporting the pregnancy are provided in Secti on 7.2. 
7.5. Physical Examinations   
Physical examinations, including height and weight (to be obtained at the screening visit, 
randomization visit, and EOT only) and puberty status (at randomization and EOT only) will be 
performed at the time points detailed in  Table  1. Body mass index will be calculated at screening 
and randomization.  
While the onset of puberty is generally associated with the onset of adolescence, a globally 
accepted age range for the onset of puberty and adol escence cannot be easily defined ( World 
Health Organization 1986 ). Because randomization will be stratified by puberty status, the 
Tanner puberty staging scale ( Finegold 1992 ) will be used to assess puberty status at that time. 
Puberty status will be assessed either by patients’ self report or by physical examination 
according to the Tanner staging card provi ded.

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 80 A complete physical examination will include  the following organ sy stems: general appearance; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest and lungs; heart; abdomen; musculoskeletal; skin; lymph 
nodes; and neurological.  Any physical examination finding t hat is judged by the investigator as a 
potentially clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a baseline value will be 
considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section  7.1.2 . 
7.6. Vital Signs   
Vital signs (pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, and respirator y rate) will be 
measured at any  time during the visit, as detailed in  Table  1. The method for measuring 
temperature in an individual patient must be th e same at each time point.  
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine or 
semi -erect/seated position and resting for at least 5  minutes. The same position and arm should 
be used each time vital signs are measured for a giv en patient. For any abnormal vital sign 
finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is 
judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) from a baseline value 
will be considered an adve rse event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF, and monitored as described in Section  7.1.2 . 
7.7. Electrocardiography   
Twelve -lead ECGs will be conducted at any  time during the visit, prior to study drug 
administration, as detailed in Table  1. The ECGs should be performed after the patient has been 
supine for at least 5 minutes. The ECGs will be performed in triplicate, with at least 1 minute 
between recordings.  
A qualified physician at a central diagnostic center will be responsible for interpreting the ECG. 
ECGs should be performed and transmitted according to the central ECG reading instructions 
provided in the ECG user manual. ECG equipment will be provided to all clinica l sites.  
Although the ECG interpretation will be performed centrally, the clinical evaluation remains 
under the investigator’s responsibility.  
The ECG will be evaluated by the investigator at the time of recording (signed and dated), and 
the printout shoul d be kept in the source documentation file. When potentially clinically 
significant findings are detected by the investigator, a cardiologist should be consulted for a 
definitive interpretation. All communications and diagnoses should be filed in the sourc e 
documentation file. The investigator’s interpretation will be recorded in the CRF regardless of 
the central reading interpretation. Any abnormal findings assessed by the Investigator as 
clinically significant should be recorded in the relevant CRF module s (eg, adverse event, medical 
history).  
Objective alerts are predefined as described in the central ECG reading manual. In these cases, 
the site and the sponsor will be informed immediately.  
Any unscheduled ECGs must also be submitted for central ECG reading.  
Any ECG finding that is judged by the investigator as a potentially clinically significant change 
(worsening) compared with a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the

Section  7.1.2 . 
7.8. Assessment of Local Tolerability and Pain   
Injection site assessment will be performed after administration of each dose of study drug, 
before the patient leaves the investigational site. The injection site will be asses sed by site 
personnel for erythema, induration, and ecchymosis and categorized according to measurements: 
5 to ≤50  mm (mild), >50 to ≤100 mm (moderate), and >100 mm (severe). Induration must be 
assessed by careful superficial palpation, avoiding placing pr essure on or squeezing the injection 
site. 
Reports of pain will be recorded as adverse events  and will be graded using the 11 -point 
numerical rating scale according to patient’s self -report of pain intensity and then mapping to 
mild, moderate, or severe.  
Appropriate treatment may be provided if necessary, in which case it must be recorded as 
concomitant medication.  
Injection site reactions will be recorded as adverse events as described in Section  7.1 and 
Section  9.8. 
7.9. Assessment of Suicidality   
The C -SSRS, combined with the investigator’s clinical evaluation, will be used to assess whether 
the patient has suicidal ideation or behavior and its severity ( Posner et al 2011 ). The C -SSRS 
will be completed by a qualified rater trained to administer the scale at the investigational center 
based on discussion with the patient/caregiver at the time points described in  Table  1. Any 
patient who demonstrates suicidal ideation and/or any suicidal behavior at any point during the 
study  should be withdrawn from the study and discontinued from study treat ment. In addition, if 
a patient endorses suicidal ideation or behavior at any point during the study (including during 
screening), the investigator must explain to the patient/caregiver the need for follow -up with a 
mental health professional and make any necessary referrals.  
7.10. Concomitant Therapy or Medication   
Concomitant therapy or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Details of 
prohibited medications are found  in Section  5.6.

 82 8. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND  
IMMUNOGENICITY   
8.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessment   
Sampling for pharmacokinetics will be sparse. Thus, the fremanezumab pha rmacokinetic 
samples will be analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic approach and will be reported 
separately from the clinical study report.  
Samples from patients who receive active study drug will be analyzed for fremanezumab using a 
validated metho d. Samples from patients who receive placebo will not be analyzed.  
8.1.1.  Specimen Sampling, Handling, and Shipment   
Blood samples (2 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwellin g catheter at the time points 
detailed in Table  1 for plasma concentration measurements of fremanezumab.  
The dates and times of study drug administrat ion and each pharmacokinetic sample will be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.  
Details on sample handling, storage, shipment, and analysis are given in Appendix  N and in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
8.2. Pharmacodynamics Assessment   
Not applicable.  
8.3. Immunogenicity Testing   
Samples from patients who receive active study drug will be analyzed for ADA using a validated 
method. Samples from patients who receive placebo will not be analyzed.  
Blood samp les (4 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points 
detailed in Table  1 for immunogenicity testing.  
Details on sam ple handling, storage, shipment, and analysis are given in Appendix  N and in the 
Laboratory Manual.

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 83 9. STATISTICS   
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
study comparing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sc administration of fremanezumab 
versus placebo for preventive treatment of EM in pediatric patients 6 through 17 years of age. 
Eligible patients will be randomiz ed in a 1:1 ratio between fremanezumab and placebo treatment 
groups. Patients weighing ≥45.0 kg at randomization (visit 2) will receive a 225 mg 
administration of fremanezumab or matching placebo. Patients weighing <45.0 kg at 
randomization (visit 2) will receive a 120 mg administration of fremanezumab or matching 
placebo. Randomization will be stratified by country, sex, puberty status, and preventive 
medication use at baseline (Yes/No).  
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations   
The sample size planned is approximately 220 patients (110 evaluable patients completing the 
study per treatment group). Assuming a treatment difference of 1.8 days (reduction in monthly 
average number of migra ine days) and a common SD of 4.31, a sample size of 110  patients per 
treatment group gives at least 87% power for the study to succeed at an alpha level of 0.05. 
Assuming a 4% discontinuation rate, approximately  230 patients (115 patients per treatment 
group) will be randomized. Patients will be randomized to receive either monthly sc 
administration of fremanezumab or placebo.  
The enrollment target is approximately 230 patients in total, with a goal of approximately 20% of 
those patients in the 6 - through 11-year-old age group.  
9.2. Analysis Sets   
9.2.1.  Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set   
The intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis  set will include all randomized patients.  
In the ITT analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were 
randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually received.  
9.2.2.  Safety Analysis Set   
The safety analysis set will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP.  
In the safety analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment patients actually 
received, rega rdless of the treatment to which they were randomized.  
9.2.3.  Full Analysis Set   
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all patients in the ITT population who receive at least 
1 dose o f study drug and have at least 10 days of diary entries postbaseline for efficacy 
assessments on the primary endpoint.  
9.2.4.  Per-Protocol Analysis Set   
The per -protocol analysis set wil l consist of all patients in the FAS who have completed the 
study without any important deviations , such as important inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations, 
VV-00040232 v20.0
 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 84 important deviations or omissions of the IMP administration, or unexpected drug concentration 
findings, and who have at least 75% diary compliance after the start of treatment.  
9.3. Data Handling Conventions   
Efficacy variables from patients who do not have their diary completed f or the entire study 
period will be imputed. The detailed data imputation rules will be described in the statistical 
analysis plan.  
9.3.1.  Handling Withdrawals and Missing Data   
Efficacy  variables based on diary data will be prorated to monthly rate. Sensitivity analysis for 
primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using multiple imputation method for missing data.  
9.4. Study Population   
The ITT analysis set (Section  9.2) will be used for all study population summaries unless 
otherwise specified. Summaries wi ll be presented by treatment group and for all patients.  
9.4.1.  Patient Disposition   
Data from patients screened; patients screened but not randomized and reason not randomized; 
patients  who are randomized; patients randomized but not treated; patients in the ITT, safety, and 
other analysis sets; patients who complete the study; and patients who withdraw from the study 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Data from patients wh o withdraw from the study 
will also be summarized by reason for withdrawal using descriptive statistics.  
9.4.2.  Demographic  and Baseline Characteristics   
Patient demographic and baseline  characteristics, including medical history, prior medications, 
and 12 -lead ECG findings, will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maxim um) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be 
provided. Categories for missing data will be presented, if necessary.  
Treatment groups will be compared for all continuous variables, using an analysis of variance 
with treatment group as factors. The categorical variables of patient sex and race will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics for each variable category. Missing categories will be 
presented, if necessary. Treatment groups will be compared for all catego rical variables using a 
Pearson’s chi square (or Fisher’s exact test if cell sizes are too small).  
9.5. Efficacy Analysis   
For the purpose of this study, a migraine day will be defined as a calendar day where the patient 
reports either of the following:  
• headache pain that lasts ≥2 hours and is accompanied by ≥1 migraine symptom(s)  
• the patient used acute migraine -specific medi cation (triptans or ergots) to treat a 
headache of any severity or duration

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
 85 The detailed algorithm for deriving migraine days will be described in the statistical analysis 
plan.  
9.5.1.  Primary Endpoint   
The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline period) in the 
monthly average number of migraine days during the 12 -week period after the first dose of study 
drug.  
9.5.1.1.  Estimand for the Primary Endpoint   
The primary estimand for this study is the difference in means between the fremanezumab group 
and the placebo group in the target population who have received at least 1 dose of  study drug 
and have at least 10 days of electronic diary efficacy data for the mean change from baseline in 
the monthly average number of migraine days during the 12 -week period after the first dose of 
study drug as if there were no intercurrent events. D ata collected after treatment discontinuation 
or prohibited therapy will not be used for assessing the primary estimand.  
9.5.2.  Secondary Endpoints   
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline period) in monthly average number of 
headache days of at least moderate severity  during the 12 -week period after the first 
dose of study drug  
• proportion of patients reaching at least 50% reduction in t he monthly average number 
of migraine days during the 12 -week period after the first dose of study drug  
• mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline period) in the monthly average number 
of days of use of any acute headache medications during the 12 -week per iod after the 
first dose of study drug  
• mean change from baseline (day 1) in migraine -related disability score, as measured 
by the PedMIDAS questionnaire, at 12 weeks after administration of the first dose  of 
study drug  
• mean change from baseline (day 1) in quality of life, as measured by the PedsQL, at 
12 weeks after administration of the first dose of study drug  
• proportion of patients developing ADAs throughout the study. The impact of ADAs 
on safety and efficacy will be analyzed if the number of ADA -positi ve patients 
allows.

9.5.4.  Planned Method of Analysis   
The FAS (see Section  9.2.3 ) will be used for all efficacy analyses. Summaries will be presented 
by treatment group.  
9.5.4.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis   
The primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline (28 -day baseline period) in the 
monthly av erage number of migraine days during the 12 -week period after the first dose of study 
drug, will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance method. The model will include treatment, 
sex, puberty status, region, baseline weight category (<45.0 kg or ≥45.0 kg), and preventive 
medication use at baseline (Yes/No) as fixed effects and baseline number of migraine days as a

 87 covariate. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be constructed for the least squares mean 
differences between the fremanezumab group  and the placebo group. A hierarchical procedure 
will be used to control Type 1 error rate, as described in Section  9.6. An interim analysis with 
blinded sample size re -estimation will be conducted as described in Section  9.12. 
9.5.4.2.  Sensitivity and Supplementary Analyses   
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted by using multiple 
imputation method for missing data. Sensitivity analysis using Mixed -Effect Model Repeated 
Measure  method also will be conducted for change from baseline to months 1 through 3 in 
migraine days. A supplementary analysis using the ITT population will also be carried out for the 
primary efficacy endpoint. Additional subgroup analyses will be performed to investigate 
treatment effect among relevant sub -populations, such as sex, region, receiving preventive 
migraine therapy or not, receiving 2 preventive medications from Appendix  C, and receiving 
alternative preventive medications that belong to the same classes but are not listed in  
Appendix  C. The details will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.5.4.3.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis   
The same analysis used for the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed for the conti nuous 
secondary efficacy endpoints. For the proportion of responders, defined as at least 50% reduction 
from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days, a logistic regression model will 
be used with the following factors: treatment, sex, regio n, puberty status, baseline weight 
category (<45.0 kg or ≥45.0 kg), and preventive medication use at baseline (Yes/No). The odds 
ratio, 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, and p -value for the treatment comparison will 
be presented.  
9.5.4.4.  Exploratory Eff icacy Analysis   
 
 
9.6. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity   
A fixed -sequence (hierarchical) testing procedure will be implemented to control the Type 1 
error rate at 0.05. The sequence of comparisons will star t with the analysis of the primary 
endpoint and will follow with the secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The order of secondary endpoint analyses will in general follow the sequence listed in 
Section  9.5.2 . Final order and details will be confirmed in the statistical analysis plan, which will 
be finalized before database lock.  
9.7. Safety Analysis   
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set.  
Safety assessments and time points are provided in Table  1. 
All adverse events  will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class 
category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (ove rall

 88 and by severity), adverse events determined by the investigator to be related to test IMP (and/or 
PFS) (ie, reasonable possibility) (defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and by 
severity), serious adverse events, serious adverse de vice effects, and adverse events and adverse 
device effects causing withdrawal from the study. Summaries will be presented by treatment 
group and for all patients. Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to 
withdrawal will be presented.  
Changes in laboratory, ECG, and vital signs measurements data will be summarized 
descriptively. All values will be compared with predefined criteria to identify potentially 
clinically significant values or changes, and such values will be listed . 
Suicidal ideation and behavior will be measured using the C -SSRS. Data for patients with 
positive findings will be listed.  
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive 
statistics. Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated 
with study drug.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline to each t ime point. For categorical 
variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of serious 
adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and potentially clinically significant 
abnormal values (clinical laboratory o r vital signs) based on predefined criteria will be provided 
as well.  
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided, and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report.  
9.8. Tolerability Analysis   
Injection site reactions will be recorded as adverse events  according to the following severity 
assessment criteria:  
• Assessment  of injection site erythema,  induration, and ecchymosis will be recorded 
according to measurements: 5  to ≤50  mm (mild), >50 to ≤100  mm (moderate), 
and >100  mm (severe).  
• Injection site pain will be recorded  using the 11 -point numerical rating scale and will 
be mapped to  mild, moderat e, or severe, according to patient’s self -report of pain 
intensity, as described for the recording of headache pain in Section  6.1.1 . 
• Appropriate treatment may be provided if necessary, in which case it must be 
recorded as concomitant medication.  
Tolerability will be assessed by the following:  
• the number (%) of patients who fail to complete the study (day 85, final assessment)  
• the number  (%) of patients who fail to complete the study due to adverse events  
Local tolerability findings will be listed and summarized descriptively.

 89 9.9. Pharmacokinetic Analysis   
Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration results (fremanezumab) will be tabulated descriptively at 
each planned sampling time point by weight cutoff.  
In addition, the most appropriate population pharmacokinetic model will be developed. This 
analysis will be re ported separately, as appropriate.  
9.10. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis   
The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic relationship may be estimated by compartmental 
techniques. The ph armacokinetic parameters will be based on fremanezumab measurements. The 
pharmacodynamic measures will be the efficacy/safety responses.  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship may be estimated using the most 
appropriate model after comparing dif ferent candidate models for their quality of fit. If 
performed, this analysis will be reported separately.  
9.11. Immunogenicity Analysis   
Summary of immunogenicity results will be provi ded, and the incidence of immunogenicity will 
be calculated. The impact of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetic profile, drug efficacy, and 
clinical safety will be evaluated if data allows. This analysis will be reported separately.  
9.12. Planned Interim Analys is  
An interim analysis with blinded sample size re -estimation will be conducted by evaluating the 
pooled variability (SD) of the primary endpoint using the total number of patien ts regardless of 
the treatment assignment once 50% (±10%) of patients have completed at least 3 months of 
treatment or have withdrawn from the study early. If the pooled SD is <4.8, there will be no 
change in enrollment; if the pooled SD is >5.2, the sampl e size will increase to  approximately  
400 patients; and if the pooled SD is between 4.8 and 5.2, the sample size will increase to 
approximately 340 patients total. Details of the interim analysis will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan.  
9.13. Reporting  Deviations from the Statistical Plan   
Deviations from the statistical plan, along with the reasons for the deviations, will be described 
in protocol amendments, the statistical a nalysis plan, the clinical study report, or any 
combination of these, as appropriate, and in accordance with applicable national, local, and 
regional requirements and regulations.

The primary reason for this amendment is to revise the protocol to allow combined oral progestin 
and estrogen contraceptives, expand the BMI upper limit to 120% of the 95th perc entile in order 
reflect the real -world patient population, and to clarify potential sample size changes subsequent 
to the planned interim analysis. This update and other minor revisions do not impact the study 
design, and the amended protocol remains consi stent with the United States FDA Special 
Protocol Assessment and Written Request agreements. All major changes to the protocol body 
are listed below in the table and are reflected in the synopsis, as applicable. Minor editorial 
changes (typos, punctuation,  etc) have been made to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as

variability (SD) of the primary 
endpoint using the total number of 
patients regardless of the treatment 
assignment once 50% of patients have 
completed at least 3 months of 
treatment or have withdrawn from the 
study early.  If the pooled SD is <4.8, 
there will be no change in enrollment; 
if the pooled SD is >5.2, the sample 
size will increase to  approximately  400 
patients; and if the pooled SD is

See New wording column.  Section 5.6  Prior and Concomitant 
Medication or Therapy  
There are currently no data available 
regarding the concomitant use of 
fremanezumab and the new COVID -19 
vaccines. Based on Teva’s knowledge 
of both fremanezumab and what has 
been published about the respective 
vaccines, Teva has no r eason to believe 
there would be an interaction. 
However, the investigator should use 
his/her medical judgment regarding 
any concerns related to an individual 
patient. We do recommend not giving 
the 2 injections, the study drug, and the 
vaccines in the same  arm if the 
injections are administered close 
together in time, as it would be difficult 
to tell which one caused any potential 
reaction. If logistically possible, we 
would recommend waiting at least 
72 hours between the receipt of the 
vaccine and the subs equent dose of 
fremanezumab in order to allow for 
better attribution of causality should an 
adverse event occur after 
administration. As with any 
concomitant medication, the vaccine 
should be recorded in the source 
documentation and in the electronic 
data capture.  Clarification regarding the 
COVID -19 vaccination

 122 16.7. Amendment 07 Dated 20 August 2020   
The primary reason for this amendment is to provide guidance for remote assessments to 
minimize the time that patients and caregivers are required to spend at the study site. This 
consideratio n was triggered by the COVID -19 pandemic; however, remote assessments can be 
carried out on a regular basis to provide flexibility for patients, caregivers, and site staff. Patient 
reported outcomes assessed in this study, including the PedMIDAS, PedsQL, a nd PGI -I, as well 
as the C -SSRS, are valid to be conducted remotely, as confirmed by the scale authors. 
Instructions on remote data collection are available in the site operational manual. This update 
and other minor revisions do not impact the study desig n, and the amended protocol remains 
consistent with the United States FDA Special Protocol Assessment and Written Request 
agreements. All major changes to the protocol body are listed below in the table and are reflected 
in the synopsis, as applicable. Min or editorial changes (typos, punctuation, etc) have been made 
to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as appropriate).  
Additionally, COVID -19 pandemic -related operational updates were added to the study protocol 
as a new appendix ( Appendix O ). Administrati ve changes have been applied, including updating 
the Table of Contents.

selection for pediatric patients 
weighing <45 kg was also performed 
with an alternative pediatric population 
pharmacokinetic model with the fixed 
allometric exponents (ie, 0.75 for

However, the appar ent over prediction 
of observed exposures from the Phase 
1 pharmacokinetic pediatric study 
(Study TV48125 -CNS -10141) with 
this model led to an under prediction of 
the selected dose needed to achieve 
exposures comparable to those in 
adults receiving 225 mg sc 
fremanezumab.  
Considering the wide safety margin for 
fremanezumab with substantial 
evidence supporting the safety of the 
approved dose of 225 mg sc monthly in 
adults, the expected exposures in 
pediatric patients weighing <45 kg 
after administration of 1 20 mg sc 
monthly fall well within the exposure 
range of adults receiving doses up to 
900 mg sc monthly; where 675 mg sc 
monthly and 900 mg sc monthly were 
administered in the adult Phase 2b 
studies and were found to be safe and 
well tolerated. Safety margi n data from 
a nonclinical study in juvenile rats 
indicate that at the NOAEL dose of 
450 mg/kg/week (see Section 1.2.1), 
calculated safety margins range from 
16- to 22 -fold higher than expected 
pediatric clinical exposure based on a 
population pharmacokinet ic model. It 
is therefore concluded that in 
nonclinical studies, adequate safety 
margins are calculated even when 
considering higher exposure in the 
pediatric population.  Additional paragraphs

5.3.1. Justification for Dose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product  
A 2013 investigation by Momper et 
al from  the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) analyzed 
92 products approved between 2007 
and 2012 with similar adult and 
pediatric indications across different 
therapeutic areas, and 87 (94.5%) 
had equivalent dosing for adults and 
adolescent patients (Momper et al

fremanezumab to be used for clinical 
investigations in the pediatric 
population will be identical to the sc 
formulation of fremanezumab that 
was used in the clinical program for 
adults. ).  
Based on pharmacokinetic 
simulations, a b ody weight threshold 
of 40 kg can be generally used for 
pediatric patients to receive the same 
fixed adult dosage for mAbs (Yang 
et al 2019). In addition, mAbs tend 
to have wide therapeutic windows 
since they represent more targeted 
therapy with limited of f-target 
toxicity; as a result, recommending a 
40 kg threshold for receiving the 
adult dosage, with resultant pediatric 
exposure being within 20% to 30% 
above adult exposure, seems to be 
appropriate (Yang et al 2019). The 
fremanezumab weight cutoff is 
slightly higher (45 kg); hence, this 
reduces the likelihood to be above 
adult exposure. In addition, 
fremanezumab has a wide 
therapeutic dose range that was A 2013 investigation by Momper et

Based on pharmacokinetic

fremanezumab has a wide

 146 16.14.  Amendment 02 Dated 05 December 2019   
The primary reason for this amendment is to update the protocol with the dose to be used for 
patients <4 5.0 kg (120 mg sc monthly) following the completion of the Phase 1 pediatric 
pharmacokinetic study (TV48125 -CNS -10141). This update and other minor revisions do not 
impact the study design, and the amended protocol remains consistent with the United States  
FDA Special Protocol Assessment agreement. The amendment is considered to be substantial (ie, 
requires approval by competent authorities, IEC, and/or IRB) by the sponsor’s Authorized 
Representative. Other nonsubstantial changes have been made to the proto col (and protocol 
synopsis, as appropriate). These changes are unlikely to affect the safety or rights (physical or 
mental integrity) of the patients in this clinical study or the scientific value of the clinical study.

On each day, the patient or parent/caregiver will be 
asked to record diary data for the previous 24 -hour 
period. Patients and parents/caregivers may be as ked 
about their (child’s) performance at school and when 
doing household chores (ie, functional assessments). 
Patients or parents/caregivers who report headache 
on the previous day will answer questions about the 
headache (ie, the number of hours with head ache, 
headache severity,  presence of associated symptoms, 
and use of acute migraine medications). Additional 
details regarding the questions patients or 
parents/guardians will answer can be found in the 
electronic headache diary training manual.  On each day, the patient or parent/caregiver will be

 157 16.15.  Amendment  01 Dated 21  June  2019   
The primary reasons for this amendment are to improve the feasibility of t he diary compliance 
requirement, clarify the exclusion criterion for nerve stimulation or device , and clarify the timing 
of injection site reaction assessment. None of these revisions impact the study design, and the 
amended protocol remains consistent with the United States FDA Special Protocol Assessment 
agreement. The amendment is considered to be  substantial (ie, requires approval by competent 
authorities, IEC, and/or IRB) by the sponsor’s Authorized Representative. Other nonsubstantial 
changes have been made to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as appropriate). These changes 
are unlikely to af fect the safety or rights (physical or mental integrity) of the patients in this 
clinical study or the scientific value of the clinical study.

SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF PATIENTS  
Section  4.1  
i. The patient/caregiver has dem onstrated 
compliance with the electronic headache diary 
during the 28 -day baseline period by entry of 
headache data on a minimum of 2421 out of 28 days 
(approximately 8575% diary compliance).  i. The patient/caregiver has demonstrated 
compliance with the electronic headache diary during 
the 28 -day baseline period by entry of headache data 
on a minimum of 21 out of 28 days (approximately 
75% diary compliance).  This change was made to harmonize the 
required diary compliance during the baseline 
and treatment periods across the 3 Phase 3 
pediatric protocols. The change will not 
impact data quality or accuracy.  
(Not applicable)  n. The patient has received all reco mmended age -
appropriate vaccines according to local standard of 
care and schedule.  This inclusion criterion was added to protect 
study participants from preventable 
childhood illnesses in accordance with 
current medical recommendations for 
pediatric patien ts and to help prevent the 
spread of communicable infections to others 
at the investigational site.

Section  4.2 
(Not applicable)  b. The patient has used an intervention/device (eg, 
scheduled nerve block or transcranial magnetic 
stimulation) for the treatment of migraine during the 
2 months prior to the day of the screening visit.  This exclusion criterion was added to 
decrease the chances that previous 
nonpharmacologic treatments would 
confound the assessment of safety and 
efficacy of fremanezumab.  
(Not applicable)  s. The patient received a live attenuated vaccine 
within the 12 -week period prior to screening or plans 
to receive a live attenuated vaccine at any time during 
the study and for 6 months after the last dose of IMP.  This exclusion criterion was added to avoid 
an immune response elicited by 
administration of a live attenuated vaccine 
that could interfere with the accurate 
assessment of efficacy and safety of 
fremanezumab.  
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Section  7.8  
Injection site assessments will be performed 
immediately and 1 hour  after administration of each 
dose of study drug, d before patients leave the 
investigational site . Injection site assessments will be performed after 
administration of each dose of study d rug and before 
patients leave the investigational site.  This change was made to clarify the 
procedure for assessment of local tolerability 
and pain.

171 APPENDIX  C. PREVENTIVE MIGRAINE MEDICATIONS FOR ANY 
CONDITION ALLOWED FOR THE DURATION OF THE 
STUDY  FOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF PATIENTS   
The chronic use of 2 of the following concomitant medications is allowed in approximately 30% 
of EM patients and should be entered in electroni c case report form (eCRF) pages specific for 
migraine preventive medication. Patients using no more than 2 of the following migraine 
preventive medications for any condition at the time of study enrollment will be allowed to 
remain on the medication. Patie nts must have been on a stable, well -tolerated dose of this 
medication for at least 2  months prior to screening (visit 1) and would be expected to remain on 
this medication for the duration of the study. For the remaining approximately 70% of EM 
patients, the chronic use of these medications are not allowed for migraine or for any other 
indications. PRN use of the following medications are allowed during the course of the study  for 
any indications and do not have to have established dosing regimens . PRN use of these 
medications should be reported in the eCRF as concomitant medications. Patients should be 
trained and should not report PRN use of these medications in the electronic headache diary. 
PRN use is defined as any treatment regimen outside of the p rescribing information or local 
treatment guidelines. Patients will be allowed PRN  use of acute medications to treat acute 
migraine attacks, as needed, with the exception of regular use of medications containing opioids 
and barbiturates.  
• Antidepressants : amitriptyline, nortriptyline, fluoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine, 
duloxetine  
• Antiepileptics : topiramate, valproic acid, levetiracetam, zonisamide, gabapentin, 
pregabalin  
• Antihistamines : cyproheptadine, pizotifen  
• Beta blockers : propranolol, metoprolol, na dolol, timolol  
• Calcium -channel blockers : flunarizine, verapamil, nimodipine  
• Onabotulinumtoxin A or B  
Other agents that are not on this list but used for migraine prevention that may be used per local 
guidelines or clinical practice preference are considere d to have doubtful evidence for migraine 
prevention and therefore are treated the same as other concomitant medications (ie,  recorded as 
concomitant medications on the CRF) and DO NOT need to be captured in eCRF pages specific 
for migraine preventive medic ations.

173 APPENDIX  E. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE   
Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations  
Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written  
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the Independent Ethics Committee/ 
Internal Review Board (IEC/IRB)  and national and local competent authorities, as applicable , 
except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the patien ts or when the change 
involves only nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal investigator at each 
investigational center, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the 
protocol amendment.  
Important Protocol D eviations  
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or 
mental integrity of the patients in the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be 
considered an important protocol deviation. Imp ortant protocol deviations may include 
non-adherence  on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol -specific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines; noncom pliance to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration; use 
of prohibited medications. Important protocol deviations will be identified and recorded by 
investigational center personnel in the source documents and reported to regulatory authoriti es as 
applicable. All important protocol deviations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as 
required.  
When an important protocol deviation is reported, the investigator and the sponsor will 
determine whether to withdraw the patient from the study o r permit the patient to continue in the 
study, with documented approval from the medical expert. The decision will be based on 
ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study.  
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are not prospectively granted by 
the sponsor. If the investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study, they must immediately inform the 
sponsor of the impor tant protocol deviation . If such patient has already completed the study or 
has withdrawn early, no action will be taken but the deviation  will be recorded.  
Information to Study Personnel  
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the stu dy to all personnel members 
involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and 
during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must 
ensure that all study personnel are  qualified by education, experience, and training to perform 
their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s 
responsibilities.  This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary.  
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol.

Clinical Study Protocol w ith Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
174 Study Monitoring  
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form and the study is conducted 
according to applicable standard operating procedure (SOPs), the protocol, and ot her written 
instructions and regulatory guidelines.  
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study t o ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they 
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warrante d, in accordance with 
IEC/IRB approvals.  
The study monitor(s) will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center according 
to the monitoring plan. The study monitor will be permitted to review and verify the various 
records (case report for ms [CRFs] and other pertinent source data records, including specific 
electronic source document relating to the study) to verify adherence to the protocol and to 
ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded.  
As part of the  supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, 
accompany the study monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the course of these 
monitoring visits or provided in follow -up written communication.  
Audit and Inspection  
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study condu ct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global 
Clinical Quality Assurance, independent of Global Specialty Development, is responsible for 
determining the need for (and timing of) an inv estigational center audit.  
The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor representatives may conduct 
inspections and audits to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.

175 APPENDIX  F. ETHICS   
Informed Consent/Assent  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by the 
Independent Ethics Com mittee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB), per local regulations. All 
written and oral information about the study will be provided in a language as nontechnical as 
practical to be understood by the patient. The patient should be given ample time and opp ortunity 
to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The 
above should be detailed in the source documents.  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before any study -specific 
procedures  or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained. The patient’s willingness to participate in the study will be 
documented in the informed consent form (ICF), which will be signed and personall y dated by 
the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the 
patient and each parent/legally acceptable representative of all pertin ent aspects of the study, 
including the written information approved by the IEC/IRB, per local regulations. All written 
and oral information about the study will be provided in a language as nontechnical as practical 
to be understood by each parent/legally  acceptable representative and the patient. The patient and 
each parent/legally acceptable representative should be given ample time and opportunity to 
inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The 
above s hould be detailed in the source documents.  
A personally signed and dated ICF will be obtained from each parent/legally acceptable 
representative, and a signed and dated assent form will be obtained from each patient (if the 
patient is able) before any study -specific procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are explained; according to IEC/IRB 
requirements. The forms will be signed and dated also by the person who conducted the 
informed co nsent discussion. The investigator will keep the original informed consent and assent 
forms, and copies will be given to the patients (and each parent/legally acceptable 
representative). It will also be explained to the patients (and each parent/legally ac ceptable 
representative) that they are free to refuse participation in the study and free to withdraw from 
the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
Competent Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards  
Befo re this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national competent authority and to 
the respective IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start at a given investigational 
center before the IEC/IRB and competent authority (as applic able) for the investigational center 
give written approval or a favorable opinion.  
Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients  
The investigator must ensure that the privacy of the patients, including their identity and all 
personal medical information, will b e maintained at all times. In case report forms (CRFs) and 
other documents or image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by 
their names, but by an identification number.

177 APPENDIX  G. BIRTH CONTROL METHODS AND PREGNANCY 
TESTING   
Females of childbearing potential are defined as the following:  
• not surgically (documented hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral 
salpingectomy) or congenitally sterile  
• postmenarchal or ≥12 years of age  
Females who are not of childbearing potential are defined as the following:  
• premenarchal and <12 years of age  
Description of different birth control methods  
Highly effective birth control methods:  
Highly effective birth control methods are methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% 
per year when used consistently and correctly are considered. Such methods include the 
following:  
• Progestogen -only h ormonal contraception (oral, injectable, and implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least 1  month 
before the first dose of IMP  
• Progestin and estrogen contraceptives (oral only) associated with inhibition of 
ovula tion; these should be initiated at least 1  month before the first dose of IMP  
• Intrauterine device and intrauterine hormone -releasing system need to be in place at 
least 2  months before screening  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner, provided that  he is the sole sexual partner and has received 
medical assessment of the surgical process  
• Sexual abstinence is only considered a highly effective method if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the defined period. The reliability of 
sexua l abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Unacceptable birth control methods:  
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and post -ovulation methods), withdr awal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.  
Male contraception  
Male patients who are sexually active with female part ners must always use a condom for the 
duration of the study and for 6 months after the last administration of IMP.

178 APPENDIX  H. LOST TO FOLLOW -UP  
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the investigational center.  
The followi ng actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the investigational center for a 
required study visit:  
• The investigational center must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the 
missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on th e importance of 
maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient 
wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee 
must make every effort t o regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3  telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the 
patient’s medical record  and transcribed to the electronic case report forms.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “lost to follow -up.”

Clinical Study Protocol w ith Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
179 APPENDIX  I. GUIDANCE ON SAFETY MONITORING   
Guidance on Monitoring Patients with Elevated Liver Function Tests  
Liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma 
glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) as well as total bilirubin1 will 
be measured at each study visits 1, 3, and 5.  
In any case of elevated ALT or AST to a level exceeding ≥2× the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
(including patients whose baseline ALT or AST levels are ≥2× and ≤3× the ULN, who may be 
enrolled in the study), a thorough medical history and physical examination with a focus on liver 
disease should be undertaken.2 In addition, the patient should be instructed to refrain from 
alcoholic beverages.  
In case of symptoms compatible with drug -induced liver injury during the study, patients will be 
instructed to return to the study center for an unsched uled visit or to go to the emergency room to 
measure liver enzymes as soon as possible. Solitary elevations of total bilirubin, not 
accompanied by elevations of ALT or AST should be managed according to the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
Elevation o f Either ALT or AST to ≥3× ULN  
Confirmation is required prior to study drug discontinuation in cases of elevation of either ALT 
or AST ≥3× ULN (Note: In cases of elevation of ALT or AST ≥8× the ULN, no confirmation is 
required prior to study drug discontin uation, but the assessments below should be performed). 
The following procedures should be followed:  
• The day in which the abnormal value is received from the laboratory will be 
considered as day 0.  
• The investigator should repeat the test for confirmation purposes (this may be 
performed in a local laboratory along with complete blood count [CBC] and 
differential to assess for eosinophilia. In general, in case a blood sample is sent to a 
local laboratory, the following assessments [and reference ranges] are mandatory: 
ALT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase], AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase], ALP, total bilirubin, CBC [with differential for eosinophil count, 
separate tube], and International Normalized Ratio [INR] [separate tube; not to be 
sent in a confirmatory test]). The investigator should also question the patient 
regarding symptoms.  
 
 
1 In case total bilirubin is >ULN, then direct bilirubin will be checked.  
2 Thorough medical history with a focus on liver disease: personal or family history of liver disease; personal history 
of a s ystemic disease with potential liver involvement; exposure to alcohol, medications (prescription or over the 
counter), herbal preparations, dietary supplements, recreational drugs, special diets, or environmental chemical 
agents; potential exposure to infe ctious agents (eg, travel to developing countries, history of potential exposure to 
blood or blood products, high -risk sexual relations); and any additional information deemed relevant by the 
investigator. Physical examination, including signs of chronic l iver disease.

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol w ith Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
180 The abnormality will be regarded as confirmed in each of the following scenarios:  
• the baseline value was within the normal range and ALT or AST is still ≥3× the  ULN  
• the baseline value was above the ULN and ALT or AST is ≥2× the baseline value  
Additional Tests/Evaluations  
Upon confirmation of the abnormality as noted above, the following additional evaluations 
should be performed and results should be recorded in the CRF:  
• serology for hepatitis A (antibody and immunoglobulins M and G), B (core antibody 
total, core immunoglobulin M, and surface antigen), and C viruses (central 
laboratory)  
• serology for autoimmune hepatitis: anti -nuclear antibodies (titer), anti -smoot h muscle 
antibodies, and anti -liver kidney microsomal antibodies (central laboratory); further 
testing may be required in case of a positive result for hepatitis B or C  
• ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract at the investigator’s discretion  
• other diagnostic tests/consultations as deemed necessary by the investigator (eg, 
serology for hepatitis E virus in case of travel to endemic geography)  
• observation and follow -up (to be performed after the abnormality was confirmed as 
above)  
ALT or AST ≥3× (>3.5× the ULN if the Baseline Value Is >2.5× the ULN) but Less Than 5× 
the ULN  
• In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3× the ULN:  
• ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and  differential (to assess for 
eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored on days 5 (±2 days), 8 (±2 days), 14 (±3 
days), and 28 (±3 days). On at least 1 of these days, the test should be performed 
centrally. (The INR should be sent to a local laboratory onl y.) 
• In cases where a local laboratory is used, the results should be recorded in the case 
report form, accompanied by the reference range of the relevant measurements.  
• Should the abnormality (≥3× the ULN in case baseline was within the normal range 
or ≥2× the ULN in case the baseline value was above ULN but still <5× the ULN) 
persist further, the patient will be followed according to the investigator’s discretion, 
but a blood sample for ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total and direct bilirubin should 
be sent to th e central laboratory at least once a month.  
ALT or AST ≥5× but Less Than 8× the ULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3× the ULN:  
• ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and differential count (to 
assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored twice a week.

Clinical Study Protocol w ith Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
181 • At least for every other measurement, the tests should be sent to the central 
laboratory. The rest of the tests may be sent to a local laboratory. The INR should 
always be sent to a local laborat ory. 
ALT or AST ≥8× the ULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3× the ULN:  
• The study drug should be discontinued immediately, and the early withdrawal visit 
should be performed.  
• For follow -up guidance, please see belo w section “Follow -Up of Liver Enzymes 
After Stopping Rules Are Met.”  
Stopping Rules  
In the following circumstances, the study drug will be discontinued immediately:  
• any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3× the ULN, combined with INR >1.5× the ULN or 
total bilirub in >2× the ULN  
• any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3× the ULN, which is accompanied by symptoms 
clearly associated with impaired liver function (eg, vomiting, nausea, fever, rash, 
eosinophilia) and not deemed related to other diseases (eg, vomiting or nausea 
triggered by migraine)  
• any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥5 but <8× the ULN, which is persistent for ≥2

183 APPENDIX  K. PRODUCT COMPLAINTS   
Clinical Product Complaints /Device Deficieny  
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical 
quality or characteristics of clinical investigational medicinal product (IMP) supplies or clinical 
device supplies used in a clinical research study sponsored by Teva. Examples of a product 
complaint include but are not limited to:  
• suspected contamination  
• questionab le stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc)  
• defective components  
• missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center 
with more or less than the designated number of units inside)  
• incorrect packaging, or inco rrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both  
• device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner  
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by comp leting the product complaint form provided by Teva and emailing it to 
clinical.productcomplaints@tevapharm.com within 48  hours of becoming aware of the issue.  
For complaints involving a device /combination product  or other retrievable item, it is required 
that the device /combination product  (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing 
whenever possible. For complaints involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of 
the patient’s IMP supply) should be sent back to the sponsor f or investigative testing whenever 
possible.  
Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center  
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide 
the following information, as available:  
• invest igational center number and principal investigator name  
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint  
• clinical protocol number  
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable  
• product name and streng th for open -label studies  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double -blind or open -label 
studies  
• product available for return Yes/No  
• product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No

Clinical Study Protocol w ith Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
184 • description or nature of complaint  
• associate d serious adverse event Yes/No  
• clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No  
• date and name of person receiving the complaint  
Note: Reporting a product complaint must not be delayed even if not all the required information 
can be obtained immedia tely. Known information must be reported immediately. The sponsor 
will collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information.  
*Please refer to Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Table 2.  
Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) /Device s at the Investigational Center(s)  
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 
product for further ev aluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP  (and/or PFS) . 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all IMP  (and/or PFS) , the sponsor 
will provide the information needed to handle the return.  
The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality 
probl em existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient.  
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol 
should be followed for recording and reporting (Section  7.1.2  and Section  7.1.7.4 , respectively).  
Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint,  
the initial determination wheth er the deficiency could have led to a serious adverse event ( see 
below: Assessment of Device Performance ), and any actions taken to resolve the complaint and 
to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and  
the investigator, if necessary, an event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center 
where the complaint originated or to all investigational centers using the product.  
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documented, and reported by the investigator throughout the study.  
Assessment of Device Performance  
A device deficiency is defined as any inadequacy of an investigational medical device or 
combination product with respect to i ts identity, quality, durability, reliability, usability, safety, 
or performance (Appendix Figure 1). This definition includes malfunctions, use errors, 
inadequate labeling (eg, unintelligible label, incorrect expiry date), and product complaints that 
are related to the IMP.

 Placebo -Controlled Study –Pediatric Episodic Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol w ith Amendment 09  Study TV48125 -CNS -30083  
185 The investigator should use Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Table 2 to help make an initial 
determination whether the device deficiency could have led to a serious adverse event and 
include this assessment in the product complaint form.  
Device deficiencies with potential serious adverse device effect are defined as deficiencies that 
might have led to a serious adverse device effect if (Appendix Figure 1):  
• suitable action had not been taken (or)  
• intervention had not been made (or)  
• if circum stances had been less fortunate  
These device deficiencies shall be reported to the IEC/IRB by the investigator and to the 
regulatory authorities by the sponsor according to the national and local regulations.

187 APPENDIX  L. DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORD KEEPING   
Direct Access to Source Data and Documents  
All patient data must have supportive original sou rce documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed to the case report form (CRF). Data may not be recorded 
directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written 
instructions specifying which  data are permitted to be recorded directly to the CRF.  
If data are processed from other institutions or by other means (eg, clinical laboratory, central 
image center, or electronic diary data) the results will be sent to the investigational center, where 
they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol.  
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, Independent Ethics Committee/ Institutional 
Review Board (IEC/IRB), and inspectors from competent authority (or th eir agents) will be 
given direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical charts/records, laboratory test 
results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is 
maintained in accordance with national and local requirements.  
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s dat a 
at all times.  The investigator must maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows 
the unambiguous identification of each patient.  
Data Collection  
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21 CFR  Part 11 (USA) and documents of other concerned 
competent authorities. Before using the CDMS, it will be fully validated and all users will 
receive training on the system and study -specific training. After they are trained, users will be 
provided with i ndividual system access rights.  
Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriately designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity should not be discernible fr om the data provided on the CRF.  
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central 
image center, electronic diary data, electronic patient -reported outcome [ePRO] tablet), these 
data will be sent to the inv estigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to 
the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. All patient data must have supportive original 
source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed to the 
CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the 
sponsor provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly 
to the CRF.  
For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screening 
failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered in the CRF.

188 Data Quality C ontrol  
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency of the data from this study. Oversight will be carried out as described in the 
sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies. Day -to-day data management tasks for this study are 
delegated to a contract organization, and these functions may b e carried out as described in the 
SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by the sponsor before 
the start of data management activities.  
Data will be verified by the study monitor using the data source, and reviewed by D ata 
Management using both automated logical checks and manual review. Data identified as 
erroneous or data that are missing will be referred to the investigational center for resolution 
through data queries. Any necessary changes will be made in the clinic al database, and data 
review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be 
compared with the information available in the CDMS and any discrepancies will be queried.  
Applicable terms will be coded according to the  coding conventions for this study.  
At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confirmed a s accurate. All data collected will be approved by the 
investigator at the investigational center. This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review 
and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate.  
Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Doc uments  
Sponsor Responsibilities  
The original CRFs will be archived by the sponsor. Investigational center -specific CRFs will be 
provided to the respective investigational centers for archiving.  
Investigator Responsibilities  
The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, not es, reports, and 
data related to the study and any additional records required to be maintained under country, 
state/province, or national and local laws, including, but not limited to : 
• full case hi stories  
• signed informed consent forms  
• patient identification lists  
• CRFs for each patient on a per -visit basis  
• data from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central image 
center, electronic diary)  
• safety reports  
• financial disclo sure reports/forms  
• reports of receipt, use, and disposition of the IMPs  
• copies of all correspondence with sponsor, the IEC/IRB, and any competent authority

189 The investigator will retain all records related to the study and any additional records required, a s 
indicated by the protocol and according to applicable laws and regulations, until the contract 
research organization or sponsor notifies the institution in writing that records may be destroyed. 
If, after 25  years from study completion, or earlier in the  case of the investigational center 
closing or going out of business, the investigator reasonably determines that study record 
retention has become unduly burdensome, and sponsor has not provided written notification of 
destruction, then the investigator m ay submit a written request to sponsor at least 60  days before 
any planned disposition of study records. After receipt of such request, the sponsor may make 
arrangements for appropriate archival or disposition, including requiring that the investigator 
deliver such records to the sponsor. The investigator shall notify the sponsor of any accidental 
loss or destruction of study records.

Title: A Phase 2, Multi-Center, Double-Masked, Randomized, Vehicle-Controlled, 
Dose-Response, Parallel-Group Study of SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution versus 
Vehicle Control in Subjects with Dry Eye Disease 
Phase: 2 
Design/Conduct: This is a phase 2, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-
controlled, dose-response, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the ocular 
and systemic safety and ocular efficacy of SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution over a 
60-day treatment period in subjects with moderate to severe DED.  
During the 14-day single-masked run-in period, approximately 200 subjects 
will instill vehicle as 1 drop in both eyes (OU) twice a day (BID). At Visit 2, 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 4 treatment groups: Vehicle 
(n=50) and SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution 2.0% (n=50), 1.0% (n=50), and 0.5% 
(n=50). Double-masked IP will be instilled as 1 drop OU BID for 60 days.
The study will consist of 6 clinic visits: Visit 1 (-14 Days, Screening), Visit 2 
(Day 1, Randomization), Visit 3 (Day 7 ± 2 days), Visit 4 (Day 14 ± 2 days), 
Visit 5 (Day 28 ± 2 days), and Visit 6 (Day 60 ± 3 days, End of Study/Early 
Termination). 
Objectives: The primary objective is to assess the ocular safety and efficacy of SY-201 
Ophthalmic Solution in subjects with DED.  
The secondary objective is to assess the systemic safety of SY-201 Ophthalmic 
Solution in subjects with DED.

the disease generally more common in women than men and in Asian populations compared to 
Caucasian populations ( Stapleton et al., 2017 ). 
Current treatments for DED include tear replacement, anti-inflammatory agents, serum or 
umbilical cord serum eye drops, and surgical interventions. According to Jones (2017)
that many of the treatments available for the management of dry eye disease lack the necessary 
Approved topical treatments have been 
associated with side effects such as instillation pain and irritation ( Schultz 2014,  Leonardi 2016 ), 
ocular hypertension, and cataract formation ( Marsh 1999) . ____ _, it is "clear 
Level 1 evidence to support their recommendation" and there are "challenges ... in predicting the 
relative benefits of specific management options."

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 3. Study Design 
3.1 Overall Design of the Study 
This is a phase 2, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, dose-response, 
parallel-group study designed to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety and ocular efficacy of SY-
201 Ophthalmic Solution over a 60-day treatment period in subjects with moderate to severe DED.  
During the 14-day single-masked run-in period, approximately 200 subjects will instill vehicle as 
1 drop BID in both eyes (OU). At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 4 
treatment groups: Vehicle (n=50) and SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution 2.0% (n=50), 1.0% (n=50), 
and 0.5% (n=50). Double-masked IP will be instilled as 1 drop OU BID for 60 days. 
The study will consist of 6 clinic visits: Visit 1 (-14 Days, Screening), Visit 2 (Day 1, 
Randomization), Visit 3 (Day 7 ± 2 days), Visit 4 (Day 14 ± 2 days), Visit 5 (Day 28 ± 2 days), 
and Visit 6 (Day 60 ± 3 days, End of Study/Early Termination). A study schematic follows ( Figure 
1).

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution and vehicle will each be administered as a topical ophthalmic 
solution. In the single-masked run-in period, vehicle will be dosed OU BID by all subjects to 
normalize baseline conditions between subjects. Subjects will self-administer the first dose in-
clinic at Visit 1 and all remaining doses at home. In the double-masked treatment period, subjects 
will self-administer 1 dose of IP in-clinic at Visit 2 (Day 1) and Visit 6 (Day 60) and all remaining 
doses at home, OU BID.  
Direct instillation is the most efficient method for delivery to the ocular surface and is an accepted 
and widely used method for topical application to the eye. Each dose will be delivered by 
administering 1 drop (  in each eye from a 
single-use vial. 
3.3 Dose Justification 
The concentrations of 2.0%, 1.0%, and 0.5% SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution and the dosing schedule 
were chosen based on previous clinical studies, as described in Section 1.3.2 .  
3.4 End of Study Definition

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 5.1.2  Dosage and Administration 
This study includes a run-in period in which 1 drop of single-masked vehicle will be 
administered OU BID over 14 days. Administration of the double-masked IP, also 1 drop
OU BID, will occur over a 60-day treatment period. In both periods, administration is preferred in
the morning and evening, with 8 to 12 hours between instillations.  
At Visit 1 (Day -14), subjects will be assigned  of single-masked run-in roduct vehicle  and 
self-administer their first dose under the supervision of the site staff.
 
Subjects will be instructed to instill the run-in product as 1 drop into each eye. Subjects will 
then take home their 3 assigned kits (sufficient for up to 15 days) of run-in product for self-
administration. Subjects will dose at home that evening. 
The used and unused containing single-masked run-in must be returned to the site at 
Visit 2 (Day 1). Subjects should not dose run-in product the day of Visit 2. 
At Visit 2, randomized subjects will be assigned 2 IP kits of double-masked IP (SY-201 
Ophthalmic Solution 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% or vehicle). The first dose of double-masked IP, taken 
from an assigned kit, will be self-administered in the clinic by the subject under the supervision of 
the site staff. Subjects will be instructed to instill the IP as 1 drop into each eye. Subjects will be 
queried on drop comfort and then take home their 2 assigned kits (sufficient for up to 10 days) of 
double-masked IP for self-administration. Subjects will dose at home that evening. 
Subjects will return the used and unused double-masked IP at each subsequent visit (through Visit 
6) and receive new kits of double-masked IP to take home at Visit 3 (2 kits, sufficient for up to 10
days), Visit 4 (4 kits, sufficient for up to 20 days), and Visit 5 (7 kits, sufficient for up to 35 days).  
5.2 Preparation/Storage/Handling/Accountability 
5.2.1  Acquisition and Accountability 
. The IP may be distributed by trained study staff. Used and unused IP will be maintained 
at the site for accountability by the clinical study monitor. When authorized by the Sponsor and 
a
fter the clinical study monitor has verified drug accountability is complete and accurate, all used 
and unused single-masked (run-in) and double-masked IP will be returned
for destruction.

5.2.4  Preparation 
Neither SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution nor vehicle will require on-site preparation by the 
Investigator. 
5.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Masking 
To minimize bias, the treatment phase of this study is randomized and double-masked. 
Subjects will be randomized to treatment assignment. If unmasking is required, the integrity of the 
study assessments and objectives will be maintained by limiting access to the unmasked data.
A randomization schedule will be generated by the electronic data capture (EDC) system. The 
EDC will be used for randomization and unmasking. 
Double-masked IPSY-201 (2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5%) or vehicle assigned to subjects at 
randomization will be identical in appearance. Sponsor, subjects, and investigative staff will be 
masked to the identity of treatment until completion of the study and final database lock.

A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for a scheduled visit and 
is unable to be contacted by the study site staff.  
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return for a required clinic study visit:
 The site will attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit within 1 week, 
counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule, and 
ascertain if the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
 Before a subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
alent methods). 
 
Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.

Seinda Pharmaceutical Guangzhou Corp.  SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution
Clinical Trial Protocol
Confidential   Page 42 of 79
Version 1.2_13Apr2022 The Investigator will record all AEs with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for nonserious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. 
At each study visit, the Investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last 
visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the subject
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
8.2.1.1 Definitions 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated 
with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention. 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life-threatening AE  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or  
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition.  
8.2.1.2 Classification of Adverse Events 
Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of all AEs will be assessed by the Investigator and graded as follows:  
 Mild:  requires minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject
activities 
 Moderate:  results in a low level of inconvenience or concern and may cause some 
interference with functioning 's condition deteriorates at any time

Version 1.2_13Apr2022  Severe:  interrupts a subject
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating. 
 
Relationship of Adverse Events 
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the Investigator who 
examines and evaluates the subject based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical 
study, the IP must always be suspect. 
 Unrelated:  no reasonable possibility that the administration of the IP caused the event, no 
temporal relationship between the IP and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been 
established 
 Related:  is known to occur with the IP, is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the 
AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the IP and event. Reasonable possibility 
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the AE.

device labeling as occurring with a class of drugs  (or other medical products) or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties or other characteristics of the IP, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular IP under investigation. 
The Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE is unexpected, i.e., if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the IP.  
8.2.1.3 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
According to federal regulations, an Investigator must immediately report (within 24 hours) to the 
Sponsor any SAE, whether or not considered drug related, including those listed in the protocol or 
IB, and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are SAEs (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance 
with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and 
the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the Investigator must immediately report the 
event to the Sponsor (See 21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 312.64(b)).  • 's usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 According to federal regulations, the Sponsor must notify the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and all participating Investigators as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar 
days after the Sponsor determines that a potential serious risk arising from a clinical study qualifies 
for reporting. The Sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and 
unexpected. The Sponsor must report an AE as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event (See 21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)). 
Furthermore, the Sponsor must also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the 
Sponsor's initial receipt of the information (See 21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).  
8.2.1.4 Other Events of Interest 
Not applicable. 
8.2.1.5 Pregnancy 
All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed through Visit 6. 
Any report of pregnancy for any female study subject must be reported within 24 hours to the female subject must be withdrawn from the study. 
Every effort will be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition 
of the infant. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar 
days after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar days after delivery. 
Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 9. Statistical Considerations 
Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively by the mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum values. Categorical measures will be summarized by the frequency and 
percentage of subjects.  
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared prior to unmasking of study data. 
9.1 Statistical Hypothesis 
It is hypothesized that SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution will be safe and improve DED signs and 
symptoms in subjects with a documented diagnosis of DED. In particular, efficacy will be assessed 
using the following endpoints at Day 60: 
 Mean CFB in tCFS (mNEI scale) 
To control for type I error, comparisons will be made within each active dose level of SY-201 
Ophthalmic Solution compared to vehicle. In other words, the primary endpoints will be compared 
sequentially between SY-201 Ophthalmic Solution 2.0% and vehicle, first testing tCFS and, if 
statistically significant, then  Should both endpoints achieve statistical 
significance for the 2.0% dose, testing will proceed to SY-201 O hthalmic Solution 1.0% versus 
vehicle, first testing tCFS and, if statistically significant, then . Should both 
endpoints achieve statistical significance for the 1.0% dose, testing will proceed to SY-201 
Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% and vehicle, first testing tCFS and, if statistically significant, then 
In other words, the first non-significant result in this testing hierarchy of six 
hypotheses will imply that subsequent tests are non-significant. 
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
For mean change from baseline to Day 60 in tCFS, a sample size of 45 SY-201treated subjects 
versus 45 vehicle-treated subjects will have 87.9% power to detect an effect size of 2.0 units with 
a standard deviation of 3.0 for an unpaired t-test with a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. 
For mean change from baseline to Day 60 in dry eye symptom , a sample size of 45 SY-201
treated subjects versus 45 vehicle-treated subjects will have 83.5% power to detect an effect size 
of 1.5 units with a standard deviation of 2.4 for an unpaired t-test with a 2-sided alpha = 0.05.
Fifty (50) subjects per treatment arm, for a total 200 subjects, will be enrolled to allow for some 
dropout of subjects. •

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 9.3 Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects Subjects will be 
analyzed in the group to which  This set will be used for the analysis of all 
efficacy endpoints as the primary analysis. 
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will include all subjects who completed study-required 
treatment and who followed the protocol without significant deviations. The determination of 
significant protocol violations will be made prior to locking the final database and unmasking. 
Subjects will be analyzed in the group according to the treatment received. 
The Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects who took at least one dose of investigational 
product as indicated on the dosing record. Subjects will be analyzed in the group according to the 
treatment received. All safety variables will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set and only 
observed data will be included (i.e., missing data will remain missing for the safety analysis).
9.4 Statistical Analyses 
The statistical analysis of the study will be performed on the data through Day 60, after all subjects 
have either completed the Day 60 visit or discontinued early from the study and after the study 
database has been cleaned, verified, and locked. It is planned that the data from all clinical sites 
that participate in this study will be combined so that the target sample size will be available for 
analysis. 
Analyses will be conducted on individual SY-201 arms versus vehicle arm. 
9.4.1  Baseline Descriptive Analyses 
Demographic characteristics including age (years), sex, race, and ethnicity will be summarized by 
treatment group and overall. Medical history [coded using the most recent version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)], and prior and concomitant medications (coded 
using the most recent version of the WHODrug) will be summarized by treatment and overall.
The numbers of subjects who were enrolled and completed each visit of the study will be provided, 
as well as the reasons for all enrollment discontinuations, grouped by major reason (e.g., lost to 
follow-up, adverse event, poor compliance, rescue due to lack of efficacy). A list of discontinued 
subjects, protocol deviations, and subjects excluded from the analysis sets will be provided as well.
Exposure and compliance to study treatment will be summarized by treatment and overall.

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 9.4.2  Efficacy Analyses 
In general, efficacy analyses will be performed using the FAS and the observed data at each visit 
for the study eye and qualifying non-study eyes for most ocular measures or overall for subject-
level measurements. In the case of the biomarker test (MMP-9), analysis will be for the study eye
only. Analysis of mean CFB in tCFS and eye dryness score will also be performed using the PP 
Analysis Set as documented in the SAP. 
9.4.2.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
Primary Estimands : The primary estimands are the treatment differences between SY-201
Ophthalmic Solution arms and vehicle for mean CFB to Day 60 in tCFS using study eyes and 
mean CFB to Day 60 in eye score using the FAS. 
Target Population : Subjects with DED who meet the study entry criteria. 
Treatment Condition(s) : Treatment condition is based on the randomized treatment group. 
Population-level Summaries : The difference in the mean CFB to Day 60 in tCFS using study 
eyes and the difference in mean CFB to Day 60 in eye  score and their p-values and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
The proposed procedures to handle missing data and intercurrent events are as follows: 
 Discontinuation of study therapy with continued participation in the study 
o Treatment Policy  no imputation; use observed data 
 Receipt of rescue therapy 
o Treatment Policy  no imputation; use observed data 
 Missing data with or without withdrawal, regardless of reason 
o Hypothetical approach  missing data will be accounted for assuming missing at 
random (MAR) using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM). 
Mean CFB in tCFS will be analyzed using an MMRM model. The model will include the baseline 
measurement, treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction as fixed effects, with a random 
effect for site. An unstructured covariance among repeated measurements is assumed. A similar 
model for the subject-level mean CFB in eye score will be used. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP.

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 12.3 Appendix 3:   Corneal Fluorescein Staining (CFS), Modified NEI Scale 
The Investigator should use sufficient unpreserved saline solution (study stock) to wet the entire 
area of fluorescein impregnation on a 1.0 mg strip. If the strip becomes too saturated, discard and 
begin again with a new strip. Within 15 seconds of wetting the strip, taking care not to touch the 
strip to the eye, instill the fluorescein sodium in the inferior cul-de-sac. Instruct the subject to blink 
several times to distribute the fluorescein staining. 
The Investigator should wait approximately 2 minutes after instillation of fluorescein before 
evaluating staining. A Wratten #12 yellow filter will be used to enhance the ability to grade 
fluorescein staining.  
The cornea is divided into 5 sectors (central, superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal), each of which 
is scored on a scale of 04 in increasing increments of 0.5. Grade each of the 5 sectors of the cornea 
(central, superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal) in each eye. Total score (0-20) is obtained by 
summing the 5 sections of the cornea.  
 
The grading results for each area, as well as the total score obtained from the scoring of the cornea, 
are to be recorded in the eCRF. Whenever possible, the same Investigator should perform the 
grading per subject.

4 meters (13.1 f
subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet. Reflectance wall charts should be frontally 
illuminated (60-watt bulb or a well-lit room). 
The subject should be positioned according to the elevation of the chart (either seated or standing) 
so that the chart is at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. The subject 
should attempt to read each letter, line-by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 at the top of the 
chart. The subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the subject reads a 
number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should 
then request a letter instead of the number. The subject should be asked to read slowly, about 1 
letter per second, to achieve the best identification of each letter. He/she is not to proceed to the 
next letter until he/she has given a definite response. If the subject changes a response before he 
has read aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted. 
Maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart; the subject should be 
encouraged to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, 
the examiner should stop the test. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted.
In order to provide standardized and well-controlled assessments of visual acuity during the study, 
the same lighting conditions must be used consistently throughout the study

Version 1.2_13Apr2022 12.12 Appendix 12:   Dilated Ophthalmoscopy 
This procedure will occur after instillation of dilating drops and upon Investigator confirmation 
that both eyes are fully dilated (recommended time of 20 minutes). As dilating drops will be 
instilled, dilated ophthalmoscopy must be performed after Pinhole Distance VA, IOP, and 
assessments of corneal staining and healing. Dilated ophthalmoscopy will include assessment of 
the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid, optic nerve, and vertical optic nerve cup-to-disc ratio. After 
the ophthalmoscopy procedure, the Investigator will determine if findings are within normal limits 
or are abnormal. For abnormal findings at screening, the Investigator will determine whether the 
abnormality would exclude the subject from study participation. All abnormalities should be noted 
in the source and clinically significant or non-clinically significant should be marked.

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  1 Introduction 
This Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP)  describes the planned statistical methods for all safety , 
efficacy , ,  analyses  for study LDK378A2205 final clinical study 
report .  
The content of this SAP is based on LDK378A2205 study protocol Amendment 6. All decisions 
regarding final analysis, as defined in the SAP document, have been made prior to database 
lock of the study data. 
1.1 Study design 
This is a phase II, multi -center, open -label, five -arm study in which the efficacy and safety of 
oral ceritinib treatment will be assessed in patients with NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges harboring a n ALK rearrangement using the FDA approved Vysis ALK Break 
Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test and scoring algorithm (including positivity criteria). The study will enroll approximately 160 patients globally . 
Patients with ALK -positive NSCLC and active metastases to the brain and/or to leptomeninges 
will be included in this study. Patients without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) 
will be allocated  into 1 of the 4 arms taking into account the patient’s history of prior therapy: 
prior radiation therapy (whole brain or stereotactic radiation therapy) to the brain (yes/no) and 
prior treatment with an ALK  inhibitor (ALKi)  (yes/no) ( Table 1 -1). The allocation of patients 
into the five study arms are described below.  
Table 1-1 Allocation into Study Arms based on prior radiation to brain (yes/no) and prior treatment with ALK inhibitor (yes/no)  
 Prior Radiation to the b rain: 
YES  Prior Radiation to the brain: 
NO 
Prior treatment with a ALKi1: YES  Arm 1  Arm 2  
Prior treatment with a ALKi: NO  Arm 3  Arm 4  
Leptomeningeal disease1 Arm 5  
1Previous treatment with ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib is not allowed in Arms 1, 2 and 5.  
The description of patients in each of the five study arms is as follows: 
• Arm 1 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain and with prior exposure to an ALKi. 
• Arm 2 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain but with prior exposure to an ALKi.  
• Arm 3  will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain but with no prior exposure to an ALKi.  
• Arm 4  will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain and with no prior exposure to an ALKi .

16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  • Arm 5 will include any patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with or without 
evidence of active lesion at the baseline Gadolinium -enhanced brain MRI. 
All patients will receive the same treatment regimen regardless of the arm to which they are allocated. Treatment with ceritinib will continue until the patient experiences disease 
progression (in the brain, outside of the brain or both) as determined  by t he investigator 
according to RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, pregnancy, start of a new anticancer therapy, discontinues treatment at the discretion of the patient or investigator, lost to follow -up, death, or study is terminated by the Sponsor. 
Tumor response will be evaluated starting from the first day of treatment with ceritinib until the 
time of disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 as determined by investigator, withdrawal 
of consent for further follow -up, loss  to follow -up or death. This schedule of tumor assessment s 
must continue regardless of dose interruptions. In patients who discontinue treatment in the absence of progression, tumor assessments will continue every 8 weeks until progression of disease, with drawal of consent for further follow -up, loss to follow-up or death. 
Primary analysis of any of the study arms or overall will occur only after enrollment in the specific study arms or overall is complete and all patients have completed at least 24 weeks o f 
treatment with ceritinib or have discontinued earlier respectively. The study will end when both of the following conditions are met: 
1. At least 24 weeks after last patient treated in the study.  
2. At least 75% of patients have died, have been lost to follow-up, or have withdrawn 
consent for survival follow-up, or  the last patient will be able to enter into a separate 
rollover study and/or other options for continued treatment, whichever comes first. 
If the end of study criteria is met before the primary analy sis is conducted, a single final analysis 
and study report may be performed. If the end of the study criteria is not met by the time that the primary analysis is conducted, a final CSR will be produced reporting all available data collected up to last patient last visit (LPLV) including the additional study data collected after the primary analysis . 
1.2 Objectives 
1.2.1  Primary o bjective  
The primary objective is to evaluate the antitumor activity of ceritinib in patients with ALK -
positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges based on investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 . The primary endpoint is the overa ll response rate (ORR)  defined 
as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial respons e (PR) in the whole body as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by the 
investigator. 
1.2.2  Key s econdary and other secondary o bjectives  
The key secondary objective is to evaluate Disease Control Rate (DCR)  in patients with ALK -
positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges  based on investigator 
assessment per RECIST 1.1 . The  DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall 
response of CR, PR or SD in the whole body, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST 1.1. 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 10  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  Other secondary objectives are:

as asses sed by investigators and Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) (using 
modified RECI ST 1.1 criteria)  
• To evaluate extracranial tumor -response related endpoints (OERR, EDCR, TTER and 
DOER) as assessed by investigators and BIRC (using RECIST 1.1 criteria) 
• To evaluate whole body tumor -response related endpoints as assessed by investigators  (TTR, 
DOR and PFS)  and BIRC (ORR, DCR, TTR, DOR and PFS)  (using RECIST 1.1 criteria) 
• To evaluate overall survival (OS)  in patient s with ALK- positive NSCLC metastatic to the 
brain and/or to leptomeninges  
• To evaluate safety  in patient s with ALK- positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to 
leptomeninges  
•  
 
1.2.3  Exploratory objectives 
• To evaluate intracranial endpoints for patients with measurable  brain metastases at baseline 
in Arms 1 to 4 (OIRR, TTIR and DOIR) and for patients with active brain lesions at baseline 
in Arms 1 to 4 (IDCR)  using the Response Assessment in Neuro- Oncology (RANO) criteria 
for high grade gliomas ( Wen et al 2010 ) by investigators and BIRC.

personnel according to the data analysis Section 10 of the LDK378A2205 protocol, which will 
be available in Appendix 16.1.1 of the Clinical Study Report ( CSR) . Important information is 
given in the following sections and details are provided, as applicable, in Section 4 from which 
Appendix 16.1.9 of the CSR will be extracted .  
SAS® version 9.4 (or later version if available at time of database lock) will be use d in all 
analyses.  
Data from all patients who signed main informed consent in centers that participate in this study 
will be used in the  analysis . Data collected after withdrawal of informed consent will not be 
reported. D ue to expected small size of enrollment at individual centers, no center effect will 
be assessed . Each  analysis will use all data in  the database up to the analysis cutoff date, 
determined prior to database lock . Data collected after patients’ withdrawal of informed consent 
for furthe r participation in the study will not be reported (except for death date , which might be 
obtained from public records). 
Section 4.1 provides further details regarding data to be included in the analyses.  
General presentation of descriptive summaries  
Qualitative data  (e.g., gender, race) will be summarized by frequency count s and percentages. 
Percentages will be calculated using the number of patients in the relevant population or 
subgroup, as the denominator.   
Continuous data (e.g., age, body weight) will be summarized by appropriate descriptive 
statistics (i.e. mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). 
All baseline characteristics , efficacy  (except intracranial endpoints by RANO ) and safety 
analyses will be presented by study arm  (Arm 1, Arm  2, Arm 3, Arm 4 and Arm 5)  and for all 
patients.

2.6 Treatments (study drug, concomitant therapies, compliance) 
The Safety Set  will be used for a ll medication data summaries and listings  unless otherwise 
specified . Summaries will be produced by study arm and for all patients. Listing will be 
produced by study arm. 
Study drug and study treatment  
Study drug and study treatment  both refer to LDK378 (ceritinib) and will be used 
interchangeably. 
Date of first /last admini stration of study drug  
The date of first administration of study drug is defined as the first date when a non- zero dose 
of study drug was administered and recorded on the Dosage Administration Record (DAR) 
eCRF. For the sake of simplicity, the date of first administration of study drug will also be referred to as start date of study drug. 
The date of last administration of study drug is defined as the last date when a non- zero dose of 
study drug was administered and recorded on the DAR eCRF. This date will also be referred  to 
as the last date of study drug. 
Study day  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 16  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  The study day for all assessments (e.g. tumor assessment, death, disease progression, tumor 
response, performance status, adverse event onset, laboratory abnormality occurrence, vital sign measurement, dose interruption etc. ) will be calculated using the start date of study drug as the 
origin. For assessments occurring after or on the start date of study drug, study day will be 
calculated as:  
Study Day = Date of the assessment/ Event date - start date of study drug + 1. 
The first day of study drug is therefore study day 1.  
For any assessment or events such as baseline disease characteristics or medical history (e.g., 
time since diagnosis of disease) occurring prior to the start of the study drug, study day will be negative and will be calculated as:  
Study Day = Event date - start date of study drug. 
The study day will be displayed in the relevant  data listings.  
Baseline  
Baseline is the result of an investigation describing the “true” uninfluenced state of the patient. 
For efficacy  evaluations , the last non- missing assessment, including unscheduled assessments 
on or before the date of start of study treatment  is taken as “baseline” value or “baseline” 
assessment.  
For safety evaluations , the last available assessment on or before the date of start of study  
treatment is taken or ‘‘baseline” assessment.   
If an assessment is planned to be performed prior to the first dose of study treatment in the 
protocol and the assessment is performed on the same day as the first administration of study treatment, it will be assumed that it was performed prior to study treatment administration, if assessment time point is not collected or is missing.  
If assessment time points are collected, the observed time point will be used to determine pre -
dose on study day 1 for baseline calculation. Unscheduled assessments will be used in the determination of baseline. See Section 4.7.2
 for further details on derivation of baseline for 
laboratory data and ECGs.  
Patients who start treatment and discontinue from the study on the same day may have two different sets of data collected on study day 1, one being reported to the cycle 1 day 1 visit, the other reported to the end of treatment (EOT) visit. Data reported at the EOT visit are not eligible for baseline selection.  
Dose exposure  and intensity  
Definitions of duration of  exposure , cumulative dose, average daily dose, dose intensity (DI) , 
relative dose intensity (RDI) , as well as intermediate calculations , include: 
• Duration of exposure (days): last date  of study drug  −  first date  of study drug + 1  
(periods of interruption are not excluded)  
• Cumulative dose (mg): total dose of study drug taken by a patient in the study 
• Number of dosing days (days): duration of exposure − number of zero dose days

16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  • Average daily dose (mg/day): cumulative dose (mg) ∕  number of dosing days (days) 
• DI (mg/day): cumulative dose (mg) ∕ duration of exposure (days) 
• RDI (%): 100 × [ DI (mg/day) ∕ planned dose intensity (750 
mg/day)] 
Note: given the planned ceritinib dose of 750 mg/day, the planned dose  intensity can be 
calculated as : 
PDI (mg/day) = cumulative planned dose (mg)/Duration of exposure (days), 
where  
cumulative planned dose (mg) = Protocol planned dose of 750 (mg)* Duration of 
exposure. 
then, RDI (%) which is calculated as 100*DI /PDI can be simpl ified as shown above. 
Duration of exposure to study drug, cumulative dose, average daily dose, DI and RDI will be 
summarized  by study arm  and for all patients . In addition, the duration of exposure to study 
drug will be categorized into time intervals  and frequency counts and percentages of patients 
with exposure in each time interval will be presented . Frequency counts and percentages  of 
patients who have dose changes, reductions  or interruptions, and the corresponding reasons, 
will be summarized  by study arm  and for all patients . Time to first dose reduction and time to 
first dose interruption will be summarized  by study  arm and for all patients , using summary 
statistics along with frequency counts and percentages for pre- specified time intervals   
Listings  of all doses of the study drug along with dose change  and dose interruption reasons 
will b e produced.   
Section 4.5 provides further details on the definition of dose changes and interruptions. 
Concomitant therapy  
Concomitant therapies are defined as any  medications (excluding study drug, pr ior 
antineoplastic treatments and blood transfusions), surgeries or  procedures (including physical 
therapy) administered in the study and are recorded in the Prior and Concomitant Medications 
and the Surgical and Medical Procedures eCRF, respectively.  
Conc omitant medications  will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference Listing (WHO DRL) 
dictionary that employs the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (WHO ATC) classification system. Surgeries or procedures will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. All summaries will be tabulated using frequency counts and percentages  by study arm. 
Concomitant therapies will be summarized by ATC class  and preferred term  by study arm  and 
for all patients . These summaries will include : 1) medications starting on or after the start of 
study drug but starting no later  than 30 days after last dose of study drug; and 2) medications 
starting prior to the start o f study drug but continuing after the start of study drug. 
All concomitant therapies and surgeries and medical procedures will be listed.  Any concomitant 
therapies starting and ending prior to the start of study drug or starting more than 30 days after the last date of study drug will be flagged in the listings.

2.7 Analysis of the primary variable 
The primary objective is to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of ceritinib in patients with ALK -
positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges.  
2.7.1  Variable  
The primary endpoint used to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of ceritinib is the overall response 
rate (ORR), which is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response  
(BOR)  of CR or PR in the whole body, as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by the investigator. 
Best overall response 
The BOR will be assessed based on reported lesion responses at different evaluation time points. 
Both CR and PR must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed not less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met . The next scheduled assessment may be used for 
purposes of confirmation of response.   
BOR for each patient is determined from the sequence of overall (lesion) responses according 
to the following rules: 
• CR = at least two determinations of CR at least 4 w eeks apart before progression  
PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression  
(and not qualifying as  a CR)  
• SD = at least one SD assessment (or better) > 7 weeks after start of study drug (and not 
qualifying as a  CR or PR)  
• PD = progression ≤ 17 weeks after start of study drug (and not qualifying as a CR, PR or 
SD) 
• UNK = all other cases (i.e. not qualifying for confirmed CR or PR and without SD after 
more than 7 weeks or progression within the first 17 weeks)  
The cut -off for SD too early and PD too late were chosen based on tumor assessment schedule. 
Only tumor assessments performed before the start of any further anti -neoplastic therapies (i.e. 
any additional secondary anti -neoplastic therapy or anti -cancer surger y) will be considered in 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 19  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  the assessment of BOR.  If a patient receives any further anti -neoplastic therapy while on study, 
any subsequent assessments will be excluded from the BOR determination. Further  anti-
neoplastic therapies will be identified from the  data collected on ‘Anti -neoplastic therapies 
since last date of study drug’ as appropriate. Clinical deterioration will not be considered as 
documented disease progression. Patients with BOR ‘unknown’ will be summarized by reason for having unknown status. The following reasons will be used: 
• No valid post- baseline assessment  
• All post- baseline assessments have overall response UNK  
• New anti -neoplastic therapy started before first post- baseline assessment  
• Stable disease (SD) too early (≤ 7 weeks after start d ate of study drug) 
• PD too late (> 17 weeks after start date of study drug). 
Special (and rare) cases where BOR is ‘unknown’ due to both early SD and late PD will be 
classified as ‘SD too early’.  In case, a patient had only a non- measurable disease at basel ine, 
same cut -off (≤ 7 weeks after start date of study drug) will be applied for a response  of non -
CR/non-PD too early. 
2.7.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS. This is a n estimation based study 
and no statistical testing of hypothesis will be conducted.  
The primary efficacy endpoint ORR  per investigator  in the whole body will be estimated and 
the 95% exact binomial ( Clopper and Pearson 1934) confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided  
by study arm  and for all patients . Exact binomial  confidence intervals will be used since the 
confidence limits based on the normal approximation are not bounded by the [0, 1] interval, 
meaning that for rates close to 0 or 1, the upper limit of the normal approximation interval for the proportion could exceed 1 or the lower limit could be negative.  
Additionally, the ORR in the whole body will also be  summarized by prior radiation to the brain, 
prior ALK inhibitor use and overall using the data from Arms 1 through 4.  
2.7.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
Confirmed PR or CR reported prior to any additional anticancer therapy will be considered as 
responses in the calculation of the ORR , irrespective of the number of missed assessments 
before response.  
Patients with a best overall response (BOR) of ‘Unknown’ per RECIST 1.1 will be considered as non- responders when estimating ORR . Patie nts who have disease progression and continue 
to receive study drug after progression will qualify for PD at the time of progression and will be counted as PD in the derivation of ORR and any other efficacy endpoints. 
2.7.4  Supportive analyses  
Waterfall plots  representing the best percentage change from baseline in the sum of the tumor  
diameters for target lesions will be produced by prior ALKi use (Yes/No) for FAS . See 
Section 
4.6.1  for details on construction of waterfall graphs.

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  2.8.1.1  Key secondary endpoint  
The key secondary objective is t o evaluate Disease Control Rate (DCR) . The  DCR is defined 
as the proportion of patients with best overall response ( BOR ) of CR, PR  or SD in the whole 
body, as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by the investigator. 
DCR will be estimated and the exact binomial 95% CI (Clopper & Pearson, 1934) will be 
presented  by study arm and for all patients .  
Supportive and sensitivity analyses  
The DCR will also be summarized by prior radiation to the brain and by prior ALK inhibitor 
use. 
2.8.1.2  Other secondary endpoints  
The following intracranial, extracranial  and whole body (for lesions in and outside  the brain ) 
tumor- response related endpoints will be assessed separately based on investigator assessment  
and BIRC assessment  per RECIST 1.1 ( OERR, EDCR, TTER, DOER , ORR, DCR, T TR, DOR 
and PFS) or Modified RECIST 1.1 (OIRR, IDCR, TTIR, DOIR). 
2.8.1.2.1  Intracranial endpoints  
Overall intracranial response rate (OIRR ): OIRR is calculated based on response 
assessments in the brain for patients having measurable brain metastases at baseline. The OIRR 
is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR in the brain as assessed per modified RECIST 1.1.  
OIRR will be estimated and the exact binomial 95% CI will be presented  by study arm and for 
all patients . OIRR will also be summarized by prior radiotherapy to the brain (yes, no) and prior 
ALK inhibitor use (yes, no) and overall using the data from Arms 1 through 4. OIRR by the 
investigator and by BIRC will be summarized separately. 
Same analysis on OIRR will be conducted for patients having evaluable (measurable or non-
measurable) brain metastases at baseline.  
Intracranial disease control rate ( IDCR) at 8 and 16 weeks and overall : IDCR is calculated 
based on response assessments in the brain for patients having evaluable (measurable or non-measurable) brain metastases at baseline. In what follows, CR, PR and SD are possible 
responses only for patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline, while non -CR/non-
PD is a possible response only for patients without measurable brain metastases at baseline. 
• The IDCR at 8 and 16 weeks is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR, SD or non-CR/non- PD assessment in the brain  at Week 8 and Week 16 intracranial tumor 
evaluations respectively , taking into consideration 4- week window for each 
assessment, i.e.,  assessment done between study day 29 and 85 (both inclusive) for 
week 8 and study day 86 and 141 (both inclusive) for week 16, as per modified RECIST 1.1. If there are multiple tumor assessments within the defined window, the following rules should be used hierarchically to select the overall response contributing to the xx- week IDCR rate:  
1) PD - If at least one tumor assessment with overall response of PD;  
2) Unknown - if all tumor assessment with overall responses of unknown;

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  3) CR/PR/SD - Overall response from the latest tumor assessment within the 
window  
The assessment of SD too early or PD to o late will be considered as Unknown and 
following the same rule specified in SAP Section 2.7.1 . 
• IDCR overall is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, SD or non-CR/non-PD in the brain, as assessed per modified RECIST 1.1. 
IDCR will be estimated and the exact binomial 95% CI will be presented by study arm and for all patients . IDCR will also be summarized by prior radiotherapy to the brain (yes, no) and prior 
ALK inhibitor use (yes, no)  and overall  using the data from Arms 1 through 4. IDCR by the 
investigator and by BIRC will be summarized separately. 
Same analysis on overall IDCR will be conducted for patients having measurable brain 
metastases at baseline.  
Time to intracranial tumor respo nse (TTIR): TTIR  is defined as the time from the date of 
the first dose of ceritinib to the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) in the brain 
as assessed per  modified  RECIST 1.1 criteria  for patients with measurable brain metastases at 
baseline. 
TTIR will be summarized by frequency counts in time intervals and using descriptive statistics 
for patients with confirmed CR or PR. These analyses of TTIR will be performed separately based on in vestigator and BIRC 
assessment.  
Same analysis on TTIR will be conducted for patients having evaluable (measurable or non-
measurable) brain metastases at baseline.  
Duration of intracranial response (DOIR) : Among patients with measurable brain metastases 
at baseline and a confirmed response (PR or CR) in the brain per Modified RECIST 1.1, DOIR 
is defined as the time from the first documented response (PR or CR) in the brain to the date of 
the first documented disease progression in the brain or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, DOI R is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment . 
The censoring and event date options to be considered for the main analysis are presented in Table 2 -2. Please note that the intracranial/extracranial/whole body tumor assessments apply to 
intracranial (DOIR), extracranial (DOER) and whole body (DOR and PFS) endpoints, respectively.

Additionally, DOR will also be presented by prior radiotherapy to the brain (yes, no) and prior 
ALK inh ibitor use (yes, no) and overall using the data from Arms 1 through 4. 
These analyses of DOR will be performed separately based on investigator assessment and 
based on BIRC assessment. 
Progression -free survival (PFS):  PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of 
ceritinib to the date of the first radiologically  documented disease progression in the whole body 
per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause. A patient who has not progressed or died at the date 
of the analysis  cut-off will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor evaluation  
performed  on or before the cut -off date. By default, if disease progression or death for any 
reason is documented after one single missing tumor evaluation, the  actual event date of disease 
progression/death will be used for the PFS event date. If disease progression or death for any reason is documented after two or more missing tumor evaluations, the PFS time of these patients will be censored at the date of th e last adequate tumor evaluation without PD. Refer to 
Table 2 -2 for censoring and event date options and outcomes for PFS. See also Section 4.6.1 
describing the special case of a missing baseline tumor assessment.  
PFS will be described by study arm  using Kaplan- Meier methods, including estimated median 
(in months) with 95% CI, 25
th and 75th percentiles and Kaplan -Meier estimated probabilities 
with corresponding 95% CIs at pre -specified  time points.  Censoring reasons will also be 
summarized.  
These analyses will be performed separately based on investigator assessment and based on BIRC assessment.  Additionally, PFS will also be presented by prior radiotherapy to the brain 
(yes, no) and prior ALK inhibitor use (yes, no) and overall using the data from Arms 1 through 4. 
Overall survival (OS) : OS time is defined as time from the date of first dose of ceritinib to the 
date of  death due to any cause. OS time for patients who are alive by the date of the analysis 
cut-off or are lost to follow -up will be censored at the date of last contact.  
OS will be described by study arm  using Kaplan- Meier methods, including estimated median  
(in months) with 95% CI, 25
th and 75th percentiles and Kaplan -Meier estimated probabilities 
with corresponding 95% CIs at pre -specified  time points.  Censoring reasons will also be 
summarized.  
OS will be analyzed by study arm  using the data from study arms 1 through 5. However, Kaplan -
Meier curves of OS will not be produced for Arm 5 alone if the number of patients enrolled in 
this arm is ≤ 10.

Duration of Follow -up  
Follow- up in the study will be summarized using the following methods to provide a 
comprehensive assessment of follow-up for all patients.  
Summary of duration between start date of study drug and cut -off date, and follow -up times for 
PFS/OS, are defined as follows: 
• Duration between start date of study drug and data cut -off date = (Cut -off date – Start date 
of study drug + 1) / 30.4375 (months). 
• Follow- up time = (Date of event or censoring – Start date of study drug + 1) / 30.4375 
(months) regardless of censoring.  Date of censoring is defined as the last adequate tumor 
assessment date for PFS or last contact date (when the patient is known as alive) for OS.  
All summaries will be reported in months (see Section 4.3). The calculations for PFS will be 
based on investigator assessment and BIRC assessment .

Selecting Primary QT Correction for Heart Rate  
The analysis of QT data is complicated by the fact that the QT interval is highly correlated with 
heart rate.  Because of this correlation, formulas are routinely used to obtain a corrected value, denoted QTc, which is independent of heart rate. This QTc interval is intended to represent the QT interval at a standardized heart rate. Several correction formulas have been proposed in the literature. For this analysis we will use some of those methods of correction, as described below. The QT interval correcte d for heart rate by the Bazett’s formula, QTcB, is defined as  
RRQTQTcB=
, 
the QT interval corrected for heart rate by the Fridericia’s formula, QTcF, is defined as  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 31  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  3RRQTQTcF=
 , 
where RR represents the RR interval of the ECG, in seconds.   
Although Bazett’s correction is the historical standard, it does not perform  well when heart rate 
fluctuates. Fridericia’s formula may perform better under these conditions.  An alternate 
correction to achieve the goal of getting uncorrelated QTc and RR is based on linear or log-linear regression methods which yield, theoretically , uncorrelated QTc and RR.  
Linear regression method: 
• Fit a model QT = a + b * RR to baseline data  
• Use the estimated slope,  , 𝑏𝑏� , to correct QT  
• Corrected QT for heart rate will be computed as follows:  
QTcP = QT + 𝑏𝑏� * (1- RR)  
Data will be summarize d using QTcF and QTcB. However, if these are not appropriate for the 
data set due to an observed large correlation between corrected QT and HR using the baseline 
assessments, the results will also be summarized using QTcP.  
ECG Summaries  
The following analyses will be performed for each applicable ECG parameters ( RR, PR, QRS, 
QT, ventricular rate – denoted as HR in what follows, and QTc ) as noted. 
• Pearson correlation between QT and HR, QTc (QTcB, QTcF and, if applicable, QTcP) and HR using individual (non -averaged) baseline assessments and separately using on -treatment 
assessments  
• For each of the ECG parameters (HR, and QT, QTc, QRS, PR intervals), descriptive statistics at baseline, at each post -baseline time point and changes from baseline at each 
post- baseline time point  
• For each of the QTc and QT intervals, s hift table s based on notable parameter categories

The study will enroll approximately 160 patients, with approximately 40 patients each in 
Arms 1 and 2 and ~30 patients each in Arms 3 and 4 and at least 20 patients in Arm 5 (See Table 2 -4). It is assumed that 5% of the patients diagnosed with brain metastases have 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.  Additional patients in Arm 4 may be enrolled in order achieve 
approximately 60 patients in Arms 3 and 4 together (i.e. ALKi naïve patients) if enrollment rate in Arm 3 is slow.  
An observed ORR of 50% in 140 patients planned for Arms 1-4 will result in an exact binomial 
95% CI with a lower bound greater than 40% which is clinically meaningful and exceeds the ORR expected with available therapies ( Shaw 2012). Table 2 -4 provides the exact binomial 95% 
CI for various observed ORRs for the 140 patients and for each of the strata.

Estimation of the DCR is the key secondary objective of the study. An observed DCR of 65% 
in 140 patients  in Arms 1 -4 will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a lower bound greater 
than 55%. Table 2 -5 provides the ex act binomial 95% CI for various observed DCRs for the

An additional secondary objective of the study is estimation of the OIRR for patients with 
measurable brain metastases at baseline. As described in Section 4.1.1 of the study protocol , 
the study targets enrolling approximately 70 patients with measurable b rain metastases: ~ 50 
patients with prior ALKi treatment (Arms 1 and 2)  and ~ 20 patients with no prior ALKi 
treatment (Arms 3 and 4). An observed OIRR of 50% in 70 patients with measurable brain 
metastases will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a lowe r bound greater than 35%. An 
observed OIRR of 60 % in 50 patients with measurable brain metastases previously treated with 
ALKi (Arms 1 and 2)  will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a  lower bound greater than 
45%. An observed OIRR of 60% in 20 patients with measurable brain metastases not previously 
treated with ALKi (Arms 3 and 4)  will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a lower bound 
greater than 36%  (Table 2 -6). The reported OIRR with c rizotinib is 18% (95% CI: 5 - 40) for 
patients with measurable brain metastases and prior radiation therapy to the brain, and 33% (95% CI: 13 - 59) for patients without prior radiation to the brain; recent whole brain radiation was 
allowed ( Crino et al 2013 ).

4 Additional details on implementation of statistical 
methodology  
The sections below  contain additional details on statistical methodology that will be included 
in Appendix 16.1.9 (Documentation of Statistical Methods) of the CSR as well as rules details 
on programing rules that will be followed to implement the analyses described in Section 2 . 
4.1 Data included in the analyses 
This section provides additional details to those included in Section 2.1. 
Each analysis (primary analysis and final analysis ) will include the data with an assessment date 
or event start date (e.g. vital sign assessment date or start date of an adverse event) prior to or 
on the cut -off date. For example, if the cut -off date is 30DEC2008, an AE starting on 
28DEC2008 will  be reported, whereas an adverse event starting on 31DEC2008 will not be 
reported. 
4.2 Last contact date  
The last contact date will be derived for patients not known to have died at the analysis cut- off 
using the latest complete date among the following: 
• All patient assessment dates (e.g. blood draws (laboratory, ), vital signs, performance 
status, ECG, tumor assessments)  
• Start and end dates of antineoplastic therapies administered after study drug discontinuation ( with non-missing medication/procedure term). 
• AE start and end dates  (with non- missing verbatim AE term present) 
• From ‘Survival information’ eCRF: 

Novartis  Confidential  Page 39  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  • Last known date patient alive if answer to question ‘Is  subject alive?’ is ‘lost to 
follow-up’;  
• Date of assessment if answer to question ‘Is  subject a live?’ is Yes  
Note: If answer to question ‘Is subject alive?’ is ‘unknown’, neither ‘last known date patient alive’ nor ‘date of assessment’ is used  
• Study drug start and end date s from DAR with non -missing dose. Doses of 0 are allowed.  
• Concomitant medications/Surgical and Medical Procedures start and end dates  
• Date of discontinuation/study phase completion on the ‘End of treatment discontinuation’ and the ‘End of Post Treatment Phase Disposition’ eCRF s. 
The last contact date is defined as the latest complete date from the above list on or before the data cut -off date . The cut -off date will not be used for last contact date, unless the patient was 
seen or contacted on that date. Completely imputed dates (e.g. the analysis cut -off date 
programmatically  imputed to replace the missing end date of a dose administration record) will 
not be used t o derive the last contact date.  
Only dates associated with patient visits or actual examinations of the patient will be used in the der ivation. Dates associated wit h a technical operation unrelated to patient status such as 
the date a blood sample was processed will not be used. Assessment dates after the cutoff date 
will not be applied to the last contact date.  
Partial date imputation is allowed for event (death)/c ensoring if the date is coming from 
‘Survival information’ eCRF only.  If the day is missing for the ‘Date of assessment’ when 
answer to question ‘Is subject alive?’ is Yes, or ‘Last known date patient alive’ when answer to question ‘Is  subject alive?’ is  ‘lost to follow -up’, it will be imputed to 1
st day of the month and 
year. If imputed date is after cut -off date, then this date will not be applied to derive the last 
contact date.  
4.3 Month derivation 
For all derivations, a  month will be calculated as (365.25 / 12) = 30.4375 days. If duration is to 
be reported in months, duration in days will be divided by 30.4375. 
4.4 Age derivation 
Age for enrolled  patients or screen failures will be calculated based on the date when the patient 
signed the main study informed consent from the date of birth. 
4.5 Dose interruptions and dose changes 
This section provides additional details to those included in Section 2.6. Both dose interruption 
and dose change are analyzed based on CRF pages  based on the dose actually taken by the 
patients . 
An interruption is defined as a 0 mg dose taken on one or more days. What follows defines how 
dose interruptions will be counted in the case of multiple dose interruptions. 
• If an interruption occurs consecutively for at least two days due to the same reason, then it 
will be counted only once ( example: If the actual dose on days 1- 3 is 750 mg and actual 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 40  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  dose on days 4 -5 is 0 mg and dose interruption on days 4- 5 is due to AE, then the total 
number of dose interruptions is 1).  
• If an interruption occurs consecutively for at least two days due to different reasons, then it 
will be counted for each reason ( example: If the actual dose on days 1- 3 is 750 mg and 
actual dose on days 4 -5 is 0 mg and dose interruption on day 4 is due to AE and dose 
interruption on day 5 is due to dosing error, then the total number of dose interruptions is 2).  
• If an interru ption occurs for more than one day due to the same reason, but the days are not 
consecutive , i.e. there is at least one dosing day in between, then each dose interruption will be counted as a different occurrence ( example: if the actual dose on days 1, 3 and 5, is 
750 mg and actual dose on days 2 and 4 is 0mg, and dose interruptions on day 2 and 4 are both due to dosing error, the total number of dose interruptions is 2).  
A dose change is defined as a change in dosing from one record to the next. However, a dose interruption will not be counted as a dose change.  For example, for LDK378, in the sequence 
750 mg – 0 mg – 600 mg, the 600 mg dose will be counted as a dose change (with reason documented), preceded by a 0 mg due to interruption (with reason documented) . Dose 
reductions are a subset of dose changes where dose changes to higher than protocol planned 
dose are excluded . 
4.6 Efficacy endpoints  
For further details on efficacy endpoints, see Section 14 (Appendixes  2 and 3) of the 
LDK378A2205 protocol. For the evaluation of tumor -response related endpoints, response is 
assessed by investigator and BIRC according to RECIST 1.1 with the exception of intracranial endpoints following Modified RECIST 1.1. Additionally, intracranial endpoints are also 
evaluated by investigator and BIRC as exploratory endpoints according to RANO criteria. 
The text below gives more detailed instructions and rules needed for programming of the 
analyses described in Sections 2.7 and 2.8.1. 
4.6.1  I mplementation of RECIST g uidelines  
Disease progression  
PD should only be assigned if it is demonstrated  by an objective assessment method as per 
RECIST 1.1  (whole body and extracranial)  or Modified RECIST 1.1 ( intracranial ) (e.g. 
radiologic scan, histology for bronchoscopy, photos for skin lesions). If a new lesion is detected 
using an objective assessment method other than radiologic scan, it should be entered on the 
‘New lesion’ RECIST eCRF with appropriate method (or method=‘Other’).  
In particular, discontinuation due to disease progression or death due to progressive disease , 
without supporting objective evidence (as defined above), will not be considered as PD in the 
determination of BOR, the derivation of any efficacy endpoint or efficacy analysis.  
Change in imaging modality  
Per RECIST 1.1, a change in methodology can be defined as either a change in contrast use (e.g. 
keeping the same technique, like CT, but switching from with to without contrast use or vice -
versa, regardless of the justification for the change) or a change in technique (e.g. from CT to 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 41  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  MRI, or vice -versa), or a change in any other imaging modality. A change from conventional 
to spiral CT and vice versa while keeping same contrast use (e.g. switching from spiral CT with 
contrast to CT with contrast) is not considered a change in imaging modality . 
A change in methodology will result by default in a UNK (unknown) overall lesion response 
assessment. However, a response assessment other than the Novartis calculated UNK response may be accepted from the investigator or BIRC if a definitive response assessment can be justified based on the available information. Potential discrepancies between the modality used and overall lesion response reported by the investigator (e.g. change in modality but investigator assessment of response is different from UNK ) will be queried during the data validation 
process.  
Determination of missing adequate tumor assessments  
For the computation of ORR  (for primary analysis), patients without any radiological 
assessment after the start date of study drug will be counted as failure.  
Partial or complete responses reported prior to any additional anticancer therapy will be considered for ORR computation irrespective of the number of missed assessments before response. The anticancer therapy will be defined for intracranial, extracranial and whole body 
separately : e.g., radiotherapy to the brain wil only be considered as anticancer therapy for 
intracranial and whole body endpoints but not for extracranial endpoint. In this section, the 
‘missing adequate assessment’ is defined as assessment not done or assessment with overall lesion res ponse equal to UNK.  For the sake of simplicity, the ‘missing adequate assessment’ 
will also be referred as ‘missing assessment’.  
As detailed in Section 14 (Appendix 2) of the LDK378A2205 protocol and Table 2 -2 of SAP , 
the PFS censoring and event date options depend on the presence and the number of missing tumor assessments. For example, an event occurring after two or more missing assessments is censored in the analysis of PFS at the last adequate tumor assessment be fore the event date. 
An exact rule to determine whether there is none, one or two missing assessments is therefore needed. This rule will be based on the distance between the last adequate tumor assessment date and the event date.  
If the distance is larger  than threshold D
1 or D 2 then the analysis will assume one or two missing 
assessments, respectively. The threshold D 1 will be defined as the protocol specified interval 
between the tumor assessments plus the protocol allowed window around the assessments. Similarly, the threshold D
2 is defined as two times the protocol specified interval between the 
tumor assessments plus the protocol allowed window around the assessments. In this study, the protocol defined schedule of tumor assessment is every 8 weeks and each assessment is 
expected to be performed at the scheduled time point plus or minus 1 week, i.e. the window is 2 week s, then any distance larger than D
1 = 8+2 = 10 weeks means one missing assessment and 
any distance larger than D 2 = (2*8) + 2 = 1 8 weeks  means two missing assessments.  
The same definition of D 2 will be used to determine the PFS censoring reason.  
Possible censoring reasons for PFS are: 
1: Ongoing without event 2: Lost to follow-up 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 42  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  3: Withdrew consent 
4: Adequate assessment no longer available 5: Event after >=2 missing tumor assessments  
Non-measurable disease at baseline  
As specified in Section 14 (Appendix 2) of the LDK378A2205 protocol, the RECIST 1.1 
criteria imply  that only patients with measurable disease at baseline  (at least one extracranial 
measurable lesion  as per inclusion criteria ) should be included in the study. If a patient without 
measurable disease is enrolled, the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle requires including these 
patients in the analys es. Hence, analyses will be based on FAS including patients with either 
measurable or non- measurable disease. Therefore, a rule needs to be specified on how to handle 
these cases.  
As specified in Table 3 -1 of Sectio n 14 (Appendix 2) of the LDK378A220 5 protocol, overall 
lesion response can be derived for patients without measurable disease at baseline  as follows 
(Table 4 -1). 
Table 4-1 Overall lesion response at each assessment: patients with non -target 
disease only  
Non-target lesions  New Lesions  Overall lesion 
response  
CR No CR 
Non-CR/Non -PD1 No Non-CR/non -PD 
UNK  No UNK  
PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Yes PD 
1 In general, the non- CR/non -PD response for these patients is considered equivalent to an SD 
response in endpoint determination.  
Missing baseline tumor assessment  
As specified in Section 14 (Appendix 2) of the protocol, since the timing of PD cannot be 
determined for patients with missing baseline tumor assessment, these patients are censored in the PFS analysis at the start date of treatment. This rule, however, only applies to the ‘PD component’ of the PFS or DOR  asse ssment.   
Patients without baseline tumor assessment who die within D
2 distance from start date of 
treatment will be counted as having an event in the primary analysis of PFS.  All deaths will be counted in the OS analysis regardless of presence or absence of the baseline tumor assessment.  
Construction of waterfall graphs  
The waterfall graphs will be used to depict the anti -tumor activity. These plots will display the 
best percentage change from baseline in the sum of the measured diameter of all target lesions for each patient.  The proportions of patients with various degrees of tumor shrinkage or growth can then represent a useful efficacy metric.  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 43  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  However, caution needs to be paid to the assessments, where an occurrence of a new lesion or 
worsening in non- target lesions (resulting in PD as an overall lesion response at gi ven 
assessment) contradicts the measurements obtained on target lesions.  These assessments will not be displayed as bars in the graph. If such a “contradicting” assessment represents the only post- baseline assessment for a patient, then the patient will b e represented by a special symbol 
(e.g. *) in the waterfall graph. 
The assessments with unknown target response and also assessments with unknown overall 
response will be excluded. Patients without any valid assessments will be completely excluded from the  graphs. 
The total number of patients displayed in the graph needs to be shown and this number will be used as a denominator when calculating the percentages of patients with tumor shrinkage and tumor growth.  Footnote will explain the reason for excluding some patients (due to absence of 
any valid assessment).  
All possible assessment scenarios are described in Table 4 -2. 
Table 4-2 Inclusion/exclusion of assessments used in waterfall graph  
Criteria for inclusion/exclusion  Possible source of 
contradictions  
Target response Overall lesion

CR/PR/SD  PD Yes but as * only  PD any 
CR/PR/SD  PD Yes but as * only  any Yes 
UNK  UNK or PD  No any any 
CR/PR/SD  UNK  No UNK  No 
CR/PR/SD  CR/PR/SD  Yes as a bar  SD/IR  No 
PD PD Yes as a bar  any any 
The following algorithm will be used to construct the graph: 
1. Select “valid” post- baseline assessments to be included, i.e. for each patient and each 
assessment repeat the following four steps: 
1.1. Check the target lesion response and overall lesion response at each assessment.  If at least 
one of them is UNK then exclude the whole assessment.  Otherwise, go to step 1.2. 
1.2. Check the overall lesion response.  If PD , then go to step 1.3. Otherwise, go to step 1.4 
1.3. Check target response.  If PD , then go to step 1.4.  Otherwise flag the assessment  . 
1.4. Calculate the % change from baseline in target lesions.  
2. For each patient, go through all valid assessments identified in step 1 and find the 
assessment with best % change from baseline in target lesions.  The “best” means best for the patient, i.e. the largest shrinkage or if a  patient only has assessments with tumor growth 
take the assessment where the growth is minimal. ( Example 1 : Patient 1 has the following % 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 44

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  changes from baseline at assessments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively: -10%; - 25%; -13%; -4% 
and +6%. His/her best % change is then -25%. Example 2: Patient 2 has the following % 
changes from baseline at assessments 1, 2 and 3, respectively: +5%; +18% and +35%. 
His/her best % change is then +5%.  
3. Construct the waterfall graph displaying the best % change from baseline for e ach patient. 
Patients having only   flagged assessment(s) will be displayed separately.  
The recommended way of the display from left to right is: 
1. Bars above the horizontal axis representing tumor growth  
2. Bars under the horizontal axis representing tumor shrinkage 
3.  “Zero” bars with   symbol representing patients with contradiction 
4.6.2  Implementation of RANO guidelines (protocol Appendix 3)  
As described in the protocol, intracranial endpoints (OIRR, IDCR, DOIR, and TTIR in the brain) 
will also be evaluated by RANO criteria as exploratory endpoints. This section provides some 
details on how to derive these intracranial endpoints by RANO and further details are included in the protocol Appendix 3. 
RANO vs. RECIST 1.1  
In this study, intracranial endpoints will be evaluated by both RECIST 1.1 and RANO . 
Measurable disease by RANO is defined as bi -dimensionally, contrast -enhancing, measurable 
lesions with clearly defined margins by CT or MRI scan, with a minimal diameter of 10mm, 
and visible on 2 axial slices which are at least 5 mm apart with 0 mm skip. Measurement of tumor around a cyst or surgical cavity, if necessary, requires a minimum thickness of 3 mm.  
The major differences between RECIST 1.1 and RANO include: 
• The measurability criteria for target lesion by RANO is based on two dimensions and is 
more stringent than the RECIST 1.1 criteria, therefore, the number of target lesions by RANO is no more than the number of target lesions by RECIST 1.1; 
• In RECIST 1.1, only one diameter is recorded for each target lesion, while in RANO, two perpendicular diameters are measured for each target lesion;  
• In RANO, corticosteroids use and clinical status are also considered for determining 
overall response; 
• There are two types of non -target lesions by RANO: non-enhancing lesions and non-
measurable enhancing lesions. Both types of non-target lesions contribute to the non-target lesion response. 
Overall Lesion Response Collected on RANO eCRF page  
Intracranial endpoints by RANO will be derived based on the collected overall lesion response on eCRF page “RANO Overall Lesion Response” (ZR domain, ZRCAT = ”RESPONSE ASSESSMENT IN NEURO- ONCOLOGY”, and ZRSCAT = ”OVERALL LESION 
RESPONSE”). The derivation of intracranial endpoints (OIRR, IDCR, DOIR, TTIR and TTP in the brain) by RANO is the same as by RECIST 1.1. 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 45  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  Calculation of Overall Lesion Response by RANO  
Overall lesi on responses by RANO are also calculated from the following components: 
1. Target lesion measurements;  
2. Non-target lesion response;  
3. New lesion present (Yes/No);  
4. Corticosteroids use; 
5. Clinical status.  
All these components are collected on the following eCRF page s: 
1. RANO target lesion - Measurable enhancing lesion (T1) (ZI domain, ZICAT = 
”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN METASTASES”, ZISCAT = ”TARGET ENHANCING T1”);  
2. RANO non -target lesion - Non -measurable enhancing lesion (T1) (ZI domain, ZICAT = 
”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN METASTASES”, ZISCAT = ”NON -
TARGET ENHANCING T1”);  
3. RANO non -target lesion - Non -enhancing lesion (T2/FLAIR) (ZI domain, ZICAT = 
”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN METASTASES”, ZISCAT = ”NON -
TARGET NON ENHANCING T2/FLAIR”);  
4. RANO New Lesion (Z I domain, ZICAT = ”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN 
METASTASES”, ZISCAT = ”NEW”);  
5. Corticosteroids use and c linical status  are collected on the Modified RANO Assessment 
(ZR domain, ZRCAT =  ”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN METASTASES”, 
ZISCAT = ”RESPONSE AS SESSMENT”).  
Unlike in RECIST 1.1, each target lesion by RANO criteria has two perpendicular diameters collected. In order to calculate the target lesion response, the product of the two perpendicular diameters is calculated for each target lesion. Then the sum of the products of all target lesions is compared to the baseline or nadir to determine the target lesion response.  
The non- target lesion response is collected on the field of “Non- target lesion present” in the 
Modified RANO Assessment page, and is evaluated based on both non- target lesion eCRF 
pages as shown above. However, no derivation will be performed from individual non- target 
lesion status to non-target lesion response.  The RANO response/progression crit eria are summarized in Table 4 -3.  
Please note that patients with non -measurable disease in brain at baseline are allowed to  be 
enrolled in the study. According to RANO criteria, these patients with non- measurable disease 
in brain cannot have a response of CR or PR in the brain, and the best response they can achieve 
is stable disease (SD) in the brain.

Two fields in the Modified RANO Assessment page will not be used for any data analysis in 
the study: “New enhancement outside radiation field?”, “Tumor present in histopathology”. 
As in RECIST 1.1, PD should only be assigned if it is demonstrated by an objective assessment 
method as per RANO. Discontinuation due to disease progression or death due to progressive disease, without supporting objective evidence, will not be considered as PD.  
As in RECIST 1.1, the same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. The details of 
change in imaging modality are described in Section 4.6.1. 
The same principle will be followed for determining missing adequate tumor assessments, as 
described in section 4.6.1.  
4.6.3  Sources for overall lesion  response  
The tumor endpoints derivation is based on the sequence of overall lesion responses at each 
assessment/time point. However, the overall lesion response at a given assessment/time point will be provided from different sources as illustrated in  Table 4 -4. 
Table 4-4 Sources for overall lesion response  
Source 1  Investigator (local radiology) reported overall lesion response 
(intracranial, extracran ial and whole body)  
Source 2 BIRC (Blinded Independent review committee) reported overall lesion 
response  (intracranial, extracranial and whole body)  
In this study, Source 1 will be used for the primary endpoint ORR, the key secondary endpoint DCR and other secondary endpoint calculations based on investigator assessment ( OIRR, IDCR, 
TTIR, DOIR, OERR, EDCR, TTER, DOER, DOR, TTR , and PFS).  Source 2 will be used to 
calculate OIRR, IDCR, TTIR, DOIR, OERR, EDCR, TTER, DOER, ORR, DCR, DOR, TTR, 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 47  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  and PFS by BIRC . In addition, OIRR, TTIR, DOIR, and IDCR are also assessed according to 
RANO from both Source 1 and 2.  
4.6.4    Kaplan -Meier estimates  
To analyze time to  event variables ( DOIR, TTIR, DOER, TTER, DOR, TTR, OS and PFS) a n 
estimate of the surv ival function will be constructed using Kaplan- Meier (product -limit) 
method  as implemented in SAS PROC LIFETEST with METHOD=KM option (see example 
below). The TIME state ment will include a variable with survival times ( survtime  in the 
example below) and a (right) censoring variable ( censor  in the example below) with a value of 
1, representing censoring: 
PROC LIFETEST data = dataset   
METHOD = KM  
CONFTYPE=LOGLOG; 
TIME survtime* censor(1); 
RUN; 
/* survtime  represents variable containing event/censor times; 
censor represents censoring variable (1 = censored, 0 = event); */  
Kaplan -Meier survival and failure function estimates from this procedure will be used to 
construct the Kaplan -Meier figures . 
Median survival will be obtained along with 2- sided 95% CIs calculated from PROC 
LIFETEST output using the method of Brookmeyer & Crowley, 1982.  
Kaplan -Meier estimates with 2 -sided 95% CIs at specific time points will be summarized.  The 
time points can be expressed in weeks or in months depending on the time -to-event variable.  
The CIs will be constructed using Greenwood’s formula [Collet, 1994, p.23]  for the standard 
error of the Kaplan -Meier estimate.  
The PROC LIFETEST statement will use the option CONFTYPE=LOGLOG. The 
CONFTYPE option specifies the transformation applied to the survival function to obtain the point- wise confidence intervals and the confidence intervals for the quartiles of the survival 
times. The LOGLOG keyword specifies the complementary log- log transformation (Collett, 
1994; Lachin, 2000) g(x)=log( -log(x)) which ensures that the point -wise confidence intervals 
are always within interval [0,1]. Although the LOGLOG is the default option in SAS v 9.4, it should be explicitly shown. 
The Kaplan -Meier graphs will be constructed using SAS software.  
4.6.5  Confidence interval  for response rate s 
The estimate of the  response rates ( OIRR, IDCR, OERR,  EDCR  ORR , DCR ) will be 
summarized in terms of percentage rates with 95% CIs. An exact binomial confidence interval 
(implemented using SAS procedure FREQ with EXACT statement for one- way tables) will be 
calculated (Clopper and  Pearson,1934).  
SAS procedure FREQ will be used to estimate the proportion of responders (binary outcome = 1 or “Yes”), along with the  associated 95% (=100 × (1 – two-sided alpha level )) two-sided exact 
binomial CI. These estimates are obtained as follows :

proc freq data = dataset;  table binary event /  
binomial( 
level = “Yes”) 
alpha = two-sided alpha level ; 
exact binomial; 
When there are no responders, SAS does not produce a CI by default. To obtain a CI in this 
situation, PROC FREQ is used as specified above except changing level =”No” . From the results 
of this modified procedure, the values in percent of the LCL and UCL of a 0% response rate are calculated as follows:  
LCL
LEVEL=”Yes”  (%) = 100% - UCL LEVEL=”No”  (%) 
UCL LEVEL=”Yes”  (%) = 100% - LCL LEVEL=”No”  (%) 
4.7 Safety evaluation s 
The text below gives more detailed instructions and rules needed for programming of the analyses described in  Section 2.8.2. 
4.7.1  Multiple assessments within post -baseline visits  
For all analyses regarding abnormal assessments or analyses based on worst or best post-
baseline value (laboratory, ECGs, vital signs, WHO  performance status), all post -baseline 
values will be included (scheduled, unscheduled, repeat). All unscheduled and repeat 
measurements will be included in listings.  
Laboratory  Data   
For laboratory data, assessments can  be collected from both local and central laboratory on the 
same date. For shift tables using CTC grades to compare baseline to the worst post -baseline 
value, the assessment with worst post -baseline value is used for analyses irrespective of the 
source. Fo r LFT summaries, where concurrent measurements are used in the calculation of 
number and percentage of patients with worst post -baseline values, the assessment with worst 
post- baseline value is used (since worst values are based on the largest ratio of lab  value to its 
ULN for each patient) although the worst values for the different parameters may be coming 
from different laboratories. 
ECGs  
For all patients, 3 ECGs are targeted to be measured at the protocol -defined (nominal) time-
points. If a patient has more than one measurement at a nominal time point, the average of all 
available measurements associated with the nominal time  point will be used for the analyses.   
4.7.2  Baseline  
As defined in Section 2.6, the last available assessment before or on the date of start of study 
drug is defined as “baseline” value or “baseline” assessment.  
Laboratory data  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 49  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  If both central and local laboratory assessments wer e performed on the same date and 
corresponding to the baseline assessment date , then the central laboratory assessment will be 
used for the calculation of baseline. 
ECGs   
Baseline for ECG measurement is the average of all available measurements (unscheduled, if 
applicable) taken prior to dosing on the date associated with the last available ECG measurement before or on the date of start of study treatment. To determine whether ECG measurement was taken prior to dosing, ECG time will be compared with dosing time, if available. Unscheduled assessments will be included in the calculation of the average if ECG time is before dosing time. Study day 1 scheduled pre -dose ECGs will be considered to have 
been obtained prior to study drug administration if dosing time or ECG time is missing.  
If a scheduled pre -dose measurement actually occurred post -dose, then the corresponding 
measurement will be treated and analyzed similar to an unscheduled post- dose measurement.  
For unscheduled assessments on study day 1, 
• if dosing time is non -missing, then the assessment is classified as post- baseline if ECG 
time is later than dosing time.  
• if dosing time is missing, the assessment is classified as post- baseline.  
The same ECG assessments will be used for both qualitative and quantit ative baseline 
evaluations. 
4.7.3  Laboratory Parameters 
This section provides further detail on the analysis of laboratory parameters that will be listed 
and summarized as described in Section 2.8.2.  
Hematology Hematolog ic tests include: Hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells 
(RBC), differential (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils (% or 
absolute) 
The following rules will be applied to derive the WBC differential counts when only 
percentages are available (this is mainly for neutrophils and lymphocytes, because CTC grading 
is based on the absolute counts).  
The method to convert the value is straightforward: for each patient , the original lab value (%) 
is divided by 100 and multiplied by WBC count e.g. for neutrophils (NEU): 
NEU count = (WBC count) * (NEU%value/100) 
In order to derive the corresponding absolute normal range,  the rule to be applied depends on 
the availability of the % range and the absolute range for the differential: 
• If % range missing and absolute range missing, then use pre -defined normal range 
reported in the Merck manual 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 50  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  • If %  absolute range NOT missing (% range is or isn’t missing), then use the absolute 
range provided by the site 
• If % range NOT miss ing and absolute range missing, then the % normal limits ( i.e. LLN 
and ULN) are divided by 100 and multiplied by the corresponding normal limits of WBC count, e.g. for neutrophils NEU): 
LLN for NEU count = (LLN for WBC count)* (LLN for NEU%value /100) ULN for NEU count = (ULN for WBC count)*(ULN for NEU%value/100) 
Biochemistry  
The following calculation will be applied for corrected calcium in SI unit: 
Corrected calcium (mmol/L)=measured total Ca (mmol/L)+0.02 (40 -serum albumin[g/L]), 
where 40 represents the average albumin level in g/L. 
4.8 Handling of missing or partial dates 
For patients not known to have died prior to the cut- off date:  
• All events with start date before or on the cut -off date, and with end date missing or 
after the cut -off date  or after the date of withdrawal of informed consent  will be reported 
as “continuing”.  
• This approach applies, in particular, to AEs and concomitant medication reports. For these 
events, the end date will not be imputed and therefore will not appear in the listings.  
If imputation of an end date is required for a specific analysis (e.g. for a dose administration 
record with missing end date or last date of study drug after the cut -off date), the end date will 
be imputed by the minimum of death date, cut-off date  and withdrawal of informed consent 
date for the purpose of calculating duration of exposure to study drug and dose intensity. The 
imputed date will be displayed and flagged in the listings. 
4.8.1  AE date i mputation  
Date imputation is the creation of a new, complete date from a partial one according to an a greed 
and acceptable algorithm.  Missing date for AE will be handled according to rules specified 
below. A partial date is simply an incomplete date e.g. DDOCT2001: the days are missing from 
this DDMMMYYYY date.  
Partial AE start dates, if left partial, would ultimately mean the following  
It would not be possible to place the AE in time. 
Therefore the treatment/dosage at the time of the event would be unknown. Therefore the event could not be reported/summarized appropriately – if at all.  
Therefore it is important to perform date imputation to ensure that as many data events are 
represented as correctly as possible. Of course partial and/or missing dates should also  be 
caught as edit checks and passed back to the in vestigator for resolution. 
There will be no  attempt to impute the following:

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  4.8.4  Incomplete date for anti -neoplastic therapies  
Prior therapies  
Start date:  
The same rule which is applied to the imputation of AE/concomitant medication start date 
will be used with the exception that for  scenario (B) will be replaced to be ‘start date of 
study drug - 1’. 
End date: 
Imputed date = min (start date of study drug, last day of the month), if day is missing; 
Imputed date = min (start date of study drug, 31DEC), if month and day are missing. If the end date is not missing and the imputed start date is after the end date, use the end 
date as the imputed start date.  
If both the start date and the end date are imputed and if the imputed start date is after the 
imputed end date, use the imputed end dat e as the imputation for the start date.  
Post therapies  
Start date : 
Imputed date = max (last date of study drug + 1, first day of the month), if day is missing; 
Imputed date = max (last date of study drug + 1, 01JAN), if day and month are missing.  
End date: No imputation.  
4.8.5  Incomplete assessment dates for tumor assessment  
All investigation dates (e.g. X-ray, CT scan) must be completed with day, month and year. If one or more investigation dates are incomplete but other investigation dates are available, the 
incomplete date(s) are not considered for calculation of the assessment date and assessment date is calculated as the latest of all investigation dates (e.g. X -ray, CT -scan) if the overall lesion 
response at that assessment is CR/PR/SD/UNK. Otherwise, if o verall lesion response is PD, the 
assessment date is calculated as the earliest date of all investigation dates at that evaluation number.  If all measurement dates have no day recorded, the 1
st of the month is used.  
If the month is not completed, for any of the investigations, the respective assessment will be 
considered to be at the date which is exactly between the previous and the following assessment. 
If both a previous and following assessment s are not available, this assessment will not be used 
for any calculation s.  
In case of multiple imaging scans performed within an evaluation, if some imaging dates for tumor assessment under the same evaluation for a patient are before as well as after cut -off, the 
entire evaluation will not be included for analyses based on the pre-specified cut- off.

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  4.8.6  Incomplete date for death  
All dates must be completed with day, month and year. 
If the day or month is  missing, death date will be imputed to the maximum of the  full (non-
imputed) last contact date (excluding th e date of death) and the following: 
• Missing day:   1st day of the month and year of death 
• Missing day and month:    Jan 1st of the year of death  
4.8.7  Incomplete dates for last dose of study drug 
Scenario 1  
If the last date of study drug is after the cut -off date or is completely missing and there is no 
end of treatment eCRF page and no death date the patient should be considered to be on-going 
and use the cutoff date for the analysis as the last dosing date. 
Scenario 2  
If the last date of study drug is completely or partially missing and there is EITHER an end of treatment eCRF page OR a death date available then imputed last dose date:  
 = 31DECYYYY, if only Year is available and Year < Year of min (EOT visit date, death 
date)  
= Last day of the month, if both Year and Month are available and EITHER  
     -- Year = Year of min (EOT visit date, death date) and Month < the month of min (EOT 
visit date, death date)  OR, 
    -- Year < Year of min (EOT date, death date) irrespective of the month  
    = min (EO T visit date, death date), for all other cases . 
The imputed date will be compared with start date of study drug.  
If the imputed date < start date of study drug, then last date of study drug is set to start date of study drug; 
 Otherwise, use the imputed date.  
4.8.8  Incomplete dates for disease progression prior to start of study drug 
If day of PD associated with prior antineoplastic medication is missing then imputed PD date: 
= min (midpoint between the end date of the prior antineoplastic medication and the end of the month, start date of LDK, start date of prior medication from the next regimen), if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in the same month as the PD date,  
= min (15th of the month of the PD date, start date of LDK, start date of prior medication from the next regimen), if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in a month prior to the PD date 
= 15th of the month of the PD date, if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in a month after the PD date.

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  If both day and month of PD associated with prior antineoplastic medication are missing then 
imputed PD date: 
= min (midpoint between the end date of the prior antineoplastic medication and the end of the 
year, start date of LDK, start date of prior medication from the next regimen), if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in the same year as the PD date  
= min (July 1 of the year of the PD date, start date of LDK, start date of prior medication from the next regimen), if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in  a year prior to the PD date  
= July 1 of the year of the PD date, if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in a year after the PD date  
Completely missing PD dates will not be imputed. The start date of medication from the next regimen is based on the earliest start date of any medication(s) from the next regimen. For the mid-point calculation, if odd days in between, (e.g. last dose of medication is 27 June 2012, and 
end of the month is 30 June 2012), then use the next day from the midpoint calculation (e.g. mid-point is 29 June 2013).

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  3 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   1. General  Information  
Vadadustat is a synthetic, orally bioavailable, small molecule which acts as an inhibitor of hypoxia - 
inducible  factor  prolyl -hydroxylases  (HIF -PHs)  and is currently  being develo ped as a potential  therapy 
for anemia of chronic kidney disease. This clinical trial aims at evaluating the efficacy of vadadustat 
on the prevention and treatment of ARDS in hospitalized patients with COVID -19 
 
2. Background  Information  
2.1. Oxygen Homeostasis and Hypoxia- Inducible  Factor  
Erythropoiesis is closely regulated in response to changes in tissue oxygenation levels. It is controlled 
in a large part by changing levels or the oxygen- sensitive transcription factor known as Hypoxia 
Inducible Factor, or HIF. HIF largely exists as two related but distinct isoforms: HIF -1 and  
HIF-2. HIF controls pathways that facilitate oxygen delivery to cells and allow adaptation to 
hypoxia (Siddiq et al., 2007), including the expression of EPO (Peyss onnaux et al., 2007; Semenza, 
1999). 
 
The transcriptionally active form of HIF is a heterodimeric protein consisting of an oxygensensitive 
HIF-α subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF -β subunit. Under normoxic conditions, the HIF -α 
subunit is produced and continuously degraded with a t ½ of approximately 5 minutes (Berra et al., 
2001). This degradation is initiated by a family of enzymes known as the HIF -prolyl hydroxylase 
domain, (or HIF -PHD or HIF -PH) enzymes (Bishop and Ratcliffe, 2014; Ke and Costa, 2006). The 
HIF-PHs function as critical sensors of cellular oxygen levels, and regulate oxygen homeostasis in 
response to hypoxia through inhibition of hydroxylation thus leading to stabilization of HIF -α, which 
in turn signals gene transcription and trans lation of proteins necessary for the cellular and organ 
responses to poor oxygenation (Myllyharju, 2013; Siddiq et al., 2007). 
 
2.2. Inhibition of HIF PHD  enzymes  
The general,  molecular  mechanism  of action  proposed for small molecule  HIF-PHD  inhibitors  such as 
vadadustat has been described extensively (Joharapurkar et al., 2018; Rabinowitz, 2013) and is illustrated in the Figure 1. Under conditions of tissue oxygen repletion (normal O
2, top Figure 1), the 
HIF-PHD enzymes rapidly hydroxylate HIF signaling its degradation in the proteasome. However, 
under low oxygen conditions (bottom, Figure 1), the HIF -PHD enzymes are substrate (O 2) deficient 
and inhibited leading to the accumulation of the HIF - subunit, translocation to the nucleus and 
activation of transcriptio nal protocols that signal hypoxia -protective pathways. Vadadustat acts in a 
manner similar to physiological hypoxia, by inhibiting PHD enzymes in the active site, leading to 
stabilization  and increased  levels  of HIF-α, and upregulation of  hundreds  of genes  involved in  cellular 
protection from and adaptation to pathologically low oxygen levels (Haase, 2017; Rabinowitz, 2013).

2.3. Vadadustat  
Vadadustat  is a small molecule active -site inhibitor of the HIF -PHD enzymes, the inhibition of which 
leads to increases in cellular HIF —the “hypoxic response” (see Figure 1). HIF -PHD enzymes are 2 - 
oxoglutarate -dependent dioxygenases that require molecular oxygen in order to affect hydroxylation 
of proline residues in the oxygen- dependent degradation domain of HIF -α, and require Fe2+ and 
ascorbate as essential cofactors (Appelhoff et al., 2004; Masson and Ratcliffe, 2003). Each of the 3 
known human HIF -PH isoenzymes regulate HIF -1α and HIF -2α in a nonredundant manner that is 
dependent upon the degree of hypoxia and the relative abundance of the specific HIF -PH isozyme in 
different tissues (Appelhoff et al., 2004; Fong and Takeda, 2008; Kant et al., 2013). Thus, pharma cologic inhibition of HIF -PHs represents a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of 
anemia and also cellular and organ protection against ischemic insult (Lee et al., 2019; Schodel and Ratcliffe, 2019).  
 
2.4. The Role  of HIF  in Acute Lung  Inflammatory Diseases  such  as COVID- 19 and Associated 
Organ  Failure  
Coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID -19) is a recently  emerged  respiratory  disease  caused  by severe acute 
respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2). During the past months, COVID - 19 has 
become a pandemic with currently over 2 million patients affected worldwide and over 600,000 documented infected patients only in the US ( https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html ). While  most 
patients  with COVID -19 only experience mild to moderate symptoms, approximately 15% will proceed 
to severe pneumonia and about 5% among those patients will go on to experience life - threatening 
acute respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS)  (Cao,  2020;  Huang  et al., 2020;  Wu et al., 2020;  Xu et al., 
2020; Zhou et al., 2020). 

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  5 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   ARDS is an acute form of lung disease characterized by acute bilateral pulmonary edema, severe 
hypoxia – usually requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation (Ranieri et al., 2012; Thompson et 
al., 2017). Using the 2012 Berlin Definition (Table 2), stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS 
are associated with increased mortality (27%; 95% CI, 24% -30%; 32%; 95% CI, 29%34%; and 45%; 
95% CI, 42% -48%) and increased median duration of mec hanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; 
interquartile [IQR], 2 -11; 7 days; IQR, 4- 14; and 9 days; IQR, 5- 17, respectively).

 Severe ARDS: <  100 mmHg  
 
Therapeutic approaches for ARDS are very limited and currently focus on vigilant supportive care, 
prevention of nosocomial infections, and protective mechanical ventilation (Eltzschig et al., 2014; 
Thompson et al., 2017;  Vohwinkel  et al., 2015;  Ware and Matthay,  2000). Similarly,  treatment  options 
for COVID -19 or COVID -19 associated ARDS are extremely limited. During COVID associated 
ARDS, an uncontrolled immune response with excessive infiltration of myeloid inflammatory cells and uncontrolled lung inflammation are characteristic features (Cao, 2020). The search f or anti - 
inflammatory treatment approaches that could dampen excessive immune activation as a therapeutic strategy to decrease COVID -associated ARDS mortality is an area of intense investigation (Wu et al., 
2020). Based on an extensive literature documenti ng effects as well as organ -protective effects of  HIF 
stabilization in the area of acute injury, we propose vadadustat may offer benefit to patients suffering from COVID -19 and related acute respiratory  syndromes. 
 
2.4.1. Lung Protection  
During conditions of hypoxia and ischemia, HIF is stabilized and triggers a wide -ranging of adaptive 
responses through activation of hypoxia -responsive gene products, such as erythropoietin (Eltzschig 
and Carmeliet,  2011;  Semenza,  2011;  Semenza,  2012). Several  HIF target -genes  have been  implicated 
in improving ARDS outcomes: HIF -dependent increases in extracellular adenosine signaling 
(Eltzschig et al., 2012; Idzko et al., 2014a; Idzko et al., 2014b), increases in the glycolytic capacity of alveolar  epithelia  (Eckle et al., 2013a), or other  anti-inflammatory  signaling pathways  that promote  the 
resolution of mucosal inflammation (Clambey et al., 2012; Eckle et al., 2013a; Eckle et al., 2008a; Eckle et al., 2007; Eckle et al., 2014; Hoegl et al., 2015; Kiers et al., 2018; McClendon et  al., 2017; 
Mirakaj  et al., 2010;  Morote -Garcia et al., 2009;  Mutz  et al., 2010;  Reutershan  et al., 2009;  Rosenberger 
et al., 2009). For example,  experimental  studies  indicate  that during ARDS,  HIF is stabilized  and 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  6 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   provides protection from ARDS, as part of an endogenous protective pathway that could be targeted 
therapeutically  (Eckle et al., 2013a;  McClendon et al., 2017). Studies  in mice  with targeted  deletion  of 
HIF in alveolar epithelia revealed a more severe degree of ARDS, including increased pulmonary edema, increased lung inflammation and attenuated survival time. Similarly, studies utilizing pharmacologic  inhibitors  of the HIF-pathway  demonstrated  increased  lung injury and attenuated  ARDS 
survival  time. In contrast,  pretreatment  with pharmacologic  HIF-activators  is associated  with protection 
from ARDS induced by mechanical ventilation including attenuated pulmonary edema, improved gas exchange and improved survival (Eckle et al., 2013a). Taken togeth er, these studies provide strong 
experimental  evidence showing that HIF activators  can be used therapeutically  to prevent  or treat lung 
inflammation during  ARDS.  
 
Acute lung injury (ALI) leads to pulmonary edema and hypoxia. Increase permeability of endothelial 
cells leads to protein rich fluid accumulation in alveoli (smallest airspaces in the lung) and thereby 
impairing gas (oxygen or O
2 and carbon dioxide or CO 2) exchange (Shimoda and Semenza, 2011; 
Urrutia and Aragones , 2018; Vohwinkel et al., 2015). Hypoxia itself may contribute to lung injury 
and thereby perpetuate the injury by impairing endothelial cells, attracting white blood cells, and 
promoting inflammation. Stabilizing HIF has been shown to be protective during ALI (Huang et al., 
2019; Li et al., 2020a; Nagamine et al., 2016). HIF -1 stabilization has been shown to reduce I 
preclinically through both optimizing carbohydrate metabolism (shift to glycolysis) (Eckle et al., 2013a) and through upregulation of anti - inflammatory adenosine signaling (Bowser et al., 2017; 
Eckle et al., 2008a; Eckle et al., 2008b; Eckle et al., 2013b; Eckle et al., 2014; Hoegl et al., 2015) as 
well as improvements in general somatic epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity (Clerici an d 
Planes, 2009; Gong et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2019; Kapitsinou et al., 2014; Rajendran et al., 2020).  
 
Long- term upregulation of HIF may have  deleterious  effects  on chronic  organ inflammatory  conditions 
such as pulmonary  hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis , and chronic  obstructive  pulmonary disease,  CKD, 
etc. although this  seems  less relevant  to the acute application  envisioned here (Fu  and Zhang, 2018;  Li 
et al., 2020b; Luo et al., 2015). 
 
2.4.2. Protection of Other Organs Against Failure During Ischemia  
In addition to its potential beneficial effects with respect to the treatment of anemia, and acute lung 
inflammation, HIF may have protective effects during ischemia, reperfusion, hypoxia, and 
inflammatory conditions (Heyman et al., 2016). Pharmacologic inhibition of PHDs is associated with increased HIF stabilization – even under normoxic conditions – and concomitant organ protection, 
including the heart, intestine, kidneys, liver as well as the lungs (Bowser et al., 2017; Eckle et al., 2013a;  Eckle et al., 2012;  Eckle et al., 2008d;  Hill et al., 2008;  Kapitsinou et al., 2014;  Robinson et al., 
2008). 
 
The myriad potential benefits if HIF stabilization related to hypoxia have been extensively reviewed 
(Colgan et al., 2020; Fraisl et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2019; Prabhakar and Semenza, 2015; Zhu et al., 2019). In general:  
• Hypoxia results in inflammation and stabilization of HIF can dampen tissue inflammation and promote repair (Colgan et al., 2020; Cummins and Taylor, 2017).  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  7 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   • HIF stabilization upregulates glycolytic enzymes that adapt tissue to oxygen deprivation and 
anaerobic energy production (Koivunen and Kietzmann, 2018). 
• HIF promotes EPO and VEGF production. EPO increases red blood cell production and 
hemoglobin that carry  oxygen to tissues.  VEGF  increases  blood vessel  growth to hypoxic  tissue. 
The combination leads to increased oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues (Pugh and Ratcliffe, 
2003; Tanaka et al., 2015). 
• HIF increases extracellular adenosine by stimulating genes  that convert extracellular ATP to 
ADP,  AMP,  and eventually  adenosine. HIF also upregulates  adenosine  receptors  leading  to cell 
signaling that decreases cellular inflammation (Eckle et al., 2014; Hart et al.,  2011). 
• Stabilizing HIF either pharmacologically  or genetically, has been shown to afford protection 
against ischemic and other damage in multiple organs apart from  lung:  
o Heart (Eckle et al., 2008c; Natarajan et al., 2006; Sridharan et al., 2007)  
o Kidney (Eckardt et al., 2007; Ito et al., 2020; Yang et a l., 2018)  
o Liver (Guo et al., 2015; Ju et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2010)  
• HIF is a potent stimulator of EPO production, and EPO has been shown to have significant 
protective effects in the lung after ALI through a number of different protective mechanisms 
(Heitrich et al., 2016; Rocha et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2019). 
 
2.5. Vadadustat in Clinical  Trials  
A total of 34 Akebia studies spanning Phase 1 through 3 have been completed or are ongoing. In the 
studies completed to date (Phase 1 and 2 studies), a total of 1011 subjects have received vadadustat, including 553 healthy volunteers, 450 subjects with CKD , and 8 subjects with hepatic impairment. In 
4 ongoing Phase 3 studies, 7237 subjects have received study medication (vadadustat or darbepoetin alfa).  
 
Generally,  in completed  vadadustat  studies  with healthy volunteers, there were  a low number  of adverse 
events (AEs). The most frequently reported AEs in healthy volunteers were in gastrointestinal system 
disorders (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, dyspepsia) and nervous system disorders (headache, dizziness). The majority of the events were mild to moderate in severity. There were no 
serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, or withdrawals due to AEs. There were no clinically relevant changes in mean laboratory values (including vascular endothelial growth factor or adrenal -related 
biomarkers), vita l signs, or electrocardiograms  (ECGs).  
 
In completed Phase 2 studies, the most frequently reported AEs in subjects with CKD were in 
gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting), cardiovascular disorders (hypertension, hypotension, coronary arter y disease), renal disorders (renal failure chronic, renal failure acute), 
infections and infestations (gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia), and metabolism and 
nutrition disorders (hyperkalemia, fluid overload).  
 
The safety profile to date supports the ongoing clinical development of vadadustat as an orally 
bioavailable agent for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD.  
 
2.6. COVID- 19 and  ARDS  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  8 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   Patients with COVID -19 present primarily with fever, myalgia/fatigue, or dry cough. In m ost cases, 
COVID- 19 results in mild symptoms and patients can recover in 1 to 2 weeks. Most patients have a 
favorable prognosis; however, older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions may have 
worse outcomes. Patients with severe illness may develop dyspnea and hypoxemia within 1 week of onset, with the potential to progress to ARDS or end- organ failure (Wu et al, 2020). Typical findings 
of chest  CT images  of COVID -19 positive  patients  who are in the ICU include  bilateral  multiple  lobular 
and subsegmental areas of consolidation. Analysis of 1324 laboratory -confirmed cases in Wuhan China 
showed that fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were among the most common symptoms. Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients admitted to the ICU ( Jin et al,  2020).  
 
In a study of  5700 patients  hospitalized  with  COVID- 19 in  New  York  City,  the median  age of  patients 
affected  was 63, with 39.7%  female patients  and 60.3%  male  patients.  Common comorbidities  included 
cancer  (6%);  cardiovascular  disease,  including hypertension (56.6%), coronary  artery  disease  (11.1%), 
and congestive heart failure (6.9%); chronic respiratory disease, including asthma (9%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.4%), and obstructive sleep apnea (2.9%); immunosuppression, including HIV (0.8%) and history of solid organ transplant (1%); kidney disease, including chronic (5%) and end- stage disease (3.5%), and metabolic disease, including obesity (41.7%), morbid obesity 
(19%), and diabetes (33.8%). Among the 2634 patients who were discharged or died at the study 
endpoint, 373 (14.2%) patients were treated in the ICU, and 12.2% received invasive mechanical ventilation (Richardson et al, 2020). As of April 4, 2020, out of the patients requiring mechanical 
ventilation,  38 (3.3%) were  discharged alive,  282 (24.5%)  died,  and 831 (2.2%) remained  hospitalized. 
A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. 
 
In a study of 41 patients hospitalized with COVID -19 in Wuhan China, patients with severe illness 
developed ARDS and required ICU submission and oxygen therapy. The median time from onset of 
symptoms to first hospital admission was 7 days, to shortness of breath was 8 days, to mechanical ventilation  was 10.5 days, and to ICU admission  was 10.5 days. The median  time to ARDS  from  onset 
of symptoms was 9 days, the time between hospital admission and ARDS being as short as 2 days (Huang et al,  2020).

2.7. Bayesian Statistical  Methods  
Developing effective interventions for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requires 
incremental  improvement of theoretically sound treatments based on systematically accruing data. 
Often this incremental development is hampered by statistical tools not appropriate to the task. 
Classical, Frequentist statistics have advanced the field, but are less i nformative for the initial test of  a 
new treatment. The reliance of the Frequentist framework on dichotomous, null hypothesis testing provides some control of the error rate in the context of multiple repeated trials; however, this is not what early -phase treatment testing requires. Developing nascent treatments requires investigators to 
bet on an alternative hypothesis. Investigators evaluating a theoretically sound intervention want to 
know the probability that the approach confers some level of benefit given the observed data: that is, 
they want to know the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true. While Frequentist inference does not directly address this issue, Bayesian statistical inference provides a principled approach to answer this quest ion. Indeed, addressing the so -called “Pipeline Problem” in developing clinical 
applications, the FDA has indicated that Bayesian statistics offers one avenue for improved methodological efficiency (FDA. Innovation/Stagnation 2004, FDA. Innovation/Stagnati on 2006, 
Irony 2008, O’Neill RT 2006, Woodcock 2005, Fitzmaurice & Laird  2000). 
 
Decision -making based on an initial treatment trial is assisted by estimates of the probability of an 
effect of some specified magnitude. These statements, not part of the conventional, Frequentist statistical lexicon, are accessible via Bayesian  approaches,  particularly  with small sample  sizes  (Lilford 
et al 1995, Spiegelhalter et al 1999). Detailed descriptions of Bayesian statistical reasoning exist 
elsewhere (Berry 2006, Goodman 2005, Wijeysundera et al 2009). Succinctly, Frequentist  models  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  10 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   estimate the probability of observing the data (or data more extreme) given that the null hypothesis is 
true; Bayesian analyses estimate the probability of the alternative hypothesis given the observed data (Wijeysundera et al 2009). Bayesian probability estimates incorporate prior information about plausible parameter values (i.e., the prior distribution) and the observed data (i.e., the likelihood). Combining these two distributions forms the posterior distribution which permits evaluation of the probability that the true value of the parameter falls in some range.

5.2. Assessment of  Safety  
• Incidence of adverse events  (AEs) 
• Incidence of serious AEs  (SAEs) 
• Incidence of thromboembolic  events  
• Creatinine, bilirubin, AST and ALT, hemoglobin  
 
In addition to the ongoi ng and final safety assessments through the course of the trial, a detailed 
review of safety by the DSMB will follow the ascertainment of the 14- day outcomes on the first 
30 and 120 patients. After 30 and 120 patients have received treatment and have compl eted their 
day 14 event, enrollment will be suspended (suspension of enrollment will occur at n = 30, based 
on DSMB recommendation, enrollment will continue during the safety analysis at n = 120). An 
interim blinded safety report will be sent to the DSMB. Enrollment will continue according to DSMB recommendations. The DSMB will provide a report to the UTHealth COVID -19 
Research Workgroup and UTHealth IRB to consider further patient screening and enrollment.  
 
5.3. Exploratory Outcomes  
Efficacy of vadadustat to induce known transcriptional targets of HIFs (e.g., erythropoietin, 
extracellular  adenosine  levels,  circulating  levels  of CD73, VEGF,  hypoxia -driven microRNAs  that 
dampen lung inflammation) will be  explored.  
 
Various laboratory measurements (e.g., serum creatinine, FGF -23, markers of attenuated 
inflammation) will be measured and summarized.

responsible  for keeping  accurate records  of the clinical  supplies  received  from  Akebia  Therapeutics 
(Akebia)  all supplies  retained  in inventory at the study site, and study drug dispensed  to or returned 
from each patient. Records will be maintained that accurately reflect the drug accountability of 
vadadustat.  
 
Drug accountability includes, but is not limited to:  
• Monitoring expiration dates.  
• Verifying physical inventory matches documented  inventory. 
 
Verifying  accountability  records  are completed  for all vadadustat  received,  dispensed, and returned, 
and that all required fields are complete, accurate, and legible. During the study, the research 
pharmacist will be notified of any expiration dates or retest date extensions of study drug. If an 
expiration date notification  is received  during the study, the study site will complete  all instructions 
outlined in the notification, including segregation of expired study drug for return to the Akebia  or 
its designee for destruction as specified by the  Akebia.  
 
Prior to study site closure and at appropriate intervals during the study, the research pharmacist of 
designee will perform study drug accountability and reconciliation.  
 
At the end of the study, the investigator  will retain  all original  documentation regarding study drug 
accountability, return, and/or destruction, and copies will be sent to the  sponsor. 
 
All unused and/or partially used vadadustat will be returned to Akebia or destroyed at the study 
site, as specified by Akebia. Appropriate records of the disposal will be documented and maintained. No unused vadadustat may be disposed of until fully accounted for by Akebia or 
designee. Empty containers may be disposed of accor ding to local procedures with the permission 
of Akebia.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  15 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   7.4.4. Dosing  rationale  
The planned  dosing  is a fixed  daily  dose of 900 mg (supplied  as 6-150 mg tablets).  We believe  that 
the dose and magnitude of HIF stabilization needed to induce the hypothesized beneficial 
pulmonary effects are the same as that needed to induce erythropoiesis. In healthy volunteers who received single doses of vadadustat, the median tmax ranged betw een 3.5 hours for the subjects 
who were administered 900 mg. The peak erythropoietin concentration was reached after 18 hours 
from dosing. In healthy volunteers who received 10 daily doses of vadadustat, the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to day 11 among those who took vadadustat 900 mg was 0.43 g/dL. 
From published literature on COVID ‑19 patients, the median duration from onset of illness to 
admission is 7 days and takes a median of additional 3.5 days until ICU admission. In order to 
maximize the  benefit of acute HIF stabilization and observe a potential benefit, a dose of 900 mg 
once daily for 14 days is  recommended.  
Vadadustat doses of 150- 1200 mg per day were tested in healthy volunteers and patients with 
anemia secondary  to chronic  kidney disease (CKD).  A dose of vadadustat  900 mg was administered 
to healthy volunteers and patients with CKD for 10 days without significant adverse effects. In healthy  volunteers, the most  commonly reported  AEs (nausea,  diarrhea,  abdominal  pain, flatulence, 
dyspepsia, headache, and dizziness) were generally reported to be mild to moderate in severity. 
There were  no SAEs,  deaths,  or withdrawals  due to AEs,  and no clinically  relevant  changes  in mean 
laboratory values, vital signs or ECGs. In CKD subjects, the most commonly reported AEs were 
nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, hypotension, coronary artery disease, chronic and acute renal failure, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia.  
8. Study  Procedures  
 
8.1. Recruitment  
All COVID- 19 patients will be screened for eligibility. If a patient meets screening eligibility, the 
study coordinator will introduce the study to the patient to determine interest. If the patient is interested  in participating  in the study, the study coordinator  will introduce  the patient  to one of the 
study clinicians either in person or virtually utilizing WebEx. Written consent will be obtained for all patients interested in study participation. Patients will be randomized if meeting all eligibility criteria (as specified in inclusion/exclusion criteria). Initial recruitment will occur at MHH - 
Southwest  and MHH -Texas  Medical  Center  for the first 30 patients.  After  30 and then 120 patients 
are treated,  screening  and enrollment  will be suspended (suspension of enrollment  will occur  at n 
= 30, based on DSMB recommendation, enrollment will continue during the safety analysis at n = 
120) to enable an interim blinded safety analyses by the DSMB. The DSMB will provide a report to the UTHealth COVID -19 Research Workgroup and UTHealth IRB to consider further patient 
screening and enrollment. 
 
8.2. Concomitant  medication  
Probenecid is not allowed as it may increase systemic exposure to vadadustat. Investigators should 
adjust the dose of these concomitant medication as follows: 
 
1. Simvastatin, maximum daily dose of 20  mg 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  16 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   2. Rosuvastatin, maximum daily dose of 10 mg  
 
If the patient is currently taking erythropoiesis -stimulating agents or ESA (e.g., epoetin alfa, 
darbepoietin alpha, or methoxy polyethylene glycol -epoetin beta), the medication should be 
discontinued. 
 
Sulfasalazine and other breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrates (imatinib, gefitinib, 
nilotinib, prazosin, glyburide, cimetidine, AZT and lamivudine) should be used with caution as 
vadadustat can increase systemic exposure to these medications. Lopinavir and rotinavir are also prohibited due to observed higher LFTs in patients treated with these drugs.  
 
Phosphate binders (iron- containing and non- iron containing) and oral iron supplements should be 
taken at least 2 hours before or after the dose of vadadustat as they can interfere with vadadustat absorption
. 
 
At enrollment, the study team will notify the treating physician of medications prohibited by the 
study. Study  personnel  will review  the patient’s  current  medications  daily  to identify  the use of any 
prohibited medications and notify the treating physician when they are prescribed. The study team will discuss the use of alternative medications. If the prohibited medication cannot be stopped the patient will continue in the study but study medication will be  stopped. 
 
 
8.3. Complete Withdrawal from Study  Visits/Assessments 
A patient has the right to withdraw consent for participation in the study at any time. Withdrawal 
of consent is a patient’s refusal to continue study treatment, data collection and ALL methods of 
follow -up noted in the informed consent form: procedures, participation in reduced 
procedures/study visits, telephone contact only or alternative contact only, s ource document or 
designated alternative contact, or access to medical records from alternative sources.  
 
It is important for the Investigator to review options with a patient. The patient may decide to stop 
study medication but still be followed up in the  hospital and contacted on Day 7, 14, and 28 after 
discharge to assess safety and efficacy outcomes. Alternatively, the patient may decide to completely withdraw consent from the study which entails not receiving study medication, not to be followed up in the hospital, and not to be contacted after discharge.  
 
8.4. Data  Collection  
Refer to Appendix 1 (Schedule of Activities) for detailed timing and frequency of the below 
activities: 
• Informed consent

receiving a score of 0 and deceased patients receiving a score of  20. 
• NIAID -OS, daily and until discharge and at Day 7, 14, and 28 
• For patients  who are discharged, before  or after completing  14 days of in-hospital  treatment, 
a phone visit at day 7, 14, and 28 after randomization will be conducted to collect serious 
adverse events and NIAID -OS score.  
 
8.4.1. Extended Follow  Up 
Eligible patients will be asked on the consent form if they would like to consent to participate in an 
extended follow up opportunity which will consist of the following:  
 
• Retu rn to the clinic at 6, 12 and 24 months  
• Complete a quality of life  questionnaire  
• Provide a small blood sample (10 ml) 
• Provide a urine sample (10 ml) 
• Perform a pulmonary function test to see how well their lungs are working and a bedside echocardiogram to see how their heart is  working. 
 
The participant will receive a $100 gift card for each follow up visit completed. In addition, the 
parking and travel expenses will be covered.  
 
To consent to the optional long term follow up, the patient will be asked to check a box and initial. 
 
8.5 Protocol Deviations: Protocol deviations will be recorded in the RedCAP database. The type 
of deviation will be specified. The deviation will be described and corrective actions will be recorded.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  18 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   9. Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  
A DSMB will be formed. DSMB is a group of external experts who will provide oversight to the 
conduct of the study and provide safety assessment through planned interim analysis. The DSMB 
shall  include  an odd number  of members,  minimum of 3, preferably  5. It should include  at least one 
of the following: one critical care physician, one physician- trialist and one  statistician.  
 
In addition to the ongoing and final safety assessments through the course of the trial, a detailed 
review of safety by the DSMB will follow the ascertainment of the 14- day safety on the first 
30,120 and 400 patients. After 30,120 and 400 patients have received treatment and have completed their day 14 event, an interim blinded safety a nalysis by the DSMB will be completed. 
The DSMB will provide a report to the UTHealth COVID -19 Research Workgroup and 
UTHealth IRB to consider further patient screening and enrollment. In the n=400 safety analysis 
there will be no planned suspension in ongoing recruitment during evaluation of the findings. 
 
10. Discontinuation of study treatment in individual patients (Stopping  Criteria)  
Vadadustat must be permanently discontinued if a patient meets one of the following pre -specified 
criteria:  
1. Patient comple tes 14 days of in- hospital treatment since randomization  
2. Patient is discharged before 14 days of treatment since randomization 
3. If the clinical team deems necessary that the patient receive a medication that was 
previously prohibited, or if the clinical team decides the patient should not receive 
vadadustat.  
4. Persistent eGFR decrease (greater than 2 days < 30) 
5. Hemoglobin above the gender specific upper limit of normal (ULN): females (16 g/dL) and 
males (18 g/dL)  
6. Patient dies  
 
11. Safety  Assessment  
11.1. Adverse Events  (AEs)  
For the purposes of this study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding) that occurs in the protocol -specified AE reporting period; the event does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.  
 
An AE includes medical conditions, si gns, and symptoms not previously observed in the subject 
that emerge during the protocol -specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms 
associated with pre -existing underlying conditions that were not present prior to the AE reporting 
period. 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  19 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   AEs therefore include the following:  
• All AEs, whether suspected to be causally related to study drug or  otherwise. 
• All AEs secondary to any medication overdose, medication error, abuse, withdrawal, 
sensitivity, or  toxicity.  
• Illnesses apparently unrelated to study drug, including the worsening of a pre -existing 
illness (see paragraph below on Pre -existing  Conditions). 
• Injury or accidents. Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident (for example, a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and 
the accident (fall) will be reported as 2 separate AEs.  
• Abnormalities  in physiological  testing  or physical  examination  findings  that require  clinical 
intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory]  test).  
• Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further  investigation (beyond 
ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated with an  already reported 
clinical even t. Laboratory abnormalities associated with a clinical event reported as  an AE 
(for example, elevated liver enzymes in a subject with jaundice) will be described  under  
‘Comments’ on the report of the clinical event rather than reported as separate AEs.  
 
The following guidelines are to be used when reporting AEs for this study:  
• Medical Diagnoses – Whenever possible, a medical diagnosis term will be used to report 
AEs instead of signs and symptoms due to a common etiology, as determined by qualified medical  study staff.  For example,  pneumonia  will be the reported  AE term,  instead  of fever, 
dyspnea, etc., when the diagnosis has been established. Signs and symptoms will be reported as event terms only when the medical diagnosis remains unknown and revised to a medical diagnosis term once it has been established.  
• Procedures – Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as 
surgery, will not be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed will be rep orted if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, 
an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period will be reported as the  AE 
and the resulting appendectomy noted under  “Comments.”  
• Preplanned therapeutic procedures not associated  with a new medical condition or 
worsening pre -existing condition will not be reported as  AEs. 
• Pre-existing Conditions – In this study, a pre -existing condition (i.e., a disorder present 
before the AE reporti ng period started and noted on the pretreatment  medical 
history/physical examination form) will not be reported as an AE unless the condition 
worsens, or episodes increase in frequency  during the AE reporting  period.  
• Abnormal Test Findings – All laboratory  test results will be reviewed by the research 
team. The research team will utilize his/her judgment in determining if out of range laboratory values are clinically significant. Laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant will be reported a s AEs, either separately or as part of a description of a 
symptomatic AE. If there are significant changes in a laboratory report from a previous result that are determined to be clinically significant, these will also be reported as AEs. Any abnormal laboratory value, which requires treatment or further diagnostic testing or 
results  in discontinuation from  study will be reported  as AEs.  An expected  laboratory  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  20 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   abnormality from a condition that is part of the medical history is not considered clinically 
significant for the purposes of the study unless it represents a worsening of the condition. 
 
Special daily safety monitoring for the risk of thrombosis and proinflammatory state is planned in 
this trial. This will be achieved  by daily review  of electronic  medical  records  for clinical  evaluation 
of thromboembolic events. Furthermore, all patients will be managed according to local institutional anticoagulation  protocols. 
 
Thrombo- embolic events (complications) including:  
• Deep vein thrombosis —catheter associated or  spontaneous  
• Pulmonary embolism 
• Ischemic stroke  
• Systemic arterial  thrombosis  
• Acute coronary syndrome/myocardial  infarction.  
 
11.2. Serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
SAEs are AEs that meet one or more of the following criteria/outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered a medically important event not meeting the above  criteria, but which may 
jeopardize a patient,  or may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the criteria 
listed in this  definition  
 
Serious  also includes  any other  event  that the investigator  judges  to be serious. If there is any doubt 
whether the information constitutes an AE or SAE, the information is to be treated as an SAE.  
 
Life threatening – Defined as any event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. ‘Life threatening’ does not refer to an event w hich hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe. For example, drug -induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of 
hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening, even though drug -induced hepatitis of a 
more severe nature c an be fatal.  
 
Hospitalization – Defined as an overnight admission with observation of a minimum of 24 hours. 
A hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a preexisting condition that has not worsened during the AE reporting period does not c onstitute an SAE unless an untoward event 
occurs related to the procedure (e.g., elective hospitalization for a total knee replacement due to a pre-existing condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the study). 
 
Disability – Defi ned as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  21 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   In addition to the above criteria for classifying AEs as serious, the following situations will be also 
be classified as serious for purposes of this study:  
 
Malignancies  – If a subject  develops  basal  cell carcinoma of skin, squamous  cell carcinoma of skin, 
or cervical carcinoma in situ during the study, or has worsening of these events from baseline, the 
investigator  will determine  if the event  is reported  as an AE or SAE.  Newly  diagnosed malignancies 
or a recurrence of a malignancy  will be reported  as an SAE  with the seriousness criterion  “medically 
important” if no other seriousness criteria are  met. 
 
All cardiac events will be specifically elicited and followed. Troponins ordered by the clinical 
team will be recorded in the Daily lab section of the CRF. Troponin levels are not required, but will be recorded when available. Recent data using vadadustat in the PROTECT2 study showed an increase rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in some study participants. This increase in MACE events occurred in patients who were not on dialysis, were treated outside the US and were treated for more than 6 months  with vadadustat. This risk as not seen in dialysis 
patients and was not seen in study participants in the US. The DSMB was notified of these results. Based on the above data, the DSMB recommended that all cardiac events be tracked and troponins be recorde d when ordered by the treating team. 
 
Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after 
the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE. Compliance with this time requirement is essential so that sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations. 
 
11.3. Eliciting Adverse Event  Information  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
patient. Patients will be questioned daily about AEs if they are able to respond, and t hen followed 
through the duration of the study. 
 
11.4. Reporting  
Each AE is to be classified by the investigator as serious or non- serious. 
 
All AEs that occur in study subjects during the AE reporting period specified in the protocol must 
be reported, whether or not the event is considered to be related to study drug. 
 
11.4.1. Reporting  Period  
The AE reporting period for this study begins upon initiation of study drug and ends up to 16 days 
after randomization (14 days of drug dosage plus two days), while SAEs will be c ontinued to be 
reported  up to Day 28, and will be assessed  via follow -up, or through the patient’s  chart.  However, 
AEs considered secondary to protocol mandated procedures should be reported post signing of  the 
informed consent form (ICF), whether or not t hey occur before or after initiation of study drug. 
Subjects discharged from the hospital will be contacted on day 7, 14, and 28 to assess for SAEs. In 
addition, SAEs that occur during the protocol -defined AE reporting period that the investigator 
assesses as unexplained and related to the study drug will also be reported as an SAE to the 
UTHealth  IRB and the FDA.  AEs and SAEs  that occur  after the protocol -defined  period that the 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  22 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   investigator  assesses as related  to the study drug will also be reported  as an AE to UTHealth.  If the 
event is serious, related, and unexpected, the event will be reported to the investigator IRB and the 
FDA.  
 
11.4.2. Reporting  AEs  
All AEs (serious  and non-serious)  are to be reported on the AE CRF  in the clinical database during 
the AE reporting period as described in Section 11.1. 
 
11.4.3. Reporting  SAEs  
Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, will be reported to the sponsor’s designee within 24 
hours after the investigator becomes aware of the SAE. Compliance with this time requirement is 
essential so that the sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations. Additionally, it may be 
necessary for UTHealth (or designee) to directly communicate with the investigator if additional information is required.  
 
The initial SAE report should be completed as fully as possible but will contain, at a minimum 
item number 1 to 6:  
1. Subject number/ID, sex, and age 
2. The date of  report  
3. Name of the reporter  
4. Name of the suspected medicinal  product  
5. A description of the event, including event term(s), seriousness criteria, and a clinical summary of the  event  
6. Causality  assessment  
 
The investigator will assess the relationship to each specific component of the study treatment. A 
SAE Report Form will be sent to the sponsor or its designee via email or the investigator will call the sponsor or its designee SAE hotline within 24 hours of being made aware of the SAE.  
 
Refer  to the SAE  Report  Form  and SAE  Report  Form  Guidelines  for more  details  on SAE  reporting, 
including timelines, and email for reporting and the contact information for any questions regarding 
SAE  reporting.  
 
The investigator must report follow -up information relating to an SAE to the study safety monitor 
as it becomes  available by submitting  a REDCAP  SAE  Report  Form.  The subject  will be observed 
and monitored carefully until the condition is resolved or  stabilizes.  
 
All deaths are to be thoroughly investigated and reported to the UTHealth IRB. Autopsy reports 
and death certificates are to be obtained, if p ossible. In- hospital deaths will be investigated via 
electronic medical records (EMR). Out -of-hospital deaths will be investigated by calling their 
family, and reviewing available death certificates.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  23 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   In addition to the sponsor’s responsibility for reporting SAEs to all applicable regulatory agencies, 
Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  or Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IEC),  and investigators  within 
the required timeline, UTHealth and/or its designee are responsible for reporting SAEs to all 
applicable regulatory agencies, central ethics committees, and investigators as well within the 
required  timeline.  
 
11.5. Relationship to Study  Drug  
The investigator must provide an assessment of causality (relationship to study drugs) at t he time 
of the report. If causality is difficult to determine, for example, due to incomplete clinical 
information at the time of the report, the investigator must use clinical judgment under consideration of the criteria outlined below and provide a causa lity assessment. It is also good practice to include 
a rationale for the causality assessment.  
The assessment of causal relationship to study drug will be evidence -based, and not based on the 
premise that all AEs are possibly causally related to study drug until proven otherwise.  
Examples of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE 
include the occurrence of an AE that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome), or an AE that is 
uncommon in the population exposed to the drug.  
 
The site investigator, on the basis of his or her clinical judgment and the following definitions, 
determines the relationship of the AE to the protocol intervention as one of the following:  
 
Algorithm to Determine Relatedness of Adverse Event in Study Agent  
Unrelated  The temporal relationship between treatment exposure and the adverse even is 
unreasonable or incompatible and/or adverse event is clearly due to extraneous causes  
(e.g. underlying disease, environment).  
Unlikely  Must have both of the following two (2) conditions, but may have reasonable or only 
tenuous temporal relationship to intervention:  
1. Could readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental, or other  interventions.  
2. Does not follow known pattern of response to intervention.  
Reasonable Possibility  Must have at least two (2) of the following three (3) conditions:  
1. Has a reasonable temporal relationship to  intervention  
2. Could not have readily been produced by the subject’s clinical state or environmental or other  interventions  
3. Follows a known pattern of response to intervention.  
Definitely  Must have all three (3) of the following conditions:  
1. Has a reasonable temporal relationship to  intervention  
2. Could not possibly have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or have been due to environmental or other  interventions  
3. Follows knows pattern of response to intervention.  
Default assessments using the ‘related’ category without supportive evidence for a causal 
relationship to study drug is generally uninformative and does not contribute meaningfully to the 
development of the safety profile of the drug or to s ubject protection.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  24 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   Investigators  are encouraged to choose  the most  plausible  cause  for the event(s)  from  the following 
list: medical history, lack of efficacy/worsening of treated condition, study treatment, other 
treatment  (concomitant, or previous), withdrawal  of study treatment,  administration  error,  protocol - 
related procedure, others  (specify).  
 
11.6. Severity  
The investigator will assess each AE using the CTCAE guidelines to describe the maximum severity 
of the AE:  
• Grade 1 Mild  – asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations  only; 
intervention not  indicated.  
• Grade 2 Moderate – minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental  ADL.  
• Grade 3 Severe or medically sign ificant but not immediately life threatening –  
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL.  
• Grade 4 Life threatening consequences – urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5 Death related to  AE. 
 
Note that a severe AE is not necessarily a serious AE. For example, a headache may be severe in 
intensity, but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious events 
listed above, see Section 11.4.3. 
 
11.7. Emergency  Unblinding:  
A rep resentative of the study leadership will always be available using 24- hour telephone number 
for communication with investigators and healthcare providers caring for the  patient.  
 
If a clinician  requests  emergency  unblinding of study drug in response  to a clinical event,  the study 
representative will discuss the clinical utility of unblinding with the clinician. Emergency 
unblinding will only occur if the clinical and investigator agree that it is necessary to treat the patient. Emergency unblinding should be rare as there is no antidote to the drug, and it is given orally. All requests  for emergency  unblinding will be reported  to the study  safety  officer.  The safety 
officer will then determine if the patient should continue to receive study medication.  
 
11.7.1 Non -Emergency Un -blinding  
At times  the sponsor  or designee may request  un-blinding of safety  events  in accordance with  their 
reporting responsibilities. In these cases, if the treatment team does not need to be un- blinded, the 
database manager will un -blind the sponsor or their designee but will not un- blind the clinical or 
research team.  
 
11.8 Follow -up of Unresolved Events  
All AEs will be followed until they are resolved, or the investigator assesses them as chronic or 
stable or the subject’s participation in the study ends (i.e., until a final report is completed for that  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  25 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   subject).  
 
All SAEs and non- serious events that are ongoing at the time a subject’s participation in the study 
ends and that are assessed by the investi gator as related to the study drug, will continue to be 
followed until they resolve  or until the investigator  assesses them  as “chronic” or “stable”.  Follow - 
up information  will be reported  to UTHealth  on the  appropriate  CRF  or paper  SAE  Report  Form  if 
EDC is  unavailable.  
 
More details of the study safety plan are described in the study Manual of Procedures.  
 
12. Sample Size and Power Calculation  
The trial will investigate  the superiority of vadadustat  900 mg per day to placebo  for the prevention 
and treatment  of ARDS  among COVID -19 patients,  defined  by the proportion of patients  at day 14 
who are dead (8) or hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO (7) or  hospitalized, 
on noninvasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (6) on the N IAID -OS (i.e. decrease in the 
proportion of participants with NIAID -OS <  6 at day  14). 
 
Anticipated sample size for the current study is N = 650. An evaluation by the DSMB will occur 
following ascertainment  of 14-day safety  outcomes  for the first 30 patien ts that are randomized  and 
dosed, and a second at the first 120 (i.e. n = 60 receiving Vadadustat).  
 
Bayesian analysis for superiority will occur following ascertainment of outcome at fourteen days 
after randomization of N = 650 patients. We stipulate that a posterior probability of a > 2.5% 
decrease in the proportion of NIAID -OS > 6 as a function of trea tment that is > 0.85 constitutes 
sufficient evidence to declare that the active treatment condition is superior to placebo. The prior distribution  for analysis  will be ~Beta(a= 1, b = 1), or in the presence of covarying for stratification 
factors  ~Normal  (µ=0,  σ2=1 x 10) for the coefficients  in the log-form  of the appropriate  generalized 
linear model.  
 
We anticipate a decrease in the proportion of NIAID -OS > 6 participants due to treatment will be 
approximately 15%, with preliminary data suggesting a rate of 25.1% in the placebo condition. Assuming this effect,  K = 1000 Monte  Carlo  clinical  trial simulations,  for N = 650 participants  and 
the previously stated decision rules resulted in detection of a > 2.5% decrease in NIAID -OS > 6 
due to the active treatment 99.1% of the time with a Type I Error rate of 3.5%. For more modest effects,  12.5%  and 10% decreases  in NIAID -OS > 6, the curren t sample  and decision  rules  will lead 
to detection 96.1% and 86.3% of the time with Type I Error rates of 4.8% and 3.7%  respectively.  
 
13. Statistical  Analysis  
 
13.1. Specific Statistical Hypothesis Primary 
Outcome 
Among adult hospital admissions with lab -confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19, vadadustat 900 mg 
will demonstrate superiority to placebo as defined by a lower probability, at treatment day 14, of  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  26 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   death  (8) or hospitalization,  on invasive  mechanical  ventilation  or ECMO  (7) or hospitalization,  on 
non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (6) on the NIAID -OS. Generalized linear 
modeling will evaluate the probability of patients demonstrating this status at day fourteen of 
treatment as a function of treatment condition after covarying for stratification variables.  
Secondary Outcome 
 
Among adult hospital admissions with lab -confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19, vadadustat  900 mg 
will demonstrate superiority to placebo as defined by a higher probability, at treatment day 14, of recovery on the MSOFA scale (MSOFA = 0). Generalized linear modeling will evaluate the probability of patients demonstrating an MSOFA = 0 at day fourteen of treatment as a function of treatment condition after covarying for stratification variables.  
13.2. Bayesian Modeling Strategy  
Initial analyses examining group differences for baseline variables will use cross -tabulation, 
ANOVA’s, and examination of corr elations between baseline variables and specified outcomes. 
For the purposes of evaluating the comparability of groups, a posterior probability of > 95% will constitute evidence for statistically reliable differences. Baseline or demographic variables on 
which group differences are detected, and which are correlated with outcomes, meet the definition 
of confounders  (Assmann  et al 2005, Pocock  et al 2002)  and will result  in two sets of analyses:  one 
in which  the relevant  variable is included  as a covariate and one in which  it is not. This will permit 
determination of the degree to which any group differences might confound conclusions  regarding 
treatment.  
 
Broadly, the data analytic strategy will use generalized linear and multilevel models (R v. 3.6, and 
Stan 2.17)  for both discrete and continuous  outcomes  (SAS  Institute  2002- 2012, R Core  Team  2017, 
Carpenter et al 2017). Multilevel generalized linear modeling to account for clustering of patients 
within site and repeated observations within patients will evaluate continuous, dichotomous, and 
count  data.  All analyses  will apply intention -to-treat principles  with missingness addressed  via joint 
modeling of observed outcomes and the missing data, an approach robust to ignorable  missingness 
(i.e., MCAR and MAR) (Best & Thomas 2000). Sensitivity analyses will evaluate robustness of analytic  conclusions  to missing  data.  Non-ignorable  missing  data patterns  will be addressed  through 
pattern -mixture modeling methods (Fitzmaurice & Laird 2000). Eva luation of  posterior 
distributions will permit statements regarding the probability that effects of varying magnitudes 
exist, given the data. Specification of diffuse, neutral priors will reflect the initial uncertainty 
regarding effect sizes. For all gene ralized linear models, priors for regression coefficients will be 
specified  as ~Normal  (µ=0,  σ2=1 x 10), level  one and two error variances  will be specified  as ~Half - 
Normal (µ=0, σ2=1 x 10
3). The choice of prior distribution for level two variances will f ollow 
Gelman’s recommendations (Gelman 2006). Priors for the comparison of proportions will be specified as ~Beta (α=1.0, β=1.0).

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  28 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   15. Informed  Consent  
Potential subjects are to receive a thorough explanation of study details and procedures and 
provided time to ask any questions. All subjects  must  sign the IRB approved informed  consent  form 
before performing any study- related activity (including screening activities). Due to COVID -19 to 
prevent  cross  contamination, the original  signed consent  form  is given to the patient.  A photograph 
using HIPAA  compliant  Tiger  Connect  will be captured of the signature  page  and will be placed  in 
the subject’s study file. In the case where an adult is incapable of making an informed decision, 
they will be excluded from study participation.  
 
16. Data handling and record keeping  
16.1. CRFs/EDC 
This study will utilize an electronic data capture (EDC) system to manage data collection during 
this trial. The system is fully Code of Federal Regulations 21 part 11 compliant. This EDC will reside behind the Zone 100 UTHealth firewall with Shibboleth -based user -access and identification.  
Patients  will be assigned  a unique  ID number. A master  key file will be stored  on the shared password 
protected drive at UTHealth. Only Co- investigators at UTHealth and their staff (to  be added  through 
amendment  at a later date when  hired)  will have  access  to this master  key file. 
The EDC  in this study will utilize  the REDcap  system  maintained  on secure  UTHealth  servers.  This 
database possesses a graphical user interface to facilitate data entry, capability of tracking data 
management  and user activity,  a data validation  element  to check  user data (e.g. impermissible/out-  
of-range or missing values), and a reporting function to assist with the review and analysis of  data. 
The data base will utilize  a relational structure to avoid so- called “orphan records” with staff 
password protected and access to and modification of data tables restricted based on their 
operational roles. Clinical Research Forms (CRF’s) available through this system are required and 
will be completed for each randomized subject. Any data from the electronic system are the sole property of the sponsor and will not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the sponsor. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered 
in the EDC or any other data collection forms. The CRFs will be signed electronically by the 
investigator to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are  true. 
In most cases, the source documents are contained in the subject’s chart at the hospital, dialysis or 
research clinic,  or the physician's office. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs will match the 
data in those charts. 
16.2. Record  Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the sponsor, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information  to 
link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all CRFs, SAE forms, source documents, detailed records of drug disposition, and ade quate 
documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, and telephone calls reports). The records will be retained by the investigator according to the International  Conference  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-20-0395 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  29 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   of/Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requires for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator  becomes  unable  for any reason  to continue  to retain  study  records  for the required 
period (e.g., retirement and relocation), the sponsor will be prospectively notified. The study 
records will be transferred to a designee acceptable to the sponsor, such as another investigator, another institution, or to the sponsor. The investigator will obtain sponsor’s written permission 
before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
17. Quality control and assurance  
17.1. Manufacture and  Storage  
Drug to be tested: Vadadustat  is manufactured by Akebia and contains microcrystalline cellulose 
(MCC), sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium  stearate,  and a nonfunctional  film coat  in addition  to vadadustat. Placebo: 
Placebo is manufactured by Akebia and contains MCC, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium 
stearate, and a nonfunctional film coat. Vadadustat and placebo are stored at room  temperature.  
 
17.2. Active Dose  
Subjects will receive 900 mg as 6 x 150 mg tablets once  daily. 
 
17.3. Dispense and Handling of Study  Drug  
The research  pharmacist  or designee  will dispense  6 tablets  of vadadustat  or placebo  daily  for each 
study patient. Administration to the study patients will follow the local institution’s  procedures.  
 
18. Protocol  Amendment  
 
18.1 Long- Term Follow -up 
 
The purpose  of this amendment  is to characterize the long- term effects  on COVID -19 survivors  who 
were hospitalized with SARS -CoV -2 and treated with either a HIF activator vadadustat or placebo. 
Specifically, we will 1) characterize the occurrence of long -term COVID -19 sequelae in  a well -
described patient cohort and 2) address the hypothesis that vadadustat would attenuate or prevent the long- term disease sequelae of  SARS -CoV -2. 
 
18.2 Study  Objectives.  
 
Primary : Evaluation of pulmonary capacity as a function of treatment, time and the interaction 
of treatment and time.  
 
Secondary : Evaluate cardiac, hepatic and renal outcomes, quality of life, and long- term 
neurocognitive impairment of COVID -19 patients treated with either vadadustat or placebo

18.6 Study  Procedures.  
 
Each study participant will undergo the following procedures on 6th, 12 and 24th month follow -  up. 
There is a one (1) month window  to complete  each follow  up appointment  once  a patient  reaches their 
long term follow up due date. This one -month window provides flexibility to schedule and 
accommodate both the patient and the clinical teams’ availability. If a patient cannot be scheduled 
within one month of their follow up date, this will be deemed a loss to follow up and documented 
in RedCAP  accordingly. 
 
18.6. 1 Sample collection  processing  
 
Blood and urine  samples  will be collected  at our Clinical  Research  Unit (CRU)  and processed  using 
standard protocols. Blood specimens will be collecte d from the patient (biomarkers and laboratory 
specific tests)  and urine  over the course  of the visit.  Universal  precautions  and institutional biosafety 
procedures will be  followed.  
 
18.6.2 Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)  
 
This test is the primary noninvasive imaging modality for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of 
cardiac anatomy and function using an ultrasound. This test will be performed by physicians, 
fellowship -trained in  ultrasonography.  
 
The study currently evaluates pulmonary function and cardiac function as part of the long term 
follow up protocol. There is currently no lung imagining as part of the follow up process. Previous literature has shown ultrasound is as accurate as computed tomography for interstitial lung disease, 
without the cost or ionizing radiation. We are adding lung ultrasound as a seamless addition to the 
echo  portion of  the long  term  follow  up study.  We anticipate  this exam  will add approximately five 
minutes to the ultrasound portion of the protoc ol. There are no known harms associated with lung 
ultrasound. 
 
C60 probe using abdominal preset. Axial images obtained via cranial caudal sweep of the right  and 
left hemi- thorax in the mid- clavicular, mid -axillary, and peri -scapular. De- identified video cl ips of 
each location  will be saved. We will make notation of any unusual  signature  with particular  attention 
to previously described findings in COVID lung disease including B lines and sub- pleural 
consolidations.

18.6.3 Pulmonary Function Tests  
 
Participants will be subjected to a pulmonary testing using spirometry. Briefly, spirometry is used 
to measure forced expiratory flow rates and volumes. It is the most commonly used pulmonary function test and is useful in the evaluation of patients with r espiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, 
cough, wheeze) or risk factors for respiratory diseases. Specifically, we will be measuring FVC, 
FEV, FEV/FVC ratio.  
 
 
18.6.4 Study  Questionnaires  
 
The PROMIS  Global  Health  assess an individual’s  physical, mental  and social  health.  The measures 
are generic,  rather  than disease- specific,  and often  use an ‘In General’  item context  as it is intended 
to globally reflect individuals’ assessment of their health. The adult PROMIS Global Health 
measure produces two scores: physical heal th and mental health. The Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) is a tool to assess short memory, visuospatial abilities, executive functions, attention, concentration and working memory, language and orientation to time and place.  
 
 
18.6.5 Visit  Compensation  
 
Each time a patient completes follow up, she/he will receive a $100 gift card, (up to a maximum of  
$300 for completion  of 3 follow -up in  24 months).  Patients  will be provided with a $100  SPA  Card 
at the end of each visit. Additionally, the study team will arrange round trip transportation of the 
patient from and to their home or destination. Should they choose to drive, the research team will provide patients with parking validation. Other findings:

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/20/2022  33 – VSTAT | Revised December 23, 2021   18.6.6 Study  Dissemination  
 
Study c linicians will review any results found outside of expected ranges for the Transthoracic 
Echocardiography, pulmonary function test, lung ultrasound, labs and/or  MoCA.  Participants  will 
be notified via mail to follow up with their  PCP.  
 
 
18.7 Withdrawal from Follow -up Visits  
 
A patient can withdraw from participating in the long -term follow -up at any point for any reason. If 
possible, reasons for discontinuation or refusal will be documented.  
 
18.8 Statistics  
 
18.8.1  Specific Statistical Hypothesis of Primary  Outcome  
 
The primary outcome analysis will model pulmonary capacity as a function of time, treatment and 
the interaction of time and treatment after controlling for stratification variables (i.e. site and MSOFA < 4 or > 4). 
 
18.8.2  Sample Si ze and Power  Calculation  
 
For the purpose of sample size justification, we assume a small between -groups effect (Cohen’s d  
= 0.2) unfolding in linear fashion over time (6, 12, and 24 months). Estimation will focus on the interaction of treatment and time to ascertain the degree to which the two group’s trajectories of change differ. We further assume that pulmonary function will exhibit with subject autocorrelation of r = 0.3 for every  six-month time lag with this correlation  diminishing  by 50% for every  additional 
six-month time lag. We anticipate enrolling N = 200 participants, and assume attrition will be 
approximately 10% resulting in a final sample  of n = 180. Stipulating  a posterior  probability  of 0.80 
for the existence of an interaction effect (i.e. there is an 80% chance that there are differential 
trajectories of change for the treatments, K = 1000 Monte Carlo simulations identify an interaction 
term 92% of the  time.  
 
18.8.3  Linear Multilevel  Models  
 
Analyses will focus on longitudinal trajectories o f change for outcomes specified in objectives 1- 3. 
Generalized linear multilevel models will evaluate change as a function of time, treatment, and the 
interaction of treatment and time after controlling for stratification variables (i.e. site and baseline 
severity as measured by the MSOFA < 4 or >  4). Analyses will utilize Bayesian inference. Prior 
distributions will be neutral (centered on the null hypothesis) and weakly informative as described by Gabry and Goodrich (2020). This will have the benefit of r egularizing any parameter estimates 
and render more conservative estimates of effect size. Regarding priors essentially as a set of assumptions, we will evaluate the robustness of our analytic conclusions to alternative prior specifications with varying de grees of regularization/skepticism (Gelman, 2007; Spielgelhalter, 
2004).

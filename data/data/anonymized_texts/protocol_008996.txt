EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 9 2 INTRODUCTION 
The Avaira Vitality ™ (CooperVis ion Inc. US), also known as Serenity ™ (CooperVis ion Inc. 
Canada) has been on the market for some time, however its performance has not been  evaluated 
in comparison to other monthly replacement lenses  that have more rec ently been introduced. The 
goal of this study  is to determine  the performance of  Avaira Vitality ™/ Serenity ™ (Lens A),  a SiHy  
monthly replacement  lens from CooperVision Inc., and compare it with  TOTAL30® (Lens B), a 
SiHy monthly replacement lens  from Alcon  Inc.  
3 OBJECTIVES  
To compare the clinical performance of Avaira Vitality ™/ Serenity ™ versus TOTAL30® in habitual 
spherical soft lens wearers, when worn for 1- month  each in a double- masked, randomized 
crossover study design.  
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
• Lens handling on removal (0- 100 scale) collected on Day 27 on the  at-home 
diary .   
4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference for  lens handling rating on removal 
between Lens A compared to Lens B  collected on the at -home diaries on  day 27.  
5 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This study is a prospective, bilateral eye, double- masked, randomized, 1- month  cross- over, 
daily-wear design involving two different frequent replacement  lens types. Each lens  type will be 
worn for approximately one month , during which participants record their subjective lens -wear 
experience on several  different days  at home and during study visits . 
5.1.2 RANDOMIZATION  
A randomization schedule will determine the order of Lens A and Lens B wear for the 
first/second month for each p articipant . Participants  will be randomized immediately prior to their 
first lens dispense.  
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 10 This randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The lens type that will be worn dur i ng the first month  is called “ Lens 
type #1”, the lens type dispended for the second month  is called “ Lens type #2”. The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by CORE ’s Database Administrator  and provided to 
the research assistants at each site.  
5.1.3 MASKING  
This study will be double masked i.e. participants and investigators will be masked to the lens 
type dispensed. In order to achieve this, unmasked research assistants will determine the lens order according to the randomization schedule (see section 5.1.2) and will over -label the lens 
packages/foils prior to dispense by placing strongly adhesive stickers on the packages/foils to 
mask the participant and investigator to the lens brand. At the fitting visit both lens types will be 
fit, but only the participant will be masked to the lens type during this process . During the lens 
wear phases both investigators and participants will be masked . 
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted in three to four optometry practice sites  in the US  and/or Canada, 
depending on their ability to recruit sufficient number of participants. The exact site locations and 
names of the principal Investigators will be listed in the final study report. 
5.2.2 INVESTIGA T OR RECRUITMENT  
The principal investigator at each site will be required to fulfil the following criteria:  
• Is a licensed Optometrist with at least two years of contact lens fitting experience.  
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by the already trained 
principal investigator.  
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site. 
• Has in -office email and either document scanning capabilities or fax. 
• Will scan and upload all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors at 
CORE.  
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for  a timely d ata 
review, query and entry.  
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 11 5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The data for subjective responses for ease lens handling for lens removal when reflecting on a 
typical day, collected at the 1- month visits: standard deviation of paired differences was 1.7 (0-
10 scale) was transformed to a standard deviation of 17 on the planned 0 -100 scale for this 
study. 90% power is achieved with a minimum sample size of 33 participants.  
In addition, data for subjective responses related to lens comfort on insertion and just prior to removal when reflecting on a typical day, collected at the 1- month visits: standard deviation of 
paired differences was 2.2 and 2.3 (0- 10 scale) was transformed to a standard deviation of 22 
and 23 on the planned 0 -100 scale for this study. 80% power is achieved with a minimum 
sample size of 45 and 44 participants.  
It was therefore decided to move ahead with minimum sample of 45 in order to exceed that required for the primary outcome variable, and also provide sufficient sample related to comfort 
variables.  To allow for drop- out and possible protocol deviations, up to 52 participants may be 
dispensed with study products.

5.3.2 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records, databases and advertising materials ( e.g., 
posters, email scripts) approved by the ethics review board. All initial individual -targeted 
recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be conducted by 
practice staff that are not directly involved in conducting the research. This separation will 
reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process will also 
eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any 
consent for disclosure is provided by the potential participant.  

EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 13 It is anticipated that up to 80 potential participants may attend a Screening visit and up to 52 
participants may be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a target of at least 45 completing the study.  
 
5.3.3 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is at least 18  years of age and no older than 3 9 years, and has full legal capacity to 
volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter; 
3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;  
4. Self-reports  having a full eye examination in the previous two years; 
5. Has healthy eyes with no  health condition or medication that contra- indicate contact lens 
wear, in the opinion of the investigator ; 
6. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 6 days a week;  
7. Habitually wears spherical soft contact lenses, for the past 3 months minimum:  
It is preferred that all participants are habitual frequent replacement lens wearers. 
However, if this is not possible then no more than 5 participants can be habitual daily 
disposable lens wearers at each site, the rest must be habit ual frequent replacement lens 
wearers;  
- For the frequent replacement wearers: No more than 3 can be habitual wearers of 
the Avaira Vitality ™/ Serenity ™ brand (or their equivalent private label brand name) 
and no more than 3 can be habitual wearers of TOTAL30® can be enrolled at each 
site; 
8. Has refractive astigmatism no higher than -0.75D C in each eye ; 
9. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen ( Available lens 
parameters are sphere +6.00 to -6.00D , 0.25D steps ). 
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Has any known active * ocular disease and/or infection that contraindicates contact lens 
wear ; 
3. Has a  systemic or ocular condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect  a 
study outcome variable;  
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 14 4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may 
affect contact lens wear or a study outcome variable; 
5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein used in the study;  
6. Self-reports  as pregnant, lactating  or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment; 
7. Has undergone refractive error surgery  or intraocular surgery . 
* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
The upper age limit of 39 years is in place to eliminate the influence of presbyopia (age -related 
difficulties focusing at close range) on eye strain with extended close work or digital device use.  
Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety concerns but 
due to fl uctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that occur secondary 
to systemic hormonal changes  and water retention. It has further been shown that pregnancy 
could impact tear production, which could impact dry eye symptoms. Such fl uctuations could 
affect data, thereby negatively affecting study data integrity. 
5.4 STUDY MATERIALS  
Each site will be provided with an inventory of Lens A  which will be used for fitting and 
dispensing of Lens A.   
For Lens B , the clinical sites will pre -order two commercial 6-packs in each prescription in the 
range -0.25 to - 6.00 inclusively in 0.25D steps and one commercial 6-pack in each prescr iption 
in the range +0.25 to +6.00 inclusively in 0.25D steps for the use in this study. These lenses will 
be used for fitting and dispensing Lens B . Reimbursement to practice sites for study product 
expenses  for Lens B  will be provided by CooperVision, after CORE has reconciled the invoices . 
CORE will provide all sites with the study paperwork. This will include participant informed 
consent letters and study data collection forms, product accountability logs and the participant dispensing logs. CORE will train site personnel to complete the forms correctly and provide 
continued support to answer queries on correct form completion. 
  
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 16 5.4.5 DISPOSING OF STUDY  P RODUCTS  
At the end of the study, all sites will return all unused products to CORE, unless  otherwise 
directed. Worn lenses will be disposed of by participants and at the sites according to local 
regulations.  
5.4.6 PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY  
Accountability logs are completed to record all  study products that were used for each 
participant, which includes products used during the visits and those dispensed to and returned 
by each participant . 
5.5 SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
This study has a minimum of 4 scheduled study visits, including the screening visit.  There is an 
option for repeated screening visit  if needed.  
A scheduled 1- month  follow- up visits may only take place when the participant  attends  wearing  
the study lenses for at least two hours  that day . If this is not the case and the participant  is not 
experiencing any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally within 
the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and at the end of the study, the data collected during protocol deviations  will be assessed for their 
suitability to be included in the analysis population. 
Table 3 summarizes the scheduled study visits and study codes.

in the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria and is eligible to continue in the study.  
15. If the required prescriptions for both lens types are available, the lens Dispense visit (1- 0) 
will occur on the same day, otherwise the correct lens powers  will be ordered and the 
Dispense visit  will be scheduled once both lens  types are on site (within 0-21 days after 
Visit 0 ).  
 
5.5.2 REPEATED SCREENING VI SITS (VISIT 0 OR VISIT 0 /R1) 
In some circumstances a repeated screening may need to be scheduled. Examples include, but 
are not limited to:  
1. Incomplete information available at time of screening to determine eligibility (e.g. current lens brands worn, history from current eye care practitioner etc.)  
2. Study procedures unable to be completed in time scheduled for visit;  
3. Study products not available at the time of the screening visit;

5.5.6 STUDY EXIT  
The study exit form will be completed when a participant exits the study. This form will be 
completed either after the last  study visit, or if the participant is discontinued from the study at 
another time, complete also an unscheduled visit form. A study exit form must be completed for all participants who have taken a study ID number. If in the opinion of the investigator post -study 
follow- up visits are required, the exit form will be completed after the last follow -up visit.  
Exit visual acuity will be recorded with either the participant’s spectacles, refraction or habitual 
contact lenses. An exit biomicroscopy assessment will be conducted if not already completed on the same day for a concurrent study visit.

6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e. subjective ratings) will be monitored by CORE. Deviations from the study 

EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 27 plan as  described in the protocol will be reported in the study report. As described in Section 13.4, 
major protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and Sterling Institutional Review Board  
within 10 days of becoming aware of them (as per Sterling Institutional Review Board  guidelines) .  
7 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO HUMAN PARTICIPANTS 
There may be no direct benefits to the subjects in this study . Participation in a study may contribute 
to scientific research information that may be used in the development  of new contact lens 
products. The  subjects will receive  an examination of the front part of their eyes and may have the 
opportunity to try a different type of soft contact lenses and/or different lens care products at no 
cost to them. The contact lens materials used in this study are commercially available as daily wear. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) , similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
All lenses used in this study are IDE exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c )2. The two study contact lens  
types will be worn as per their approved use; on a daily wear basis with monthly replacement.  
When contact lenses are worn on a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact lenses. When contact lenses are worn on an extended wear 
basis, there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing contact 
lenses on a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact lenses can occur  (e.g. 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses 
include discomfort, dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does 
exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection 
will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by 35- million Americans who currently wear 
contact lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known al lergy or sensitivity to fluorescein.  
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto- keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact lens 
fitting will be used. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 
mm or digital cameras . Patients will be monitored frequently  until the end of the study to reduce 
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 30 8.1 NORMAL OR ADAPTIVE SYMPTOMS 
Transient symptoms such as end- of-day dryness, lens awareness, itching or burning or other 
discomfort may occur with contact lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These 
are not reported as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opinion they are unexpected in nature, severe or have a high rate of occurrence.  
8.2 PROCEDURES FOR ADVERSE E VENTS  
Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator the ocular adverse events  may be managed at the practice, or the 
participant may be referred to another eye care practitioner for treatment. The investigator will attempt to determine whether the reaction is related to the test device or a result of other factors. 
An adverse event form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a 
separate adverse event form will be completed for each eye. Whenever possible, the adverse 
event will be photo- documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the sponsor (bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further 
change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional 
and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. The site’s Principal  Investigator will also report the event to Sterling  IRB within 10 days of 
becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All 
fatal or life -threateni ng events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non- Significant Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  
and the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after becoming aware of 
the occurrence.

9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants discontinued from a study will be reimbursed for their active involvement in the study (including the initia l screening visit  and all lens fitting visits) as per the information on the consent letter .  
Upon discontinuing, a participant will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may  be 
discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the 
study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding: Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgemen t of the investigator.   

EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 32 • Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study, they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms: If the participant has persistent symptoms, they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules and/or study procedures.  
• Instillation of topical ocular medication:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topical ocular medication during the study unless that topical ocular medication is prescribed for a limited duration (less than two weeks) to treat a transient condition; in this case the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the investigator) after stopping topical ocular medication following resolution of the ocular 
condition).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contacted and do 
not return to complete the final study exit, and if the investigator has made a reasonable effort to contact the participant for a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by the sponsor, CORE or Sterling IRB.  
A discontinuation form, stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to follow- up in which case only the signature of the investigator is required.    
When a participant chose to discontinue from the study, they will be given the opportunity to withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation 
form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a  Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to CORE  and the sponsor within 24 hours  of the investigator 
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 33 becoming aware of the  malfunction. Sterling IRB  would also be notified within 24 hours of any 
device malfunction that may contribute to a  Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possible.  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as 
comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as complaints or device malfunctions. 
11 STUDY COMPLETION AND REMUNERATION 
At the last scheduled protocol visit a study completion form will be completed, which requires the signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  Participants will also be provided with a letter of appreciation.    
Once their involvement in the study is complete, participants will be informed about receiving feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation. 
Participant remuneration will be paid as per site contract and approved consent letter . 
12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by CORE at the University of Waterloo.  Unmasked data analysis will be conducted using Statistica 14.0, Statsoft or other suitable software.  Descriptive statistics will be provided on demographic data (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.). Table 7  lists 
the primary and other outcome variables and anticipated statistical procedures.  
Visual acuity results will be converted to LogMAR for analysis purposes. 
Comparisons will be made between the study lenses for the variables measured at the 1 -month 
visits. Additionally, the subjective ratings completed on days 7, 14 and 27  with each study lens 
will be compared. A binomial test will be used to analyze the results for the count data of 
subjective preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the number of “no 
preference” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be 
equally likely to choose either.  
For assessments conducted for each eye separately, the right eye will be  used for analysis. If a 
general difference  is found (paired t -test / Wilcoxon matched pairs) between OD and OS, a 
comment will be  provided. 
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 35 out by the University of Waterloo. More details regarding storage procedures are provided in 
section 15.7 and also in CORE SOP0 14 Clinical data management.  
At the completion of the study CORE will provide a copy of the study database in Excel format to the sponsor when requested. Data will typically be sent using Sendit. This system provides a secure way to transfer files when email is not appropriate, whether because of file size, file type or concerns over security. Sendit includes features such as password protection, a restricted 
time period for download, IP logging and email notification of download. Files may be encrypted 
prior to transmission at the request of the sponsor. Using this method means that data files are only stored on University of Waterloo servers during the transfer.   
12.3 COMMENTS ON SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Data analysis will not be conducted on comments which have been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as deemed necessary by CORE’s Lead Co -ordinator.  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All stu dy personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. 
Records of training will be kept at CORE. This will include training by CORE on the study protocol, study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and participant masking procedures, as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.  
All site Principal Investigators and co -investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular status reports to CORE. Status reports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID 
number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and regular status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits to the sites may be conducted by CORE, the sponsor, or s ponsor’s 
designate, throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Principal Investigator at each site. In addition, study records may be inspected by the sponsor, the 
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 36 sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board, and by regulatory authorities in Canada 
and the United States, namely Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing identifiable personal information.  
Study  data review and data monitoring will be conducted by CORE personnel. To improve data 
integrity, data entry will be conducted by one person and a second person will visually compare 
the data entry to the source documents.  Data queries will be reported to the site within 5 working 
days of receipt of initial data. A response resolving the query will be expected from the site within 
5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal Investigator and will be reported to the sponsor. All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal Investigator and CORE’s Lead Co -ordinator before reporting to the 
sponsor and to Sterling Institutional Review Board as per their policies.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Act which mandates the registration of certain cli nical trials 
of drugs and medical devices.  They will maintain the information on that site.  
15.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations are unanticipated or unintentional changes to a study after it has received prior sponsor approval and ethics clearance. Pr otocol deviations can be major or minor. All 
protocol deviations must be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator (see section 8.3).  
15.4.1  MAJOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations may impact the research protocol, information consent document or other study materials, usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of the participants.  
The following are examples of protocol deviations that must be reported to Sterling IRB:  
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to participants; 
• Enrollment of participants outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed to or not by the sponsor;  
• Medication / device / intervention errors (i.e. incorrect drug or dosage of drug / incorrect contact lens(es) dispensed / incorrect care system dispensed); 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -related 
intervention or upon the experimental design;  
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; incorrect version of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 38 15.4.2  MINOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations caused by or which originate with research participants are considered 
minor, and normally are not reported to Sterling IRB unless these result in increased risk to the participant(s). The following are examples of protocol deviations that are considered minor and do not require reporting to the ORE:  
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study participant missed appointment, change in appointment date);  
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -
related intervention or upon the experimental design (i.e., missing a measurement duri ng 
a session that is not considered critical for the study).  
15.4.3  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTING PROTCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations must be reported to the Sterling Institutional Review Board and the 
sponsor within 10 days  of the deviation occurring (or its discovery) using the Reportable Events 
Form . To facilitate timely reporting to the sponsor, all sites must notify CORE (see contact 
details in section 8.3) of a major protocol deviation as soon as possible. 
All protocol deviations (major and minor) occurring during the study will be documented and 
included in the final report . 
15.5 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY  
The sponsor, CORE  or Sterling Institutional Review Board may terminate the study at any time 
for any reason.

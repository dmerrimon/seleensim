Compass Device Trial
Page  3 of 12 Revised: February 14, 20171.0 Objectives*
1.1 This is  a single-arm observational trial  of a new FDA-approved 
device (Compass Vascular Access  device,  Centurion Medical  
Products, Williamston  MI; formerly Mirador Boimedical).  This 
device is a compact,  sterile, single-use extravascular blood  pressure 
transducer with a  continuous  digital pressure display.  This pressure 
measurement provides  an aid in the confirmation of appropriate 
venous access.  The device has FDA 510(k) clearance  as 
substantially equivalent to existing devices on the market.  Evidence of this clearance is included with this application.
1.2 The investigators  plan to enroll 40 consenting  patients  with BMI ≥35 
who require central  venous catheterization for clinical reasons  
independent of the existence of  this study.  For purposes of the 
study, the investigators will record  data  germane to the procedure as 
well as operator  satisfaction.  Analysis of these  data will be used to 
evaluate the appropriateness  of the  device  for this procedure in  the 
obese population,  where  device  ergonomics may be more of a  factor  
than in previous studies.
1.3 This study is  not investigating the safety  of the device, because the 
primary outcome is operator satisfaction.  None of the observed outcomes relate directly  to device safety, and the  study is not 
powered to detect  rare adverse events.
1.4 This study is  also not investigating the effectiveness of the device.   
The investigators  are not gathering  any data that would  permit  
evaluation of the device’s  accuracy  or precision, which are the 
salient factors for effectiveness of a measurement device.
1.5 Deidentified  study  data  may be shared with the sponsor, but the 
investigators do not plan to submit  study data to the  FDA.
2.0 Background*
Central venous  catheterization (CVC) is a common perioperative procedure that is 
associated with  a number of potential mechanical complications.   It  involves three steps: 
first a needle  is introduced to the target  vein,  followed by a guidewire, and  finally the 
catheter itself.  The  needle is relatively fine,  and the guidewire slightly larger, but  the 
catheter is relatively large, with corresponding  increases in the severity of complications 
associated with  arterial puncture.  Inadvertent  arterial cannulation  is the most common 
mechanical complication of CVC  placement and is associated with significant morbidity 
and mortality.(1)  Complications of arterial puncture  or cannulation may lead to 
uncontrolled hemorrhage, airway compromise related to  neck hematoma, cerebrovascular  
accident, hemothorax, mediastinal bleeding, cardiac tamponade, aortic  dissection,  and 
death.
The use of ultrasound guidance for CVC has mitigated the risk for arterial 
cannulation but  not eliminated it.  Ultrasound  guidance has decreased the rate of arterial  
puncture to  rates as  low as 0.5%. (1)  Nonetheless, arterial cannulation can  still occur 
during CVC placement  with  ultrasound  guidance  for a variety of reasons  primarily  
Compass Device Trial
Page  4 of 12 Revised: February 14, 2017related to either incorrect identification of the target vein or the inability to accurately  
determine the location of the tip of  the access needle.(2)
Due to  the limitations of  two-dimensional surface ultrasound and the goal of 
further mitigating the risk of arterial access during CVC insertion, various methods have been employed to confirm that only the target vein has  been  accessed.  One method is 
echocardiographic confirmation of guidewire placement in the superior vena cava and/or  
the right  heart; however,  aside from select operative procedures, use of echocardiography  
in the perioperative period or in the  intensive care unit (ICU) is limited, costly, and may 
not be contemporaneous  with CVC  placement.   A second method  is the use of column 
manometry to transduce the intravascular  pressure.   However, performance  of manometry  
may be cumbersome  and may generate  a false negative finding (fluid column appears  
venous) even when the  CVC is intra-arterial due to obstruction of the proximal  
transduction site or a low cardiac output state.
An FDA-approved electronic  extravascular blood pressure monitor (Compass® 
Vascular Access device,  Centurion Medical Products, Williamston, Mi.) has been 
recently developed which  provides an aid in the confirmation  of appropriate CVC access.  
The device  is a compact, sterile, single-use  pressure  transducer that has a  continuous 
digital pressure  (mmHg) display.  The device connects in  a luer-lock fashion to  all 
standard syringes  and needles and has a separate self-sealing channel  for CVC guidewire 
insertion and withdrawal.  The  device  is intercalated between the syringe proper and  the 
needle used to access the  target vessel.  The  device  permits confirmation of guidewire 
insertion into the  target vein via  its pressure display.  There are two previous reports on 
the use of this device in the perioperative and ICU settings.(3,4)  In the report  by Togashi 
et al(3), 298 CVC placements were performed  with the device and five inadvertent 
arterial punctures occurred  even  though ultrasound guidance  was utilized.  All  five of 
these inadvertent arterial punctures were  correctly identified prior to  cannulation  because 
of the use of  the device. (3)  The device did not produce any adverse  events.  Furthermore, 
Togashi et al performed a  cost-benefit analysis comparing the claim costs associated with 
a single  mechanical CVC injury (per  American  Society of Anesthesiology Closed  Claims  
Database(5): $95,000 / event) versus device costs and found that  the use of the novel 
device generated a  net savings of $116 for each  CVC  insertion.(3)  The Togashi group (3) 
noted that some operators would prefer  a smaller device,  but most were satisfied with  it 
as tested.  The planned case series is intended to evaluate use of the device  in the obese 
population (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2), where device ergonomics may be  more  of a factor.

3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*
3.1 The study  population consists of obese  (≥35 kg/m2) adult (≥18 yrs)  
patients presenting  at the UNM Hospital main/adult  operating rooms 
who require central  venous catheter  (CVC) placement for  their  
perioperative care.  The  investigators will exclude pregnant women, 
adults unable to consent, and prisoners.
3.2 Members of the commonly recognized vulnerable  populations  will 
not be enrolled: pregnant women, prisoners, neonates of uncertain  
viability or that  are nonviable,  and minors.
4.0 Study-Wide Number of Subjects*
4.1 The planned completed sample size is 40 patients.  The investigators  
request HRRC permission to enroll  up to 45 patients in  order  to 
accommodate any whose CVC procedures may  be cancelled 
between consenting  and commencement of the actual procedure, but  
will only complete  data collection for 40 patients.
5.0 Study-Wide Recruitment Methods*
This is  a single-site  study; local recruitment methods are described  in section 22 
below.
6.0 Multi-Site Research*
6.1 This is  a single-site  study.
7.0 Study  Timelines*
7.1 Describe:
 A given  individual  will participate in the study for 
approximately 15 minutes,  representing  the time  required  for 
the CVC placement.
 The investigators  anticipate that the  study  sample can  be 
enrolled in approximately six months to one year.
 The investigators  estimate that all analyses will be completed 
in one  year  after  completion of enrollment.
8.0 Study  Endpoints*
8.1 This is  an observational study.  The main data  point  of interest  is 
operator satisfaction.   The number  of inadvertent arterial punctures 
Compass Device Trial
Page  6 of 12 Revised: February 14, 2017identified by the device  (if any) will also be  recorded.  The data 
collection form is included  with this HRRC application.
8.2 The investigators  have not identified  any safety  endpoints.
9.0 Procedures Involved*
9.1 This is  an observational study to be completed on  40 patients 
meeting the inclusion/exclusion  criteria.   Subjects presenting for 
CVC placement at  the UNMH operating suites will be  prepared as  
usual and  consent obtained.   The  Compass  pressure measurement 
device will be included in  the CVC  placement  apparatus as per  the 
manufacturer’s directions.  Data will be recorded on the placement 
procedure as  well as routine patient demographic data.  Identifiers 
will not be recorded.
9.2 A photograph of the device (with attached  syringe and needle) is  
below.  
9.3 The only research procedure  is the inclusion of the device in  the 
CVC placement apparatus, for  patients who would already be having 
CVC placement regardless of  the existence of this study.  The 
research does not modify routine practice  surrounding CVC 
placement (patient selection and preparation,  operating personnel, 
catheter equipment, the  procedure itself, or medications used) in  any 
way.  These considerations  should mitigate  risks.
9.4
 As noted above, enrollment of subjects  from a population 
already presenting for CVC placement regardless of the existence of  this study mitigates study risks.  The  investigators  
are similarly not modifying routine CVC practice except to  
specify the use of the  studied  device.
 The project does not specify  the use of any drugs.   The device 
being studied  is the Compass for  CVC  pressure transducer 
device (Centurion Medical  Products, Williamston MI).
 The data collection  form is included  with this application.
Compass Device Trial
Page  7 of 12 Revised: February 14, 20179.5 Data to be collected include routine demographic data (age, sex, height, weight, BMI, ASA  status), data surrounding the CVC 
placement procedure (insertion location, use of ultrasound guidance,  
venous pressure before/after guidewire  placement,  operator 
satisfaction), and  incidence  of inadvertent arterial puncture.
10.0 Data and Specimen Banking*
10.1 Data will be  recorded on paper forms with identifiers in  order to  
permit resolution of any incomplete/unclear data entries.  Data will 
be deidentified upon transfer to an electronic spreadsheet for analysis.  The identifiable data  forms  will be retained  until 
publication of results in  order to permit  any supplemental analyses 
requested by peer  reviewers.  The  deidentified data may be retained 
indefinitely for potential future  use, such as in serving as the 
underlying dataset  for power  analysis of a future  study.
10.2 Deidentified  data may be reviewed  by the study sponsor.  Release  of 
deidentified data  may be  requested by contacting the  PI and/or 
sponsor.  Both  the PI and study sponsor must approve release. 
Release will only  be made to personnel who are qualified researchers  
pursuing legitimate  research projects, in the opinion of the PI and/or 
sponsor.  Identifiable data will not be released except as required by law.
11.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality
11.1 Data will be  summarized by reporting  mean (SD) of continuous 
variables such as BMI and age, percentages for categorical data such as patient sex, and raw  count for inadvertent arterial punctures.
11.2 As this  is an observational study,  a power analysis is not useful.
11.3 All investigators  are CITI- and  HIPAA-certified.  Completed data 
collection forms will be maintained in locked  cabinets in 
Anesthesiology department  offices,  which  are a patient-restricted  
area.  As  noted  in section 10 above,  the deidentified data will be  
retained indefinitely.   Only investigators will have  access  to study 
data, but they  will transmit an electronic  copy of deidentified study 
data to the sponsor  upon request.   Qualified researchers  may request  
an electronic copy of  the deidentified data  as listed  in section  10 
above.  Identifiable data will not be  released except as  required by 
law.
12.0 Provisions to Monitor the  Data to Ensure the  Safety  of Subjects*
The investigators believe  that this is  a Minimal Risk  study.   The only 
research-related procedure  is the inclusion of  a small FDA-approved 
device in the apparatus used to perform CVC placement, in accordance with its labeling.
Compass Device Trial
Page  8 of 12 Revised: February 14, 201713.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*
13.1 The investigators  have not identified  any circumstances in  which 
participants would  be withdrawn  without their  consent.
13.2 The investigators  do not anticipate  situations in which  advance plans  
for orderly termination of research participation would be required.
13.3 The investigators  do not anticipate  any requests for withdrawal from  
the study.
14.0 Risks to Subjects*
14.1 Previous studies on this sterile, single-use  device have identified no 
adverse events arising due to its use.  The  only  issue identified  to 
date is the size of the  device; a few  operators  (reported in  reference 3 
listed above) would prefer that it be  smaller.  It is therefore possible,  
but has not ever  been demonstrated,  that the device’s  presence  may 
impede CVC placement in  some way.  This risk is  completely  
reversible, because the device can  simply be removed from the 
needle apparatus if it is in the way.  As in any  study, there are risks 
of confidentiality breach.  This study does not gather data that are especially sensitive,  so the consequences of any confidentiality 
breach are minor.  All risks are mitigated  to the extent possible by 
restricting enrollment to a population  that would have received CVC  
placement regardless  of the existence of  this study.
14.2 The presence of the  device in the needle apparatus may present  some  
unforeseeable risk, but as noted above,  no such risks  have been 
reported, and  the device  can simply be removed so  that the CVC 
placement can proceed as usual.
14.3 The investigators  have not identified  any risks to the embryo or fetus 
should a subject  be pregnant at  the time of the study.
14.4 The investigators  have not identified  any risks to others who  are not  
subjects.
15.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects*
15.1 While rare, inadvertent arterial  puncture  is possible during  CVC 
placement.  The studied device does not eliminate this risk, but rather permits early identification of  arterial  placement through  
pressure measurement; pulsatile pressure  indicates arterial 
placement.  Identification of arterial  puncture at  this point, before 
introduction of  the guidewire or catheter,  greatly reduces the 
consequences of arterial puncture.  In a previous study on this  device 
(reference 3 above), arterial puncture  was identified in 1.7% of 
subjects, and  all were recognized before guidewire insertion (and  
thus clearly before  catheter insertion; no guidewires or catheters 
were inserted in arteries).  Subjects in this study may similarly  
Compass Device Trial
Page  9 of 12 Revised: February 14, 2017receive the benefit of early identification  of inadvertent arterial  
puncture, if  any of these punctures do occur.
16.0 Vulnerable Populations*
16.1 This project does not involve the commonly-recognized  vulnerable 
populations.
17.0 Community-Based Participatory Research*
This study  does not constitute community-based participatory 
research.
18.0 Sharing  of Results with Subjects*
18.1 This study does not involve testing or other  results that may affect  
future treatment decisions for subjects,  so there are none to share  
with subjects.  Final study results will also not be shared with  
patients, because others’ experience has no direct  effect  on the 
patient.  
19.0 Setting
19.1 Research activities will occur at the UNMH operating suites and in  
the Anesthesiology  department offices.
 Subjects will be identified  from  among the patient population 
at the  UNMH operating  suites.  CVC placement for recruited 
patients will occur  as planned  at the UNMH main operative 
setting.
20.0 Resources  Available
20.1 All investigators  who will perform the CVC placements are licensed 
physicians authorized to  practice  and perform this procedure at 
UNMH.  Investigator Tim  Petersen PhD is a staff member  in the 
Department of  Anesthesiology  with experience in study  design and  
data analysis.
20.2 Describe  other  resources available to conduct  the research:  For 
example, as appropriate:
 A conservative estimate of the number  of patients presenting  to 
the UNMH main  OR suites who require  CVC  placement is 10-
20 per week.  Of these, approximately  1/3 have BMI  ≥35.
 Investigators will conduct study activities in conjunction with their routine clinical  and non-clinical duties. 
 The operating suites at UNMH are equipped with the personnel, facilities, and  other resources needed to place  CVCs 
and respond to any eventuality  arising  from the placement of a 
CVC.
 Upon HRRC approval, the  approved  version of  the protocol 
will be distributed to all  participating investigators.   The  
Compass Device Trial
Page  10 of 12 Revised: February 14, 2017investigators do not anticipate any need  for protocol 
modifications after  HRRC  approval.
21.0 Prior Approvals
21.1 Beyond the  routine  departmental review process and  HRRC  review, 
no other approvals are necessary  for this project.
22.0 Recruitment Methods
22.1 After HRRC approval, enrollment will occur among at least  40 and 
up to 45 patients  meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
22.2 Subjects will be  drawn from adult patients  requiring CVC placement  
at the UNMH main  operating rooms.
22.3 Investigators will identify subjects from among  their  routine patients.  
22.4 No patient recruitment materials will be used.
22.5 Subjects will not be  paid.
22.6 Investigators have drafted a  proposed information handout for 
participating physicians  who will  place CVCs with the Compass 
device in this  study.  The  handout notes that an  investigator will 
obtain patient  consent, and outlines both the  target population and  
the study procedures.  It  also encourages participating physicians to 
contact the PI with any remaining  questions.
23.0 Local Number of Subjects
23.1 As noted above, up to 45 patients will be included in  this study, with 
a target completed  sample size of 40.
24.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy  Interests of Subjects
24.1 All research-related activity will occur in the context of medical  
care, which already  occurs in a suitable private location.  Similarly,  
investigators are already authorized  to initiate  contact with potential 
subjects as  part of clinical  care.
25.0 Compensation for  Research-Related  Injury
25.1 The investigators  believe that  this is  a Minimal Risk study.  As such, 
there is not a plan for compensation for research-related injury.
26.0 Economic  Burden to Subjects
26.1 Participation will not modify  patient costs in any way.
27.0 Consent Process
27.1. Consent will be obtained  by an HRRC-approved investigator  prior to the 
commencement of  research procedures.   All investigators are CITI- and HIPAA-
certified.
27.1.1. The consent process  will occur in the UNMH operating  suites.
Compass Device Trial
Page  11 of 12 Revised: February 14, 201727.1.2. Coercion and undue influence will be  avoided by not  paying participants,  
and by assuring  prospective enrollees that their participation  is entirely 
voluntary: they  can still receive CVC  placement without participating.
27.1.3. Additional lead time for prospective subjects to consider participation is not available in this study because  CVC placement is  usually performed  
shortly after the  decision that one is needed.  Similarly, there is published 
research that examines the  effect of additional consideration time on 
patients’ views of  the consent  process and their rights in  anesthesia  
clinical trials.  This research has shown that consent on the day of surgery for trials of  treatments  with similar  risks/benefits  does  not compromise 
patient rights or welfare. The  study  authors  (Murphy et al., “Consent for 
Anesthesia Clinical Trials on the Day  of Surgery,” Anesthesiology 2016;  
124:1246-55) found that  anesthesia patients  approached for research 
consent on the  day of surgery were satisfied with  the consent  process, 
felt that  the protocol was  well explained  and comprehended, and agreed 
that the  setting  was appropriate.  Conversely, these patients strongly 
disagreed that  they  were anxious at the time of  consent,  felt any  obligation 
to participate, or regretted participating.  Importantly, these results were not changed  by the use of a preadmission telephone call  to describe the 
research protocol and  provide greatly extended time for  patients to  
consider their participation.  If patients  felt that day-of-surgery consent  
represented a violation of their  rights or an imposition on their welfare, 
these results would have been  very different.
27.1.4. As this  study involves  a one-time clinical  procedure, the investigators 
believe that a one-time consent procedure  is appropriate, and  the study 
thus does not require provisions for ensuring  ongoing consent.
Subjects not fluent in English
27.1.5. As this  study involves  a relatively small sample, the investigators  
anticipate that  few subjects will speak  Spanish  exclusively.   If any eligible 
patients are  Spanish speakers, the investigators will  use the routine  
UNMH oral  translation procedures  to obtain consent, document it with the 
Spanish short form consent included with this application, and  provide  
subjects with a  copy of the English consent document as  well.
Cognitively Impaired  Adults/Adults Unable to Consent/Use of a Legally 
Authorized Representative
27.1.6. Inability  to consent is an exclusion criterion.
Subjects who are not  yet adults  (infants,  children, teenagers)
27.1.7. Only adults will be  enrolled.
28.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing
28.1 Consent will be documented on an HRRC-approved consent form;  a 
proposed form  is included with this application.
Compass Device Trial
Page  12 of 12 Revised: February 14, 201729.0 Drugs or  Devices
29.1 The devices to be  studied will be  stored in the Cardiac Anesthesia  
office, which is a  separate area  within the patient-restricted 
Department of  Anesthesiology  administrative  offices.  These offices  
are adjacent to the  UNMH operating suites, so obtaining a device for 
a relevant patient will not present  significant delay to  any 
procedures.  In this way,  the devices will be maintained separately 
from regular operating room supplies and  equipment,  so they will 
not be mistakenly used on non-subject  patients.   
29.2 Device trade name: Compass for  CVC
29.3 Device common name: Extravascular blood pressure transducer
29.4 Manufacturer: Centurion Medical  Products, Williamston MI  
(formerly Mirador Biomedical)
29.5 The device received FDA 510(k) clearance (K133624) without a  
requirement for clinical testing, and there  is not an IDE for this study 
(see section 29.7 below).
29.6 The use of the device in this  setting  does not present a potential for 
serious risk to the  health, safety, or  welfare  of a subject.
29.7 This study is  IDE-exempt in accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(c) and 
the FDA’s “Information Sheet  Guidance for IRBs, Clinical 
Investigators, and Sponsors: Frequently  Asked Questions  about  
Medical Devices” available  at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/U
CM127067.pdf (see section 12C on page 8 of that document), 
because the device  will be  used in accordance with the indications  in 
its approved labeling in this study.  The study does not  modify the 
labeling, indications, instructions for use, or any other aspect of device administration.  The  study  reviews operator satisfaction when 
using the device as directed in one  subset of the intended population.

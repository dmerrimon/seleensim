INN0-206-P2-STS-01 
Title of the Protocol: 
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Phase 2b Study to Investigate the Preliminary Efficacy and 
Safety of INN0-206 (Doxorubicin-EMCH) Compared to Doxorubicin in Subjects with Metastatic, 
Locally Advanced, or Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma 
Primary Objectives: 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of administration of INNO-
206 compared to doxorubicin in subjects with metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable soft 
tissue sarcoma as measured by progression-free survival, progression-free survival at 3 and 6 
months, tumor response and overall survival. 
Secondary Objectives: 
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of INN0-206 compared to doxorubicin 
in this population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings 
on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) 
scans/cardiac ultrasound evaluations, electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and weight. 
Study Rationale and Significance: 
INN0-206 is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment. This carrier-linked prod rug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when compared with free 
doxorubicin. 
Patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas have a poor 
prognosis with progression-free survival of around 4-5 months and median overall survival of 
approximately 15 months. Three-year survival rates as high as 30% have been observed in some 
clinical studies. Several chemotherapy regimens have been explored as palliative therapy for 
subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. Combinations of ifosfamide and doxorubicin appear to 
offer the highest response rates and longest time to progression. However, these regimens are quite 
toxic and have not significantly increased survival in these individuals. INN0-206 may improve the 
activity of doxorubicin without increasing its toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal studies.

I NN0-206-P2-STS-01 
Study Design and Methodology: 
This is a phase 2b open-label study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of INN0-206 
administered at 350 mglm2 (260 mglm2 doxorubicin equivalent) intravenously (IV) on Day 1 every 21 
days for up to 6 consecutive cycles compared to doxorubicin administered at 75 mglm2for up to 6 
consecutive cycles, Subjects will be randomized 2: 1 to receive either INN0-206 or doxorubicin, 
Tumor response will be monitored prior to (within 5 days) of Cycles 3 and 6 (then every 2 months for 
8 months, then every 3 months until disease progression) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1, 1 criteria, and treatment will continue every 21 days until tumor progression 
is observed, 6 cycles of treatment are completed or unacceptable toxicity occurs, Progression-free 
survival [PFS], progression-free survival at 3 and 6 months and overall survival [OS] will be monitored 
as other primary objectives, Subjects will visit the study site every 21 days for their IV infusions, at 
which time safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical examination, laboratory evaluations 
(serum chemistry, complete blood count [CBC], and urinalysis), vital signs, weight measurements, 
ECOG and ECGs will be performed, Cardiac function will also be followed periodically using either 
MUGA scans or cardiac ultrasounds,

INN0-206-P2-STS-01 
Statistical Methods: 
In accordance with the intention-to-treat principle, all randomized subjects who enter active treatment 
and have had at least 1 dose of study medication and 1 post-dose efficacy measurement will be 
included in the primary statistical analyses according to the treatment group to which they were 
originally assigned. 
Efficacy: 
Tumor response will be monitored prior to Cycle 3 and 6 as well as every 2 months for 8 months from 
randomization, then every 3 months until disease progression. For the estimation of progression-free 
and overall survival a Kaplan-Meier analysis will be performed. The percentage of subjects with 
complete or partial responses, or stable disease will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months. 
Safety: 
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group. The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total number of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal 
laboratory tests will be compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. Adverse events, ability to 
remain on assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital 
signs, weight, ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant medications, will be 
assessed to characterize the safety profile of the treatment regimens. Descriptive statistics denoting 
the changes from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and 
vital signs will also be provided.

th the intention-to-treat principle, all randomized subjects who enter active treatment 
and have had at least 1 dose of study medication and 1 post-dose efficacy measurement will be 
included in the primary statistical analyses according to the treatment group to which they were originally assigned.   
Efficacy:   
Tumor response will be monitored every 60 days (2 months) after Cycle 1-Day 1 until Day 240 (8 months) from first drug application (within 5 days of given time point), then every 3 months until disease progression. For the estimation of progression-free and overall survival a Kaplan-Meier analysis will be performed.  The percentage of subjects with complete or partial responses, or stable disease will be evaluated at 4 and 6 months. 
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group.  The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total number of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal laboratory tests will be compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test. Adverse events, ability to remain on assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, weight, ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant medications, will be 
assessed to characterize the safety profile of the treatment regimens. Descriptive statistics denoting 
the changes from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs will also be provided.

Protocol Number:  
INNO -206-P2-STS-01 
 Phase of Development: 2b 
 
Title of the Protocol :  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open -Label Phase 2b Study to Investigate the Preliminary Efficacy and 
Safety of INNO -206 (Doxorubicin -EMCH) Compared to Doxorubicin in Subject s with Metastatic , 
Locally Advanced,  or Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objective  of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of administration of INNO -
206 compared to doxorubicin in subjects with metastatic , locally a dvanced,   or unresectable soft 
tissue sarcoma as measured by progression -free survival , progression -free survival at 4 and 6 
months, tumor response  and overall survival.  
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of INNO -206 compared to doxorubicin  
in this population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings 
on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, multiple -gated acquisition (MUGA) 
scans/cardiac ultrasou nd evaluations, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , and weight.  
Study Rational e and Significance:  
INNO -206 is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by c leaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when compared with free 
doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas have a poor 
prognosis with progression -free survival of around 4-5 months and median overall survival of 
approximately 15 months.  Three -year survival rates as high as  30% have been observed  in some  
clinical studies.  Several chemotherapy regimens have been explored as palliative therapy for 
subject s with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. Combinations of ifosfamide and doxorubicin appear to 
offer the highest response rates and longest time to progression.  However, these regimens  are quite 
toxic and have not significantly increased survival in these individuals.  INNO -206 may improve the 
activity of doxorubicin without increasing its toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal studies.

Protocol Number:  
INNO -206-P2-STS-01 
 Phase of Development: 2b 
 
Study Design and Met hodology:  
This is a phase 2b open -label study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of INNO -206 
administered at 350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent )  intravenously ( IV) on Day 1 every 21 
days for  up to  6 consecutive cycles  compared to doxo rubicin administered at 75 mg/m2 for up to 6 
consecutive cycles . Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive either INNO -206 or doxorubicin.  
Subjects will visit the study site every 21 days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, 
including AEs, a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry, complete 
blood count [ CBC ], and urinalysis ), vital signs, weight measurements, ECOG  performance status  and 
ECG s will be performed.  Cardiac function will also be followed period ically using either MUGA scans 
or cardiac ultrasound s. Treatment will continue every 21 days until tumor progression is observed, 6 
cycles of treatment are completed or unacceptable toxicity occurs .  
Tumor response will be monitored every 6 weeks from Cycl e 1-Day 1  during treatment , at End of 
Treatment,  2 months following the End of Treatment scan (for those subjects completing 6 cycles), 
and then every 3 months until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 cr iteria.   For those subjects that leave the study prior to completing Cycle 6, 
and who do not start another therapy, they can be followed 2 months following the End of Treatment 
scan, and then every 3 months until disease progression.  However, if a subject  receives another 
therapy, they shoul d only be followed for overall s urvival  [OS]. Progression -free survival  [PFS] , 
progression -free survival at  4 and 6 months and OS will be monitored as other primary objectives.

Anticipated Serious 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Serious ADE which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome 
has been identified in the risk management file.  
Device Deficiency  Inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Note: This definition 
includes malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeli ng. 
Malfunction  Failure of a medical device to meet its performance specifications 
or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications 
include all claims made in the labeling of the device. The intended 
performance of the device refers to the int ended use for which the 
device is labeled or marketed.  
Non-serious Adverse 
Event  AE that does not meet the criteria for an SAE.  
Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)  AE that led to any of the following:  
• Death.  
• A serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either 
resulted in:  
a) a life -threatening illness or injury.  
Note: Life -threatening means that the individual was at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, ie, it

caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
b) any potentially sight -threatening event or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function.  
c) in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.  
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, 
without serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
an SAE. In general, hospitalization signifies that the 
individual remained at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment (usually involving an 
overnight stay) that would not ha ve been appropriate in the 
physician's office or an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalization are adverse events. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other 
serious criteria, the event is serious. When in do ubt as to 
whether “hospitalization ” occurred, the event should be 
considered serious.  
d) a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b).  
e) any indirect harm as a consequence of incorrect diagnostic 
test results when used within manufacturer ’s instructi ons 
for use.  
• Fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect.  
Refer to Section 7.1 for additional SAEs.  
Serious Adverse 
Device Effect 
(SADE)  ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of 
an SAE.  
Significant Non-
Serious Adverse 
Event  A significant non -serious AE is a symptomatic, device -related, 
non-sight threatening AE that warrants discontinuation of any 
contact lens wear for greater than or equal to 2 weeks.  
Refer to Section 7.1 for additional Significant N on-Serious AEs.  
Unanticipated 
Serious Adverse 
Device Effect  Serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence,

Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durabilit y, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in  the 
Device Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm separately.

7.2 Monitoring for Adverse Event s 
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been a ny changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
Additionally, changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnaires evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by the Investigator. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the Investigator, is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
7.3 Procedures for Recor ding and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study a nd should be recorded as medical 
history .

Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study marketed devices/products (ie, OFR ) will be 
considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket vigilance procedures) 
and should be communicated to the device ’s/product ’s manufacturer as per local 
requirements.  
Study Sponsor representatives  may be contacted for any protocol related question.

9.1 Completion of Source Documents and Case Report Forms  
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to complete the eCRFs exist and are accessible for verification by the site monitor, 
and all discrepancies shall be app ropriately documented via the query resolution process. 
Study monitors are appointed by the Study Sponsor and are independent of study site staff. If 
electronic records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in advance 
of starting th e study.  
At a minimum, source documents should include the following information for each subject:  
• Subject identification (name, sex, race/ethnicity)  
• Documentation of subject eligibility  
• Date of informed consent  
• Dates of visits  
• Documentation that protocol  specific procedures were performed  
• Results of study parameters, as required by the protocol  
• IP accountability records  
• Documentation of AEs and other safety parameters (if applicable)  
• Records regarding medical histories and the use of concomitant therapies  prior to and 
during the study  
• Date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable  
It is required that the author of an entry in the source documents be identifiable. Direct access 
to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying that 
the data recorded on the eCRF are consistent with the original source data.  
Only designated individuals may complete the eCRFs. The eCRFs will be submitted at 
regular intervals following the clinical study visit sc hedule. It is expected that all data 
reported will have corresponding entries in the source documents. The Principal Investigator 
is responsible for reviewing and certifying that the eCRFs are accurate and complete. The 
only subject identifiers recorded on  the eCRFs will be subject number and subject 
demographic information.

Alcon – Business Use Only  9.2 Data Review and Clarifications  
Upon completion of the eCRFs, a targeted review of the eCRF data to the subject ’s source 
data will be completed by the site monitor to ensure completeness  and accuracy. Additional 
data clarifications and/or additions may be needed as a result of the data cleaning process. 
Data clarifications are documented and are part of each subject ’s eCRFs.  
9.3 Regulatory Documentation and Records Retention  
The Investigator is required to maintain up -to-date, complete regulatory documentation as 
indicated by the Sponsor and the Investigator ’s files will be reviewed as part of the ongoing 
study monitoring. Financial disclosure is not subject to regulatory inspection and should  be 
kept separately.  
Additionally, the Investigator must keep study records and source documents until the 
Sponsor provides written approval for their destruction. If the Investigator retires, relocates, 
or for any other reason withdraws from responsibility of keeping the study records, the 
Sponsor must be notified and suitable arrangements made for retention of study records and 
source documents needed to comply with national and international regulations (generally 
2 years after discontinuing  clinical development or after the last  marketing approval).  
10 ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE

if the study is terminated prematurely. Finally, the Investigator must report to the IRB on the 
progress of the study at intervals stipulated by the IRB.  
V oluntary info rmed consent must be obtained from every subject (and/or legal representative, 
as applicable) prior to the initiation of any screening or other study -related procedures. The 
Investigator must have a defined process for obtaining consent. Specifically, the Investigator, 
or delegate, must explain the clinical study to each potential subject and the subject must 
indicate voluntary consent by signing and dating the approved informed consent form. The 
subject must be provided an opportunity to ask questions of t he Investigator, and if required 
by local regulation, other qualified personnel. The Investigator must provide the subject with 
a copy of the consent form written in a language the subject understands. The consent 
document must meet all applicable local la ws and provide subjects with information 
regarding the purpose, procedures, requirements, and restrictions of the study, along with any 
known risks and potential benefits associated with the IP, the available compensation, and the 
established provisions fo r maintaining confidentiality of personal, protected health 
information. Subjects will be told about the voluntary nature of participation in the study and 
must be provided with contact information for the appropriate individuals should questions or 
concer ns arise during the study. The subject also must be told that their records may be 
accessed by appropriate authorities and Sponsor -designated personnel. The Investigator must 
keep the original, signed copy of the consent and must provide a duplicate copy t o each 
subject according to local regulations. Following this study, the subject will return to their 
eye care professional for their routine eye care and contact lenses.

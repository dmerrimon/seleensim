TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title  An Open -Label, Long -Term Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety of 
Cortexolone 17α- Propionate (CB -03-01) Cream, 1% Applied Twice -Daily 
in Subjects with Acne Vulgaris  
Study Type  Phase 3  
Test Article / 
Investigational Product  CB-03-01 cream containing 1% cortexolone 17α -propionate  
Study Objective  The primary objective of this study is to determine the long -term safety of 
CB-03-01 cream, 1% applied twice daily for an additional nine months in 
subjects with acne vulgaris that participated in t he Phase 3 pivotal studies for 
a total treatment of up to 12 months.  
Study Design  Multicenter, open label study.  
Treatment Groups  All subjects will apply CB -03-01 cream, 1% twice daily (BID) to the entire 
face and, if designated by investigator AND desired by subject, truncal acne 
for an additional nine months of treatment.  
Duration of Treatment  9 additional months.  
 
All subjects will apply the active medication (CB -03-01 cream, 1%) twice 
daily (BID) for an additional nine months of treatment (for a total of up to 
12 months; 0 or 3 months in the Phase 3 pivotal study [CB -03-01/25 and CB -
03-01/26] and an additional 9 months in this open -label long -term extension 
study). Treatment on face and/or trunk may be discontinued if/when acne clears (achieves an  IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) and re- instated 
if/when acne worsens (IGA ≥2) according to the assessment of the 
investigator for each respective treatment area.  
Duration of Study  Each subject’s participation will be for nine (9) months.  
Study Popu lation  Male and female subjects 9 years or older who were enrolled and completed 
participation in one of the Phase 3 pivotal studies [CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-
01/26].  
Total Number of 
Subjects  Approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled in this trial to achie ve at least 
300 subjects on -study at 6 months and 100 subjects on -study at 12 months.  
These treatment durations include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in the Phase 3 pivotal studies (CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26).  
 
Enrollment will be competitive; up on enrollment of about 600 subjects in 
this study, the option for rollover will not be offered to other subjects in the 
Phase 3 pivotal studies (CB -03-01/15 and CB -03-01/26), even if those 
subjects are eligible.  
Number of Sites  Approximately 78 sites that  are participating in either Phase 3 pivotal study 
[CB-03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26] will also participate in this study.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  5. Subject, and parent/guardian if required, is unable to communicate or 
cooperate with the investigator due to language problems, poor mental 
development, or impaired cerebral function.  
6. Subject  may be unreliable for the study including subjects who engage 
in excessive alcohol intake or drug abuse, or subject who is unable to 
return for scheduled follow -up visits.  
7. Subject has known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any 
of the active or inactive components of the test article.  
8. Subject is or plans to use any topical anti-acne preparations (excluding 
CB-03-01 cream ) or procedures on the face (or trunk, if applicable)  or 
any systemic  anti-acne medications (as detailed in Section 8.1: 
Prohibited Medications and Therapies) during the study.  
Study Procedures  The study will consist of a Baseline Visit, follow -up visits at LTF -Months 1, 
3, 6, and 9,  and follow -up phone calls at LTF -Months 4.5 and 7.5. For 
subjects in the Phase 3 pivotal studies randomized to active (CB -03-01 
cream, 1% twice daily), the total treatment period will be 12 (3+9) months; 
whereas for those subjects in the Phase 3 pivotal s tudies randomized to 
vehicle, the total treatment period will be 9 (0+9) months.  
 
For this Long- Term Follow -Up (LTF) study, subjects must rollover from the 
Phase 3 pivotal study (CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26) into this study AT or 
WITHIN THREE (3) DAYS of Visit 4- Pivotal.  
 
During the LTF study, subjects will treat facial acne per protocol for nine months. Treatment of truncal acne is optional and will be discussed by the 
investigator and subject (see Section 10.3). If truncal acne is to be treated, 
the subject must continue to treat the designated treatment area for the 
remainder of the study as detailed in Section 6.2
. Treatment on face and/or 
trunk for a subject may be discontinued if/when acne is under successful control (achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) and re- instated

investigator for each respective treatment area. Subjects must be seen by the 
investigator via a scheduled or unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart or 
stop) test article dosing.  Acne will be managed per p rotocol as detailed in 
Section 6.2 and Section 8.2. 
 
Visit 4 -LTF (Baseli ne): At Visit 4 -LTF, study staff will explain the study 
procedures and an informed consent/assent must be signed prior to the 
initiation of any study -related procedures. At this visit, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Demographics and medical/dermatological history data will be used from the Phase 3 pivotal study. A brief physical examination including vital signs and a UPT (if 
applicable) will be performed. Note: If Visit 4- Pivotal and Visit 4- LTF occur 
on the  
same day, the results of the UPT performed during the End of Study 
(EOS) visit of the Phase 3 pivotal study can be used as Baseline data. IGA 
for the face and local skin reactions (LSRs) [pre- application for the face] 
performed during the EOS Visit of the  Phase 3 pivotal study (Visit 4 -Pivotal) 
will be used as Baseline data. Treatment of truncal acne will be discussed by 
the investigator and subject. If the subject desires, the truncal treatment area 
will be defined and agreed upon by the investigator and the subject, with the 
percent body surface area (BSA) to be treated recorded. If the investigator

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  and subject designate a treatment area for truncal acne, the subject must 
continue to treat this area for the duration of the study with dosing 
adjustments pe r protocol as detailed in Section 6.2. If the investigator and 
subject do not designate a treatment area for truncal acne at this visit, one may be  designated at subsequent visits (e.g., if acne worsens in the truncal 
area); however, once treatment begins in such truncal treatment area, the subject must continue to treat this area for the remainder of the study as 
detailed in Section 6.2. If applicable, IGA and LSRs [pre- application] for the 
trunk will also be assessed at this visit. Ongoing concomitant medications 
and procedures will be reviewed. The subject (and parent/guardian, if 
applicable) will be instructed on how to apply the investigational test article (ITA). ITA and subject diary will be dispensed. The first dose will be applied 
during this visit under supervision of the investigator, except for thos e 
subjects with clear facial acne and no truncal acne. LSRs post -application 
(for both face and trunk separately, as applicable) and adverse events (AEs) 
will be assessed. The subject will be scheduled for the first follow -up visit.  
NOTE: If a subject’s a cne is totally clear (i.e., IGA=0) on face and/or trunk, 
the subject will not receive or apply the ITA at home for the first month of 
the study and be reassessed at Visit 5 or earlier (after an unscheduled visit), 
if acne worsens (be it on the face and/or the trunk) before Visit 5.  
 
Visits 5 (LTF Month 1), 6 (LTF Month 3), and 8 (LTF Month 6) : Subjects 
will return to the clinic. IGA, LSRs, and AEs will also be assessed. 
Concomitant medications and procedures and ITA compliance will be 
reviewed. A UPT (if ap plicable) will be performed at Visit 8. Assessment of 
the subject’s acne will be made on face and trunk to determine if the subject requires on -going therapy or if treatment needs to be started (i.e., for subjects 
with an IGA=0 at Baseline [Visit 4- LTF]) o r restarted (after a previous 
discontinuation due to acne clearing). Based on this determination, ITA and 
a subject diary will be dispensed/returned (as required). For subjects starting 
treatment at this visit, the first dose of the ITA will be applied und er 
supervision of the investigator. The subject will be scheduled for a follow -
up visit (at Visit 5 and Visit 6) or end of study (EOS) visit (at Visit 8).  
 
Visit 7: Phone Call 1 (LTF Month 4.5) and Visit 9: Phone Call 2 (LTF Month 
7.5):  The site staff will contact the subject by telephone to review any 
changes in concomitant medications and procedures as well as test article compliance. Site staff will query the subject about any AEs and will confirm the next appointment. In the event there is:  
 
a) improvin g or worsening of the subject’s acne such that the treatment may 
be discontinued or restarted, respectively, OR  
 
b) a concern regarding an AE or the subject’s progress based upon the Phone Call visit,  
 
the subject may be seen in the clinic as an unscheduled visit at the discretion 
of the investigator. However, to change (i.e., restart or stop) test article 
dosing on either treatment area (face and/or trunk), the subject must be seen 
and evaluated in person by the investigator or designee.  
 
Visit 10 (Month 9): End of Study (EOS) Visit & Early Termination.  Subjects 
will return to the clinic for the final visit. UPT (if applicable) will be 
performed. IGA, LSRs, and AEs will be assessed. Concomitant medications

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  and procedures will be reviewed. ITA and subject diary will be returned. The 
subject will exit the study.  
 
Unscheduled Visit: [If/As Needed]. Note: Subjects must be seen by the 
investigator via a scheduled or an unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart 
or stop) test article dosing on either treatment area (face and/or trunk).  
Subjects may return to the clinic at the discretion of the investigator. LSRs, 
AEs, and any changes in concomitant medications and procedures will be 
assessed, as needed. In addition , IGA, to document acne 
improvement/clearance (i.e., achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) or significant worsening (IGA ≥2), shall also be assessed to support treatment modifications. ITA will be dispensed/returned (as required). The 
next regul ar follow -
up visit will be confirmed prior to the end of the 
unscheduled visit.  
Study Measurements  Safety  will be assessed by the investigator via the evaluation of local and 
systemic AEs at each visit/phone call.  
 
LSRs including telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, and scaling/dryness will be assessed by the investigator for each treatment 
area (face and trunk) using a five-
point ordinal scale from 0=none to 
4=severe at each visit (Visit 4 -LTF [post -application, if applicable], and 
Visits 5, 6, 8, and 10, and any Unscheduled Visits, as needed). Subjects will 
be asked to rate the severity of stinging/burning and pruritus for each 
treatment area (face and trunk) using a four -point scale from 0= none to 
3=severe at each visit (Visit 4 -LTF [post -application, if applicable], and 
Visits 5, 6, 8, and 10, and any Unscheduled Visits, as needed).  
 Efficacy will be assessed by the investigator using an IGA. IGA performed 
on the face during the End of Stud y (EOS) Visit of the Phase 3 pivotal study 
(i.e., Visit 4 -Pivotal) and IGA performed on the trunk at Visit 4- LTF will be 
used as Baseline data. If treatment of the trunk begins post -Visit4 -LTF, the 
Baseline data will be assessed at the visit where treatmen t is first applied.  
 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) : Overall severity of acne using a 
five-point scale from 0=clear to 4=severe will be conducted at Visits 5, 6, 8, 
and 10 for each treatment area (face and trunk) and any Unscheduled Visits, as needed. This is a static morphological scale that refers to a point in time 
and not a comparison to Baseline.  
Study Endpoints  Safety Endpoints:  
• Incidence of any local and systemic treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAEs). 
• Number of subjects with presence (and sever ity) of each individual 
LSR (telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus) for each treatment area, as applicable, at each time point collected (Baseline, and LTF -
Months 1, 3, 6, and 9, and a ny Unscheduled Visits).  
• UPT results in all WOCBP at Baseline, LTF- Month 6, and EOS.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  • Number of subjects with each IGA severity score for each treatment 
area, as applicable, at each time point collected (Baseline and LTF -
Months 1, 3, 6, and 9).  
Sample Size 
Calculations  For large samples, the two -sided confidence interval for a single proportion 
extends a distance ω =𝑧𝑧1−𝛼𝛼
2�𝜋𝜋(1−𝜋𝜋 )
𝑛𝑛 from the observed proportion in both 
directions. An incidence no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 100 
subjects will provide the estimate of no greater than a 3% prevalence of 
important AEs at the 95% confidence level with a much larger number of subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 12 months). Applying the same 
approach, an incidence no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 300 
subjects will provide the estimate of no greater than a 2.1% prevalence of important AEs at the 95% confidence l evel with a much larger number of 
subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 6 months).  
 
Approximately six hundred (600) subjects will be enrolled in order to have 
300 subjects on -study at 6 months and 100 subjects on -study at 12 months.  
These treatmen t durations include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in 
the Phase 3 pivotal studies (CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26).  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise 
stated. Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will 
be provided for baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables will be described by descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and maximum). Frequency 
counts and percentage of subjects within each category are provided for 
categorical data.  
 
Study Sets:  
Subjects who complete 6 months or 12 months on- study without material 
non-compliance with test article (CB -03-01 cream, 1%) dosing per protocol 
will count towards the desired 300 subjects at 6 months and 100 subjects at 
12 months. The Safety set will include all subjects who received at least one 
application of the test article. The intent -to-treat (ITT) set will include all 
enrolled subjects. The per -protoc ol (PP) set will be a subset of the ITT set 
and will include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol deviations. The analysis of safety will be conducted on the Safety set. The analysis of efficacy will be conducted on both the IT T and PP sets.  
 
Safety Analyses:  
Extent of Exposure  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for 
the Safety, ITT, and PP sets. The total amount of test article used (grams applied) will be calculated for each subject from t he weights of the returned 
test articles. The mean daily amount of test article applied (total amount of test article used/number of days of treatment) will be calculated for each subject. The number of applications and days dosed for each treatment area 
(face and/or trunk from Subject Diary) will also be summarized.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  1. BACKGROUND  
CB-03-01 (cortexolone 17α- propionate) is a steroidal antiandrogen that is being developed 
as a 1% cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, an androgen -depende nt skin 
disorder. CB -03-01 binds to the human androgen receptor displacing the androgenic 
hormones and acts as an androgen antagonist. In human plasma, CB -03-01 is rapidly 
metabolized to parent cortexolone so that its systemic bioavailability after topical 
application is anticipated to be low. Cortexolone, the main by -product, is a physiological 
component of the pool of endogenous corticosteroids, and is an intermediate in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, but it only exhibits weak glucocorticoid properties [ 1]. 
 CB-03-01 could offer advantages over existing products for acne vulgaris due to its 
potential efficacy and lack of systemic antiandrogen activity. Because its pharmacological action appears to be limited to the local site of application, use of CB-03-01 may be able 
to mitigate the side effects related to systemic exposure to hormonal agents currently used in the treatment of acne.  
2. RATIONALE  
To date, CB -03-01 cream has been used for treatment of acne vulgaris for up to 12 weeks 
with no material sa fety issues to note. Given that acne vulgaris is a chronic condition which 
typically waxes and wanes over time and often requires extended (and sometimes intermittent) treatment, this study is designed to investigate the long -term safety of CB -03-
01 cream,  1%. 
3. OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the long -term safety of CB -03-01 cream, 
1% applied twice daily for an additional nine months in subjects with acne vulgaris that participated in the Phase 3 pivotal studies for a total trea tment of up to 12 months. 
4. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, open label, long- term extension study for CB -03-01 cream, 1% 
focused on safety in male and female subjects, 9 years or older who completed one of the Phase 3 pivotal studies [CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26]. Subjects will apply the active 
medication (CB -03-01 cream, 1%) twice daily to the entire face and, if designated by 
investigator AND desired by subject, truncal acne for nine additional months of treatment. Thus, overall subjects will be exposed to CB -03-01 cream, 1% for a total treatment of up 
to 12 months (0 or 3 months in the Phase 3 pivotal study and an additional nine months in this long- term safety study).

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  For this Long- Term Follow -Up (LTF) study, subjects must rollover from the Phase 3 
pivotal study (CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26) into this study AT or WITHIN THREE (3) 
DAYS of Visit 4 -Pivotal.  
 Subjects will treat facial acne per protocol for nine months. Treatment of truncal acne will be discussed by the investigator and subject. If the subject desires, the truncal treatment area will be defined and agreed upon by the investigator and the subject. If the investigator and subject designate a treatment area for truncal acne, the subject must continue to treat this area for the duration of the study per protocol as detailed in Section 6.2. If the 
investigator and subject do not designate a treatment area for truncal acne at Baseline [Visit  4-LTF], one may be designated at subsequent visits (e.g., if acne worsens in the 
truncal area), but once treatment begins in such treatment area, the subject must continue to treat this area per protocol for the remainder of the study.  
 Treatment on the face and/or trunk may be discontinued if/when acne clears (achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) and re -instated if/when acne worsens (IGA ≥2), 
according to the assessment of the investigator for each respective treatment area (i.e., face and trunk). Note: Subjects must be seen by the investigator via a routinely scheduled study visit or an unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart or stop) test article dosing on either treatment area (i.e., face and trunk).  
 Subjects (approximately 600) will be rolled over from the Phase 3 pivotal studies [CB -03-
01/25 and CB -03-01/26] into this long -term, safety study in order to achieve at least 300 
subjects on- study at 6 months and 100 subjects on- study at 12 months. These treatment 
durations include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in the Phase 3 pivotal studies (CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26). 
5. STUDY POPULATION 
5.1 Subject Eligibility  
To be included in the study, subjects must meet the following inclusion and none of the

6. TEST ARTICLES AND RE GIMEN  
6.1 Description  
Test artic le name:  CB-03-01 Cream, 1% 
Active ingredient: Cortexolone 17α -propionate (11- deoxy -hydrocortisone-17α -
propionate). 
Other ingredients: Cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, liquid paraffin, propylene glycol, tocopherol, sodium edetate, polysorbate 80, citr ic acid, 
purified water.  
6.2 Instructions for Use and Application  
Subjects will treat facial acne per protocol for nine months. Treatment of truncal acne will be discussed by the investigator and subject. If the subject desires, the truncal treatment area will  be defined and agreed upon by the investigator and the subject. If the investigator 
and subject designate a treatment area for truncal acne, the subject must continue to treat this area per protocol for the duration of the study as detailed below. If the investigator and subject do not designate a treatment area for truncal acne at Baseline (Visit  4-LTF), one 
may be designated at subsequent visits (e.g., if acne worsens in the truncal area), but once treatment begins in such treatment area, the subject must continue to treat this area per protocol for the remainder of the study.  At the first visit, the subjects will be instructed to wash the area to be treated (entire face and trunk, if applicable) with mild soap and water and then dry the area gently. The  study 
staff will then instruct the subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) on how to dispense the test article, how much of the test article to use, and where to apply the assigned test article. The first application of the test article should be appl ied in the office at Visit 4 -LTF 
under supervision of the study staff after the treatment areas have been determined, except for those subjects with clear facial acne and no truncal acne. For subjects starting treatment at subsequent visits, the first dose  of the test article will be applied at that visit under 
supervision of the study staff. Typically, for the face, about one (1) gram of the test article will be dispensed onto a fingertip and applied by gently dabbing small amounts of the test article on m ultiple regions of the face (e.g., forehead, nose, cheeks, chin). Using a fingertip, 
the test article will be spread to provide a thin, uniform layer of the test article over the 
entire face. In addition, if applicable, subjects who choose (with investigator’s approval) to treat truncal acne should apply a thin uniform application of the test article to the

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  designated area(s) of the trunk (e.g., the shoulders, chest, and/or back).  Note: one (1) gram 
of cream will cover approximately a 8.5” x 11” (~22 cm x 28 cm) area. 
 Subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) will also be provided with a Subject Instruction Sheet ( Appendix 1) providing them with instructions on how to use and store the cream at 
home during the study period. Subjects and parents/guardians (if applicable) will be instructed to apply the test article to the whole face and trunk, if applicable, twice daily (morning and in the evening) for nine additional months. The subject should ideally allow at least eight hours between applications. All subjects should not wash the treated area for at least four hours following test article application and should not apply the test article within four hours prior to any study visit.  If a subject’s acne is totally clear (i.e., IGA=0) on face and/or trunk at Visit 4 -LTF, the 
subject will not apply the test article to the area(s) that is clear at home for the first month of the study and be reassessed a t Visit 5 or earlier (after an unscheduled visit), if acne 
worsens (in either area) before Visit 5. If acne is totally clear on the face and the trunk has not been designated for treatment, the subject will not be dispensed the test article at Visit 4-LTF.  For subjects whose acne is not totally clear (i.e., IGA>0) at Visit 4 -LTF, the subject 
should apply the test article at home twice daily (morning and evening) as instructed by the study staff.  
 Over the course of the study, treatment on the face and/or trunk may be discontinued if/when acne clears (achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) and re- instated 
if/when acne worsens (IGA≥2), according to the assessment of the investigator for eac h 
respective treatment area. If treatment is discontinued on face and trunk, all containers of the test article should be collected. If treatment is re -instated, sufficient test article will be 
dispensed to the subject; previously returned test article should NOT be re -dispensed, 
rather new containers of the test article will be dispensed as needed to the subject. Note: Subjects must be seen by the investigator via a scheduled or an unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart or stop) the test article dosing  on either treatment area (face and trunk). If the 
subject feels that his/her acne has cleared, he/she should continue to apply the test article to the designated treatment area (face and/or trunk) as instructed by the investigator and call the investigator for an unscheduled visit. The subject should NOT change his/her dosing regimen until the investigator has documented acne clearance or significant worsening to support a change in the treatment.  
 Subjects will be provided with a Subject Diary ( Appendix 2) to record the dates and time 
of application, along with where the test article was applied. Subjects will be instructed to only apply the test article to the face and/or trunk as instructed by the investigator or 
designated study personnel. Note: The dispensing, recording, and application of the test 
article by the subject may require adult supervision by the subject’s parent/guardian.  
 
Subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) will be instructed to bring all the containers of 
cream (used and unused) and their completed diaries to each visit. The study staff will

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  weigh all the returned containers and will record the weights on the appropriate study 
medication accountability logs and case report forms (CRFs). Test articles that are returned should NOT be re-dispensed to the subject.  
Subjects who are not compliant with applying the test article as instructed (determined from subject diaries and/or the weight of test  article used) may be discontinued from the 
study.  
6.3 Warnings, Precautions and Contraindications 
The test article is for topical use only. Care should be taken to avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.  
 Subjects with a known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test article should not participate in this study.  
 Should skin irritation or rash develop, subjects should discontinue use and contact the study site. 
 In case of accidental ingestion, subjects should contact the investigator immediately.  
 The effects of the test article in nursing mothers, pregnant women and their unborn children are unknown. WOCBP must not be pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the study period. 
7. RANDOMIZATION ASSIGNMENT  
There is no randomization assignment in this study. This is an open label, extension study 
in which all eligible subjects will be treated with CB -03-01 cream, 1% (i.e., the test article). 
About 600 subjects will be enrolled in this extension study to achieve at least 300 subjects on-study at 6 months and 100 subjects on- study at 12 months. These treatment durations 
include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in the Phase 3 pivotal studies (CB -03-01/25 
and CB -03-01/26). Enrollment will be competitive; upon enrollment of about 600 subjects 
in this study, the option for rollover will not be offered to other subjects in the Phase 3 pivotal studies (CB -03-01/15 and CB -03-01/26), even if those subjects are eligible. 
Enrolled subjects will be provided with labeled test article during the study period, as needed. Subject numbers will be carried over from the Phase 3 pivotal study [CB -03-01/25 
or CB -03-01/26].  
8. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPIES  
Current medications taken at the start of this study (Visit 4 -LTF) will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRFs with the corresponding indication. The medications to be recorded include RX and OTC medications (except vitamins and dietary supplements not used to treat a medical condition). All medications taken on a regular basis should be recorded on

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  the Concomitant Medications form prior to commencing the use of the test article. Any 
medications that were used prior to the start of this study would have been recorded as part of the Phase 3 pivotal study [CB -03-01/25 or CB -03-01/26]. 
 Therapies (medication and non -medication therapies) not restricted by the protocol may be 
used during the study for the treatment or prevention of disease or to maintain good health. Vitamins and mineral supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the investigator as 
reasonable for maintaining good health. Non- prohibited chronic therapies being used at 
Visit  4-LTF may be continued. Any changes in concomitant therapies during the study must 
be recorded on the Concomitant Therapy  form. The reason for any change in concomitant 
therapies should be evaluated and, if appropriate, reported as, or in conjunction with, an AE . 
8.1 Prohibited Medications or Therapies  
During the study , subjects must not use the following products and/or procedures on the 
face or trunk:  
• Any other investigational drug or use of any investigational device; 
• Light treatments (including artificial tanning devices, blue light, laser, etc.), microdermabrasion, or chemical peels;  
• Systemic spironolactone; 
• Systemic r etinoid therapy; 
• All topical acne therapies not allowed per Section 8.2 (e.g. retinoids, azelaic acid, 
dapsone, etc.). 
 Other chronic medications b eing used at the time of Visit 4 -LTF can be continued at the 
discretion of the investigator. The reason for any changes in such concomitant medications and/or therapies should be reported as, or in conjunction with, an AE. 
8.2 Allowed Medications or Therapies  
All allowed concurrent acne medications and/or therapies must be given IN 
ADDITION to the test article and NOT IN PLACE of the test article. 
 
During the study , if control of acne is insufficient, the following supplemental products 
and/or procedures may be used at the discretion of the investigator on the face or trunk: 
• Hormonal contraceptives11; 
• Occasional use of systemic antibiotics for acne (not to exceed 12 continuous weeks) 
or for other medical needs; 
• Systemic corticosteroids (for other medical needs); 
• Occasional use of intralesional corticosteroid injections for nodular or cystic acne 
lesions (low dose, e.g., ~2 mg triamcinolone / cc) or for other medical needs; 
                                                 
11 If hormonal contraception is initiated as concurrent acne therapy, the method of highly effective birth 
control used at Visit 4 -LTF must be continued for at least two complete cycles (i.e., eight to twelve weeks).

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  • Occasional use of TOPICAL steroids or TOPICAL antibiotics for up to 10 
continuous days (for other medical needs) within the treatment area (face and/or 
trunk); 
• TOPICAL anti-acne cleansers  (not leave -on products) that have benzoyl peroxide 
(≤5%) OR salicylic acid (≤2%) as their only active ingredient within the treatment area (face and/or trunk).  
 
Acne Management:  The intent of the study is to limit the use of other acne medications 
to facilitate the safety assessment of long -term use of the investigational test article over a 
one year period of time.  In the event that the study drug does not suff iciently control the 
subject’s acne, the Investigator, at their election, may prescribe select additional 
medication(s)12 that can be taken in addition to the investigational test article. Ideally these 
measures should be used only for brief period(s) of ti me, if medically necessary, to 
reasonably control the subject’s acne, during the study.  These medications are limited to 
certain products (e.g., topical anti -acne cleansers, oral antibiotics, or intralesional steroid 
injections for cyst/nodular lesions) a s detailed in the list of allowed medications or 
therapies above.  
9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study will consist of a Baseline Visit, follow -up visits at Months 1, 3, 6, and 9, and 
follow- up phone calls at Months 4.5 and 7.5. For subjects in the Phase 3 pivotal s tudies 
randomized to active (CB -03-01 cream, 1% twice daily), the total treatment period will be 
12 (3+9) months; whereas for those subjects in the Phase 3 pivotal studies randomized to vehicle, the total treatment period will be 9 (0+9) months.  
During the LTF study, treatment on face and/or trunk for a subject may be discontinued 
if/when acne is under successful control (achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 
1) and re -instated if/when acne worsens (IGA≥2), according to the assessment of the 
investigator for each respective treatment area. Subjects MUST be seen by the investigator 
via a scheduled or unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart or stop) test article dosing). 
 Specific activities for each study visit are listed below.  
9.1 Visit 4 -LTF Baseline (LTF -Day 1) [Visit 4 -Pivotal + 3 days] 
Informed consent/assent can be obtained up to 45 days before Visit  4-LTF. Note: 
Consent/assent for this extension study should not be signed at Baseline of the Phase 3 pivotal study (i.e., Visit 1). For th is LTF study, subjects must rollover from the Phase 3 
pivotal study (CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26) into this study AT or WITHIN THREE (3) DAYS of Visit 4 -Pivotal.  
                                                 
12 For US sites: OTC acne cleanser containing 2% salicylic acid or 5% benzoyl peroxide and doxycycline 
will be provided by the investigator. The subject will be responsible for other additional acne medications 
that may be prescribed by the investigator.

• Perform a UPT for all WOCBP (see Section 5.1 for definition). The results must be 
negative for the subject to be enrolled. Note: If Visit 4 -Pivotal and Visit  4-LTF 
occur on the same day, the results of the UPT performed during the End of Study 
(EOS) visit of the Phase 3 pivotal study can be used. 
• Confirm that an IGA was performed and LSRs were assessed for the face  at Visit 
4-Pivotal.  
• Discuss with the subject if tr uncal acne will be treated. If applicable, identify the 
truncal treatment area and record the percent BSA of the truncal treatment area (see Section 10.3). Note: If the investigator and the subject designate a treatment area 
for truncal acne, the subject must continue to treat this area per protocol for the duration of the study as detailed in Section 6.2. 
• Prior to the first application of the test article, for the trunk (if applicable). 
o Perform IGA (see Section 10.1); and  
o Perfo rm LSR assessment (see Section 10.2).  
• Determine if the subject requires ongoing therapy based on IGA scores of the face 
and trunk. Note: If a subject’s acne is totally clear (IGA=0) on face and/or trunk, 
the subject will not receive or apply the ITA for the first month of the study and will 
be reassessed at Visit 5 or earlier (after an unscheduled visit), if acne worsens (be it on the face and/or the trunk) before V isit 5.  
• Dispense the Subject Instruction Sheet to the subject and parent/guardian (if 
applicable) ( Appendix 1), as required.

10. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS  
The following clinical evaluations will be performed according to the schedules indicated during the study. The same investigator should complete the evaluations for a given subject throughout the study. If this becomes impossible a sub -investigator with overlapping 
experience with the subject and the study should complete the evaluations. 
10.1 Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA)  
Overall severity of acne using a five- point scale from 0=clear to 4=severe will be evalu ated 
for the face and trunk, separately. This is a static morphological scale that refers to a point 
in time and not a comparison to Baseline. IGA performed on the face during the End of Study (EOS) Visit of the Phase 3 pivotal study (i.e., Visit 4 -Pivotal ) and IGA performed 
on the trunk at Visit 4- LTF will be used as Baseline data.  
 
0 Clear  Absence of active disease with no inflammatory or non -
inflammatory lesions.  
1 Almost Clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions with no more than one small 
inflammatory lesion. 
2 Mild  Some non -inflammatory lesions with no more than a few 
inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodular/cystic 
lesions). 
3 Moderate  Up to  many non -inflammatory lesions and may have some 
inflammatory lesions but no more than one nodular/cystic lesion. 
4 Severe  Up to many non -inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions 
but no more than a few nodular/cystic lesions.  
 
IGA, to document acne improvement (i.e., achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 
1) or worsening (IGA≥2), should also be assessed to support treatment recommendations at regularly scheduled visits and any unscheduled visits, as needed.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  10.2 Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
At every  in-clinic study visit and unscheduled visits, the investigator or designee will 
document the severity of the following LSRs known to be associated with application of 
topical steroids in the treatment areas (face and trunk, separately):  
• Telangiectasia  
• Skin atrophy 
• Striae rubrae  
 A five -point ordinal scale will be used to assess the severity of these reactions (0=none, 
1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe).  In addition, the investigator or designee will evaluate the severity of the following LSRs known to be associated with acne vulgaris in the treatment areas (face and trunk, separately), using the five-point ordinal scales described below: 
• Erythema  
• Edema  
• Scaling/dryness  
 Erythema:  
0 None  
1 Minimal – barely perceptible erythema  
2 Mild – predominantly minimal erythema (pink) in the treated area with or without 
a few isolated areas of more intense erythema  
3 Moderate – predominantly moderate erythema (red) in the treated area with or 
without a few isolated areas of intense erythema (bright  red) 
4 Severe – predominantly intense erythema (bright red) in the treated area with or 
without a few isolated areas of very intense (fiery red) erythema  
 Edema:  
0 None  
1 Minimal – scant, rare edema  
2 Mild – easily seen edema, minimally palpable, involving up to 1/3 of the 
Treatment Area  
3 Moderate – easily seen edema and typically palpable, involving between 1/3 to 
2/3 of the Treatment Area  
4 Severe – easily seen edema, indurated in some areas, involving over 2/3 of the 
Treatment Area

Scaling/ dryness: 
0 None  
1 Minimal – barely perceptible desquamation  
2 Mild - limited areas of fine desquamation in up to 1/3 of the treatment area  
3 Moderate – fine desquamation involving 1/3 to 2/3 of the treatment area or limited 
areas of coarser scaling  
4 Severe – coarser scaling involving more than 2/3 of the treatment area or limited 
areas of very coarse scaling  
 In addition, subjects will be asked to rate the severity of the following LSRs that occurred in the treatment areas (face and trunk, separately ) since the last visit, using the four -point 
ordinal scales described below:  
• Stinging/burning 
• Pruritus  
 Stinging/burning: 
0 None  
1 Minimal, barely perceptible – tolerable and little discomfort  
2 Moderate – tolerable, but causes some discomfort  
3 Severe – very uncomfortable or intolerable  
 Pruritus (itching):  
0 None - no evidence of itching  
1 Mild - only aware of itching at times, only present when relaxing, not present when 
focused on other activities  
2 Moderate - often aware of itching, annoying, som etimes disturbs sleep and daytime 
activities  
3 Severe -constant itching, distressing; frequent sleep disturbance, interferes with 
activities  
 These LSRs will be collected independently of AEs. Only LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication) or require withholding the application of the test articles will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as AEs.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  10.3 Truncal Body Surface Area (BSA)  
Treatment of truncal acne will be discussed by the i nvestigator and subject. If the subject 
desires, the truncal treatment area will be defined and agreed upon by the investigator and 
the subject with the percent BSA to be treated recorded. Percent BSA to be treated will be estimated using the assumption th at 1% BSA is equivalent to the area of the subject’s hand 
with fingers held together. Once this truncal treatment area has been defined, the subject must continue to treat this area for the remainder of the study until the area is clear (an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) as determined by the investigator and then re -initiate 
treatment (as/if required) per protocol for worsening (see Section 6.2). 
11. PHOTOGRAPHY  
Photography documentation is not required in this study. However, the investigator may 
elect to photograph the subject to document the effects of treatment, AEs or other findings during the trial. All photographs taken as part of this study are for informational purposes only and are not to assist in grading or for any other assessment.   Note: Subjects may decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of the study. If a subject initially consents to photographs, then declines further photography, the  Sponsor 
may use the photographs taken under consent for the purposes noted above. 
12. LABORATORY TESTS  
12.1 Urine Pregnancy Tests (UPTs)  
The UPT will be performed at the study site if the site meets local country requirements to 
perform the testing (e.g., United S tates sites registered and conforms to Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments  (CLIA) regulations for such testing [site possesses at a 
minimum a current valid CLIA Certificate of Waiver]) or at an appropriately registered reference laboratory. A UPT wi ll be performed at Visit 4 -LTF (or Visit 4 -Pivotal, if the 
visits occur on the same day) (i.e., Baseline), Visit  8 (LTF -Month 6), and Visit  10 (EOS) 
on all WOCBP (see Section 5.1 for definition). The investigator will report the UPT results 
on the CRFs, in the subject’s medical records and, if applicable, in independent records maintained at the study site. The UPT used must have a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU of 
β-HCG/mL of urine.  
13. END OF STUDY CRITERI A 
At the end of each subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will complete an 
End of Study form for all completed and discontinued subjects.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  13.1 Completion of the Study  
Each subject who completes the nine month treatment period and the required study visits 
(Visits 4 -LTF and Visits 5 -10) will have completed the study. 
13.2 Subject Discontinuation 
A subject may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following reasons:  
• Whenever the subject or the subject’s parent/guardian decides it is in the subject’s 
best interest to be withdrawn, Note: if the subject or parent/guardian decides to withdraw from the study due to an AE then it should be classified as withdrawal due to an AE. 
• Whenever the inv estigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to be withdrawn  
• AEs 
• Worsening of condition or treatment failure (in the opinion of the investigator) 
• Noncompliance 
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up  
• Sponsor administrative reasons 
 If a subject withdraws prematurely during the nine month treatment period for any reason, the Visit 10 (EOS) procedures should be completed at that time. When a subject is withdrawn from the study for a treatment-related AE (i.e., possibly, probably or definitely related as defined in Section 14), when possible, the subject should be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the AE.  
13.3 Study Termination 
The study may be terminated by the investigator or the Sponsor. If, in the opinion of the investigator, clinical observations made during the study suggest that it may be unwise to continue, he or she may stop the study. A study termination by the investigator will be reported to the Sponsor. 
 In addition, a written statement fully documenting the reasons for this action will be submitted to the Sponsor by the investigator within five (5) working days.  In the event that the Sponsor chooses to discontinue or terminate the study, appropriate notification will be given to the investigator.  
14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 53 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  An AE (also referred t o as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s written consent/assent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken at screening. Other changes in subject health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the test article and therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first d ose of test article. These data are considered treatment -emergent AEs.  
 Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the contract research organization (CRO) in identifying any untoward medical occurrence, thereby allowing:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3) recognition of dose- related test article toxicity;  
4) appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.  
 Test article is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or vehicle/placebo being tested or used as a reference in the study, whether blinded or unblinded. AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a subject. All AEs must be completely recorded on the AE CRF. If known, the investigator should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual sympt oms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of test 
article, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study should receive follow -up as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of  any AE 
that caused permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study particularly if the AE is considered by the investigator to be treatment- related (i.e., 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to test article). 
14.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible), and reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) if they become serious.  LSRs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1% -1% 
concentration) include (with decreasing frequency) erythema, pruritus, scaling/dryness, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, stinging/burning, edema, and telangiectasia; however most LSRs were typically of minimal to mild severity. No subjects discontinued tre atment due 
to these LSRs.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06   
AEs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1 -1% 
concentration) were minimal, typically mild in severity, and most were recovered/resolved without sequelae at the end of the study. Only two AEs in one (1) subject were judged as 
probably or possibly related to treatment; both of these treatment -related AEs (burning and 
cold at application site) were mild in severity. Two SAEs have been reported to date; both were not related to treatment and were resolved at the end of the study. In addition, one subject discontinued early from the study due to an AE (urinary tract infection), which was not related to treatment.  
 The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study.  
At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non- directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall condition since the previous visit.  The severity of each AE, as judged by the investigator, will be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF and will be graded according to the following scale: 
 
Mild - The AE is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.  
 
Moderate - The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.  
 
Severe - The AE causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual 
activities, and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
 The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to the following categories:  
Definite  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage, and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (re- challenge).  
 
Probable  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed by imp rovement on stopping or reducing 
the dosage of the test article; and that is unlikely to have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes. 
 
Possible  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; but may have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  Unlikely  - An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response 
pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
 
Not Related  - An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes.  
The investigator should categorize the outcome of the AE according to the following categories:  
  Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE. 
  Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not 
recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved - AE has improved or the subject has recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae - subject recuperated but retained the 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.  
  Recovering/Resolving -  AE is improving or the subject is recuperating.  
  Unknown - Not known, not observed, not recorded or subject refused. 
 The investigator should report the action taken with the test article due to the AE according 
to the following categories:  
Dose Not Changed  - An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
 Dose Increased  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
addition; either  by changing the frequency, strength or amount. 
 Dose Reduced  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
subtraction, either by changing the frequency, strength or amount.  Drug Interrupted  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
temporarily terminating a prescribed regimen of medication.  
 Drug Withdrawn  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified through 
termination of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
 Not Applicable  - Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 53 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  Unknown - Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 
 
The investigator should report any other action taken due to the AE.  An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. For the purposes of prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as pa rt of 
its pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event.   For the purposes of IND (and other national health authority)  safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.   An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the in vestigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are n ot specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
14.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE CRF and on the CRO SAE Report Form, and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements.  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opinion of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• Life-threatening event.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 53 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  • Is an important medical event - defined as a medical event(s) that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examp les of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
• Hospitalizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre -planned, of a pre -
existing condition that did not worsen, and 
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
 
AEs classified as “serious” by either the investigator or the Sponsor require expeditious handling and reporting to the CRO to comply with regulatory requirements. All serious 
AEs, whether related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by 
telephone to the Medical Monitor and, in the event that he/she is unavailable, to the 
Project Manager listed on the first page of the protocol.  Written notification of all SAEs 
should be sent to the Project Manager by email or confirmed facsimile transmission. These 
include those SAEs listed in the protocol or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.   
 Study endpoints that are SAEs (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported in accordance 
with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In this case, the investi gator must immediately 
report the event to the Sponsor. In addition, such information should also be provided to the site’s respective IRB per their governing guidelines for SAE reporting.   If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Should the 
investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to test article) that occurs within 30 days after stopping the test article, the SAE must be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the CRO, if available.  As required, the CRO will notify participating investigators of all suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an IND (and other national health authority) safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the criteria listed in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are: 
 
i) Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 53 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  ii) Findings from other studies including epidemiological studies, pooled 
analyses, or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the test articles,  
iii) Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the test articles or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure, and 
iv) Clinically important inc reases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected 
adverse reactions.  
 Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed 
consent/assent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by the investigator to Health Authorities should be handled according to local regulations.  
14.3 Pregnancy  
WOCBP (see Section 5.1 for definition) must have a negative UPT prior to study 
enrollment and must use a highly effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failur e is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, 
WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject and parent/guardian must sign an informed consent/assent form documenting this discussion. 
 
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately 
if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
 WOCBP enrolling into the study must have a pregnancy test prior to study therapy, and at EOS. The study therapy must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are known, and a negative UPT must be confirmed to continue in the trial. If pregnancy is confirmed during screening, the subject must not receive test article and must not be enrolled in the study.  If a subject or investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not apply further test article and must be discontinued from the study.  If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial subject 
was pregnant or may ha ve been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator 
must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event, and record the pregnancy on 
the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to the CRO. The

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 53 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  investigator must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study therapy and 
keep careful source documentation of the event.  Protocol- required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must 
be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x -ray studies).  
Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by the investigator and her managing physician or health care provider (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to the CRO, on the appropriate CRO pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs (or SAEs, if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be reported as an SAE. Offspring should be followed for a minimum of eight weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test article(s) should be recorded as an SAE and details documented in the pregnancy surveillance form.  
15. BLINDING/UNBLINDING

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  17. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
17.1 Sample Size  
For large samples, the two -sided confidence interval for a single proportion extends a 
distance ω=𝑧𝑧1−𝛼𝛼
2�𝜋𝜋(1−𝜋𝜋 )
𝑛𝑛 from the observed proportion in both directions. An incidence 
no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 100 subjects will provide the estimate of no 
greater than a 3% prevalence of im portant AEs at the 95% confidence level with a much 
larger number of subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 12 months). Applying the same approach, an incidence no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 300 subjects will provide the estimate of no greater than a 2.1% prevalence of important AEs at the 95% 
confidence level with a much larger number of subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 6 months). 
 Approximately six hundred (600) subjects will be enrolled in order to have 300 subjects on-study at 6 months and 100 subjects on- study at 12 months. These treatment durations 
include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in the Phase 3 pivotal studies (CB -03-01/25 
and CB-03-01/26). 
17.2 Endpoints  
17.2.1  Safety Endpoints  
Safety endpoints will include: 
• Incidence of any local and systemic treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs).  
• Number of subjects with presence (and severity) of each individual LSR 
(telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, 
stinging/burning, and pruritus) for each trea tment area, as applicable, at each time 
point collected (Baseline, and LTF -Months 1, 3, 6, and 9, and any Unscheduled 
Visits).  
• UPT results in all WOCBP at Baseline, LTF -Month 6, and EOS. 
17.2.2  Efficacy Endpoints 
Efficacy Endpoints will include: 
• Number of subjects with each IGA severity score for each treatment area, as 
applicable, at each time point collected (Baseline and LTF -Months 1, 3, 6, and 9). 
17.3 Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Summar y 
tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables will be described by descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and

for categorical data.  
 Subjects who complete 6 months or 12 months on- study without material non -compliance 
with test article (CB -03-01 cream, 1%) dosing per protocol will count towards the desired 
300 subjects at 6 months and 100 subjects at 12 months. The Safety set will include all subjects who received at least one application of the test article. The intent -to-treat (ITT) 
set will include all enrolled subjects . The per -protocol (PP) set will be a subset of the ITT 
set and will include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol deviations. The analysis of safety will be conducted on the Safety set. The analysis of efficacy will be conducte d on both the ITT and PP sets. 
17.3.1  Safety Analyses 
Extent of Exposure 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for the Safety, ITT, and PP sets. The total amount of test article used (grams applied) will be calculated for each subject from the weights of the returned test articles. The mean daily amount of test 
article applied (total amount of test article used/number of days of treatment) will be calculated for each subject. The number of applications and days dosed for each tr eatment 
area (face and/or trunk from Subject Diary) will also be summarized.  
 
Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
LSRs (telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus) will be summarized by the frequency of each individual LSR and severity at each clinic visit for face and trunk, separately.  
 
Adverse Events (AEs)  
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary summarized by relationship to test article and severity.  
17.3.2  Efficacy Analyses 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) 
Frequency distributions of IGA scores will be summarized at Baseline (EOS -Pivotal), and 
LTF Months 1, 3, 6, and 9 for face and trunk, separately.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  APPENDIX 3  TEST ARTICLE INFORMATION  
A 3.1 Test Article Packaging and Labeling  
The test articles will be packaged and labeled by the Sponsor or designee. CB -03-01 cream, 
1% will be packaged in blind- end epoxy lined aluminum tubes, with a polypropylene cap 
closure, containing 30 grams or 60 grams of the test article. Each subject will be assigned 
a subject number (carried over from Phase 3 pivotal study [CB -03-01/25 or CB -03-01/26]) 
and provided with sufficient test article in standard packaging for the designated treatment 
period during the study.  
Tube Labels  
Each tube will contain, at a minimum, the following information: the study/protocol numbe r, subject identifiers (e.g., subject number [to be filled in]), the contents, the tube 
number (to be filled in) with test article batch number), an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g., Caution: New Drug Limited by United States law to investigational use), and the appropriate storage conditions for the test article. 
A 3.2 Test Article Storage and Preparation  
The test articles will be stored under secure conditions until they are dispensed to the 
subjects. Test articles should be stored in accordance wi th the tube labels.  
A 3.3 Dispensing Test Article 
The test article must be dispensed only to study subjects and only at study sites specified on the form FDA 1572 (or other documents required by the governing national health authority) by authorized personnel as required by applicable regulations and guidelines.  Sufficient test article will be provided to each subject as needed for the designated treatment period. For those subjects with clear facial acne and no truncal acne at Baseline (Visit 4 -LTF), the test a rticle will NOT be dispensed and the subject will be reassessed at 
Visit 5 or earlier (after an unscheduled visit), if acne worsens (be it on the face and/or the trunk) before Visit 5.  As test article is dispensed and collected at clinic visits, tubes will be weighed to the nearest tenth gram (0.1 gram) and information should be recorded on the Study Medication Accountability Log. If treatment is discontinued on the face and trunk, all containers of the test article should be collected. If treatment is re -instated, sufficient test article will be 
dispensed to the subject; previously returned test article should NOT be re -dispensed, 
rather new containers of the test article will be dispensed as needed to the subject. Every effort to obtain the return of all dispensed tubes of the test article should be made. If these 
efforts fail, the reason should be recorded on the drug accountability CRF and a detailed note of the reason for failure should be made in the source documents.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  A 3.4 Test Article Supply Records at Stu dy Sites  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that a current record of test article 
disposition is maintained. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines, and should include: 
• Amount received placed in storage a rea. 
• Amount currently in storage area. 
• Label ID number (tube numbers). 
• Dates and initials of the person responsible for each product inventory 
entry/movement. 
• Amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subject identifiers.  
• Amount transferred to another area for dispensing or storage. 
• Non-study disposition (e.g., lost, wasted, broken). 
• Amount returned to Sponsor or third party, if applicable. 
• Amount destroyed at study site, if applicable.  
 
The CRO will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the staff at the study site does not have an established system that meets these requirements.  
A 3.5 Dose Modifications 
The subject should not modify the treatment regimen without consultation with the 
investigator. If the subject feels that his/her acne has cleared, he/she should continue to 
apply the test article to the designated treatment area (face and/or trunk) as instructed by 
the investigator and call the investigator for an unscheduled visit. The subject should NOT change his/her dosing regimen until the investigator has documented acne improvement or worsening to support a change in the treatment recommendations.  Treatment on the face and/or trunk may be discontinued if/when acne clears (achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) and re -instated if/when acne worsens (IGA≥2) 
according to the assessment of the investigator for each respective treatment area.  If skin irritation or rash develops, subject should discontinue use and contact the study site. In the event that the inves tigator believes dose modification is necessary due to tolerability 
issues (e.g., problems with tolerance), the subject’s care should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to making any dose modifications. All dose modifications must be reported on the appropriate CRF. 
A 3.6 Documentation of Application and Compliance 
A Subject Diary will be dispensed to the subject to record the dates and times of all 
application doses and any missed doses of the test article ( Appendix 2). Subjects will be

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  instructed to bring the diary with them to each study visit. The date and time of the first 
and last application of the test article will be recorded on the appropr iate CRF.  
A 3.7 Return and Destruction of Test Article Supplies  
Upon completion or termination of the study, all test article tubes must be accounted for and any missing tubes of the test article must be explained on the completed Study Medication Accountability  Log. All returned tubes will be weighed to the nearest tenth 
gram (0.1 gram) in order to document extent of subject exposure. Unless instructed otherwise by the Sponsor, the study site will keep the original Study Medication Accountability Log in the stud y file. A copy of the Study Medication  Accountability Log 
will be returned to the Sponsor. All tubes of test article will then either be a) returned to the study Sponsor or b) emptied and provided to a sponsor -identified third party vendor for 
appropriate destruction, according to applicable regulations with the provision of a 
certificate of destruction.

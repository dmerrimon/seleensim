DEFINITIONS  
Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke: Focal irreversible brain injury with neuron cell 
death most commonly caused by compromise of end-organ oxygen supply due to 
parenchymal hemorrhage from loss of arterial vascular integrity or flow interruption from 
intracranial arterial occlusion. 
Transient ischemic attack (TIA):  Focal neurological symptoms that resolve spontaneously 
within 24 hours without evidence of cerebral infarction. 
Secondary hypertension: High blood pressure that is caused by an identifiable secondary 
medical condition or exogenous substrate. Secondary hypertension differs from the usual 
type of high blood pressure (essential hypertension), which is often referred to simply as 
high blood pressure. Essential hypertension, also known as primary hypertension, has no 
clear cause and is thought to be linked to genetics, poor diet, lack of exercise and obesity. 
Secondary hypertension has been linked to conditions that affect kidney function, as well as 
sleep apnea, renal circulation compromise, congenital aortic abnormalities, unusual 
adrenalin secreting tumors, and endocrine system abnormalities.  In addition, the 
aggravating factor for secondary hypertension could also be medications like NSAIDs.  
Vulnerable plaque: An atheromatous plaque in an arterial wall that has abundant 
macrophages, prominent lipid pool, and is usually covered by a thin fibrous cap that is 
providing a limiting protective barrier from rupture. The repeated cycle of rupture and 
healing is regarded as one of the key mechanisms of arterial stenosis progression in 
atherosclerotic heart disease, myocardial infarction and strokes. 
Clinical significant structural valvular cardiac disease: For the purpose of this study we 
define a “significant” valvular condition as any structural heart abnormality that increases 
the patient’s risks for a stroke or adverse event during the follow-up period. For example, 
patients with hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis as defined by a mean gradient of > 
30mmHg and/or symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain or syncope.  In addition, this includes 
patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis based on contemporary echo or 
hemodynamic guidelines. 
Moderate to severe reactive airway disease: 
Moderate persistent asthma: Documented primary reactive airway disease with 
symptoms that occur daily.  In addition, flare-up s can occur, increasing the 
symptoms from moderate to severe, which often last several days. Thus any patient 
with chronic daily symptoms and or documented flair-ups over the last year falls in 
this exclusion definition. Coughing and wheezing may disrupt the normal activities 
and make it difficult to sleep. Nighttime flare-ups may occur more than once a week. 
In moderate persistent asthma, lung function is roughly between 60% and 80% of 
normal, without treatment. 
Severe persistent asthma: With severe persistent asthma, symptoms occur daily and 
often. They also frequently curtail the patient’s activities or disrupt his/her sleep. 
Lung function is generally less than 60% of the normal level without treatment. 
History of hospitalization within the preceding year for an asthmatic attack is also 
consistent with severe asthma. 
 
 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 10 
 
Moderate to severe COPD: 
Moderate COPD: For the purpose of this study, moderate COPD will be defined as 
any patient with documented chronic lung disease that experiences daily dyspnea 
symptoms and requires daily medical treatment in order to maintain normal daily 
activities.   
Severe COPD: Any patient with documented COPD on lung function and/or X-ray 
studies that has persistent limiting symptoms due to dyspnea. In addition these 
patients frequently have orthopnea that would prohibit them from lying flat during 
the needed imaging and transcatheter study device placement. This will also include 
a
ny patient who has been hospitalized with acute exacerbation of COPD in the 
preceding year. 
Moderate to severe primary pulmonary hypertension: Any patient with symptoms of 
dyspnea and known pulmonary hypertension without secondary cause of recurrent 
pulmonary embolism, sleep apnea, left sided heart failure, chronic lung disease or other 
primary substrate. Objectively this can be defined as NYHA II or III symptoms with mPAP 
>41mmhg, or PASP >49 in the absence of a secondary cause.

STUDY 
ENROLLMENT  This study will be enrolled based on the following matrix with review of 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and FDA:  
 
Unilateral study safety design:  
 
 
Following enrollment of the initial 10 subjects, based on DSMB review of 
available data, a determination will be made on whether the safety of the 
MobiusHD is adequate to support bilateral placement.  If the DSMB 
determines that bilateral treatment is warranted, an interim report with all 
available clinical data will be submitted to FDA with a request for initiation 
of bilateral treatment in the remaining 10 study subjects.

2.0 BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION 
Normal or optimal blood pressure (BP) is defined as the level at which minimal vascular 
damage occurs. The Joint National Committee 7 (JNC 7) defines normal BP as a systolic BP 
(SBP) less than 120 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) less than 80 mmHg.1  
An e
stimated 76 million adults above the age of 20 have high blood pressure in the United 
States. Data from NHANES 1999-2006 found that approximately 8% of US adults have 
undiagnosed hypertension. Approximately 30% of adults are unaware of their hypertension, 
greater than 40% are not on any treatment and two-thirds of hypertensive patients are not 
being controlled to BP levels <140/90 mmHg.1 The highest prevalence of hypertension in 
the U
S is noted in African Americans. 
W
orldwide prevalence estimates indicate that hypertension may affect as many as 1 billion 
individuals, and approximately 7.1 million deaths per year may be attributable to 
hypertension.1 The World Health Organization reports that suboptimal BP (>115 mmHg 
SBP) is responsible for 62% of cerebrovascular disease and 49% of ischemic heart disease 
(IHD), with little variation by sex. In addition, suboptimal BP is the number one attributable 
risk factor for death throughout the world.1 
Blood pressure control rate is recognized to be suboptimal in those who have serious 
comorbid conditions like chronic kidney disease. In a survey of patients in the United States 
with chronic kidney disease, BP control was found to be a dismal 13.2%.2  On a global level, 
h
ypertension is an even greater problem, with 13.5% of all deaths attributed to BP-related 
diseases. A majority of those who carry this disease burden belong to lower economic 
strata.3 
It is clearly recognized that increased BP is associated with a greater risk of heart attack, 
stroke
, and kidney disease. In fact, for persons aged 40 to 70 years, each increment of 
20 mmHg in SBP or 10 mmHg in DBP actually doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease 
a
cross the entire range of BP, from 115/75 to 185/115 mmHg.4

Based on JNC 7, patients with sustained hypertension are further divided into stage 1 
hypertension (SBP 140-159 mmHg or DBP 90-99  mmHg), stage 2 hypertension  
(SBP >160 mmHg or DBP >100 mmHg), and those with compelling indications that include 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease. Each BP increase of 20/10 mmHg 
doubles the risk of cardiovascular death.

Hypertension remains uncontrolled in the majority of treated patients, especially those with 
multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This was demonstrated by a French study that showed 
that 70% of treated hypertensive patients are not controlled to the target level of  
140/90 mmHg. This proportion reached 84% in hypertensive patients with diabetes (target 
level 130/85 mmHg). 
Resistant hypertension is a widely prevalent condition, estimated to affect approximately 
30% of the population in the United States. Resistant hypertension is defined as elevated BP 
that remains despite treatment with at least three (3) anti-hypertensive agents at optimal 
doses.  The morbidity and mortality risks associated with hypertension support the need for 
evaluation of new therapies that can reduce or eliminate the challenges of side effects and 
poor long-term compliance associated with commercially available blood pressure-lowering 
medications. 
2.1  CURRENT  HYPERTENSION TREATMENT  
2.1.1   Lifestyle Modification 
Educ
ating patients regarding the importance of non-pharmacologic interventions for 
effective BP control is an important component of reducing cardiovascular risk in the 
general population. This is particularly true for the pre-hypertensive and hypertensive 
patient. Aggressive efforts, however, are needed to ensure optimal adherence to 
recommendations. 
Lifestyle modifications include limiting alcohol intake, increasing physical activity, and 
reducing sodium intake to less than 6 g of sodium chloride daily. Results from the long-term 
follow-up of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) study demonstrated that patients 
who were randomized to a low-salt diet (sodium <1800 mg/24 hr) had a 25% risk reduction 
in ca
rdiovascular events.5 
Weight reduction of as little as 10 to 12 pounds in the obese hypertensive patient can have a 
c
onsiderable impact on elevated BP. Appropriate nutritional counseling can encourage a diet 
with reduced total fat and cholesterol intake, in addition to providing an adequate daily 
intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium. The Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension (DASH) trial has provided substantial data that a diet rich in fruits, nuts, 
vegetables and low-fat dairy products, with an emphasis on fish and chicken rather than red 
meat, contributed to lowered BP, even without weight reduction. This dietary approach was 
particularly effective for participants who also restricted sodium chloride intake.6  Dietary 
recommendations must be made on an individualized basis and should be well supported 
with continued educational and counseling efforts. 
Cigarette smoking is a recognized accelerator of cardiovascular disease. Smoking cessation 
should, therefore, be strongly encouraged for all patients, and education, counseling, and 
medic
ation should be provided as needed. 
The effects of implementing these modifications are both dose-dependent and time-
dependent and could be greater for some patients than for others. Also, a combination of two 
or more lifestyle modifications can lead to even better results. Lifestyle modifications not 
only reduce BP but also enhance the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and decrease 
cardiovascular risk.

2.1.2    Medical Treatment for Stage 1 and Stage 2 Hypertension  
Based on Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering to Reduce Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) 
data, JNC 7 recommends diuretics as first-line therapy for the management of stage 1 
hypertension, and a combination of two (2) drugs as initial therapy for stage 2 hypertension, 
preferably with a diuretic as one (1) of these two (2) drugs.1 
It was concluded from this trial that diuretic therapy is as effective as a calcium channel 
blocker (CCB) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor from the standpoint of 
the primary outcome of the trial, and diuretic therapy is superior for select subgroup 
analyses. A critical look at the trial design suggests a more prudent conclusion that diuretics 
should be part of all antihypertensive regimens unless they are clearly contraindicated. 
In addition, there was a concern that diuretics might worsen glucose tolerance and insulin 
resistance. Recent data demonstrates that the higher incidence of diabetes mellitus related to 
thiazides does not appear to be responsible for the increase in risk for coronary heart 
disease.5 In addition to thiazide diuretics, JNC 7 guidelines also recommend ACE inhibitors, 
a
ngiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (BBs), and CCBs as first-line therapy 
for hypertension. Since the publication of JNC 7 guidelines, studies have shown that beta-
blocker therapy might not be effective and in fact might increase the risk of stroke.1,4 In the 
ne
wer guidelines published by various national societies, BBs have been removed as first-
line therapy and are recommended only with a compelling indication in those with cardiac 
disea
se. 
Based on evidence of improved outcomes, JNC 7 has recommended several medications for 
compelling indications (Tables 2 and 3). These include BBs and aldosterone antagonists in 
those with cardiac disease, ACE inhibitors and ARBs in those with chronic kidney disease, 
and diuretics and CCBs in those with isolated systolic hypertension. A combination of ACE 
inhibitors and diuretics instead of ACE inhibitors alone is recommended for preventing 
recurrence of stroke based on findings of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent 
S
troke Study (PROGRESS), which showed a 42% stroke reduction in those treated with this 
combination of therapy.7

2.1.3   Baroreceptor Modulation for Hypertension 
The
 pivotal role of the autonomic nervous system in the pathogenesis of hypertension is well 
established.  However, pharmacological therapies that block sympathetic activity have not 
achieved the desired outcomes. 
In the past few years, there have been efforts to develop medical devices and techniques that 
influence sympathetic nervous system activity.  These include endovascular renal 
sympathetic denervation and continuous electrical baroreceptor nerve pacing. 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 22 
 
Vascular Dynamics’ approach is to modulate the baroreflex using a simple, passive, 
implantable device as a means for inhibiting sympathetic activity and lowering BP. The 
application of localized mechanical forces to the arterial wall of the carotid sinus changes its 
geometric shape to increase baroreceptor signaling, while preserving arterial pulsatility and 
blood flow.    
The effect of a change in the morphology of the carotid sinus on systemic BP has been 
studied in dogs, both acutely by Bagshaw, et. al. (1987)8, and chronically by Fadali, et. al. 
(1969).9  In both studies, the canine carotid sinuses were surgically enlarged using a vein 
patch.  Bagshaw measured the effect this “patchplasty” had on systemic BP and found that 
the inc
rease in carotid baroreceptor sensitivity correlated with the increase in the diameter of 
the sinus.  In the chronic study by Fadali, the dogs’ systemic BP was lowered significantly 
over a follow-up period of six (6) months. 
Although the exact change in carotid sinus morphology in the studies described above is 
different from the one produced by the MobiusHD, these studies clearly demonstrate that an 
artificial increase in the diameter of the carotid sinus, which preserves the pulsatile nature of 
the input to the baroreceptors, increases the strain measured by the baroreceptors and 
ultimately reduces systemic BP.  This is especially relevant to the MobiusHD’s mechanism 
of action since the enlarged diameter in these studies was produced by a surgical change 
rather than as a result of mere over-inflation of the sinus by increased internal pressure. 
A study in human subjects by McKevitt, et. al. (2003)10 investigated the short and long term 
effects of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) on systemic 
arterial BP.  A statistically significant decrease in SBP was found at one and six months only 
in the surgical group (37 subjects) but not in the CAS group (40 subjects).  Acute 
hypotension was observed in both groups.  These findings support our hypothesis that 
traditional carotid stents cause only transient hypotension due to an exaggerated stretching 
of
 the arterial wall, which reduces pulsatility and ultimately induces baroreceptor resetting.   
I
n a CEA the diameter of the carotid sinus is enlarged by use of a patch, and the cross 
se
ction of the artery becomes non-circular, resulting in short-term hypotension11. 
Implantation of the MobiusHD also results in a change to the cross-sectional shape of the 
carotid sinus, but unlike a carotid stent or CEA, the MobiusHD maintains pulsatility. 
Know
ledge derived from NASA’s research on the baroreflex in humans using the Variable 
Pressure Neck Chamber is described by Fadel, et. al.(2003).12  These experiments 
de
monstrate the significant impact that mechanical modulation of the carotid sinus has on 
systemic BP in humans, and that this effect is mostly exerted through a change of systemic 
vascular resistance by the sympathetic nervous system. 
Based on data suggesting the potential utility of mechanical modulation of the baroreflex for 
lowering BP, Vascular Dynamics has developed the MobiusHD for the treatment of resistant 
h
ypertension.13 The MobiusHD, the subject of this protocol (Protocol), is a sterile self-
e
xpanding nitinol implant, delivered through a disposable catheter, the Delivery Catheter.  
Together, the MobiusHD and Delivery Catheter make up the MobiusHD system. The 
MobiusHD is designed to treat drug-resistant hypertension by amplifying carotid sinus 
baroreceptor afferent signaling.

3.0 MOBIUSHD™ SYSTEM  
3.1  D ETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MOBIUS HD 
The MobiusHD system consists of two parts: (1) the implant (MobiusHD); and (2) the 
Delivery Catheter (DC). The implant is a thin, flexible, open metal cage that is implanted in 
the c
arotid sinus. It is made of a nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol) tubing and laser-cut into a 
cage shape. Two radiopaque markers made of tantalum are welded at each end of the 
implant to help with visualization and positioning under fluoroscopy. The implant is 
mounted in a long, thin, tube-like device called a catheter, which together with the delivery 
ha
ndle, constitutes the Delivery Catheter.   
The MobiusHD system is compatible with appropriately sized commercially available 
guidewires and guiding catheters and/or sheaths.  The MobiusHD system is introduced into 
the f
emoral artery in the groin, and advanced through the length of the guiding catheter or 
shea
th over a guidewire in to t he carotid sinus using fluoroscopic guidance.  
Once the Delivery Catheter has been guided to the desired location, the implant is partially 
de
ployed by holding the delivery handle stationary , while movin g the lever to a secondary 
locke
d position.  At this point, the operator has the opportunity to review the position and 
re
capture the device if repositioning is needed.  The recapture is performed by simply 
a
dvancing the lever forward back to the closed position.  Alternatively, if the operator is 
plea
sed with the position, a second release maneuver is performed and with a final short 
lever retraction, the remaining constrained portion of the implant is allowed to expand and is 
re
leased from the delivery system. The implant is designed to expand to a programmed size 
a
fter being released from the delivery catheter.  
3.2 CO MPONENTS  
The MobiusHD system consists of two parts: (1) the implant (MobiusHD); and (2) the 
Delivery Catheter.   
 I mplant – A super-elastic self-expanding nitinol open metal cage with two 
ra
diopaque markers on each end.  The implant expands as it is deployed from the 
delivery catheter.  The implant may be partially deployed and still be retracted back 
into its delivery catheter.  The implant is preloaded in the Delivery Catheter. 
 De livery Catheter – A soft, atraumatically tipped delivery catheter with a delivery 
ha
ndle attached to its proximal end. The delivery handle has stops that allow for 
pa
rtial deployment without risk of unintended release of the implant. In addition 
there are locks that prevent premature unsheathing or device release.  When release 
is desire
d, the delivery handle must be further actuated to release the implant from 
the delivery catheter. 
 
The MobiusHD system is designed to track easily within the guiding catheter or sheath 
through the v
asculature to the left or right carotid sinus located in the ICA just distal to the 
common carotid bifurcation.

3.2.1   MobiusHD (implant)  
The
 MobiusHD is laser cut from a tube of superelastic nitinol.  This is the same material 
used in most self-expanding stents.  After laser cutting, the implant is heat set to its final 
shape.   Radiopaque tantalum markers are swaged and welded into marker holes previously 
cut into the implant.  Finally, the implant is electropolished to create a smooth surface.   The 
design consists of four “windows,” which amplify carotid sinus baroreceptor afferent 
sig
naling, while maintaining pulsatility of the vessel.  The “crowns” at each end of the 
windows generate the radial force necessary for the implant to self-expand and allow the 
struts of the
 implant in the mid-body to maintain proper wall apposition, thus creating the 
wide “windows” necessary to amplify pulsatility.  To minimize the force per area, the struts 
along the main body of the implant are doubled to increase the surface area in order to 
distribute the radial force.  The implant design is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 and its 
c
haracteristics are presented in Table 4.

3.2.2   Delivery Catheter 
The
 Delivery Catheter (DC) is designed to enable the physician to navigate to the desired 
de
ployment location and accurately unsheathe the implant in a controlled fashion.  Similar 
to ot
her commercially available devices, the DC is designed with a truncated central 
guidewire lumen (i.e. rapid exchange) to allow introduction over a standard length 0.014” 
guidewire.  The DC is comprised of an inner body and an outer body.  The delivery handle 
connects these two components and allows the user to controllably retract the outer body 
while maintaining the position of the implant in the desired deployment location.  This 
enables the implant to gently expand to meet the interior luminal vessel wall.  The additional 
c
ontrol provided by the delivery handle reduces the risk associated with advancing the 
implant rather than retracting the outer body.  
In order to avoid unintentional deployment, the delivery handle incorporates features that 
require additional action on the part of the user to move from the partial deployment position 
to full deployment.  Additionally, the DC allows the physician to re-sheath and reposition 
the implant to ensure the desired placement is achieved. The actuation of the Delivery 
Catheter is illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
 
FIGURE 3: ACTUATION OF DELIVERY CATHETER  
 
Materials standard to commercially available medical devices have been employed  
in the construction of the Delivery Catheter.  These materials include Nylon-12, PEEK, 
P
ebax, high density polyethylene (HDPE), 90% Platinum/10% Iridium, stainless steel (in the 
form of wire, tubing and machined components), ABS, and medical grade adhesives.  
Similarly, common processes are used for construction of the DC, including extrusion, 
ther
mal and adhesive bonding, conventional machining, injection molding and braiding.

3.3   P RINCI PLE OF OPERATION  
The MobiusHD is placed in the target carotid sinus by advancing the catheter to  the target 
sit
e through the femoral artery, through an appropriate guiding catheter or sheath, and  over a 
.014 inch guidewire.  This catheter houses the MobiusHD implant.  The catheter is precisely 
posi
tioned in the carotid sinus using the marker bands on the DC and implant as a guide.  
W
hen properly positioned, the DC protective sheath is pulled back by manipulation of the 
handle, to allow expansion of the implant and apposition with the vessel intima.  The 
c
atheter is then withdrawn, leaving the implant at the site of the carotid sinus. 
4.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The objective of the present study is to prospectively evaluate the safety of the Mobius HD 
s
ystem in subjects with resistant hypertension in a multi-center, open-label, first- in- man 
clinical trial. 
Additional goals of this study are to  evaluate the effect of MobiusHD device on systemic 
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate.  
5.0 CLINICA L STUDY DESIGN 
This is an open-label, multicenter, first- in-man clinical trial to be conducted inside the 
United St
ates.  Up to 20 patients with stage 2  resistant hypertension (i.e., inadequate blood 
pressure control with a minimum of three (3) anti-hypertensive drugs), who meet the 
protocol eligibility criteria and consent to study participation wil l undergo placement of the 
Mobius HD implant in the carotid sinus and will be followed for 36 months.

The first 10 patients enrolled will undergo unilateral placement of a single MobiusHD 
implant.  Enrollment of this group of 10 subjects will be staggered based on review of 
clinical outcomes by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and by FDA, as shown in 
Figure 5.

Following enrollment of the initial 10 subjects, based on DSMB review of available data, a 
determination will be made on whether the safety of the Mobius HD is adequate to support 
bil
ateral placement.  If the DSMB determines that bilateral treatment is warranted, an 
interim report with all available clinical data will be submitted to FDA with a request for 
initiation of bilateral treatment in the remaining 10 study subjects. 
If bilateral placement of the Mobius HD is recommended by the DSMB and approved by 
F

diagnosed with stage 2 resistant hypertension, on at least three (3) anti-hypertensive 
medications of which one is a diuretic.  All potential study participants must meet all of the 
following
 eligibility criteria to qualify for enrollment in the study. 
6.1 I NCLUS ION CRITERIA  
Candidates for this study must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in the study, as 
deter
mined in the following screening and baseline visits:

7.0 SUBJECT ENROLLMENT 
Clinical site personnel will review the patient’s medical history for eligibility.  Potential 
c
andidates will be fully informed of the purpose of the study and the nature of the 
im
plantation procedure.  The implantation procedure will be described and its potential risks 
and benefits will be explained in detail.  Once the patient’s potential eligibility has been 
de
termined, the Investigator will discuss the study and ask the patient if they are interested 
in participating in the study. Patients who voluntarily agree to participate in the trial will be 
a
sked to sign and date the written Informed Consent Document (ICD).  The study will be 
e
xplained to the patient in lay terms.  The ICD, approved by the site Institutional Review 
B
oard (IRB), mu st be signed b y the potential study participant before he or she undergoes 
an
y study specific assessments.  A copy of the signed and dated ICD  should be provided to 
the subject.  Failure to obtain a signed ICD prior to the procedure constitutes a protocol 
de
viation.  Subjects must be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time, 
a
nd for any reason, and will continue to receive therapy as indicated by their physician. 
All subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and give written informed consent are 
considered enrolled in the study and must be entered into the electronic database for 
assignment of subject identification number.  This unique number identifies each Case 
Report Form (CRF )  and should be used on all source documents so that study data is 
re
ported in anonymous form to protect subject confidentiality.   
A screen-failed subject refers to a subject who signed the approved ICD but failed to meet 
a
ll the eligibility criteria.  There are no follow-up requirements for subjects who electively 
withdraw from the study prior to treatment.  The original ICD and a screening log will be 
maintained in the clinical site’s study files.  No CRFs are required to be completed for 
screen failure patients and these patients will not be followed per the Investigational Plan 
re
quirements. 
If the Investigator is unable to place a MobiusHD implant in a subject,  the subject will be 
followed to the 30-Day visit and will then be exited from the study in the absence of any 
ong
oing adverse events.  If an adverse event is ongoing or not stabilized, the subject will 
c
ontinue to be followed until complete resolution or stabilization of the AE with no 
expectation or need for further treatment.  The reason(s) for failure to place the implant will 
be
 documented on the Procedure CRF.

*Note: Potassium -sparing diuretics also directly or indirectly block aldosterone, a hormone that ra ises blood 
pressure by causing the kidneys to conserve sodium and water. As a result, these four medications are sometimes 
also known as aldosterone -receptor blockers. Amiloride (Midamor), spironolactone (Aldactone), and triamterene 
(Dyrenium) also affect other hormones and thus carry some unwanted side effects, such as breast enlargement and 
impotence in men and menstrual irregularities in women. Eplerenone (Inspra) is the only one of these medications 
that affects solely aldosterone and not other hormones .

All subjects that are implanted with the MobiusHD will be required to be on duel antiplatelet 
therapy (ie. aspirin 81-325 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily; substitutes can be used but 
should be equivalent) for three (3) days prior to the implant procedure as well as three (3) 
months post-procedure.  Aspirin will continue for the duration of study. 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 43 
 
Management of subject’s individual risk factors as appropriate, e.g., statins, smoking 
cessation, nutritionist, diabetes management, etc., will remain as standard of care and any 
c
hanges to this regimen will be documented by the study team. 
Subjects should be advised of the importance of not stopping their medical therapy regimen 
before first consulting with the study center.  In the absence of changes initiated by the study 
ph
ysician in response to severe symptomatic drops in blood pressure, subjects should not 
re
duce or stop their anti-hypertensive medication dosage until the 6-month time point, at 
which time the Principle Investigator may decide to reduce medication use. 
8.2 S T UDY ENROLLMENT  
The number of subjects to be enrolled in the study is up to 20.  This sample size is estimated 
to be sufficient to yield acceptable, first- in-man, safety and effectiveness data for initial 
analysis and to support future regulatory submissions.  It is anticipated that up to ten (10) 
c
enters inside the United States will be needed to enroll this study in a timely fashion.  Each 
investi
gational site will be expected to enroll at least two (2) and up to eight (8) subjects. 
8.3 I NV ESTIGATOR QUALIFICATION AND TRAINING  
The MobiusHD system should only be used by interventionists with expertise in the 
navigation of catheter systems and stenting procedures.  Qualified potential Investigators for 
this clinical trial will have successfully placed carotid stents in at least 10 patients in the 12 
months prior to Site Initiation and 100 carotid stents during their careers.   
Qualified study centers will be expected to work in research teams that include the 
appropriate specialties for the proper conduct of the study (e.g., interventional 
cardiologist(s) or neurointerventionalist(s) experienced in carotid stenting, internists, and 
study coordinator(s)).  Qualified interventionists will have successfully performed carotid 
stenting in at least 10 patients in the last calendar year and 100 patients in their careers. 
All 
Investigators and those to whom the Investigator delegates study responsibilities (see 
Investigator Agreement), will be trained on the Protocol by a representative of the Sponsor.  
Interventional Investigators using the investigational device will be trained on the 
Instructions For Use of the MobiusHD system.  Additional training such as preparation and 
table-top deployment of a demonstration device, animal lab, and/or case support will be 
offered by Sponsor, as appropriate, to meet the needs of the site Investigators.  In addition, 
tra
ining on topics such as Medical Imaging Guidelines (“Core Lab”, Appendix I), internet-
based CRF (iCRF) data entry procedures, and investigational device inventory management 
will be conducted at Investigator meetings and during site visits.  All training completed will 
be
 appropriately documented.  Research staff responsible for assessing neurological status 
using the NIHSS must be certified in the proper administration of this assessment tool.  
Training and Certification on administration of the NIHSS, if such documentation is not 
already available, can be obtained by taking a web-based accredited course such as:

8.4 S ELECTION AND SCREENING OF SUBJECTS  
Prior to subject participation in this study, the study team must obtain written IRB/EC 
approval for the Protocol and the ICF.  The study population for this clinical trial will be 
comprised of adult patients who have been diagnosed with stage 2 resistant hypertension.  In 
a
ddition, these patients must satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The trial will 
prospectively enroll up to 20 subjects.  Patients presenting with stage 2 resistant 
h
ypertension must be on a minimum of three (3) anti-hypertensive medications.  Clinical 
site personnel will review the patient’s medical history for eligibility.  Potential candidates 
will be fully informed by a member of the research team as to the purpose of the study and 
the nature of the implantation procedure.  The implantation procedure will be described and 
its potential risks and benefits will be explained in detail.  Patients who voluntarily agree to 
participate in the trial will be asked to sign and date the written Informed Consent Form 
(ICF).  If approved by the reviewing IRB/EC, subjects may indicate verbal, witnessed 
c
onsent with the signature of a patient representative not associated with the study team if 
cognition is intact but the subject is unable to sign (e.g., the subject has inhibited hand 
function or visual disturbance).  
The approved ICF must be signed for study enrollment prior to performing study related 
assessments.  A copy of the signed and dated ICF should be provided to the subject.  
Subjects must be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time, and for any 
reason, and will continue to receive therapy as indicated by their physician.  Internet-based 
Case Report Forms must be completed for each subject who consents to study participation.   
8.5 B ASE LINE ASSESSMENT : VISIT 1 (DAY 0-14)  – ASSE SSED DAY 14 
The following information will be assessed and the documentation will be maintained as 
source records at the study site:

After consent, all subjects should complete the baseline assessments outlined in  
Sections 8.5 – 8.7 and the Schedule of Study Visits and Assessments (Table 7).  Subjects 
who meet all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria should then undergo angiogram according to 
imaging guidelines to measure and check the remaining Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. If renal 
duplex, renal MRA , renal CTA or renal angiography was performed in the 12 months 
preceding screening and showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis then no further work-
up is 
needed. If no workup has been done then an abdominal angiogram in the 20 degree 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 46 
 
LAO projection will be done prior to device implantation. During this angiogram procedure, 
if a
ll Inclusion/Exclusion criteria are met, then the subject may be treated with the 
Mobi
usHD.  
8.9 M O BIUS HD  PROCEDURE  
Prior to implantation, all assessment data should be entered into the eDC and there should be 
doc
umentation that the patient has taken the dual antiplatelet regimen for the three (3) days. 
Also
, diabetic subjects taking drugs containing metformin should be switched to insulin 
mana
gement the night before the implant procedure and should not be restarted on 
metformin until 48 hours after the last injection of contrast dye. 
The patient will be placed in the standard supine position on the imaging table and prepped 
and draped as with any standard carotid transcatheter therapeutic or diagnostic study. Use of 
a head-stabilizing device is optional for this study and depends on physician preference. 
L
ight sedation and local anesthesia is recommended to allow for clinical neurological 
a
ssessment, as needed. 
I
n patients without adequate pre-procedure work-up for renal artery stenosis, non-selective 
re
nal angiography should be performed based on local technique preferences.  In the 
absence of a local preference, begin with placement of the pigtail or lateral spray (i.e., tennis 
ra
cket) catheter at the level of L-1. Make certain the catheter is easily movable and can 
rota
te to ensure the tip is not inadvertently positioned in a thoracic or lumbar branch. Place 
the image intensifier at 20 degrees left anterior oblique and inject 15 cc/sec for 2 seconds 
under breath-hold conditions with digital subtraction. Different obliquity images may be 
needed if the renal ostia are eclipsed by overlying mesenteric vessels.   
Heparin is given during the angiogram and implantation procedures (100 I.U ./kg).  ACT  
>
 250 must be documented before implantation and measurement of platelet function is 
re
commended according to local carotid stent protocols.   
The
 aortic arch is defined by baseline angiography in the left anterior oblique projection.  
Selective carotid angiography of the target vessel for implant is performed in orthogonal 
views. If the aortic arch and carotid meet the study inclusion criteria then the operator will 
proceed with the implant.  
The target common carotid is accessed with a 6 Fr kink-resistant sheath or an 8 Fr guiding 
catheter using the external carotid anchor-wire, telescoping technique or whatever approach 
the ope
rator typically uses for carotid stenting.  The guide or sheath tip should be in a stable 
position within the common carotid prior to removal of the .035 or .038 inch wire. 
Once the guiding catheter or sheath is in position and the ACT is above 250 seconds, the 
I
CA is accessed with a .014 inch guidewire. The implant delivery catheter is then prepared 
a
nd introduced over the guidewire. Carotid imaging and roadmaps may be useful at this 
ti
me.  Selection of the implant size should be based on the angiographic measurements of 
the carotid sinus and these should coincide with the non-invasive (Duplex and or CTA) 
measurements. To select an appropriate implant size, select the size that correlates to the 
mea
surement made of the diameter of the carotid sinus.   
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 47 
 
Some degree of distal embolization likely occurs during all transcatheter interventional 
procedures. The clinical sequela is defined by the sensitivity of the target organ to segmental 
ischemia and the burden of embolic load.14 Due to the low burden of embolic load expected 
in this procedure due to the inclusion and exclusion criteria the use of a protection device is 
ba
sed on operator preference. Distal protection may be used with any FDA-approved distal 
pr
otection device but is not mandatory. Precise placement of the implant within the sinus is 
re
quired and should be controlled by road map or contrast injections.  Gentle forward and 
backward movements may be needed as with a carotid stent, to release tension and eliminate 
re
dundancy within the delivery catheter.  Implant delivery is performed by very slow 
re
traction of the implant delivery catheter sheath and this is performed by releasing the 
ini
tial lock, then sliding the control knob proximally. The device will flower open and 
during
 this maneuver movement of the delivery catheter must be strictly avoided. The 
ope
rator has the opportunity to re-sheath and reposition or release the second lock and 
deploy the implant, depending on his or her satisfaction with the implant position and 
apposition. Following implantation, the delivery catheter is removed; fluoroscopic guidance 
shoul
d be used until the nosecone is retracted past the implant.  Post procedure angiography 
shoul
d be performed to evaluate proper implant positioning, apposition, and maintenance of  
the ve
ssel lumen. Completion angiograms should display the implanted site and the 
de
pendent territory in at least two (2) orthogonal planes.    
R
efer to the IFU (Appendix VI) for detailed preparation procedures and detailed sizing and 
plac
ement of the device. 
8.10 P O ST -PROCEDURE CARE 
Following the angiogram and procedure, the subjects will be asked to lie flat with a  
pr
essure bandage over the groin puncture site according to the local standard of care (e.g., 
a
ssess for bleeding, hematoma, pedal pulses).  A post-implant carotid duplex imaging study 
is re
quired prior to discharge.  The subject will be monitored closely for significant change 
in status (peri-procedural adverse events).   
I
mplanted subjects should be monitored in an intensive care or intermediate care unit; with 
e
mphasis on meticulous blood pressure monitoring over the first 12 hours for recognition 
a
nd/or prevention of severe hypotension (symptomatic drop in BP bellow 90/50) or severe 
h
ypertension (rise in BP above 180/100 mmHg with or without symptoms ).  If blood 
pressure drops below 90/50 with clinical symptoms or the subject has symptoms with a 
re
lative drop from baseline pressure due to past compensatory changes, then aggressive 
re
scue (may include pressors, fluids, placement in trendelenburg position, withdrawal of 
blood pressure medications, etc.) should be provided to increase blood pressure to a point 
where the symptoms are alleviated.  Blood pressure medications can be withdrawn if there is 
a
n abrupt drop in blood pressure from baseline, and should be documented as an adverse 
event and logged in the medication log.  Aggressive use of protamine sulfate to antagonize 
the total dose
 of heparin should be avoided due to risk of implant thrombosis.  Take vital 
sig
ns once an hour for three (3) hours and enter data in the post-procedure iCRF.  Standard 
post
-procedure labs should be taken prior to discharge.  These labs should include CBC, 
Chem 7, and Hematologic labs.   
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 48 
 
Prior to release from the hospital the subject’s lying and standing bedside blood pressure 
shoul
d be measured and analyzed for orthostatic changes.  In addition, the subject must be 
ambulatory, without dizziness or other symptoms. 
I
f a new neurological deficit or a significant change in neurological status is determined 
using
 the NIHSS during post-procedure monitoring, assess for intracranial thrombus or 
he
morrhage using CT scan or MRI, if  deemed appropriate by the Investigator under standard 
of
 care, and treat accordingly. 
B
ody temperature >38˚C should be investigated, and testing performed per the standard of 
medical care (e.g., blood cultures, urinalysis, chest X-ray, phlebitis source), to allow 
appropriate treatment to be implemented.

9.0 S TUDY COMPLETION 
After the subject has completed the 3 -Year follow-up  visit, a Subject Termination iCRF 
must be completed.  During the course of the study, it is possible that subjects will be 
withdrawn from the study early.  Factors leading to subject withdrawal may include, but are 
not limited to, the following: 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 51 
 
 Subj e ct Withdrawal  - A subject may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any 
ti
me without affecting his or her future medical treatment or benefits.  In addition, 
the Investigator may withdraw a subject from the study if the subject refuses 
further testing or follow-up evaluations, or for any other reason as determined by 
the I
nvestigator.   
 Subject Lost to Follow- Up – If the Investigator has attempted to contact a subject 
at least three (3) times and receives no response, the subject may be lost to follow-
up.  The research staff should document at minimum three (3) attempts to contact 
the subjec
t prior to terminating the subject from the trial.   
 Subject Death  - When a subject expires, the Serious Adverse Event and Subject 
Te
rmination iCRFs must be completed promptly.  Source documents such as death 
summary, autopsy report (if done), and a copy of the death certificate should be 
redacted of personal identifiers and provided to the designated clinical monitor and 
DSMB to describe the cause of the subject’s death.  The Investigator will notify the 
IRB/EC and Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event. 
The
 Termination iCRF should be completed for each study subject, to record date and 
reason for early termination (if subject does not complete the study) or at the final visit (if 
subj
ect completes all study time points). 
10.0 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS 
To be eligible for enrollment, study participants must require a minimum of three (3) anti-
hypertensive medications at the time of entry into the study.  Additionally, all subjects will 
remain on at least three (3) anti-hypertensive medications for the duration of the study. 
I
n addition to the required regimen of hypertensive medications, all study subjects will be 
required to adhere to a regimen of duel antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin (81-325 mg 
daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily), or equivalent medications.  If alternative equivalent 
medications are used, these should be initiated at least three (3) days prior to the implant 
procedure and continued for at least three (3) months post-procedure.  Use of aspirin is 
required for the duration of study. 
Appropriate management of subject’s individual risk factors such as statins, smoking 
c
essation, nutrition, diabetes will remain as standard of care and any changes to this regimen 
will be documented by the study team. 
Subjects should be advised of the importance of continuing their medical therapy regimen 
without
 consulting with the study center.  Subjects should not reduce or stop their anti-
hypertensive medication dosage until the 6-month time point, at which time the Principle 
Investigator may decide to reduce medication as per the site’s protocol. 
All medications will be recorded on the Concomitant Medication log.

11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
Safety assessments include adverse events and serious adverse events.  The reporting period 
is from the initial treatment through the last study visit (Month 36). 
11.1 D E FINITIONS OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event is any untoward and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational device/drug/biologic or other protocol-imposed 
intervention, regardless of the suspected cause. Conditions or diseases that are chronic but 
stable should not be recorded on AE pages of the CRF.  Changes in a chronic condition of 
disea
se that are consistent with natural disease progression are NOT adverse events and also 
should not be recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.   
11.1.1 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
An A
E should be classified as an SAE and reported as such, if it meets one or more of the 
following criteria: 
 I t results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death) 
 I t is life threatening (i.e., the AE places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 I t requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization 
 I t results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a 
mother exposed to the investigational product 
 I t is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on medical 
judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). 
If a subject is hospitalized to undergo a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, 
the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be recorded as the 
event. For example, if a subject is hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass surgery, record 
the he
art condition that necessitated the bypass. 
 
Hospitalizations for the following reasons will not be recorded as SAEs: 
 Hospit alization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for preexisting conditions 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow outcome 
measurement for the study 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for scheduled therapy of the target 
disease of the study.

VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 53 
 
11.1.2 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) (where applicable)  
An una
nticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by or associated with a device, if that 
e
ffect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of 
incidence. Anticipated adverse events are identified in Section 11.3.   
11.2 A DV ERSE EVENT ASSESSMENT AND DOCUMENTATION  
All subjects who have been exposed to the study treatment will be evaluated for adverse 
events. All adverse events, regardless of severity and whether or not they are ascribed to the 
study treatment, will be recorded in the source documents and CRF using standard medical 
terminology.  
All adverse events will be evaluated beginning with onset, and evaluation will continue until 
resolution is noted, or until the investigator determines that the subject’s condition is stable. 
The investigator will take appropriate and necessary therapeutic measures required for 
resolution of the adverse event. Any medication necessary for the treatment of an adverse 
event must be recorded on the concomitant medication case report form.  
All AEs will be characterized by the following criteria: 
 Eve nt term 
 I ntensity or severity 
 Ex pectedness 
 R elationship to study treatment 
 Outcome 
 Tr eatment or action taken. 
 
Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used when recording AEs. 
Colloquialisms and/or abbreviations should not be used. Only one medical concept, preferably 
a diagnosis instead of individual symptoms, should be recorded as the event. 
 
If more than one distinct adverse event occurs, each event should be recorded separately. 
However, if known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) should be 
recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record congestive 
heart failure rather than dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis). However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the 
time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as a separate AE. A diagnosis 
that is subsequently established should be reported as follow-up information. However, 
signs and symptoms that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease 
should be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache 
are observed at the same time, each event should be recorded as an individual AE). 
 
  
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 54 
 
Adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by 
the primary cause; a "primary" event, if clearly identifiable, should represent the most 
accurate clinical term to record as the AE event term.  For example: 
 
Orthostatic hypotension fainting and fall to floor he ad trauma neck pain 
 
The primary event is orthostatic hypotension  and the sequelae are head trauma and neck 
pa
in. 
 
11.2.1 Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity/Severity 
All adve
rse events should be graded on a four-point scale (mild, moderate, marked, severe) 
for intensity/severity. These definitions are as follows: 
 
Mild:  Transient discomfort; no medical intervention/therapy required and 
does not interfere with daily activities. 
Moderate:  Low level of discomfort or concern with mild to moderate limitation 
in dail
y activities; some assistance may be needed; minimal or no 
medical intervention/therapy required. 
Marked:  Considerable discomfort with limitation in daily activities, some 
assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy usually 
required. 
Severe:  Extreme discomfort and limitation in daily activities, significant 
assistance required; significant  medical intervention/therapy required. 
 
The
re is a distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. Severity 
is a measurement of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious adverse 
event (SAE). For example, a headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be serious 
unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events. 
 
11.2.2  Expectedness 
All AEs will be evaluated as to whether they are expected or unexpected. 
  
E
xpected (anticipated):  An adverse event is expected when the nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence was previously 
described.   
 
Unexpected (unanticipated): An adverse event is unexpected when the nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence was not previously 
described.

VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 55 
 
11.2.3  Relatedness  
The
 study investigator will evaluate if the AE is related to the MobiusHD system. 
Relationship is defined in the following manner: 
  
Not
 related:  Evidence indicates no plausible direct relationship to the study device, 
such 
that: 
 A clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the AE 
and device administration; and/or 
 A c ausal relationship is considered biologically implausible 
 The  AE can be attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures. 
  
Re
lated:  Evidence indicates a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the 
stud
y device administration exists, or that the association of the event with study 
device administration is unknown and the event is not reasonably supported by other 
conditions, such that:  
 There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and study 
treatment administration; and/or 
 T here is a biologically plausible mechanism for study treatment causing or 
contributing to the AE; and 
 The AE cannot be reasonably attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, 
or procedures. 
11.2.4 Outcome 
The
 clinical outcome of an AE will be characterized as follows: 
 R esolved without sequelae 
 R esolved with sequelae (specify) 
 Ong oing (i.e. continuing at time of study discontinuation) 
 De ath. 
11.2.5 Treatment or Action Taken 
 None  
 Medical Intervention 
 Surgical Intervention 
 Othe r.

11.4 S E RIOUS ADVERSE EVENT AND UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT 
REPORTING  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) must be 
reported to the study sponsor as soon as possible and no later than 2 days after the 
investigator first learns of the event.   
 
For initial reports, investigators should record all case details that can be gathered within the 
reporting timeframe.  The contact information for Vascular Dynamics Inc. is below:

relating to the subject’s subsequent medical course must be submitted to the study sponsor 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 57 
 
until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the event stabilizes 
and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained. 
11.5 I NDEPE NDENT ADJUDICATION OF CLINICAL OUTCOME EVENTS BY DSMB 
All SAEs and UADE s  will be reviewed and adjudicated by the DSMB.  Clinical event 
summ
aries and relevant imaging studies will be reviewed by the DSMB, which includes an 
int
erventional cardiologist, a neurologist, an internist, and a biostatistician.   
12.0 E THICS AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 S UB JECT INFORMATION AND CONSENT PROCEDURES  
The Investigator, or designee, will obtain written informed consent from the subject prior to 
performing study assessments.  The subject will be informed that the Sponsor and regulatory 
authorities will have access to personally identifiable information for the purposes of 
monitoring data against source documentation.  However, all data entered in the database, 
filed, and presented by the Sponsor will be in anonymous form. 
The site-customized ICF (see sample ICF provided by Sponsor), must be approved by 
Vascular Dynamics, Inc. and the IRB/EC before use.  Each investigational Site will provide 
Vascular Dynamics, Inc. with a copy of the IRB/EC approved ICF and renewed approvals 
and consents as appropriate for the duration of the study. 
The original, signed and dated ICF should be retained in the subject’s study records, and a 
c
opy provided to the subject.  The consent completion will be monitored by the Sponsor or 
designee. 
12.2 IRB/EC AP PROVAL  
The Investigator, or designee, is responsible for submitting the clinical protocol and any 
amendments to the IRB/EC for approval prior to any subject being enrolled and for 
obtaining
 renewals at periods determined by the IRB/EC for the duration of the study.  
13.0 S TATISTICAL METHODS 
Since this is a pilot study designed to evaluate the initial safety of the MobiusHD in subjects 
with stag
e 2 hypertension, no formal hypothesis testing is planned.  Complete data for each 
stud
y subject will be presented in an individual patient profile consisting of all CRF fields 
and a narrative summary.  Additionally, where appropriate, descriptive statistics will be used 
to t
abulate and summarize study outcomes.  Background and demographic characteristics 
will be presented.  Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics (sample 
size, mean and standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum).  Discrete variables 
will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  Adverse events will be summarized by 
presenting the number and percentage of patients having any adverse event.  Any other 
information collected (such as severity or relationship to study device) will be listed as 
appropriate.  Any statistical tests performed to explore the data will be used only to highlight 
any interesting comparisons that may warrant further consideration.

14.0 RECORDS AND REPORTS 
14.1 R E CORDS  
The investigational site will maintain iCRF and source study records for monitoring and 
audit purposes for the latter of: 
 At least two (2) years after study completion 
 At lea st two (2) years after Sponsor receives approval from the local governing 
regulatory authority 
 For the period required by the local governing authority and reviewing IRB/EC 
Sponsor is to be advised prior to destruction of study records and notified if study records 
are moved to an off-site location for archiving. 
14.2 R E PORTS  
Investigators at participating sites are required to submit reports in conformance with all 
applicable regulations.   
15.0 DA TA MANAGEMENT 
All required data for this study will be collected on appropriate source medical records and 
study forms and entered into a secure, 21 CFR Part 11 compliant, web-based database 
(MedNet Solutions, Inc.).   
16.0 M ONITORING OF THE STUDY AND QUALITY CONTROL 
16.1 DSMB 
All SAEs will be evaluated by the DSMB for potential relationship to the investigational 
device or procedure.  All AEs will be evaluated by Sponsor for significance and relevance 
with respect to trends that may represent a previously unknown or unanticipated risk that 
may relate to the investigational device or procedure.   
16.2 D AT A COLLECTION AND MONITORING  
The Research Coordinator will collect and document data in hospital and clinic charts and 
on source document forms prepared for the study.  iCRF data will be entered in anonymous 
form into the secure web-based, password protected database.  Passwords will not be issued 
by the Sponsor until Site Initiation and database training has been conducted for all 
pe
rsonnel to whom Investigator has delegated data entry responsibilities.  Hardcopy blank 
CRFs may be reproduced as needed and may be used as source documents; these should be 
sig
ned and dated by the person collecting the data.  Completed iCRFs in final form (with 
queries resolved) may be printed and filed in hardcopy for archiving if required by local 
governing authority.  All data will be exported and stored on appropriate electronic media by 
S
ponsor and to biostatistician for analysis.   
The Sponsor will designate and train monitors to review iCRF data against source 
documents for completeness and accuracy.  Discrepant data will be queried; the electronic 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 59 
 
database will maintain audit trails of all queried and corrected data.  The Investigator is 
responsible for data integrity at the site and will review and electronically sign all 
Inclusion/Exclusion, Adverse Event, Deviation, and Terminations iCRFs.  
16.3 S O URCE DOCUMENTATI ON 
Regulations require that Investigators maintain information in the study subject’s medical 
records that corroborate data reported in the iCRFs.  In order to comply with these 
regulatory requirements, at a minimum, the following information should be maintained: 
 S ufficient medical history/physical condition of the study subject before 
involvement in the study to verify protocol entry criteria;  
 Dated and signed notes on the day of entry into the study including a statement 
regarding the consent process that was followed; 
 A log  that maps the key to subject identity for monitors and auditors showing 
subject name and assigned identification number.  This record will not be collected 
by Sponsor but should be maintained at the study site so that the appropriate 
medical records are compared to study iCRF data; 
 Da ted and signed progress notes, procedure reports, assessments, and diagnostic 
results as appropriate to each study subject visit to confirm iCRF data;  
 Investigator / site radiologist assessment of medical imaging; 
 Eva luate clinical significance of abnormal lab results; 
 R ecords following adverse events reported, results of diagnostic tests ordered, 
treatment given, and clinical outcome at resolution or stabilization;  
 Dic tated procedure report; 
 Dic tated discharge summary; 
 Note s regarding medications taken during the study; and 
 S tudy subject’s condition upon completion of, or withdrawal from, the study. 
16.4 S ITE CO MPLIANCE / DEVIATIONS  
The clinical site will be monitored routinely for adequate enrollment, timeliness of data 
submission, and compliance with the Investigational Plan and local regulations.  Consistent 
pattern of non-compliance with respect to the above will require a corrective action plan to 
be negotiated with the Investigator.  If corrective actions are not effective in resolving site 
compliance, the Sponsor may withdraw the clinical site from the study.  
Significant deviation from the protocol will be reported to the Sponsor via the Deviation 
iCRF which may be completed by the site or the Sponsor.  The Sponsor will categorize and 
report deviations (e.g., improper informed consent, inappropriate use of investigational 
device, visit outside window, assessment missed).   
In the event that the Investigator identifies a potential subject that meets all but one (1) 
Inclusion/Exclusion criterion and expresses a medical opinion regarding why it is 
appropriate to consider the patient for the study, this documentation may be submitted to the 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 60 
 
Sponsor for consideration.  If the Sponsor agrees, then a prospective deviation may be 
approved to allow the subject to be enrolled in the study. 
16.5 M O NITORING PLAN 
Study monitoring activities will include Site Initiation Visits, interim Site Monitoring Visits 
and a Site Close-Out Visit.   
• The Site Initiation Visit enables the Sponsor to thoroughly review the study protocol and 
C
RFs with the Investigator's staff, in order to assure that the Investigator understands the 
Protocol.  This includes (1) assessing required records and reports; (2) verifying the staff 
ha
s sufficient background, facilities, subject load, time, and willingness to comply with 
the study requirements; is able to submit the Protocol to the IRB/EC for review and 
a
pproval; and can maintain all correspondence, the Protocol, and all required records on 
file;
 and (3) verifying that the Principal Investigator can submit required reports, 
a
ssumes responsibility for the investigation at his or her institution (which may include 
supervision of some tasks), and has sufficient experience with the study population. 
• Site Monitoring Visits will be scheduled depending on the rate of subject e nrollment . 
During the Site Monitoring Visit, the monitor will review the CRFs of each subject in 
the study to make certain that the data provided are accurate and obtained i n the manner 
specified in the Protocol.  The subjects' clinical records will be reviewed to confirm that 
the case report form data are consistent with the Investigator’s clinical records, the 
background data and concurrent medication are documented in the CRFs, and that there 
is an accurate account of the use of the investigational device in the treatment.   The Site 
Study Binder and other study documents will be reviewed.  The subjects' clinical records 
will be reviewed to determine whether recording of ad verse events has been omitted in 
the CRFs.  If this is found to be so, the CRFs will be returned to the Investigator and 
corrected to include this information. During the course of the study, the Sponsor shall 
be available to discuss, in person or by telep hone, questions regarding adverse effects, 
removal of subjects from the study, conduct of the study, etc.  
• At the completion or termination of this study a Site Close-Out Visit will be conducted. 
17.0 DATA MANAGEMENT 
17.1 R ECORD RETENTION  
It is required that a copy of all records (e.g., informed consent documents, source 
documents, safety reports, study device dispensing record, etc.) which support CRFs for this 
study, be retained in the files of the responsible Investigator for the latter of the following: 
 At least two (2) years after study completion 
 At lea st two (2) years after Sponsor receives approval from the local governing 
regulatory authority 
 F or the period required by the local governing authority and reviewing IRB/EC. 
S
ponsor is to be advised prior to destruction of study records and notified if study records 
a
re moved to an off-site location for archiving. 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 61 
 
If the Principal Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will 
a
ccept the responsibility.  Vascular Dynamics, Inc. must be notified in writing of the name 
and address of the new custodian. 
18.0 P ROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
An amendment to the Protocol may be proposed by the Sponsor, or by an Investigator with 
prior Sponsor approval.  The amendment must be submitted to the IRB/EC and its 
implementation can take place only after IRB/EC approval. 
19.0 P ROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
The Investigator will not deviate from the Investigational Plan without the prior written 
approval of Vascular Dynamics, Inc., except in medical emergencies or in unforeseen, 
isolated instances where minor changes are made that will not increase the subject’s risk or 
affect the validity of the investigation.  In medical emergencies, prior approval for 
Investigational Plan deviations will not be required, but Vascular Dynamics, Inc. ’s clinical 
re
search personnel must be notified within five (5) days of the incident. 
All deviations from the Protocol that occur during the study will be captured and the impact 
of the Protocol deviations on the validity of the clinical study reports will be discussed in the 
final clinical study report. 
20.0 DEVICE ACC OUNTABILITY 
Complete traceability records will be kept of all investigational devices during the study.  
The MobiusHD system and the applicable accessories will be provided by Vascular 
Dynamics, Inc. The device number will be documented in subject medical records, CRFs 
and in the center’s logs. 
Each Investigator will be responsible for the safe storage with restricted access of the 
investigational materials in their possession, to prevent use of investigational materials by 
any persons not participating in the study. 
After completion of the study, all unused investigational devices must be returned in thei r 
original packaging to Vascular Dynamics, Inc., 2134 Old Middlefield Way, Suite J, 
Mountain View, CA  94043. 
All Investigators will be responsible for using the investigational device according to the 
IFU and Protocol and for maintaining product inventory and records. 
21.0 INF ORMED CONSENT PROCESS 
Informed consent shall be obtained in writing from each study subject or legal guardian and 
the process shall be documented before any procedure specific to the clinical investigation is 
applied to the subject. 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 62 
 
The subject will be asked to read the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and to sign the form to 
indicate consent to participate in the study.  
The research nature of the study will be explained carefully to the subject.  The scope and 
aims of the research will be described together with known or foreseeable benefits, risks and 
discomforts that subjects may experience.  Appropriate alternative treatments will be 
discussed so that the subject may determine whether or not he or she wishes to participate in 
the study.  The subject must understand that throughout the study his or her participation 
re
mains voluntary and protected by the Declaration of Helsinki.  The Investigator is 
responsible for obtaining written (or witnessed) informed consent from potential subjects 
prior to study entry.  Subjects will be given time to read the ICF consent and ask any 
que
stions before being asked to sign the form.  The ICF (approved by the Sponsor and the 
IRB/EC) must be signed and dated by the subject and the Investigator.  The Investigator will 
retain the original signed ICF, give one copy to the subject, and send a second copy to the 
referring Investigator (if applicable).  
Subjects may withdraw their consent to participate in the study at any time without 
prejudice.  The Investigator may withdraw a subject if, in his or her clinical judgment, it is 
in the best interest of the subject, or if the subject cannot comply with the protocol.  
Attempts should be made to complete any examinations and the Sponsor must be notified of 
all withdrawals.  
Should a Protocol amendment be made, the subject's consent form may be revised to reflect 
the changes of the Protocol.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that an 
amended ICF is approved or reviewed by the IRB/EC, and that it is signed by all subjects 
subsequently entered in the study, and those currently in the study, if they are affected by the 
amendment.  
If new information becomes available that could significantly affect a subject's future health 
and medical care, the information shall be provided to the subject in written form.  If 
re
levant, all affected subjects shall be asked to confirm their continuing informed consent in 
writing. 
22.0 P REMATURE STUDY TERMINATION 
A subject should be removed from the study whenever considered necessary for his or her 
welfare or when a subject expresses a desire to withdraw from the study.  Non-compliance 
with the Protocol, the occurrence of a SAE or any medical condition that, in the opinion of 
the Investigator, warrants discontinuation from the study for the safety of the subject, may 
necessitate discontinuing a subject.  If a subject is discontinued, the reason must be entered 
on the CRF and signed by the Investigator. In case of any questionable situation, the study 
monitor or Vascular Dynamics, Inc. personnel should be consulted.  When a subject is 
removed from the study as a result of SAE, a final physical examination must be performed.  
Subjects removed from the study because of an AE will be followed-up until the adverse 
event has been resolved. 
In the case that the occurrence of AEs is greater than anticipated, the clinical investigation 
will be suspended; in such a case, a safety committee will be arranged to decide if the study 
IDE  PROTOCOL – CRD0152  OCTOBER 2014  
VASCULAR DYNAMICS,  INC. MOBIUSHD™    PAGE 63 
 
could be continued. The IRB/EC will be notified and the results of the safety committee 
discussions will be brought to the IRB/EC for review and decision. 
Vascular Dynamics, Inc. reserves the right to discontinue any study at any time for 
administrative reasons including, but not limited to, a decision to discontinue further clinical 
investigation of the device, improper conduct of the study by the Investigator, and inability 
to obtain the number of subjects required by the Protocol.  Reimbursements for reasonable 
expenses will be made if such an action is necessary. 
23.0 REG ULATORY AND HEALTH AUTHORITY AUDITS 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European authorities, and the local state 
he
alth authorities may request access to all study records, including source documents, for 
inspection.  The Investigator and hospital staff are requested to cooperate with these audits.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any health authority audit as soon as notification 
of such audit is made.  A representative or designee of the Sponsor may also conduct similar 
audits and may be present during health authority audit. 
24.0 S UBJECT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
The subject’s name and personal data will remain confidential and will not be published in 
any way.  However, the Sponsor’s monitor or representative and regulatory representatives, 
auditors and inspectors may have access to medical files in order to verify authenticity of 
data collected.

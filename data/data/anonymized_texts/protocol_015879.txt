Study of the ADAM17 Inhibitor INCB7839 Combined With Rituximab After 
Auto logous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) For Patients With 
Diffuse Large B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (DLBCL) 
Study 
Design:  This is a single institution phase I/II study using an ADAM17 inhibitor (INCB7839) with 
rituximab as consolidation therapy after an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for 
patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study consists of two phases.  The dose finding phase is a modified version of a phase I trial and the extended phase is a modified version of a phase II trial.  
 Rituximab (375 mg/m
2) is given at 3 time points post -transplant - the 1st shortly after the day 28 
(but as late as day 75), with the 2nd and 3rd doses 1 and 7 weeks later . The oral ADAM 17 
inhibitor INCB7839 is taken twice daily at the assigned dose for 90 days beginning at the time 
of 2nd rituximab .    
 The primary goal of the dose finding phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCB7839. Up to three dose levels will be tested (100 mg bid, 200 mg bid, and 300 mg bid) . 
As the 300 mg bid has been proven safe in the non- transplant setting, dose escalation follow s 
a Fast- Track Design with 1 patient enrolled per dose level unless a grade 2 or greater 
treatment emergent event occurs  within the 1
st 14 days of INCB 7839.  At that point, dose 
escalation converts to a standard 3+3 design and two  additional patients  are enrolled at the 
current  dose level. If dose level 3 is completed without dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the 1st 3 
patients, an additional 3 patients  will be enrolled at this  level (without the staggering required 
by the DLT rules) prior to moving to the phase II component.    
 Once the phase I dose escalation is completed, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD (or dose level 3, if no DLT) to obtain a more detailed toxicity profile as well as a preliminary estimate of progression free survival at 6 months post -transplant.  
 
Primary 
Objective:  Phase  I Dose Finding:   To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCB7839 when 
given in combination with rituximab as consolidation therapy after an autologous hematopoietic 
cell transplant (HCT) for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  
Phase II Extension :  To establish a preliminary estimate of  progression free survival ( PFS) at 
6 months post autologous HCT while gaining a more detailed toxicity profile of INCB7839 when administered with rituximab as consolidation therapy   
Secondary 
Objectives:  • To evaluate the safet y and tolerability of INCB7839 in combination with rituximab  
• To determine incidence of serious adverse events  
• To evaluate 1 year disease- free survival  
• To evaluate 1 year overall survival  
• To determine time to relapse/progression 
 
Correlative 
Objectives:  • To compare expression of CD16 and CD62L on natural killer (NK) cells and NK cells function 
after INCB7839 plus rituximab versus  rituximab only and the baseline.  
• To correlate clinical response with NK frequencies, phenotype, and function  
 
Patient 
Population: Patients 1 8 years and older with DB LCL who underwent an autologous HCT and are in 
remission (CR, PR) or have stable disease at the day 28 post -transplant reassessment  
 
Enrollment:  Phase I Dose Finding :  6 to 18 patients  (Enrollment completed March 2016)  
Phase II Extension:  enroll an additional 12 patients at the phase I MTD

2 Background  
2.1 Enhancing Cure Rate Of DLBCL After Autologous Hematopoietic Cell 
Transplant  
Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma (NHL) is the second most common hematologic 
malignancy. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) , the most common 
lymphoma subtype (30- 40%), is an aggressive cancer that is rapidly fatal 
unless promptly treated. In the US, approximately 440,000 patients were 
treated for NHL in 2010 (SEER.gov). Patients with DLBCL experience 
frequent relapse and estim ated 5- year survival rate is less than 50%.1, 2 
Standard treatment includes the use of high- dose chemotherapy with 
autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients with 
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 9 of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 chemosensitive recurrence. Although most patients initially achieve a 
remission, treatment fails for most patients. The relapse incidence is 
particularly high during the first 6 months after transplant3  (Figure 1 ).  There 
is an urgent need to develop well -tolerated and effective therapies to sustain 
remission in DLBCL. In this proposal, we hypothesize that chemoresistant 
lymphoma cells surviving post autologous 
transplantation retain sensitivity to 
cellular immune -mediated killing. This 
hypothesis is supported by clinical evidence that human natural killer (NK) and T cells can be used to treat 
cancer.
4,5 NK cells (defined as CD3-
CD56+) are capable of killing virally 
infected or transformed cells without prior sensitization; however, autologous 
NK cells ha ve to be activated to kill.  Proposed 
trial pr esents the novel approach of combining 
monoclonal antibody therapy with the newly 
discovered strategy of augmenting both NK cell function and tumor homing. 
The treatment goal is to eliminate chemoresistant lymphoma cells after autologous transplantation.  
2.2 Rituximab Use After Autologous Transplantation In DLBCL  
Rituximab’s key anti -cancer mechanism of action is mediated through 
FcγRIII (CD16) on NK cells; this receptor is by far the most potent NK 
activating receptor.
6 Rituximab crosslinks CD16 and triggers vigorous 
production of cytokines and NK cell degranulation, leading to target cell 
killing (a process referred to as antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity; 
ADCC). Targeting CD20 on lymphoma cells with rituximab dramatically 
improves initial remission rates (by 10- 20%), but resistance is common. The 
international CORAL study tested the impact of maintenance rituximab after autografting by evaluating DLBCL patients treated with rituximab or 
controls.
6 The 4- year event -free survival rates were identical in the two 
groups (52% and 53%). The limitations of rituximab efficacy may be due to 
poor NK cell function post transplantation. The mechanism of rituximab resistance to be tested in this study presents a new therapeutic opportunity. 
We hypothesize that targeting CD16 with the ADAM17 inhibitor may 
potently improve rituximab efficacy after autologous transplantation.

February 12, 2018  Page 10  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 2.3 Inhibition of ADAM17 Enhances NK Cell Function   
NK cells contain a germ line encoded set of receptors governing both their 
development and function. These receptors are either activating or 
inhibitory. Integration of downstream signaling pathways dictates how an 
NK cell will respond when interacting with i ts target. The most notable 
inhibitory receptors are the killer -immunoglobulin like (KIR) receptors which 
recognize the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I proteins (HLA -A, -B, 
and –C). The most potent NK activating receptor is FcRγ IIIA (CD16), 
present on most peripheral blood NK cells and all CD56dim NK cells. CD16 
mediates ADCC upon recognition of antibody -coated tumor cells, leading to 
target elimination through direct killing and cytokine production. Other 
activating receptors include NKG2D, which recognize “stress ligands” 
expressed on tumor cells. We recently identified a novel mechanism by which activated NK cells rapidly downregulate CD16.
7  Loss of CD16 is an 
enzymatically regulated process limiting ADCC. Importantly, our group 
recently discovered that CD16 is clipped by a desintegrin and 
metalloproteinase- 17 (ADAM17). We showed that inhibition of ADAM17 
with the small,  orally available molecule INCB 7839 consistently increased 
the killing of rituximab -coated lymphoma cells by preserving CD16 on NK 
cells. For the first time our data identified a novel target, ADAM17, that 
modifies the potency of monoclonal antibodies inducing ADCC. Importantly, the ADAM family enzymes including ADAM17 and ADAM10 are highly expres sed in lymphoma tumor stroma.
8 Additionally, others showed that 
lymphoma- associated stress ligands (ULBP3, MIC A, MIC B, and B7- H6) 
capable of activating NK cells are also ADAM17 targets9 
ADAM17 clips CD16 and L -selectin from NK cells and limits NK cell 
function.  The anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab interacts with 
FcRIIIуa/CD16 on NK cells to induce ADCC. Upon antibody recognition, this 
activating NK cell receptor induces potent signals that result in cytokine production (IFNγ and TNFα) and cell 
cytotoxicit y
7,9 CD16 is rapidly down-
regulated when the NK cell is activated 
by various triggers (PMA, cytokines IL12+IL18, and HLA -class I negative 
cell target K562; Figure  2). This 
process, referred to as  ectodomain 
clipping, is a proteolytic event that occurs at an extracellular site proximal 
to the plasma membrane resulting in

CD16 and the homing molecule L- selectin (CD62L) upon NK cell 
activation.
7  
CD16 expression is decreased after treatment with rituximab in vivo . 
In a control experiment ( Figure  3, top panel ), we incubated CD56dim NK 
cells with rituximab (10 μg/ml) in vitro and showed that it does not block CD16 binding. We then tested peripheral blood from patients with DLBCL before and after 
the therapy with rituximab 
(375mg/m
2 x 4 doses). At 
baseline CD56dim NK cells 
expressed high levels of 
CD16. After rituximab therapy, 
a large proportion of blood NK cells (46%) downregulated CD16 and became CD16 
negative ( Figure  3, lower 
panel ) demonstrating that 
rituximab treatment doses clip CD16 off NK cells in vivo . 
2.4 
Lymphoma-A ssociated Stress Ligands  
Others showed that ADAM family enzymes including ADAM10 and ADAM17 are expressed in lymphoma tumor stroma. Furthermore 
lymphoma- associated stress ligands (such as ULB, MIC A, MIC B and B7-
H6) are also ADAM17 protease targets.
9 The significance of these findings 
is that therapeutic blockade of ADAM10 and ADAM17  seems promising for 
cancer treatment by targeting immune escape of tumors.  
2.5 INCB7839 Is An Orally Bioavailable Small Molecule Selective 
Inhibitor Of ADAM17 /ADAM10  
INCB 7839 was recently developed by Incyte as an inhibitor of HER2 (also 
an ADAM17 target). The drug was tested in phase 1 studies in over 100 
patients. Results of these studies are summarized in below .

February 12, 2018  Page 12  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 ADAM17 inhibitor INCB7839 plus rituximab augments NK cel l 
cytokine production and cytotoxicity in vitro7 
 We recently demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of ADAM17 
enhanced CD16- mediated NK cell function by preserving CD16 on the NK 
cell surface and thus increased the killing of rituximab- coated lymphoma 
cells.  In in -vitro assays, we purified human NK cells and incubated them 
with media alone, the B cell 
lymphoma line Raji, or Raji cells pre -incubated with 10 
mg/mL rituximab. Expression 
of CD16, CD62 L (panel A), 
and intracellular IFNγ and 
TNFα (panel B) were 
measured after 5 hours 
(Figure  4). Inhibition of 
ADAM17 significantly 
attenuated clipping of both CD16 and CD62L from NK 
cells after incubation with 
rituximab -coated Raji cells ( Figure A ). In addition, ADAM17 inhibition 
significantly increased intracellular levels of IFN -g and TNF -a (Figure B ).  
 Clinical Safety  
Phase 1 studies using INCB7839  
INCB 7839 is methyl (6S,7S) -7-[(hydroxyamino) carbonyl] -6-[(4-
phenylpiperazin-1- yl)carbonyl] -5-azaspiro[2,5]octane-5- Carboxylate). 
INCB 7839 is an orally bioavailable selective small molecule inhibitor of 
ADAM17/ADAM10 developed by Incyte (Wilmington, DE). It prevents 
clipping of the tumor ligands HER2 and ErbB by inhibiting the ADAM17 
protease in a dose- dependent manner. The half -life of dosing with the 
extended release tablet is 10- 14 hours. Single and multiple- dose studies 
have been completed with INCB7839 in healthy volunteers. Adverse events 
were mild and self -limiting. INCB7839 (dosed 100- 500mg twice a day; bid) 
was tested in an open label, dose- escalation, phase 1 study for solid 
tumors. A dose of 500mg bid was determined to be the maximum tolerated 
dose. The dose- limiting toxicity was deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with a 
total of 9 thrombotic  events (in 41 patient months ); however, nearly all 
patients had added thrombotic risk factors of advanced malignancy. However, there was not a clear relationship between the frequency of thrombosis and the dose administered.  In patient without prophylaxis ( low Figure 4

February 12, 2018  Page 13  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 dose ASA) the risk of DVT was 25%. The most recent phase 1 study 
combined INCB7839 (100- 300mg bid) with the anti -HER- 2 monoclonal 
antibody trastuzumab in 46 patients with previously untreated metastatic 
HER2+ breast cancer. 13 (poster in Appendix  III)  The highest dose 
administered was 300mg bid, and side effects were modest. The most 
reported events (all causes) occurring in ≥ 10% of patients were: vomiting, 
pyrexia, anorexia, pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, asthenia, headache, cough, 
arthralgia, vascular events, abdominal pain, and back pain. Most were not 
serious.   The incidence of DVT was 10%, and thus, prophylactic measures 
are warranted to reduce the risk of thrombosis associated with INCB7839.  
 
CD16 plasma levels before and after therapy with INCB007839. We 
tested plasma levels of soluble CD16 in 11 patients enrolled to the trastuzumab+INCB7839 clinical trial by ELISA.  Soluble CD16 levels were 
significantly 
reduced after therapy with 
INCB7839  
(Figure  5).

2.6 NK Cells Rapidly Develop After Autologous HCT And Express CD16  
The recovery of NK cells after 
autologous HCT is vigorous and prompt.  Four weeks after HCT, 
NK cells represent about 15- 45% 
of lymphocytes ( Figure  6) and 
are composed almost exclusively 
of CD56
dim NK cells 
characterized by CD16 expression. CD16 expression on CD56
dim NK cells is 65 -70% at all 
time-points after transplant, however NK function is often  decreased.

February 12, 2018  Page 14  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 2.7 NK Cell Therapy Trial At University of Minnesota  
We have tested various strategies to enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells to 
treat patients with lymphoma. We tested outpatient low -dose IL2 based 
immunotherapy in three clinical trials encompassing >75 patients to date.(9)  Patients undergoing autologous HCT therapy including NHL patients were 
subsequently enrolled to a clinical trial combining daily subcutaneous IL2 
administration with infusion of autologous NK cells incubated ex vivo with IL-2 and combinations of IL- 2 with Rituximab post autologous HCT.
5,11,12  
There was significant clinical benefit of these therapies. More recently, we 
used allogeneic donor derived NK cells followed by IL- 2 to treat refractory 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients (12) We treated 12 patients on this 
regimen and observed clinical remission in 40%, however the cost and complexities of production of NK cell product limited the large scale use.
10  
This study builds on the established NK cell therapy program at University  
of Minnesota and explores novel platform to augment the activity of autologous NK cells with the use of the ADAM17 inhibitor  INCB7839 .   
3 Summary and Rationale  
Our hypothesis  is that the ADAM17 inhibitor INCB7839 will enhance the efficacy 
of rituximab -medi ated autologous NK cell killing, resulting in a 20% improvement 
in progression free survival  in DLBCL patients treated with autologous HCT .  
3.1 INCB7839 Dose Rationale  
In this dose escalation plan, three dose levels of INCB7839  will be tested 
(100 mg bid, 200 mg bid, and 300 mg bid). The previous INCB7839 plus 
trastuzumab study showed that the 300 mg bid dose was safe; however this 
was in a non- transplant setting. Therefore this study will proceed cautiously, 
starting with a 100 mg dose but using a fast track design to minimize the 
number of patients exposed to a potentially non- therapeutic dose. With the 
fast-track design, one patient will be enrolled per dose level until a grade 2 
or greater treatment emergent toxicity is encountered. At that point, dose 
esca lation will convert to a 3+3 design and three additional patients will 
enroll at the current dose level. Unless there is an interaction with the milieu seen in the post -transplant setting, it is expected all 3 dose levels will be 
completed without DLT and the 300 mg bid dose level will move to the 
phase II.

February 12, 2018  Page 15  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 4 Study Design  
This is a single institution phase I/II study using an ADAM17 inhibitor (INCB7839) 
with rituximab as consolidation  therapy after an autologous hematopoietic  cell 
transplant (HCT) for patients with DLBCL. The study consists of two phases.  The 
dose finding phase is a modified version of a phase I trial and the extended phase is a modified version of a phase II trial.  
The study is open to persons 18 years and older who are in a complete response, 
partial response or have stable disease at their 28 days post -transplant 
reassessment. Three doses of rituximab  (375 mg/m2) will be given post -transplant . 
The f irst dose will be given at  the day 28 post -transplant  follow -up (but permitted 
through day 75), the 2nd dose 1 week later, and the 3rd dose 7 weeks after the 
1st. The oral ADAM 17 inhibitor INCB7839 at the assigned dose will be taken twice 
daily for 90 days  (12 weeks). The 1st dose will be taken the morning of the 2nd 
rituximab dose after the research related labs are drawn.   
The primary goal of the dose finding phase is to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of INCB7839. Up to three dose levels of INCB7839 will be tested (100 
mg bid, 200 mg bid, and 300 mg bid). As the 300 mg bid has  been proven safe in 
the non- transplant setting, dose escalation will follow a Fast -Track Design with 1 
patient enrolled per dose level until a grade 2 or greater treatment emergent 
adverse event  occurs. A treatment emergent adverse event is any event not 
present prior to the initiation of the treatment (INCB7839) or any event already 
present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatment.  At that point, dose escalation will convert to a standard 3+3 design wi th 
two additional patients enrolled at the same dose level.  If dose level 3 is completed 
without dose limiting toxicity ( DLT) in the 1st 3 patients, an additional 3 patients 
will be enrolled at this level (without the staggering required by the DLT rules)  prior 
to moving to the phase II component.  DLT is defined in section 7.2.2 of the 
protocol.  
Once the phase I dose escalation is completed, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD (or dose level 300mg bid, if no DLT) to obtain a more detailed  
toxicity profile as well as a preliminary estimate of progression free survival  at 6 
months post -transplant.  Persons receiving less than 10 weeks of INCB7839 and/or 
fewer than 2 doses of rituximab will be replaced for the primary endpoint analysis.  
Patien ts will be followed for 1 year from transplant for  progression free survival 
(PFS)  and overall survival (OS).

February 12, 2018  Page 18  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 6 Patient Screening and Enrollment /INCB7839 Dose Level 
Assignment  
Written consent must be obtained prior to the performance of any research related 
tests or procedures. Consent is usually obtained before final eligibility is 
determined.  
Enrollment in the study and the 1st dose of rituximab may occur up to day 75 post -
transplant.  
6.1 Consent and Study Screening in OnCore  
Any patient who has been consented is to be entered  in OnCore by the 
Primary Clinical Research Coordinator (PCRC) or designee. If a patient is 
consented, but not enrolled, the patient’s record is updated in OnCore as a 
screen failure and reason for exclusion recorded.   
6.2 Study Enrollment  
To be eligible for study enrollment, the patient must sign the treatment 
consent and meet each of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion on the eligibility checklist (Appendix I) based on the eligibility assessment documented in the patient’s medical record.  
The Pr imary Clinical Research Coordinator (PCRC) or designee will assign 
the study treatment arm and add the on -treatment date to complete 
enrollment.  
6.3 INCB7839  Dose Level Assignment  
The PCRC or designee will assign each patient to the current dose level of 
INCB7 839 no later than the day of the 2
nd rituximab dose.  
In March 2016, enrollment to the phase I dose escalation component was 
completed with INCB7839 at 300 mg twice a day deemed the phase II dose.  
6.4 Patients Who Are Registered and Do Not Receive Study Treatm ent 
If a patient is registered to the study, and is later found not able to receive 
the 1
st dose of rituximab by day 75 post -transplant , for whatever reason, the 
patient will be removed from study and treated at the physician’s discretion. The PCRC or designee will update OnCore of the patient’s non- treatment 
status and notify the Principal Investigator. Study data will be collected until 
the time the patient is off study. The reason for removal from study will be 
clearly in OnCore. The patient will  be replaced to complete enrollment .

February 12, 2018  Page 19  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 7 Treatment Plan  
The first dose of rituximab will be considered study week 1 regardless of whether 
it is given at post -transplant day 28 or as late as post -transplant day 75. Routine 
post-transplant follow -up will continue as planned, independent of this study , 
although during active treatment study visits will be scheduled to coincide with 
transplant related visits (i.e. day 60, 100). F ollow -up time points for disease and 
survival status will remain linked with a p ost-transplant visit  at 6 and 12 months 
regardless of when the 1st dose of rituximab in given.  
7.1 Rituximab  
Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV will be administered per institutional guidelines at 
the following time points:  
• On (or shortly after) the day 28 post -transplan t re-assessment, but 
no later than post -transplant day 60  
• 1 week (+/ - 3 days) after the 1st dose  
• 7 weeks (+/ - 7 days) after the 1st dose  
The first dose will be infused over 6 hours. Infusion should start at 50 mg/h our and increase by 50 mg/hour every 30 mi nutes as tolerated to a 
maximal infusion rate at 400 mg/hour. If the infusion is well tolerated, the 
next two doses at 1 and 7 weeks may  be administered at 100 mg/hour with 
100 mg/hour increments at 30 minutes intervals up to 400 mg/hour.     
Premedication : Acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine  (e.g. 
Benadryl) 25 mg PO 30 minutes before each infusion.  
Persons receiving fewer than 2 doses of rituximab will be considered 
unevaluable and replaced.  
7.2 INCB7839  
Patients will begin INCB7839 orally at the assigned dose bid the morning of 
the 2nd rituximab dose  and after the research related blood samples are 
collected.  In April 2016 the study moved to the phase II component with the 
INCB7839 dose set at 300 mg bid. Dose modifications in individual patients are permitted per section 7.2.3.   
The tablets are taken twice daily, morning and night,  approximately 12 
hours apart for 90 days (+/ - 3 days) with food.    
If the morning or evening dose is missed by more than 4 hours, the patient  
will skip that dose and take the next scheduled dose at the usual time.  
Skipped doses will not be made up.  
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 20  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 The patient  will be provided with a daily drug log to record times of 
administration, side effects, and missed doses.  The patient will be 
instruct ed to bring the drug log and study drug bottles (including any 
empties) to each appointment for reconcilement.   
No pre- medications are recommended with the INCB7839 dosing, although 
side effects may be treated as needed (i.e. acetaminophen for headache, 
diphenhydramine for nausea).  
7.2.1  Supportive Care  
In order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical 
conditions, investigator discretion may be used in the prescribing of all 
supportive care drug therapy (i.e. anti-emetics, anti-pyretics ).  
DVT prophylaxis  (all patients):   On the same day that INCB7839 dosing 
is started, all patients will begin taking aspirin tablet (325 mg) once a day or 
on anticoagulant therapy (e.g. warfarin, low-molecular -weight heparin 
(LMWH)  for the duration of INCB7839 administration and for 1 week 
afterwards as prophylactic measure to reduce the risk of thrombosis.    
In the event of “excessive DVT” defined as >20% thrombotic events in 
patients taking aspirin, all patients (current and future) will be discontinued 
from aspirin and begin anti -coagulation therapy (e.g. warfarin or LMWH at 
prophylactic dose) at the time of their next scheduled appointment.  Patients within 1 week of discontinuing INCB7839 may continue aspirin as planned.  
Serum D -dimer leve ls will be checked prior to the 1
st dose of rituximab , at 
Day 22, and at the final study visit  effective with the April 2016 protocol 
revision .  The frequency was decreased from the phase I monitoring 
schedule as  abnormalities  were not seen .  If D-dimer level increase > 3-fold, 
than the patient will be considered at high risk of developing DVT/PET and will be switched to warfarin or LMWH for anticoagulation .  
7.2.2  INCB7839 Dose Level Assignment  
Dose Finding Phase  (COMPLETED MARCH 2016)  
INCB7839  dose level assignment will occur at the time of study registration 
based on the following Dose Level cohorts:  
 
  Dose 
Level  INCB7839 Dose  
(taken twice daily)  Minimum # of 
Patients*  
1 100 mg  1 
2 200 mg  1

February 12, 2018  Page 21  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 Initially the Fast Track Design of 1 patient per dose level will be used until 
a grade 2 or greater treatment emergent adverse event  is experienced. At 
that point, three additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level 
and a standard dose escalation design will be used per section 13.2.  
Dose Limiting Toxicity  is defined as  any of the following within the 1st 14 
days of INCB7839  dosing : 
• any grade 3 or greater non- hematologic, non- infectious toxicity 
including thromboembolic complications  
• selected hematologic toxicity  
o grade 4 neutropenia lasting for ≥ 7 days  
o febrile neutropenia  
o grade 4 thrombocytopenia last ing for ≥ 7 days despite dosing 
delay  
o grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding  
• inability to complete at least 20 doses of twice daily IN CB7839 
therapy within the 1st 14 days due to treatment related toxicity  
Dose escalation to the next level cannot proceed until the following 
conditions are met:  
• At least 14 days has passed since the last patient within a dose level 
began INCB7839  
• The maxi mum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been exceeded  
If dose level 3 is reached without DLT in the 1st 3 patients, an additional 3 
patients (for a total of 6) will be enrolled without the 14 day waiting period. 
Phase II Extension  (OPENED TO ENROLLMENT APRIL 2016)  
In March 2016 INCB7839 at 300 mg bid was declared the phase II dose 
level. An additional 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD established 
during the phase I component adhering to the early stopping rules found in section 13.4.    
7.2.3  INCB7839 Dose Modification/Interruptions  
Refer to section 7.2.1 for prevention and management of thromboembolic 
complications.  
With activation of the Phase II extension in April 2016, both d ose 
reductions  and dose interruptions  are permitted in individual patients  at the 
discretion of the treating physician if the 300 mg bid dose is not well 
tolerated.   
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 22  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 Dose reductions will follow the phase I dose levels (i .e. 300 mg bid reduced 
200 mg bid reduced 100 mg bid).   
Dose interruptions of up to 14 days are permitted, restarting with or without 
a dose reduction.   
General Guidelines:  
Grade 1 and 2 adverse events will be treated as medically appropriate and 
the INCB7839 dose may be reduced by one phase I dose level (i .e. 300 mg 
bid may  be reduced to 200 mg bid) . 
INCB7839 administration should be interrupted in the event of a CTCAE v4 
grade 3 or 4 treatment related toxicity  despite best medical support, until 
resolution to grade 1 or better. The patient may be restarted on INCB7839 at 1 dose level  lower  (i.e. 300 mg reduced to 200 mg bid).   
Skipped doses will not be made up.  
In general a patient would be taken off treatment if any of the following 
occurs: 
• a treatment break is for more than 14 days  
• the patient is unable to tolerate INCB7839 at 100 mg bid  
• if the toxicity recurs (≥ grade 3) despite a dose reduction  
Note:  any treatment related grade 4 or 5 event may count toward the 
study’s early stopping rules per section 13.5.  
7.3 Duration of INCB7839  
Patients will take INCB7839 twice a day beginning with the 2nd dose of 
rituximab and continuing for 90 days (+/ - 3 days) unless:  
• consent is withdrawn 
• patient refuses INCB 7839 or is non- compliant  
• more than 14 days pass without dosing (regardless of reason) , the 
patient is unable tolerate INCB7839 at the100 mg bid  level or a 
toxicity recurs (≥ grade 3) after a dose reduction  
• disease progression  
• unacceptable toxicity  
• in the treating physician’s medical judgment, continuing with INCB7839  is not in the best interest of the patient’s health or well -
being

February 12, 2018  Page 23  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 During the extension phase, patients receiving less than 10 weeks of 
INCB 7839 or less than 2 doses of rituximab for reasons other than toxicity 
will be replaced.  
7.4 Duration of Study Participation  
Active study participation will end 1 week after the last dose of INCB 7839 
unless there is ongoing treatment related toxicity, which will be treated as medically appropriate with follow -up until toxicity resolves to grade 1 or 
better or is stable for 3 months.  
Patients will be seen at 6, 9 and 12 months post -transplant as part of the 
standard of care follow -up with information regarding disease status and 
survival recorded for this study unless one of the following occurs:  
• consent is withdrawn  
• patient is unevaluable – if a patient is not evaluable, follow only until 
the resolution or stabilization of treatment related toxicity  
8 Schedule of Patient Activities  
For patient convenience and unnecessary clinic visits; some flexibility is permitted in scheduling study related visits and activities. Through the day 22 visit a window of ± 3 days is permitted. A window of ± 7 days is permitted for the 3
rd dose of 
rituximab. After day 22, visits will coordinate with BMT anniversary visits whenever 
feasible ; however a window of ± 7 days is permitted for any study visits not linked

February 12, 2018  Page 25  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 All samples go to the Masonic Cancer Center’s Translational Therapy Lab 
(TTL).  
 
Research sample collection is tied to the clinical care schedule of events 
and their associated window for performance. Therefore, if a clinical time point does not occur or is altered, the research related time point will be adjusted (or eliminated) as ap propriate.  
 
It is recognized that with novel therapies as used in this study, the timing of 
protocol directed research samples may miss important patient specific events.  For this reason, up to 3 extra samples for a total of 180 ml of blood 
may be drawn at additional time points that are not specified above.   
9 Study Drugs  
9.1 INCB7839 
Classification:  ADAM Inhibitor  
Dosage and Administration Schedule:  For the purposes of the study, 
INCB7839 will be administered twice daily for 90 days beginning with the 
2nd dose of rituximab  
Dose Forms and Strengths:  100 mg tablets  
Availability:   For the purposes of this study INCB7839 will be provided by 
the manufacturing, Incyte Corporation packaged in HDPE bottles.  All 
bottles of Incyte investigational product contain the following language:  
“Caution:  New Drug —Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use”.   
INCB7839 Expected Side Effects:  In healthy volunteer studies, mild 
nausea, headache, dizziness, and tinnitus have been noted which may 
possibly be due to administration of INCB7839. One patient with a history 
of hot flashes experienced a hot flash of moderate intensity. One subject  
experienced a SAE of DVT that was possibly related to drug exposure; this 
patient was  subsequently found to have a deficiency of antithrombin- III. 
In studies of cancer patients, INCB7839 has generally shown to be tolerated 
at doses  up to 500 mg bid.  Adverse events most frequently occurring in 
patients receiving  INCB7839 include nausea or vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, 
dyspnea, constipation,  pyrexia, cough, asthenia, and headache.  
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 26  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 Thrombotic events, primarily venous thromboses, have been observed at a 
higher than expected rate for the study population; thrombosis is defined as 
the dose- limiting toxicity.  Investigators should discuss the risk with their 
patients, and maintain a high level of vigilance for signs of p ossible 
thromboembolism.  Prophylactic anticoagulation is used as a precaution; it 
is not currently known how  effective these measures are in reducing the risk 
of thromboembolism.  
Please refer to the Investigator Brochure for additional information.  
Contraindications : INCB7839 is contraindicated in subjects with clinically 
significant hypersensitivity to any component of its formulation.  
9.2 Rituximab  
Trade name:  Rituxan  
Classification:  Monoclonal Antibody, Antineoplastic Agent  
Category:   Biological Response Modifier Agent  
Dosage and Administration Schedule:  For the purposes of the study, 
Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV administered per institutional guidelines within 4 
weeks of the day 28 post -transplant re- assessment and again 2 and 8 
weeks lat er. 
Dose Forms and Strengths:  100 mg/10 mL and 500 mg/50 mL solution 
in a single -use vial

February 12, 2018  Page 27  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 10 Adverse Event Reporting 
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE). A copy of the CTCAE can 
be downloaded from the CTEP home page (
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_
40). 
10.1 Definitions  
Note:  throughout this section the generic term “drug” refers to the 
INCB783 9 and rituximab. 
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 312.32 (21CFR312.32(a)).  
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction:   Any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event:  Any event not present prior to the 
initiation of the treatment or any event already present that worsens in either 
intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatment.   A treatment 
emergent AE refers to an event temporally related to the study treatment  
regardless of  the causality assessment by the investigator.  
Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life -Threatening Suspected 
Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigat or or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death.  
Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction:   An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in 
the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse experience  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 28  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
If either the IND sponsor or the investigator believes the event is life-
threatening or serious, the event must be evaluated by the sponsor for expedited reporting (21CRF 312.32(a)).  
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application, as amended.  Thus, adverse events that occur as part of the disease process or underlying medical conditions are considered 
unexpected; however, they will not be reportable per section 10.3. 
Unanticipated (unexpected) problems/events  as defined by the 
University Of Minnesota IRB are those that are not already described as 
potential risks in the consent form, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure 
or not part of an underlying disease.  
Note:   The major discord between the FDA and IRB de finitions is whether 
or not the underlying disease is included when considering expectedness.  
The following definitions are from the Masonic Cancer Center’s Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP) Deviation Reporting:  
 
Major Deviation:  A deviation or violation that impacts the risks and benefits 
of the research; may impact subject safety, affect the integrity of research data and/or affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the research. Deviations that place a subject at risk, but do not result in harm are 
considered to be major deviations.  
 
Minor Deviation:  A deviation or violation that does not impact subject safety, 
compromise the integrity of research data and/or affect a subject’s 
willingness to participate in the research.  
Expedited (Rapid) Reporting:  Certain events may require rapid 
notification to entities providing patient safety oversight (e.g. IRB, FDA) as 
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 29  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 detailed in section 10.3. For the IRB this is 5 business  days. For studies 
under an IND, it is 7 or 15 calendar days.  
10.2 Adverse Event Documentation 
For the purposes of this study adverse event monitoring will begin with the 
1st dose of rituximab. The adverse events associated with rituximab in the 
post-transplant setting are well characterized and expected events will not 
be documented. However, any event felt at least possibly related to 
rituximab and meets the criteria for expedited report ing per section 10.3 will 
be documented.  
  Adverse event documentation for INCB7839 will begin with the 1
st dose.   
Events will be recorded onto study specific case report forms based on the 
following table:  
Relation to 
INCB7839  Grade 1  Grade 2  Grade 3  Grade 4 and 5  
Expected or 
Unexpected  Expected  Unexpected  Expected  Unexpected  Expected or 
Unexpected  
Unrelated  Not required  Not required  Not required  Not required  Required  Required  
Possible 
Probable Definite 
Unlikely  Not required  Required  Required  Required  Required  Required  
 
After the final treatment visit approximately 1 week after the discontinuation 
of INCB 7839 formal AE documentation will end, however; the investigator 
must report upon knowledge any study treatment related event meeting the 
criteria for expedited reporting in section 10.3 or events related to the study 
stopping rules . 
During the Fast -Track Desi gn:  any grade 2 or greater treatment emergent 
adverse event during the 1st 14 days of INCB7839  
Dose Limiting Toxicity:   The following events within the 1st 14 days of 
INCB7839 meet the definition of dose limiting toxicity during the dose 
escalation phase component and must be reported to the MCC Study 
Coordinator using the DLT Report Form : 
• any grade 3 or greater  non-hematologic, non- infectious toxicity including 
thromboembolic complications  
• selected hematologic toxicity  within the 1st 14 days of INCB7839  
o grade 4 neutropenia lasting for ≥ 7 days

February 12, 2018  Page 30  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 o febrile neutropenia  
o grade 4 thrombocytopenia last ing for ≥ 7 days despite dosing delay  
o grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding  
• inability to complete at least 10 days (20 doses) of twice daily INCB7839 
therapy within the 1st 14 days due to treatment related toxicity  
 
Stopping Rule Events :  The following events count toward a study stopping 
rule during the phase II (extension) component per section 13.5 and must 
be reported to the MCC Study Coordinator using the Early Stopping Rule 
Report Form:  
• Grade 4- 5 non- hematologic toxicity by 4 months  post-transplant  
• Grade 4- 5 hematologic toxicity lasting 7 or more days by 4 months  
post-transplant  
Events that count toward dose limiting toxicity or an early stopping rule do 
not necessarily constitute a serious adverse event requiring expedited reporting and should be reported as such only if they meet the criteria for 
expedited reporting  to the IRB  as defined in section 10.3. 
In addition, although not always an event requiring expedited reporting, 
deaths with cause will be recorded in OnCore upon knowledge in the follow -
up tab.

February 12, 2018  Page 32  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 11 Study Data Collection and Monitoring 
11.1 Data Management  
This study will collect regulatory and clinical data using University of 
Minnesota CTSI’s instance of OnCore® (Online Enterprise Research 
Management Environment).  
 
The Oncore database resides on dedicated secure and PHI compliant 
hardware consisting of 3 physical servers: dev, DR, and productio n. The 
dev server is located in the University of Minnesota (UMN) datacenter 
(WBOB) and houses six database instances (test, train, sandbox, mcc 
reports, oncdm, and vendor) that are backed up locally because the data is 
refreshed from Oncore production dat a. The production server is located in 
the UMN datacenter (WBOB). All the data servers are managed by the 
Academic Health Center – Information Systems (AHC -IS) virtual servers 
which utilize clustered infrastructure to provide real -time failover of virtual 
servers. This real -time clustering is physically limited to the UMN data 
center. All relevant AHC IS procedures related for PHI compliant servers 
(as required by the Center of Excellence for HIPAA Data) apply to Oncore 
databases.  
 
The integrated data will be stored in PHI compliant servers managed by 
AHC IS with access given to those authorized users in the Clinical and 
Translation Science Institute Informatics team (CTSI BPIC and MCC CISS). 
The data will be integrated and extracted to researchers through t he CTSI 
Informatics team and will be delivered through secure and compliant 
mechanisms (e.g. AHC IE data shelter, BOX, sftp, etc). If data de-
identification is needed, then compliant AHC IE data de- identification tools 
will be used. The informatics team will grant the IRB approved study team 
members access to data.  
 
Additional data about correlative laboratory samples generated by the 
Masonic Cancer Center  Translational Therapy Laboratory (TTL) from the 
protocol -directed correlative research samples is stored in their Laboratory 
Information Management System (LIMS).The LIMS database application is 
also stored on a production server located in the UMN datacenter (WBOB) 
and is managed by the Academic Health Center  
 
Key study personnel are trained on the use of OnCore and will comply with 
protocol specific instructions embedded within the OnCore.  
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 33  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 11.2 Case Report Forms  
Participant data will be collected using protocol specific electronic case 
report forms (e- CRF) developed within OnCore based on its library of 
standardized forms. The e- CRF will be approved by the study’s Principal 
Investigator and the Biostatistician prior to release for use. The Primary 
Clinical Research Coordinator  or designee will be responsible for 
registering the patient into OnCore at time of study entry, completing e- CRF 
based on the patient specific calendar, and updating the patient record until 
patient death or end of required study participation.   
11.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be in compliance with the 
University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center's Data & Safety Monitoring 
Plan (DSMP), which can be accessed at http://z.umn.edu/dmsp . 
For the purposes of data and safety monitoring, this study is classified as 
high risk (under a locally held IND).  Therefore the following requirements 
will be fulfilled:  
 The PI will complete and submit a quarterly Trial Progress Report to the 
Masonic Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Council (DSMC) with the understanding the Cancer Protocol Review Committee (CPRC) 
may require more frequent reporting.  
 The PI will co mply with at least twice yearly monitoring of the project by 
the Masonic Cancer Center monitoring services.  
 The PI will oversee the submission of all reportable adverse events per 
the definition of reportable in section 10.3 to the Masonic Cancer 
Center’s SAE Coordinator, the University of Minnesota IRB, and the 
FDA.  
11.4 IND Annual Reports  
In accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.33, the sponsor -investigator 
with assistance from the MCC Clinical Trials Office (CTO) will submit a 
progress report annually. The report will be submitted within 60 days of the 
anniversary date that the IND went into effect.    
11.5 Monitoring  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and 
inspections by the Masonic Cancer Center or their designee, IRB, 
government regulatory bodies, and University of Minnesota compliance groups. The investigator will make available all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, 
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 34  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 study data, etc.). The investigator will ensure the c apability for inspections 
of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.) will be available for trial related monitoring, audits, or regulatory 
inspections.  
11.6 Record Retention  
The investigator will retain study records including source data, copies of 
case report form, consent forms, HIPAA authorizations, and all study correspondence in a secured facility  for at 6 years after the study file is 
closed with the IRB and FDA.   
In addition, the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) will keep a master log of all 
patients participating in the study with sufficient information to allow retrieval 
of the medical records for that patient.  
Please contact the CTO before destroying any study related records.

Correlative Endpoints  
To compared expression of CD16 and CD62L on natural killer (NK) cells  and 
ADCC and IFN gamma production prior and after treatment with rituximab and 
after rituximab + INCB7839  (each patients is his/her own control) . We will also 
determine the soluble CD16 and CD62L levels in vivo  and soluble level of stress 
ligands MICa, MICb, UPBP3 before and after INCB7839 therapy .   
13 Statistical Considerations 
13.1 Rationale 
We recently analyzed outcomes of 80 patients with diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma ( DLBCL ) who received autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant  at University of Minnesota between 1984 and 2002 (5). The 
median age was 47 years and most patient s were in complete or partial 
remission. Post -transplant, the progression free survival at 5 years was 32% 
(95%CI 22- 42%). We identified high risk group (high risk features defined 
by IPI score) and low risk group with widely different median PFS of 2 months (high risk group) versus 8 months (low risk). Based on Kaplan –
Meyer PFS curve, we expect 65% of patients to be progression- free at 6 
months.
3   
Recent prospective multicenter study comparing two different conditioning regimen prior to autograft for DLBCL demonstrated similar 6 months progression free survival of 65- 70%.
1,2. The most common cause of 
treatment failure is lymphoma progression/relapse.      
HM2013- 24: INCB7839 with Rituximab after Autologous HCT for Diffuse Large B Cell NHL   
 
   
February 12, 2018  Page 35  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 13.2 Study Design 
The study is a Phase I/II trial consisting of two phases. The first phase is a 
dose escalation phase with the aim of establishing a maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of Adam17 inhibitor INCB7839 with rituximab as consol idation 
therapy after autologous HCT for patients with diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma. In the second phase, a larger group will be enrolled in order to obtain a more detailed toxicity profile of the chosen MTD from the first phase 
as well as establish a preliminary estimate of the rate progression free 
survival at 6 months.  
In the dose escalation phase, three dose levels of INCB7839  will be tested 
(100mg, 200mg, and 300mg). Since we are starting the experiment at a 
very low dose at which expected toxicity impacts are low using the standard dose escalation design would expose more subjects to ineffective doses with no expected efficacy. Therefore we decided to conduct the dose 
escalation phase following a Fast -Track Design. With the fast tract design, 
1 patient is entered per dose level until a grade 2 or greater treatment 
emergent event  is experienced within the 1
st 14 days of INCB7839 is 
experienced.  At that point, two additional patients will be enrolled at the 
same dose level and standard dose escalation design will be used as follows:  
  
Number of Patients 
with DLT at a Given 
Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
(see section 7. 2 for dose levels)  
0 out of 3  Enter 3 new patients at the next higher dose level  
≥ 2 out of 3  This dose level is declared to be above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) an 
dose escalation is stopped. Declare the next lower dose the MTD if 6 patients 
have already been treated at that dose. Enter 3 additional patients at the next lower dose level if only 3 patients have been treated at the dose, and if ≤ 1 out of 6 patients has DLT then declare this dose the MTD. If ≥ 2 out of 6 patients have 
DLT then dose de -escalation continues according to the same scheme.  
1 out of 3  Enter 3 additional patients at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 patients (i.e. 1 out of all 6 patients) experience DLT, proceed 
to the next higher dose level.  
• If ≥ 1 of these 3 patients (i.e.≥  2 out of all 6 patients) experience DLT, then 
this dose is declared to be above the MTD and dose escalation is stopped. 
Declare the next lower dose the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that dose. Enter 3 additional patients at the next lower  dose level if only 3 
patients have been treated at the dose, and if ≤ 1 out of 6 patients has DLT then declare this dose the MTD. If ≥ 2 out of 6 patients have DLT then dose 
de-escalation continues according to the same scheme.

February 12, 2018  Page 36  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 The Phase I design will continue until the MTD is declared or until the first 
dose is declared to be above MTD. After the MTD is declared, the study will 
proceed to the Phase II.  
Phase I dose limiting toxicity ( DLT) is defined as any of the following with 
the 1st 14 days of INCB7839:  
• Grade 3-5 non -hematologic, non- infectious toxicity  including 
thromboembolic complications  
• S elect hematologic events including:   
• grade 4 neutropenia lasting for ≥ 7 days  
• febrile neutropenia  
• grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting ≥ 7 days despite dose delay  
• grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding  
• The inability to complete at least 10 days (20 doses) of twice daily 
INCB7839 therapy within the 1st 14 days due to treatment related toxicity  
If dose level 3 is reached without D LT in the 1st 3 patients, an additional 3 
patients (for a total of 6) will be enrolled without the 14 day waiting period  
Once the MTD is declared, additional 12 patients will be enrolled at the 
phase I MTD  or dose level 3 if no DLT, to obtain a total of 18 patients  treated 
at the designated dose .  The specific aim of this second phase is to obtain 
a more detailed toxicity of the newly established MTD and to make sure the 
preliminary estimate of 6- month progression free survival.  
13.3 
Phase II Power Calculation 
If all three dose levels are tested, 3- 18 patients will be enrolled in the first 
phase of the trial in order to establish the MTD. Additional 12 patients will 
be enrolled in the phase II component to obtain 18 patients treated at MTD. 
Therefore a maximum total of 15 to 30 patients will be involved in the study. 
In Phase II the designed sample size of 18 for 6 month progression free  
survival comparison will have a power of 79% to detect the difference between the null hypothesis 6 month progression free survival rate of  65% 
and the alternative hypothesis of progression free  survival of 85% (this is 
equivalent test the null hypothesis of median disease survival time of 9.7 months and the alternative hypothesis median disease survival time of 25.5 months) at a 0.05 signifi cance using two -sided test. The accrual time will be 
18 months and follow up time is 6 months.

February 12, 2018  Page 37  of 44  CPRC #2013LS0 81 13.4 Analysis 
The primary endpoint of progression free survival (P FS) and the secondary 
endpoint of overall survival ( OS) will be estimated with Kaplan- Meier 
curve s.15  Cumulative incidence will be used to estimate the probability of 
relapse/disease progression treating non- relapse death as a competing 
risk.16 Safety measures will be measured descriptively with frequencies and 
proportions.  
13.5 Early Study Stopping Rules – Phase II Component  
For phase II component, early stopping rules will be used to monitor the 
excess toxicity for the additional 12 patients. Stopping rules were developed using Pocock stopping boundaries .
17 
Grade 4- 5 non- hematologic toxicity by 4 months  
Stopping rules were developed for excessive Grade 4- 5 non- hematologic 
toxicity.  The goal is to construct a boundary based on toxicity such that the 
probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the toxicity rate is equal to 10% and our sample size is 12 in phase II component. Given these 
parameters, the upper stopping boundary for toxicity is 2 events out of 4 patients, 3 out of 10, and 4 at any time. If the true toxicity rate is as high as 40% then the chance of early stopping is 87% and the expected sample 
size is 6.0.  
Grade 4- 5 hematologic toxicity lasting for ≥ 7 days by 4 months  
Stopping rules were developed for excessive Grade 4- 5 hematologic 
toxici ty lasting for ≥ 7 days .  The goal is to construct a boundary based on 
toxicity such that the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the 
toxicity rate is equal to 30% and our sample size is 12 in phase II component. Given these parameters, the upper stopping boundary for toxicity is 3 events out of 3 patients, 4 out of 5, 5 out of 8, 6 out  of 10, and 
7 at any time. If the true toxicity rate is as high as 60% then then chance of 
early stopping is 75% and the expected sample size is 7.7.

Appendix IV - INCB7839 Drug Log 
Patient ID: _____________________   
The study drug INCB7839 should be taken with food two times a day approximately 12 hours apart, every day 
until you are told to stop.  If you forget to take a dose by more than 2 hour after the scheduled time or vomit after you take a dose, you should skip the dose and only take the next schedule dose.  If this occurs, record a 
“0” in the time taken column and indicate the reason the dose was missed under the notes column.  One 325 
mg aspirin (if not taking other anti -coagulant therapy) is also taken each day during INCB7839 administration 
and continuing until 1 week after the last dose of INCB7839.  
Please bring this completed drug log and your study drug bottles (including any unused medication) with you to 
each appointment.  If you have any questions, please contact the study coordinator

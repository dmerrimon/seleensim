INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Arthritis is a clinical syndrome of joint pain accompanied by varying degrees of functional 
limitation and reduced quality of life. Two common etiologies of arthritis are degeneration of the 
joint, osteoarthritis (OA), and inappropriate inflammatory response, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
OA is characterized by loss of cartilage, remodeling of adjacent bone, and inflammation in the 
affected joint [1, 2]. RA is a progressive inflammatory disease that eventually causes systemic 
joint damage and disability [3]. Post-traumatic arthritis is a form of osteoarthritis following an 
injury to a joint. Inappropriate joint biomechanics due to deformities is the main risk factor for 
OA [4]. The joint biomechanics are directly affected by the malalignment of the lower 
extremities due to anatomical deformities [5]. Varus deformity is an excessive inward angulation 
of the lower leg and results in a bowlegged appearance. It may cause an overloading and 
cartilage wear in the medial knee compartment, which could support a degeneration of the knee 
joint leading to OA [5]. 
As of 2010, there were approximately 250 million people globally with osteoarthritis of the knee 
joint (3.6% of the global population) [6]. The prevalence was higher in females than in males 
[6]. Initial treatment of arthritis may include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and corticosteroids which can be taken orally or by injection. 
Avascular necrosis (AVN) has several etiologies but fundamentally results from a decrease in 
blood flow to the affected bone, leading to cellular death [7]. Studies have reported a 3.4% and 
9.4% incidence of spontaneous osteonecrosis in persons older than 50 and 65 years of age, 
respectively [8]. Initial treatment of AVN may include medication, stretching, not walking on the 
affected leg. 
Complex epiphyseal fractures around the knee joint involve the distal femur or proximal end of 
the tibia. The management of these fractures especially in elderly patients is challenging [9].
When the damage to the joint is advanced or available conservative treatment options are 
exhausted, knee arthroplasty is considered the most effective treatment for patients with any of 
these indications.
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly successful and frequently performed surgical treatment 
to reduce disability caused by end-stage osteoarthritis and other conditions affecting articular 
cartilage [10, 11]. Technical outcomes for TKA are excellent, with favorable postoperative 
health-related quality of life [12]. Also, survivorship of primary knee replacements is excellent 
with reported survivorship of 82.3% at 25 years [13]. TKA has traditionally been indicated in the 
elderly population with relatively sedentary lifestyles, but more active, younger patients (<55) 
are receiving TKA due to the desire for a pain-free, active lifestyle with the demand projected to 
continue to increase for this group. A recent systematic review has shown that functional 
outcomes are similar in this population compared to elderly patients with no increase in the 
burden of revision [14].
 
Clinical Protocol  Study Number: CORI.2019.07  
A Prospective, Multi -center, Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
knee arthroplasty (UKA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 
procedures   Version:  6.0, 15/Jan/2024 
Page: 17 of 122 
 
Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) is another conservative surgical treatment for patients with 
OA or AVN that only affects a single compartment of the knee [15, 16]. In 2018, 11% of all 
knee arthroplasties in the United Kingdom were compartmental knee arthroplasties (UKA) [17]. 
In the United States, it is estimated that 600,000 primary TKAs and 45,000 primary UKAs are 
performed each year, and the amount of procedures is expected to annually increase by 10% 
[18, 19]. The escalating prevalence of end-stage OA places an increased burden on healthcare 
providers, especially on less experienced surgeons and facilities that perform low numbers of 
arthroplasties [20, 21]. Lower volume hospitals (<25 procedures/year) report higher revision 
rates and more complications by 5 to 8 years compared to high volume hospitals (>200 
procedures/years) [21, 22]. Therefore, technology or techniques that could improve outcomes 
and reduce the risk of revision are becoming increasingly important.  
Surgical factors that must be considered in knee arthroplasty include lower leg alignment, soft 
tissue balancing, maintenance of the joint line, and component size and fixation [23]. 
Malalignment of components in any anatomical plane can cause major complications including 
aseptic loosening, instability, poor function, polyethylene wear, and pain [23-25]. Additionally, 
implant malposition and malalignment of the joint can result in failure of the prosthesis [26]. 
When not aligned wit
outcomes, decreased implant survivorship, increased wear, and early failure from component 
loosening may occur [27].  
Evidence has shown that neutral mechanical alignment provides optimal outcomes in knee 
arthroplasty, which is achieved with conventional alignment guides in approximately 75% of TKA 
cases [28].  
For partial knee procedures, approximately 30-60% of UKAs have been reported to be 
malaligned using conventional manual instruments [29]. The importance of alignment can be 
demonstrated by observing higher revision rates of UKA attributed to malposition or 
malalignment of partial knees [29, 30] while roughly 25% of TKAs have been revised for 
instability or malalignment [31]. 
As an alternative to mechanical alignment, kinematic alignment technique for knee arthroplasty 
aims to restore the individual knee anatomy and ligament tension, to restore native knee 
kinematics [32]. Kinematic alignment restores the obliquity and level of the joint line 
anatomically so the femoral component is slightly more valgus (1° to 2°) and the tibial 
component is slightly more varus (1° to 2°) than mechanically aligned components. 
A significant innovation in knee arthroplasty has been the introduction of computer navigation 
and robotic-assisted surgery. One such technology is the CORI Robotics. This system is a semi-
autonomous image-free system. During the surgery, the surgeon maps the condylar landmarks 
and determines alignment indices to define the volume and orientation of bone to be removed. 
The tools to remove the bone and place the implants are controlled and manipulated by the 
surgeon with the guidance of a 3-dimensional digital map of the surgical surface.  
Comparisons of robotic systems to conventional instruments have demonstrated that robotic 
platforms produce fewer positioning errors in both UKA and TKA [33-35]. When used in medial 
or lateral UKA procedures, robotics reported short learning curves, increased accuracy in

[36-38]. 
A summary of known and potential risks and benefits to humans of CORI Robotics can be found

4.2.1 Demographic Information 
A total of 414 joints were reported in the reviewed literature. Herry et al.[43] and Canetti et 
al.[41] likely shared the same patient population as Batailler et al.[39] Therefore, these joints 
were not included in the total, but these publications were not excluded due to different 
outcomes being reported among the studies. The Robotic Knee Surgical Systems are used 
intraoperatively to assist with implantation of knee prostheses, and studies report on a 
combination of intraoperative alignment parameters, clinical outcomes, and safety information. 
Three (3) studies provided early postoperative follow-up between the perioperative period and 
one year post-operative time point. Four (4) additional studies reported follow-up of one year or 
longer, two of which reported outcomes after 2 years of follow-up. The gender of the patients 
was almost evenly distributed, as men comprised 49% of the total population from all 7 
publications. The age of patients undergoing UKA with the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems 
ranged from 45 to 92 years with an average age of 66.8 years for the total patient population 
from all 7 publications.  
4.2.2 Clinical Outcome 
Outcome measures were evaluated in three publications with Knee Society Score (KSS), 
satisfaction rate, return to sport, Lysholm scale, Forgotten Joint score (FJS), University of 
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score 
(KOOS) and Knee Society Function Score (KSFS) being reported.

procedures   Version:  6.0, 15/Jan/2024 
Page: 20 of 122 
 
KSS, KSFS, and satisfaction rates were the most commonly employed outcome measures, being 
reported by both Batailler et al.[39] and Canetti et al.[41].These studies reported KSS and KSFS 
scores ranging from 92.6 to 96.4 and 90 to 97.2, respectively, indicating excellent functional 
outcomes. Satisfaction was scored on a scale from 1-5 with values corresponding with feeling 
disappointed to very satisfied. The percentages reported are the number of patients that 
indicated they were very satisfied with their procedure; this does not include patients that 
indicated they were just satisfied. Other outcome scores were reported in a single study, and 
none of these outcomes evidenced reduced function.  
Surgical System to patients who were operated on using conventional instruments. For KSFS 
and satisfaction rate, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two 
groups. However, Canetti et al.[41] observed a statistically significant increase in KSS and 
quick
observed in the larger cohort of Batailler et al.[39], the observed difference may be due to the 
smaller sample size. The percentage of patients returning to sports, UCLA, Lysholm scale, and 
FJS were not statistically significant between the two cohorts.  
Overall, patients undergoing knee procedures with the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems showed 
improved KSS, KSFS, KOOS, and UCLA scores compared to pre-operative values. 
4.2.3 Mechanical alignment Accuracy 
The Robotic Knee Surgical Systems are intended to assist in planning and executing a procedure 
involving bone preparation for UKA procedures. Publications have provided accuracy 
measurements for the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems themselves and compared to conventional 
instruments. Three (3) publications investigated alignment accuracy in various planes, the 
incidence of outliers, and restitution of the joint line [39, 42, 43]. 
The reviewed publications indicate that the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems can produce the 
desired mechanical axis, hip knee ankle angle, coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, tibial 
slope, and joint line deviation in the majority of cases. Outliers were reported for most of the 
angular alignment parameters, and only one study indicated a rate higher than 15% [39]. This 
increased outlier rate is likely due to the decreased tolerance imposed by the authors as outliers 
were defined as being within 2° of the desired value compared to the standard 3°. 
Batailler 
to conventional instrumentation. Statistically significant differences were not observed between 
the hip knee ankle angle or tibial slope for medial or lateral UKAs. However, there were 
medial and lateral UKA, the tibial slope for medial UKA, and the coronal tibial angle. In addition, 
the joint line was significantly less distalized wh  
Using the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems results in a knee prosthesis that is well aligned and 
implanted according to the surgical plan. This is supported by satisfactory angular outcomes in 
the mean mechanical axis, hip knee ankle angle, coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, and 
tibial slope. In addition, the joint line was less distalized compared to when conventional 
instrumentation was utilized.

4.2.4 Adverse Events & Complications 
Complications related to the surgery, revision of the implant, and general complications were 
reported in the 7 included publications. Overall, the revision rate for prostheses implanted using 
the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems was 1.2% (5/414 procedures). Revisions were due to aseptic 
loosening without implant malpositioning (3, 0.7%) and unexplained pain (2, 0.5%). Additional 
reoperations included three (3) arthroscopic partial lateral meniscectomies, two (2) arthroscopic 
arthrolyses, and one (1) arthrotomy and lavage. Batailler et al.[39] noted that complications 
that affect robotic-assisted techniques (e.g. pin-site infections, broken pins, or fractures at the 
pin site) did not occur in their cohort.  
4.2.5 Conclusion 
Using the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems results in a knee prosthesis that is implanted according 
to the patient specific surgical plan. This is evidenced by satisfactory angular outcomes and 
restitution of the joint line. In addition, patients undergoing these procedures with the Robotic 
Knee Surgical Systems showed improved outcomes scores compared to pre-operative values. 
The clinical outcomes, alignment accuracy, and adverse events for the Robotic Knee Surgical 
Systems reported in the literature are similar to those reported for comparable devices.  
4.3  Study Purpose 
This is a prospective, multi-center study to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the 
CORI Robotics to meet the post-market clinical follow-up requirement in Europe, UK, India and 
the US. This is a post-market study in all countries involved.  In addition, the study may support 
regulatory approval by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China.
Study hypotheses are that the CORI surgical system will achieve post-operative leg alignment 
(± 3°), and an improvement in patient-reported outcome measures.  This primary endpoint is 
aligned to the primary study objective of evaluating the CORI surgical system for UKA and TKA 
procedures in achieving post-operative leg alignment.  Accuracy and alignment are two key 
variables in successful UKA and TKA procedures. These measures have been previously 
evaluated with the predicate NAVIO surgical system. The primary endpoint will support the 
continued evaluation of these variables for the CORI surgical system.  
4.4 Safety Considerations 
Representative language of the indications of use, contraindications and potential adverse 
effects of CORI Robotics can be found in the IFU. 
4.4.1 Intended Use 
CORI Robotics is intended to assist the surgeon in providing software-defined spatial boundaries 
for orientation and reference information to anatomical structures during orthopedic procedures.

4.4.2 Indications 
CORI Robotics is indicated for use in surgical knee procedures, in which the use of stereotactic 
surgery may be appropriate, and where reference to rigid anatomical bony structures can be 
determined. These procedures include unicondylar knee replacement (UKR) and total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA). CORI Robotics is indicated for use with cemented implants only. 
4.4.3 Contraindications 
CORI Robotics is not intended to be used on children, pregnant women, patients who have 
mental or neuromuscular disorders that do not allow control of the knee joint, or any other 
patients contraindicated for knee replacement. 
4.4.4 Warnings and Precautions 
Knee Arthroplasty) states the following warnings and cautions: 
CORI Robotics is a surgical tool designed to provide assistance to the surgeon; it is not a 
planning and the conduct of the surgery during which CORI Robotics is being used. 
CORI Robotics and accessories should be used only by, or under the supervision of, a 
qualified surgeon or qualified member of his or her staff who is familiar with this 
document and has received training from Smith & Nephew. 
Use of equipment not specifically designated in this manual as compatible with CORI 
Robotics may result in the system not functioning properly, leading to patient or user 
injury. 
Refer servicing only to trained service personnel. Equipment damage, personal injury, or 
death may result if CORI Robotics is not serviced properly. 
To avoid risk of electrical shock, only connect the CORI Robotics Cart to a supply main 
with protective earth. 
Modification of CORI Robotics can cause the system to malfunction and could result in 
user and/or patient injury. 
Connecting electrical equipment to the multiple socket output effectively leads to creating 
a Medical Equipment System, and could result in a reduced level of safety. 
The transformer outlet is only to be used for CORI Robotics components. Do not connect 
any other device or improper extension cord to the transformer (max. load 600 VA) 
outlet. Failure to comply with this warning may result in shock hazard or product damage.
Additional equipment connected to medical electrical equipment must comply with the 
respective IEC or ISO standards. All configurations shall comply with the requirements for 
medical electrical systems (see IEC 60601-1). Anyone connecting additional equipment to 
medical electrical equipment configures a medical system and is therefore responsible 
that the system complies with the requirements for medical electrical systems. Attention 
is drawn to the fact that local laws take priority over the above mentioned requirements. 
If in doubt, contact a qualified Biomedical technician or your local Smith & Nephew 
representative.

Any person who connects external equipment to signal input and signal output ports or 
other connectors has formed a system and is therefore responsible for the system to 
comply with the requirements of IEC 60601-1. If in doubt, contact a qualified Biomedical 
technician or your local Smith & Nephew representative. 
Only USB-powered devices, such as USB flash drives, should be connected to CORI USB 
ports. Any person that connects a self-powered USB device has formed a medical system 
and is therefore responsible for the system to comply with the requirements of IEC 
60601-1. If in doubt, contact a qualified Biomedical technician or your local Smith & 
Nephew representative. 
 
4.4.5 Environments of Use 
CORI Robotics is intended to be used by trained medical professionals in a hospital or clinical 
setting equivalent to an orthopedic surgery suite. The CORI Robotics Instruments will be used in 
a sterile environment and must be sterilized prior to use.  
4.4.6 Anticipated Risks / Adverse Effects 
As with any surgical procedure, there is risk involved. Potential complications accompanying 
surgery may occur, including allergic reaction (anaphylactic and minor), infection, mild to 
serious physical injury, localized static shock, delay in the operation, surgical site nerve injury, 
vascular injuries of the lower extremity, soft tissue damage, major bone gouging at the surgical 
site, bone fracture, immature implant failure, unstable knee joint, limited or restricted knee 
range of motion, major blunt impact injury, unintended laceration/puncture wound, and 
osteonecrosis.  
As this is a post-market study and the device is used according to the IFU, the use of CORI 
Robotics in this study introduces no additional potential risks to the study participant.
4.4.7 Safety Data Collection 
All adverse device effects or device deficiencies will be categorised and reported as instructed in 
Section 12, Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies. During causality assessment activity 
(assessment of Related vs Unrelated) and expectancy assessment (assessment of Unanticipated 
vs Anticipated) clinical judgement shall be used and relevant documents, such as the IFU shall 
be consulted, as foreseeable serious adverse events and the potential risks are summarized 
there. The presence of confounding factors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the 
natural history of the underlying disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be 
considered.

The CORI Robotics is comprised of a console control unit, optical tracking camera, primary and 
secondary input displays (tablet and optional display monitor), instrument trays and foot pedal 
(Figure 6-1). The CORI Robotics software consists of a patient and user management module, a 
surgical planner, and an intra-operative cutting module. The system uses the tracked position of 
the surgical bur to control its cutting engagement to the bone that is intended to be removed. 
The CORI Robotics incorporates a detailed user interface that provides procedure setup, tracking 
status, visual indicators, and real-time cutting progress during the procedure. The system uses 
the tracked position of the surgical bur to control its cutting engagement to the bone that is 
target surface of the bone. The CORI Robotics software controls the cutting engagement of the 
surgical bur based on its proximity to the planned target surface. The cutting control is achieved 
with two modes:  
Exposure control adjusts the bur's exposure with respect to a guard. If the surgeon 
encroaches on a portion of bone that is not to be cut, the CORI Robotics retracts the bur 
inside the guard, disabling cutting. 
Speed control regulates the signal going to the drill motor controller itself and limits the 
speed of the drill if the target surface is approached. This mode of operation is useful in 
shaping surfaces of the condyle as well as placing post holes and fixation features for 
femoral and tibial cut guides.

training is required. 
 
6.3 Packaging and Labelling 
Packaging and labeling are prepared to meet regulatory requirements. Package integrity and 
labelling should be verified prior to use of the product and confirmed in the eCRF. 
6.3.1 Labelling of Investigational Product 
All product components of the CORI Robotics System as well as the Smith+Nephew Knee 
Implant Systems are commercial products in Europe, UK, India and the United States and are 
being used as approved. Labeling is done as per the standard commercial packaging. No 
additional labelling will take place. 
6.4  Product Accountability Procedures 
This study is a post-market study in Europe, UK, India, and the United States. However, the 
sponsor may provide the study sites with the CORI Robotics System (Console, Optical Tracking 
Camera, Foot Pedal, Tablet, Display Monitor, Cart, CORI Instrument Trays UKA & TKA) as well 
as with reusable instrumentation (CORI Robotic Drill, Point Probe, Femur & Tibia Trackers, 
Checkpoint Pins). Therefore, the following product accountability procedures will be applied for 
CORI Robotics supplied to study sites.  
In instances where CORI Robotics is supplied to site, the investigational site will maintain an 
inventory of the IP . The Sponsor or its designee will provide a log(s) to facilitate IP inventory 
control. The log will contain details of receipt, use, returns etc. of IP. All IP accountability logs 
must be retained in the Investigator Site File (ISF). These records must be available for 
inspection by the Sponsor, its designees, or by regulatory agencies at any time.

The Study Monitor will ensure that the procedures and records are in place for the appropriate 
reconciliation of all IP. As part of monitoring, the Study Monitor will check that site personnel are 
following the proper procedures for accountability and completing all necessary documentation.
No product accountability procedures will be applied for the S+N Knee Implant Systems as these 
are commercially available products. Nevertheless, the S+N Knee Implant System as well as the 
individual component reference and lot numbers (femoral component, tibial baseplate and 
insert) will be recorded in the eCRF.
Overall accountability for the use of the product is the responsibility of the Investigator or 
designated individual .
Following completion of enrolment all supplied CORI Robotics systems will be returned to S+N.
For details on the CORI Robotics System and reusable instrumentation please refer to Section 
6.1.1 Investigational Product.
6.5 Surgical Technique
All study related procedures with the CORI Robotics must be performed according to the user 
manual (Document ID: 500230 CORI Robotics for Knee Arthroplasty) and according to the 
according to the surgical technique and IFU of the specific Smith+Nephew Implant System.

Surgeons selected to participate in this study will be familiar with the CORI Robotics and have 
written evidence of training and expertise in the study procedure. If deemed necessary, pre-
study cases shall be performed until the surgeon feels comfortable with the system in order to 
prevent any learning curve during the study. The number of pre-study cases depends on the 
level of the individual experience of the surgeon. Anonymized CORI Robotics Case Reports will 
be collected for these pre-study cases as proof of experience. If no pre-study cases are 
completed the case log of the first study case will be collected and analysed as soon as possible 
following the surgery to ensure the additional data required for the study has been collected.

STUDY DESIGN
8.1 Study Design
This study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-blinded follow-up study to 
evaluate the use of CORI Robotics in UKA and TKA procedures in achieving post-operative leg 
alignment. Up to 8 sites will participate within Europe, UK, India and the US.
Subjects will be enrolled in one of two (2) groups based on medical indication and general 
practice at the site, as shown in Table 8-1. All subjects are treated with knee arthroplasty with 
the use of the CORI Robotics and a Smith+Nephew Knee Implant System based local regulatory 
status and medical indication and general practice at the site (see Table 6-1 S+N Implant 
Systems available with CORI Robotics for this study).

The study is expected to enroll all subjects within a 24 month timeframe. Subjects will be 
followed-up for a time period of 12 months after surgery.
This study is being conducted in parallel to 2 randomized-controlled studies
Prospective, Multi-center, randomized-controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness 
ID: CORI.2019.06) and A Prospective, Multi-center, Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate 
(TKA) Procedure (Protocol ID: CORI.2020.08). The study data may be combined for analysis to 
meet the requirements for regulatory approval of the CORI Robotics by the National Medical 
Products Administration (NMPA) in China. Further details are described in Section 10 Statistical 
Design and the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
Figure 8-1 details the different steps of study conduct from screening to enrollment and follow-
up.
Subjects may be assigned a subject ID, but then not enrolled in the study (e.g. did not receive 
the study device or decided not to participate in the study).

Figure 8-1 Study Flowchart
The study design meets the needs of the aforementioned regulatory requirements and has been 
powered based on recent analyses from the NAVIO Surgical System.  This study is designed to 
demonstrate superiority in the proportion of TKAs post-operatively defined as mechanically 
aligned against the reference proportion of 73.4% (53).  The proportion of mechanically aligned 
sis was estimated to be 92.1%
(54). If this assumption holds for this study, then the enrollment of 36 knees for each of the two 
planned study groups (i.e. the CORI Robotics UKA and CORI Robotics TKA) for a total of 72
knees will individually provide approximately 80% power to show that the lower limit of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of mechanically aligned TKAs is greater than 
that obtained from literature. To account for up to a 10% attrition rate in knees enrolled, 40 
knees in each group (80 knees combined, 40 UKA and 40 TKA) will be enrolled in the study.
8.2 Data Management
This study utilizes a validated, 21 CFR Part 11 compliant, electronic data capture system. Access 
to the electronic data capture system is controlled through Smith and Nephew procedures. 
A Data Management Plan (DMP) is written according to Smith and Nephew procedures 
containing details of the data management process. The following is a brief description of the 
key points detailed in this plan.
8.2.1 Data Review and Quality Assurance 
Data will be transcribed from the data source to an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). All data 
requested on the eCRFs are considered required. Data points not collected and/or recorded will 
be considered deviations unless otherwise specified.

Page: 40 of 122 
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of 
the Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. The Principal Investigator must 
provide his/her electronic signature on the appropriate eCRFs to be documented in compliance 
with local regulations. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor will require a new 
signature by the Investigator to acknowledge/approve the changes.  
Visual and computer data review will be performed in line with Smith and Nephew procedures to 
identify possible data discrepancies. Manual and automatic queries will be created within the 
electronic data capture system and will be issued by Smith and Nephew to the site for 
appropriate response. Site staff are responsible for resolving all queries in the electronic data 
capture system.  
 
8.2.2 Retention Period 
All eCRFs will be archived once the study is completed and will be kept for a period of no less 
than five years after the later of the following dates: the date of which the study is terminated 
or completed or the date that the records are no longer required supporting marketing 
applications. 
8.3  Study Endpoints 
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of this study is defined as the evaluation of the proportion of subjects 
achieving post-operative leg alignment at 6 weeks post-surgery. Achieved leg alignment is 
 
This primary endpoint is aligned to the primary study objective of evaluating the CORI surgical 
system for UKA and TKA procedures in achieving post-operative leg alignment.  Accuracy and 
alignment are two key variables in successful UKA and TKA procedures. These measures have 
been previously evaluated with the predicate NAVIO surgical system. The primary endpoint will 
support the continued evaluation of these variables for the CORI surgical system. 
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoints 
The following secondary endpoints have been defined for this study in order to evaluate the 
safety and performance of the CORI Robotics: 
Component Alignment 6 weeks post-surgery 
Radiographic assessment (Presence of radiolucent lines, osteolysis & implant migration) 
12 months post-surgery 
2011 Knee Society Score (KSS) at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 and 12 month post-surgery
Oxford Knee Score (OKS) at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 and 12 month post-surgery
Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 month post-surgery

Secondary endpoints are aligned to the secondary study objectives of generating safety and 
performance evidence related to the use of the CORI surgical system.  Assessing alignment, 
radiographic image assessment and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) are key 
variables in determining the success of UKA and TKA procedures. These endpoints have been 
previously evaluated with the predicate NAVIO surgical system and ongoing assessment of 
these secondary endpoints under this study will support safety and efficacy of these 
procedures performed with the CORI surgical system.  
 
8.3.3 Other Endpoints 
The following additional endpoints collected during surgery have been defined for this study:
Leg alignment pre- and post-cementation 
generated by the CORI Robotics Software. 
Cutting time of the robotic drill 
generated by the CORI Robotics Software. 
8.3.4 Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints include the collection of the following events: 
All adverse events (AEs) and complications occurring from the time of subject enrollment 
until study termination or study completion including intra-operative adverse events and 
complications.  
Device related re-intervention 
Device Deficiencies 
Knee implant revision rate 
All AEs will be categorized in terms of seriousness and relatedness to the study device or to 
the surgical procedure (Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects, 
Serious Adverse Device effects). All Serious Adverse Device Effects will be further 
categorized as Anticipated or Unanticipated. The definitions for each of these categories are 
based on ISO 14155. (Including hardware and instrumentation), complications, and 
revisions.

Subjects will be enrolled at multiple sites, utilizing up to 8 sites in total for the study. This will 
reduce the effect of observer bias that might arise at any one investigational site as well as 
maximize the diversity of subjects treated.
8.4.2 Prospective Consecutive Enrolment
Consecutive enrollment will be utilized to enroll subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. 
8.4.3 Subject Attrition 
The required sample size for the study includes adjustment for expected subject attrition.
8.4.4 Pre-specification of Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome measure has been pre-specified as well as the type of statistical analysis 
to be performed in order to evaluate this outcome. The details of the analysis will further be pre-
specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) so as minimize any threats to external validity and 
yield clinically relevant estimates of effects and precision.

Post-Operative Leg alignment 
The leg alignment shall be assessed post-operatively and 6 weeks after surgery on standing weight 
bearing long leg A/P X-ray and lateral X-ray. Optionally, leg alignment can be assessed optionally 
at 12 months, in case a standing weight bearing long leg A/P X-ray is taken at 12 months. 
Post-operative leg alignment is achieved when the deviation from the subject specific target does 
not exceed ±3 degrees. 
All leg alignment measures will be added to the eCRF. 
9.2.2 Component Alignment 
Component alignment will be assessed on long leg standing A/P X-rays and standard non weight 
bearing lateral X-rays taken 6 weeks after surgery (or at discharge). The following angles will be 
evaluated on the X-rays and recorded in the eCRF: 
A/P View 
Femoral A/P Angle: From the A/P radiograph, the 
femoral flexion angle is to be obtained using standard 
radiographic tools. Femoral flexion angle is defined as 
the angle formed between a line across the base of the 
femoral condyles and a line that is centered along the 
femoral canal 
Tibial A/P Angle:  From the A/P radiograph, the tibial 
angle denotes the angle formed on the medial side of 
the knee from intersecting lines parallel to the tibial 
base plate and a line drawn parallel to the tibial canal 
(Figure 9-2).

The Objective Knee Score is rated by the clinician and assesses a range of clinical outcomes: 
UKA/TKA alignment, stability, ROM and symptoms. The Subject Satisfaction Score assesses the 
satisfaction with 5 daily activities (sitting, lying in bed, getting out of bed, light household duties, 
surgery. The post-operative questions differ from the pre-operative questions and ask if the 
-operative expectations have been met. As the pre- and post-operative scores are 
based on different questions, they cannot be directly compared. The Functional Knee Score is 
derived from assessments of walking and standing, standard activities, advanced activities, and 
discretionary activities. 
A paper questionnaire will be provided by the Sponsor to be completed by the subject. Responses 
for the KSS will then be recorded in the eCRF. 
9.2.5 Oxford Knee Score (OKS) 
The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) will be collected at the pre-operative visit and 6 weeks, 6- and 12-
months after surgery. 
The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire that was developed to 
specifically assess the patient's perspective of outcome following Total Knee Arthroplasty. The OKS 
is a patient self-completion PRO containing 12 equally weighted questions on activities of daily 
living. The OKS has been developed and validated specifically to assess perceived function and pain 
answered on a Likert scale after TKA [48, 49]. Responses to each question ranges from 0-4 with a 
range of a possible overall score from 0-48. A score of 0 is the worst possible outcome while a 
score of 48 is the best possible outcome. The benefit to this questionnaire is that it is short, 
practical, reliable, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes over time. 
A paper questionnaire will be provided by the Sponsor to be completed by the subject. Responses 
for the OKS will then be recorded in the eCRF.

will be generated where appropriate. Where data summaries are specified, categorical and ordinal 
variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with the following summary statistics: the number of observations, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum values.  
All statistical comparisons of data would describe the test statistic used as well as its distributional 
assumptions. For continuous variables, in an event of marked deviation from normality assumption, 
a commensurate non-parametric test would be used as an alternative thereby eliminating the 
possibility of violation of normality assumptions. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 
9.3 (or a later version). 
 
10.2 Analysis Populations 
The following are the analysis populations: 
Safety Population (SAF): This is defined as all subjects who were treated for a UKA or TKA 
with the use of the CORI Robotics and a Smith+Nephew Knee Implant System. 
Full analysis set population (FAS): The FAS is a subset of the subjects of the SAF population 
who have at least one post-operative assessment on any of the effectiveness endpoints or 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) endpoints.  
Per-Protocol Population (PP): The PP population is a subset of subjects in the FAS population 
who do not have major protocol deviations and who satisfied all enrollment eligibility criteria. 
Major protocol deviations will include but not only restricted to subjects enrolled who do not 
satisfy the study entry eligibility criteria. All other criteria that will be categorized as major 
deviations will be formally classified on a case-by-case basis prior to the final study database 
lock.  
10.3 Baseline Data 
All observations available prior to the operative date will be defined as baseline data. All 
demographic and pre-operative characteristics data will be summarized at baseline. All 
demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the SAF, FAS and PP analysis 
populations.

±3° from the target (pre-operative planned leg alignment) assessed at the 6 weeks study visit in 
 
The proportions as described above will be summarized along with their associated two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs), estimated using exact binomial methods. 
The hypothesis of superiority in leg alignment in both groups will incorporate the use of the 
Intersection Union Test (IUT) where superiority will be inferred if and only if the outcomes from the 
simultaneous comparisons relative to the literature-specified rate provided of 73.4% yield lower 
limits of their two-sided 95% CIs both greater than 73.4% (i.e. both lower limits of the 95% CIs 
from the two groups must be greater than 73.4%) [52]. No multiplicity adjustments are required 
through the use of the IUT. The leg alignment will additionally be summarized using summary 
 
As supportive analysis on the primary endpoint, the difference between the target and actual leg 
alignment achieved postoperatively will be summarized for each group (i.e. CORI Robotics UKA 
versus CORI Robotics TKA) as well as for the combined groups using summary statistics for 
continuous variables. Ninety- -distribution will be calculated 
for the means.   
The primary endpoint and the supportive analysis will be summarized using the FAS analysis 
population as primary and then PP analysis population for sensitivity. 
10.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoint 
All analyses on the secondary endpoints will be carried out separately in the CORI Robotics UKA 
and CORI Robotics TKA groups. 
Component Alignment 
Femoral components (internal rotation, valgus and anterior tilt) and tibial components (internal 
rotation, valgus, and posterior slope) will be summarized using descriptive summary characteristics 
for continuous variables.

postoperative) and the investigational site as a fixed term with a repeated specification for the 
knee.  Pre-operative prognostic and demographic variables not only restricted to age, BMI and sex, 
but that can also be ascertained to have an impact on the KSS scores will be introduced as 
covariates in the final model. These covariates will be added to the model using a stepwise 
approach and a covariate is retained -
Model based means (adjusted means or Least Square Means, LSMeans) and corresponding 
standard errors associated with each KSS score at the pre-operative visit and postoperative visits 
will be presented. Model based changes (and corresponding standard errors) from the pre-
operative visit to each subsequent postoperative as well as their corresponding 95% CIs will 
additionally be summarized. If the p-value associated with the visit term in the model is significant 
(i.e. p < 0.05), then the 95% CIs corresponding to the model based change (LS Mean) from the 
pre-operative to each postoperative visit will indicate where significant differences (changes) from 
the pre-operative at postoperative are found.   
The 2011 KSS subject expectation score will be summarized at the pre-operative and postoperative 
follow-up visits using descriptive characteristics for continuous variables. 
Oxford Knee Score (OKS) 
The OKS (0-48) will be summarized at the preoperative and postoperative visits using continuous 
summary characteristics. The repeated measures ANCOVA model to account for the correlation 
between subjects in case of bilateral knees analogous to that specified for the 2011 KSS will be 
used. 
Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) 
The transformed FJS score (0-100) will be summarized at the postoperative visits using continuous 
summary characteristics. The repeated measures ANCOVA model to account for the correlation 
between subjects in case of bilateral knees analogous to that specified for the 2011 KSS will be 
used.

EQ-5D-5L Score 
The HRQoL Index score and VAS score will be summarized using summary statistics for continuous 
variables pre-operatively and at all postoperative visits. In the case of bilateral knees, repeated 
measures ANCOVA models will account for correlation between subjects with bilateral knees each 
for the index score and VAS analogous to that specified for the 2011 KSS will be used.  
All secondary endpoints will be summarized using the FAS analysis population. 
 
10.4.3 Analysis of Other Endpoint(s) 
The analyses for other endpoints (will be carried out separately in the CORI Robotics UKA and CORI 
Robotics TKA groups. 
Leg alignment pre- and post-cementation 
Leg alignment pre- and post-cementation will be summarized using descriptive summary 
characteristics for continuous variables. 
Robotics System Time & Cutting Time 
Robotic System and cutting times will be summarized using summary statistics for continuous 
variables. Standard Robotics System and cutting times will be obtained from literature and included 
in the SAP. The average operating (µ 11) and cutting times (µ 21) and their commensurate 95% CIs 
will be summarized compared to the obtained literature-specified (i.e. µ 10 and µ20 respectively) 
using the t-test.  
The following are the possible outcomes, where i=1 represents operating time and i=2 represents 
cutting time:  
If the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI for µ i1 is > µ i0, then it is concluded that µ i1 is significantly 
greater than µ i0. 
If the upper limit (UL) of the 95% CI for µ i1 is > µ i0, then it is concluded that µ i1 is significantly less 
than µ i0. 
If (LL of 95% CI for µ i1 i0 i1), then it is concluded that µ i1 on-study is 
comparable to that specified in the literature (µ i0).  
All other endpoints will be summarized using the FAS analysis population.

10.5 Safety Analyses
All safety analyses will be carried out separately for each of the groups (CORI Robotics UKA and 
CORI Robotics TKA groups) and overall as follows:
The number of adverse events will be reported both overall and by seriousness, relationship 
to study device and anticipation.
The number of subjects experiencing adverse events will be summarised both overall and by 
seriousness, relationship to study device and anticipation.
An overall AE summary table that will summarize as number (n) and percentages (%), the 
overall incidence according to subjects with at least one AE; subjects with at least one AE by 
worst severity (mild, moderate, or severe); subjects with at least one AE by worst outcome 
(resolved, ongoing/unresolved, or death); subjects with an AE that led to study 
discontinuation) and; subjects with at least one AE by worse relatedness to device. Other 
events such as SAEs, ADEs, SADEs or UADEs will also be similarly summarized using the 
number (n) and percentages (%). 
Incidence of device-related re-interventions that occur on-study will be summarized as 
number (n) and percentages as well as by type.
A listing of device deficiencies that occur on-study will be provided.
Knee implant revision rate will be summarized as proportions with 95% CIs estimated using 
exact binomial methods. 
All safety endpoints will be summarized using the SAF analysis population.
10.6 Interim Analyses
Not applicable.
SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
Parratte et al.[53] looked at the effects of postoperative mechanical axis alignment on the survival 
of TKAs. They found that of the 398 TKAs reviewed in the paper there were 292 (73.4%) which 
post-operatively were defined as mechanically aligned (i.e. with a mechanical axis of 0° ± 3°).
This study is designed to demonstrate superiority in the proportion of TKAs post-operatively 
defined as mechanically aligned against the reference proportion of 73.4% from above.

analysis was estimated to be 92.1% [54]. If this assumption holds for this study, then the 
enrollment of 36 knees for each of the two planned study groups (i.e. the CORI Robotics UKA and 
CORI Robotics TKA) for a total of 72 knees will individually provide approximately 80% power to 
show that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of 
mechanically aligned TKAs is greater than that obtained from literature. To account for up to a 10% 
attrition rate in knees enrolled, 40 knees in each group (80 knees combined, 40 UKA, 40 TKA) will 
be enrolled in the study.

12.1.1 Adverse Event
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device and whether anticipated or 
unanticipated.  
Note 1: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator.

Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
Note 3: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the use of 
investigational medical devices or comparators. 
AE is used both to refer to AE which do not meet the definitions of Adverse Device Effects or 
Serious Adverse Events and as an umbrella term referring to adverse events of all classifications.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease. For reporting purposes, emphasis is placed first and foremost on whether or 
not the event constitutes an untoward medical occurrence. 
12.1.2 Adverse Device Effect 
An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical 
device.  
Note 1: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions 
for use, deployment, implantation, installation or operation, or any malfunction of the 
investigational medical device.  
Note 2: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the 
investigational medical device.  
Note 3: This includes "comparator" if the comparator is a medical device.  
Not Related  - An AE is considered to be not related to the use of an IP or the procedure when the 
effect is DEFINITELY UNRELATED to have any relationship to the use of the IP or the procedure. 
Related   An AE is considered to be related to the use of an IP or the procedure when there is a 
POSSIBLE, or DEFINITE relationship between the AE and the use of the IP or the procedure. 
An ADE is further categorized depending on whether the criteria in section 12.1.3 and 12.1.4 are 
met.

12.1.3 Serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Device 
Effects 
An AE or ADE is considered a Serious  Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious  Adverse Device Effects 
(SADE) if,  it led to any of the following: 
a) death, 
b) serious deterioration in the health of the subject, users or other persons as defined by one 
or more of the following:  
1) a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function including chronic 
diseases, or 
3) in-patient or prolonged hospitalization, or 
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, 
c) foetal distress, foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect including physical or 
mental impairment 
Note 1: Planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by the study  
protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event. 
12.1.4 Anticipated/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device 
Effect 
An Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (USADE) is a serious ADE which by its nature, 
incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk 
assessment.  
Note 1: Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by its nature, 
incidence, severity, or outcome has been identified in the risk assessment. A list of potential ASADE 
for the CORI Robotics is provided in but not limited to Table 12.1-2. Please also refer to Section

Table 12.1-2 Potential Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (ASADE)  
# Potential Harm Description 
1 Allergic Reaction 
to Materials Hypersensitivity caused by exposure to material constituents of 
the product that leads to local inflammatory reaction and tissue 
damage. Contact with an allergen may cause swelling and 
redness of the skin in minor cases. A severe anaphylactic 
reaction may occur. 
2 Bone Fracture Any break or fracture to any bone. (Applicable to displaced and 
non-displaced fractures) 
The bone break could be reduced (set) and immobilized during 
the same surgery during which it occurred if it is detected. If the 
fracture occurs after the surgery, additional medical attention 
would be required. Subsequent healing returns normal body 
function for the subject. 
3 Burn 3rd degree burn extending through the dermis which requires 
excision. 4th degree burn extending into the subcutaneous 
tissue, muscle and bone with eschar formation. Burns may be 
caused by thermal or chemical burns. 
4 Cardiac 
Arrhythmia - 
symptomatic Variation from the normal heart rhythm symptomatic. 
5 Cement Leakage Cement can end up in an unintended location in the joint. 
Cement leakage may cause early wear of poly or pain to the 
subject and may require revision surgery. 
6 Unstable knee 
joint The implant components are placed in such a way that there is 
too much laxity in the ligaments. The subject experiences 
instability throughout the range of motion, There is an increased 
risk of early loosening/ wear of the implant. This may impact the 
stability and wear of implant components.  
Implants loosening could lead to early revision surgery. 
7 Restricted Range 
of Motion The implants are placed in such a way that excessive forces are 
placed on the ligaments (ACL, PCL, MCL, and LCL). This leads to 
an unintended reduction in the range of motion or progression 
of disease in a non- operative compartment. This may be 
serious, if the subject's range of motion has been worsened 
compared to the range of motion prior to surgery, or it has been 
restored sub-optimally.

# Potential Harm Description 
8 Infection Invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissues, 
especially microorganisms causing local cellular injury due to 
competitive metabolism, toxins, intracellular replication, or 
antigen-antibody response. The infection may lead to a diseased 
state in the receiving host if the host has inadequate resistance 
and/or lacks immunity to overcome the invasion by the 
pathogen.  
Most typically, the resultant disease state can be treated 
through the use of antibiotics. When the pathogen is particularly 
virulent, or when the host has low resistance, the disease state 
may lead to a permanent impairment of some aspect of bodily 
function or, in extreme cases, to death. Infections caused by a 
transfer of body fluids during orthopedic surgery can in most 
cases be treated by a course of antibiotics. Severe infections 
that can occur by the transfer of body fluids during the 
procedure include HIV and hepatitis. 
9 Delay  A delay in the operation time exceeding 60 minutes of intra-
operative case time. A wound being open longer would more 
likely result in soft tissue edema, increased blood loss, muscle 
necrosis as a result of extended tourniquet time and a higher 
chance of infection. 
10Immature implant 
failure Implant components wear before their intended service life 
resulting in early revision surgery.  
11Neurological 
Injury Damage to the nerve systems of the subject's leg. A 
neurological injury could result in temporary or permanent 
paralysis. 
12Physical Injury - 
Serious A physical injury that necessitates medical intervention. 
13Soft Tissue 
Damage Damage to ligaments or tendons leading to loss of stability in 
the knee joint. In severe cases of ligament damage, additional 
surgery may be required. 
14Surgeon Operates 
on Wrong Part of 
Anatomy The clinical impacts of operating on the wrong subject anatomy 
relate to the resultant function of the skeletal element that was 
treated and the need to repeat treatment for the desired 
skeletal element. The impact on the subject may be additional 
surgery under full anesthesia.

# Potential Harm Description 
15Vascular Injury - 
Main Low-
extremity vessels Damage to the vascular systems of the subject's leg. 
In severe cases, dis-vascularization occurs that is, the subject 
loses blood flow to the leg when a clot forms in significant 
arteries of the leg. Additional surgery would be required to 
correct blood flow. If blood flow to the leg is not restored, the 
patient's leg may need to be amputated. 
12.1.5 Severity 
The severity of every AE will be assessed by the PI or medically qualified site staff to whom the 
responsibility has been delegated and documented on the delegation of authority log. AE should be 
classified as mild, moderate, or severe, regardless of whether or not the AE are considered to be 
serious or non-serious. The classification should be based on the following definitions: 
Mild -  An event is mild if the subject is aware of, but can easily tolerate the sign or symptom.
Moderate - An event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant enough 
activities. 
Severe -  
inability to work or engage in their usual activities. 
12.1.6 Device Deficiency 
A Device Deficiency (DD) is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance.  
Note 1: DD includes malfunctions, use errors and inadequacy in the information supplied by the 
manufacturer including labelling.  
Note 2: This definition includes device deficiencies related to the investigational medical device or 
the comparator. 
Device deficiencies that did not lead to an adverse event but could have led to a medical 
occurrence if 
a) suitable action had not been taken,  
b) intervention had not been made, or  
c) circumstances had been less fortunate,

An investigator may be early terminated from the study upon identification of serious protocol 
deviations whereby there are concerns for patient safety or data quality (especially those not 
reported to the sponsor by the site). Early termination may also occur if there are repeated 
protocol deviations which have previously been addressed via corrective and preventative actions 
thereby suggesting an issue with site compliance.
Protocol deviations requiring reporting to the IRB/IEC should be done so in the timeframe 
stipulated by the IRB/IEC.
PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS
Amendments should be made only in necessary cases once the study has started. Protocol 
amendments must be approved by the protocol signatories prior to submission to the IRB/IEC. 
Protocol amendments need to be approved by the IRB/IEC, according to the applicable 
requirements prior to implementation at the site.
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE STUDY
The confidentiality of this study and associated documents is governed by the terms of the Clinical 
Trial Agreement (CTA).
STATEMENTS OF COMPLIANCE
This clinical study will be performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and ISO 14155: Clinical investigation of medical devices Good Clinical Practice.
This clinical study will not commence until the required approval/favorable opinion from the 
IRB/IEC or regulatory authority has been obtained. Any additional requirements imposed by the 
IRB/IEC or regulatory authority will be followed. 
Public/Products Liability Insurance has been purchased by Smith & Nephew plc. Worldwide and

END OF STUDY
The end of this study is defined by the last follow-up visit that occurs in the whole study 
population. Due to defined visit windows, the last follow-up visit must not necessarily be of the last 
subject treated. ard of care as prescribed by the individual sites if 
further follow-up is needed. The study is expected to last 36 months (enrolment period: 24
months, Follow-up period: 12 months).
Should circumstances arise which require the termination of the entire study prior to its planned 
completion (e.g., safety concerns) or circumstances arise which mean the end of the participation 
of an individual site (e.g., departure of Investigator, non-compliance), then this will be undertaken 
according to the SOPs of the Sponsor. The requirement for subject follow-up in these instances will 
be considered as part of these processes.
An End of Study CRF needs to be completed for all subjects including any subject that does not 
complete the study, to document the reason for termination.
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to other parties (Investigator, 
IRB/IEC, Sponsor and regulatory authorities). If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, 
the Investigator will promptly inform the IRB/IEC and the study sites and will provide the reason(s) 
for the termination or suspension. Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension 
include, but are not limited to: 
Determination of unexpected, significant or unacceptable risk to participants 
Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping 
Insufficient compliance with study protocol requirements 
Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
Determination of futility 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, study protocol compliance, data quality are 
addressed and satisfy the Sponsor and IRB/IEC.
The sponsor may decide to discontinue a specific study site under the following conditions:
Non-compliance to GCP or study protocol
Failure to enroll in subjects
Unsafe or unethical practices

APPENDICES
22.1 Protocol Amendment
22.1.1 Protocol Amendment 1
22.1.1.1 General Purpose
This amendment has been completed to:
1) increase the pre-operative visit window from 28 days to 90 days and to allow pre-operative 
activities to occur on the day of surgery as long as they occur prior to the surgery itself.
2) allow the 6-month visit to be conducted remotely.
22.1.1.2 Rationale
1) Following the COVID pandemic and the cancellations of elective surgery the waiting lists for 
surgery have increased globally. Extending the visit window will aid sites in being able to 
include subjects whose surgery is longer than 28 days from their initial pre-operative visit
without having to schedule an additional pre-operative visit.
2) No x-rays are taken at the 6-month visit so the subject does not need to come in to site. The 
PROMs collected at the visit can be sent to the subject who can complete them whilst on the 
phone to a member of the study team. The PROMs will then be securely sent back to site and 
entered into the EDC. The KSS would not have the -generated) 
component of the questionnaire completed if the visit is remote. However, per the 2011 
Knee Society Knee Scoring System Licensed User Manual [55] outcomes are only scored 
using the patient report -
generated) component of the questionnaire is collected for background information and to 
facilitate comparison of patient outcome with the old KSCR.
22.1.1.3 Effect on Study Status
1) The amendment will ensure more potential subjects can be included in the study and reflect 
the consequences of the COVID pandemic on the current routine clinical schedules. There is 
no impact on any subjects that are enrolled prior the amendment being effective as the 
amendment is lengthening rather than reducing the pre-operative visit window.
2) There will be no impact on any subjects reaching the 6-month visit prior to the amendment 
being effective because they will have the 6-month visit on site.
The database will be updated according to the new protocol once approved.

Additional text: 
The study design meets the needs of 
the aforementioned regulatory 
requirements and has been powered 
based on recent analyses from the 
NAVIO Surgical System.  This study is 
designed to demonstrate superiority 
in the proportion of TKAs post-
operatively defined as mechanically 
aligned against the reference 
proportion of 73.4% (53).  The 
proportion of mechanically aligned 
System from a recent analysis was 
estimated to be 92.1% (54). If this 
assumption holds for this study, then 
the enrollment of 63 knees for each of 
the two planned study groups (i.e. the 
CORI Robotics UKA and CORI Robotics 
TKA) for a total of 126 knees will 
individually provide 80% power to 
show that the lower limit of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the 
proportion of mechanically aligned 
TKAs is greater than that obtained 
from literature. To account for up to a 
10% attrition rate in knees enrolled,

22.1 Protocol 
Amendment 1  N/A 22.1.1 General Purpose  
This amendment has been completed 
to: 
1) increase the pre-operative visit 
window from 28 days to 90 days and 
to allow pre-operative activities to 
occur on the day of surgery as long as 
they occur prior to the surgery itself. 
2) allow the 6-month visit to be 
conducted remotely. 
 
22.1.2 Rationale 
1) Following the COVID pandemic and 
the cancellations of elective surgery 
the waiting lists for surgery have 
increased globally. Extending the visit 
window will aid sites in being able to 
include subjects whose surgery is 
longer than 28 days from their initial 
pre-operative visit without having to 
schedule an additional pre-operative 
visit. 
2) No x-rays are taken at the 6-
month visit so the subject does not 
need to come in to site. The PROMs 
collected at the visit can be sent to 
the subject who can complete them 
whilst on the phone to a member of 
the study team. The PROMs will then 
be securely sent back to site and 
entered into the EDC. The KSS would

22.1.3 Effect on Study Status 
1) The amendment will ensure more 
potential subjects can be included in 
the study and reflect the 
consequences of the COVID pandemic 
on the current routine clinical 
schedules. There is no impact on any 
subjects that are enrolled prior the 
amendment being effective as the 
amendment is lengthening rather 
than reducing the pre-operative visit 
window. 
2) There will be no impact on any 
subjects reaching the 6-month visit 
prior to the amendment being 
effective because they will have the 
6-month visit on site.  
The database will be updated 
according to the new protocol once 
approved.

22.1.2.2  General Purpose and Rationale 
The purpose of the amendment and the rationale for the changes are as follows: 
1. Adjustment to the sample size calculation used in the CORI.2019.07 study. On a review of 
the sample size it was found that an error had led to too many patients being planned under 
the assumptions provided. A calculation was re-run under the same assumptions as the 
original sample size which found that the reduction of sample size allowed the study to still 
be appropriately powered and avoided recruiting further patients unnecessarily. 
2. Update to the Insurance provision paragraph to reflect the fact this is a global study protocol 
and remove reference to a UK only guideline. 
3. Protocol template update. At the time of the amendment the protocol template was also 
updated throughout to ensure it is compliant with the current effective protocol template 
(TMP-800052/TMP-CD-05 Rev 4).

of TKAs. They found that of the 398 TKAs reviewed in the paper there were 292 (73.4%) which 
post-operatively were defined as mechanically aligned (i.e. with a mechanical axis of 0° ± 3°). 
This study is designed to demonstrate superiority in the proportion of TKAs post-operatively 
defined as mechanically aligned against the reference proportion of 73.4% from above. 
analysis was estimated to be 92.1% [54]. If this assumption holds for this study, then the 
enrollment of 63 knees for each of the two planned study groups (i.e. the CORI Robotics UKA and 
CORI Robotics TKA) for a total of 126 knees will individually provide 80% power to show that the 
lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of mechanically aligned 
TKAs is greater than that obtained from literature. To account for up to a 10% attrition rate in 
knees enrolled, 70 knees in each group (140 knees combined, 70 UKA, 70 TKA) will be enrolled in 
the study.

At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available 
electronically to you by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send

elect to create a DocuSign account, you may access the documents for a limited period of time 
(usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to 
send you paper copies of any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a 
$0.00 per-page fee. You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the

available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of you

1.0 OBJECTIVES 
 
Primary objectives: 
• Phase I – Evaluate the toxicities  and tolerability and identify the 
maximum tolerated dose of be ndamustine combined with fixed-
dose fludarabine and rituximab (FBR) in previously treated patients 
with CLL. 
 
• Phase II – Evaluate efficacy (2008 International Workshop on 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [IWCLL]  response rate) of the FBR 
regimen at the tolerated dose of bendamustine in previously treated patients with CLL.  This will be compared to the historic data of 
treatment regimens for previ ously treated patients with CLL. 
 
Secondary objectives: 
• Evaluate safety in the Phase II portion at the tolerated dose of 
bendamustine in previously treated patients with CLL. 
 
• Evaluate time to treatment failu re (TTF) and time-to-progression 
(TTP) for previously treated patients treated with the FBR 
combination.  These time-to-event endpoints will be compared to 
historic data of treatm ent regimens for previously treated patients. 
 
• Correlate pretreatment prognostic factors, including ZAP-70 
expression, CD38 expression, β-2 microglobulin, IGHV  gene 
mutation status, chromosome abnormalities by FISH, and serum thymidine kinase with response and time to event endpoints. 
 
• Evaluate pharmacodynamic end points to determine bendamustine-
induced deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA) damage response in 
quiescent CLL lymphocytes and test the hypothesis that fludarabine triphosphate will enhance this respons e by inhibiting DNA repair. 
 
 2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 CLL is the most common leukemia  in the United States and Western 
Hemisphere (reviewed in 
1).  Nearly two-thirds of patients with CLL are 
over 65 years of age, and there is a st eady increase in the prevalence of 
this disease in the population over 50 years of age.  Interest in newer 
therapeutic agents was poor until recently, owing to the usual advanced 
age of patients and often indo lent course of disease.   However, the natural 
history of the disease is diverse.  Patients with only lymphocytosis have a 
median survival in excess of 10 years; those with evidence of marrow failure manifested by anemia or thrombocytopenia have a median survival 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 3 
of only 2 years.  Intermediate surviv al is predicted for patients with 
lymphadenopathy or organomegaly.  T he National Cancer Institute 
Working Group on CLL has described clinic al features of “active disease” 
which are helpful in the decision to treat.  These indications for treatment 
include: 1) unintentional weight loss of more t han 10% body weight over 
the past 6 months; 2) fever or night sw eats in the absence of infection; 3) 
extreme fatigue; 4) worsening anemia or thrombocytopeni a; 5) massive 
(>6 cm below the left costal margin ) or progressive splenomegaly; 6) 
massive (>10 cm in the longes t diameter) or progressive 
lymphadenopathy; 7) progressive lymphocytosis with rapid lymphocyte 
doubling time; 8) marked hypogamm aglobulinemia or paraproteinemia2-4. 
 
2.2 The mainstay of therapy has been systemic chemotherapy consisting 
usually of an alkylating agent and a co rticosteroid.  Chlorambucil plus 
prednisone has become the standard init ial therapy with response rates 
from 40-77%.  Generally, responses have not been complete 5-9.  Therapy 
in patients who are refractory to al kylating agents is unsatisfactory.  The 
response rates are substantially lowe r (approximately 30%) with rare 
complete responses 8-12. 
   
2.3 Fludarabine has shown marked ac tivity in several indolent 
lymphoproliferative disorders incl uding CLL, low- grade lymphoma, 
Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia , and prolymphocytic leukemia 13-17. 
 Treatment of previously treated CLL patients with fludarabine has resulted 
in a 13% complete response rate and 44% partial response rate 
13.  
Fludarabine has also been given to pat ients with previously untreated 
CLL, resulting in even higher response rates with 33% confirmed complete 
response, 39% unconfirmed complete response and 6% partial response 
16. 
 Despite attainment of clinical co mplete response, most patients will 
experience a recurrence at a m edian of approximately 2 years 
18.  This is 
likely related to the fact that most  patients in complete remission (CR) 
have residual disease that can be a ssessed by several parameters.  In 
previously untreated pati ents, 55% of CR patient s have residual nodules 
on bone marrow biopsy (now referred to  as nodular partial remission 
[nPR]) 16.  At 2 years 87% of CR patient s are progression-free, versus 
55% of nPR patients18. 
 2.4 Fludarabine and predni sone have been combined and used to treat over 
200 patients with CLL.  Response rates are equivalent to those seen with 
single agent fludarabine for both previ ously treated and unt reated patients 
19.  However, 14 episodes of  Listeria sepsis or Pneumocystis carinii  
pneumonia were seen with 4 deaths resu lting from these infections.  
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 4 
These infections were not seen in  100 prior patients treated with 
fludarabine alone. 
 
2.5 Cyclophosphamide has been combined with vincristine (VCR) and 
prednisone (COP) to treat lymphoprolif erative disorders.  Liepman and 
Votaw first reported on this combinatio n to treat CLL in 1978.  Thirty-six 
patients received this regimen, 23 were previously untreated.  The 
response rate was 72%; 18 of 23 ( 78%) previously untreated patients 
responded; 8 of 13 (62%) patients prev iously receiving chlorambucil 
responded to COP 20.  Oken and Kaplan treated 18 patients with CLL with 
CVP (cyclophosphamide 800 mg/m2 I.V. on day 1 or 400 mg/m2 orally for 
5 days, VCR 2 mg I.V. on day 1 and prednisone 60-100 mg/m2 on days 1-
5).  All patients were previously treat ed and 17 of 18 were refractory to 
chlorambucil.  The response rate was 44% 21. 
 
2.6 In vitro  studies have demonstrated that fludarabine inhibits repair of 
cyclophosphamide-induced DNA inter-s trand cross-links in CLL B cells  22.  
This was the basis for a regimen of fludarabine, 25-30 mg/m2, combined 
with cyclophosphamid e, 250-500 mg/m2; both drugs were given daily for 
three days in 4-week courses.  Frewin et al 23 first reported their 
experience giving fludarabine 25 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 250 
mg/m2 daily for three days in a limited trial of 7 patients with CLL; two 
patients achieved a complete remission and the overall response rate was 
71%. Toxicities included nausea and vomiting, myelosuppression and 
infections.  O’Brien et al 24 gave this treatment to 94 patients who were 
previously treated with ei ther an alkylating agent, fludarabine, or both.  
The complete remission rate was 11%  and an overall response rate 
(ORR) of 69% was report ed.  Patients that had pr eviously been treated 
with an alkylating agent and were resistant to fludarabine had a markedly 
lower, but noteworthy response rate with 3% complete remissions and a 39% overall response rate. 
 
2.7 Rituximab in CLL 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) approved Rituximab  in 1997 for 
treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade non-Hodgk in’s lymphoma.  
In the pivotal trial, 33 of 166 patients had small lymp hocytic lymphoma 
(SLL), International Working Formu lation (IWF) A (CLL equivalent).  
Rituximab was given at  a dose of 375 mg/m
2 weekly for four weeks, and 
produced a response rate of 48%.  Fo r the patients with IWF A disease 
the overall response rate was low; 12% compared to 58% for those with 
IWF B, C, and D (combined) disease 25.  There are several potential 
explanations for the lower activity of rituximab in patie nts with CLL/SLL.  
Leukemia cells from pati ents with CLL express lo wer levels of CD20 than 
that observed on follicular lymphoma cells.  In addition , pharmacokinetic 
analyses conducted during the pivotal tria l showed lower plasma levels of 
rituximab in non-responders and, effectiv ely, in most patients with SLL.  
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 5 
Finally, circulating CD20 has been demonstrated in t he plasma of patients 
with CLL 26.  Soluble CD20 may act as a si nk for the therapeutic antibody, 
resulting in more rapid cl earance and reducing delivery of the antibody to 
leukemia cells.  Therefore, higher plasma concentrations of rituximab 
could potentially improve response rates in CLL. 
 
Rituximab has been evaluated as a single age nt in the treatment of CLL.  
The standard dose of 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks was given to 28 
patients with CLL who had been prev iously treated wit h chemotherapy 27.  
There were no complete remissi ons; 25% of patients had partial 
responses, 43% had stable disease, and 32% had progressive disease.  
Smaller studies evaluating rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks in 
previously treated patients with CLL r eport low overall response rates with 
no complete remissions 27-29. 
 
Two studies of dose-escalated ritu ximab in CLL yi elded encouraging 
results.  O’Brien et al.30 conducted a study of four weekly doses of 
rituximab at 500, 650, 825, 1000, 1500, and 2250 mg/m2.  All patients with 
CLL had been previously treated wit h chemotherapy.  The overall 
response rate among the 39 eval uable patients was 36% and all 
remissions were partial.  Responses were seen in 5 of  24 (21%) patients 
receiving 500-825 mg/m2, 3 of 7 (43%) patient s receiving 1000-1500 
mg/m2, and 6 of 8 (75%) patients receiving 2250 mg/m2 (P=0.03).  Byrd et 
al.31 conducted a dose-intens ified study with 375 mg/m2 administered 
thrice weekly for four weeks.  Tw enty-seven previously treated patients 
were evaluable for response, 10 ( 37%) achieved remission.  There 
appears to be increased activity for rituxi mab in CLL with dose intensified 
schedules; the optimal dose and schedule for rituximab in CLL is yet to be 
determined.  
2.8 Chemoimmunotherapy in CLL 
The increased activity of fl udarabine combined with cyclophosphamide 
(FC) and the potential chemo-sensit ization between purine analogue, 
alkylating agent, and monocl onal antibody was the rationale for combining 
rituximab with FC.  The efficacy,  toxicity, and tolerability of 
chemoimmunotherapy with the comb ination of fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)  were evaluated in previously 
treated patients with CLL  
32. The purpose of this study was to improve the 
CR rate for previously treated pati ents and evaluate the quality of bone 
marrow response.  One hundred se venty-seven previously treated 
patients with CLL were evaluated. Tr eatment consisted of rituximab 375 
mg/m2 day 1 of course 1 and 500 mg/m2 day 1 of courses 2 to 6; 
fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d days 2 to 4 of course 1 and days 1 to 3 of courses 
2 to 6; and cycloph osphamide 250 mg/m2/d days 2 to 4 of course 1 and 
days 1 to 3 of courses 2 to 6. Cour ses were repeated ev ery 4 weeks.  CR 
was achieved in 25% of 177 patients, and nPR and partial remission (PR) 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 6 
were achieved in 16% and 32% of pat ients, respectively; the overall 
response rate was 73%. Twelve (32%) of 37 complete responders tested 
achieved molecular remission in bone marrow. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to  identify pretre atment patient 
characteristics associated with CR and overall remission, longer time to 
progression, and overall survival.  The FCR regimen was an active and 
well-tolerated treatment for previously treated patients with CLL. 
Myelosuppression was the most co mmon toxicity. FCR induced the 
highest CR rate reported in a clinical  trial of previously treated patients 
with CLL. Furthermore, molecular remissions were achieved in a third of patients achieving CR.  The FCR regimen has been  evaluated in two lar ge Phase III randomized 
trials, one in previously untreated patients (CLL8 trial
33) conducted by the 
German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) and  in previously treated patients 
(REACH trial34) conducted as an international trial sponsored by F. 
Hoffmann La-Roche.  Both trials dem onstrated superior efficacy for the 
FCR combination over FC in terms of higher complete and overall 
response rates and longer progression- free survival.  The REACH trial 
was conducted mainly in Europe and  randomized previously treated 
patients with CLL to either FC or FCR.  Patients could have only had one 
prior treatment that coul d not have included FC or rituximab.  A total of 
552 patients were randomized, 276 each received FC or FCR; patients were equally distributed between treatment arms in  terms of pre-treatment 
characteristics.  The doses of FC were the same for both treatment arms, fludarabine 25 mg/m
2 and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, both daily for 3 
days of each course.  For FCR, rituximab was given at 375 mg/m2 x1 for 
course 1 and 500 mg/m2 x1 for courses 2-6.  The CR and OR rates were 
24.3 and 69.9% respectively for pat ients treated with FCR and 13 and 
58% respectively for patient s treated with FC. The median  progression-
free survival (PFS) for patients treated with FCR was 30.6  mo, versus 20.6 
mo for patients who were treated with FC. Treatment was well tolerated by both arms and there was no significant difference in the rates of grade 3 
and 4 neutropenia, anemia, thrombocyt openia, infectious, or other 
adverse events.  These Phase III data clearly demonstrated superiority for 
the FCR regimen over FC in prev iously treated patients with CLL. 
 
 2.9 Bendamustine in CLL 
Bendamustine has recently been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with CLL
35,36.  Bendamustine has a complex structure with 3 
functional groups: an alkylat ing group, a benzimidazol e ring, and a butyric 
acid side chain37.  It clearly has alkylating-agent activity, capable of 
inducing inter-strand and intr a-strand DNA cross-links.   It may also have 
anti-metabolite activity conferred by the benzimidazole nucleus.  Work by 
our group22,38,39 demonstrated that DNA excision  repair is inhibited by  
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 7 
fludarabine, giving rationale to combining alkylating agents with 
fludarabine24.  Clinical trials have confirmed the superior efficacy with the 
combination of fludarabine and cycl ophosphamide versus single-agent 
fludarabine40-42. 
 The German CLL Study Group conducted a single-arm Phase II clinical 
trial of bendamustine with rituximab (B R) in previously treated patients 
(CLL2M) that demonstrated therapeutic activity and acceptable toxicity
43. 
In this study, previously treated patients received bendamustine 70 mg/m2 
on days 1 and 2 with rituximab 375 mg/m2 x1 course 1, then 500 mg/m2 x1 
for courses 2-6.  The CR and OR response rates for the 81 patients 
treated on this trial were 14.5 and 77.4%, respectively.  The incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was 12.2% , thrombocytopenia was 9.1%, 
anemia was 6.1% and infection was 5.2%. The response demonstrated an 
indication of therapeutic efficacy and t he incidence of toxicities were 
tolerable, considering this was a populat ion of previously treated patients.  
The GCLLSG is currently conducting a randomized frontline trial of FCR 
versus BR.  
2.10 Rationale for the FBR Combination 
This proposal takes advantage of the alkylating-agent activity of 
bendamustine and inhibition of DNA repair by fludarabine
37 and aims to 
explore the tolerability and toxicities  of this combination with rituximab 
(FBR regimen) in the Phase I portion and the therapeutic efficacy in the 
Phase II portion of a clinical trial for previously treated patients with CLL.  
In Phase I, we will evaluate a fixed dose of fludarabine 20 mg/m2 daily x 3 
and rituximab 375 mg/m2 x 1 (course 1) and 500 mg/m2 x 1 (courses 2-6), 
with bendamustine at incr easing doses of 20 mg/m2 daily x3, 30 mg/m2 
daily x 3, 40 mg/m2 daily x 3, or 50 mg/m2 daily x 3.  C ourses will be every 
4 weeks; 6 courses will be given.  In Phase I, for the first course, 
bendamustine will be given alone on Day 1, then on Days 2 and 3 fludarabine will be given before bendamus tine; fludarabine will be given 
alone on Day 4; rituximab will be given on Day 4 (afte r fludarabine) of this 
course.  For courses 2-6 of Phase I, fludarabine and b endamustine will be 
given on Days 1-3; rituximab will be given on Day 1.  For Phase II, the 
tolerated dose of bendamustine w ill be used with fludarabine and 
rituximab in an expanded population to evaluate clinical efficacy.  For Phase II, fludarabine and bendamustine will be given sequentially on the 
same day.  We have evaluated the fludarabine, cycl ophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) 
combination in over 300 previously untreated patients and nearly 290 
previously treated patient s.  Therefore, we hav e well-characterized, 
historic patient populations with which to compare new treatment 
regimens and assess clinical effica cy of new regimens.  These patient 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 8 
populations will be used as a comparison to evaluat e the effectiveness of 
this regimen. 
 This is a Phase I/II, open label study to identify the tolerated dose of 
bendamustine in combination with fix ed-dose fludarabine and rituximab in 
Phase I and in Phase II to evaluate the efficacy of th is combination. In the 
Phase II portion, patients will receive up to 6 courses of treatment at the 
tolerated dose of bendamus tine identified in Phase I and will be evaluated 
for response. 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION   
 The clinical supplies of fludarabi ne, bendamustine, and rituximab will be 
commercial drug supply.  3.1 Fludarabine: 
 The following information applie s to fludarabine (Fludara®).  
 
 3.1.1 How Supplied:   
Sterile, 50 mg prepared as a whit e lyophilized powder with sodium 
hydroxide to adjust pH. 
  3.1.2 Solution Preparation:  
Fludarabine for injection should be prepared for parenteral use by 
aseptically adding Sterile Water for Injection USP.  When 
reconstituted with 2 mL of Sterile  Water for Injection, USP, the 
solidcake should fully dissolve in 15 seconds or less; each mL of the resulting solution will contai n 25 mg of fludarabine phosphate, 
25 mg of mannitol, and sodium hydr oxide to adjust the pH to 7.7.  
The pH range for the final product is 7.2 – 8.2.  In clinical studies, 
the product has been diluted in 100 cc or 125 cc of 5% Dextrose 
Injection USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP. 
 
Reconstituted fludarabine for Inje ction contains no antimicrobial 
preservative and thus should be used within 8 hours of reconstitution.  Care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matte r and discoloration prior to 
administration. 
  3.1.3 Handling and Disposal:  
Procedures for proper handling and disposal should be considered. 
Consideration should be given to  handling and disposal according 
to guidelines issued for cytotoxic drugs. Several guidelines on this 
subject have been published.  There is no general agreement that 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 9 
all of the procedures recommended in  the guidelines are necessary 
or appropriate. 
 Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of fludarabine for Injection solution.  The use of latex gloves and 
safety glasses is recommended to avoid exposure in case of 
breakage of the vial or other accident al spillage.   If the solution 
contacts the skin or mucous membrane, wash thoroughly with soap 
and water; rinse eyes thoroughly wit h plain water.  Avoid exposure 
by inhalation or by direct contac t of the skin or mucous membranes. 
 
3.1.4 Stability:   
Fludarabine phosphate is relatively  stable in aqueous solution.  
Over a pH range of approximately 4.5 to 8 in aqueous buffer 
solutions stored at 65 °C, approximately 11% decomposition 
occurred in one day.  From this pH profile, the optimum pH was 
determined to be approximately 7.7. 
 
At a concentration of 25 mg/ml in distilled water stored at room 
temperature in normal laboratory light, fludarabine phosphate 
exhibited less than 20% decomposition in 16 days.  Diluted to concentration of 1 mg/ml in 5% dextrose injection, USP, or in 0.9 sodium chloride in jection, USP, less than 3% 
decomposition occurred in 16 da ys at room temperature under 
normal laboratory light.  CAUTION: The single-use lyophilized dosage form contains no 
antibacterial preservatives.  T herefore, it is advised that the 
reconstituted product be discarded ei ght hours after reconstitution. 
 
3.1.5 Route of Administration: Intravenous (IV). 
 
3.1.6 Fludarabine Side Effects: 
Common 
• Gastrointestinal: loss of appetite (0 to 34%), nausea (1% to 
5%), vomiting 
• Neurologic: asthenia (9% to 65%), parasthesia (4% to 12%) 
• Respiratory: cough (6% to 44%) 
• Other: fatigue (10 to 38%), feve r (11% to 69%), infectious 
disease (12% to 44%), pain (5% to 22%), shivering (11% to 
19%) 
 
Serious 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 10 
• Hematologic: decreased hem oglobin (14% to 60%), 
hemolytic anemia, neutropenia (37% to 59%), pancytopenia, 
thrombocytopenia (17% to 55%) 
• Neurologic: neurotoxicity,  progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy 
• Respiratory: pulmonary toxicity 
• Other: graft versus host dise ase, tumor lysis syndrome 
(.33% to 1%) 
 
3.2 Bendamustine (Treanda): 
Bendamustine (TREANDA®) for Injection is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with CLL.  Efficacy relative  to first line therapies other than 
chlorambucil has not been established. 
 
3.2.1 How Supplied: 
Bendamustine for Injection single-us e vial containing 100 mg of 
bendamustine hydrochloride (HCl) as white to off-white lyophilized 
powder. 
 3.2.2 Solution Preparation:  
Aseptically reconstitute each 100 mg bendamustine vial with 20 mL 
of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. This yields a clear, colorless to a 
pale yellow solution with a bendamustine HCl concentration of 5 
mg/mL.  The lyophilized powder s hould completely dissolve in 5 
minutes. If particulate matter is obs erved, the reconstituted product 
should not be used. 
 
Aseptically withdraw the volume  needed for the required dose 
(based on 5 mg/mL concentration) and immediately transfer to a 500 mL infusion bag of 0.9% Sodi um Chloride Injection, USP 
(normal saline). The reconstituted solution must be transferred to 
the infusion bag within 30 minutes  of reconstitution. After 
transferring, thoroughly mix the cont ents of the infusion bag. The 
admixture should be a clear and colorl ess to slightly yellow solution. 
 Sterile Water for Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP must be used as outlined above. Compatibility with 
other diluents has not been determined.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any unused solution should be discar ded according to institutional 
procedures for antineoplastic agents.  
3.2.3 Handling and Disposal:  
Bendamustine is intended for adminis tration as an intravenous 
infusion over 30 minutes . 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 11 
 
As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and pr eparation of solutions prepared 
from bendamustine.  The use of gloves and safety glasses is recommended to avoid exposure in case  of breakage of the vial or 
other accidental spill age.  If a solution of bendamustine contacts 
the skin, wash the skin immediat ely and thoroughly with soap and 
water.  If bendamustine contacts  the mucous membranes, flush 
thoroughly with water.  Procedures for the proper handlin g and disposal of anticancer 
drugs should be considered. Severa l guidelines on the subject have 
been published. There is no general  agreement that all of the 
procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.  
3.2.4 Stability 
Bendamustine contains no antimicrobial preservative. The 
admixture should be prepared as clos e as possible to the time of 
patient administration.  Once d iluted with 0.9% S odium Chloride 
Injection, USP, the final admixtu re, is stable for 24 hours when 
stored refrigerated (2-8°C or 36-47° F) or for 3 hours when stored at 
room temperature (15-30°C or 59-86°F) and room light. Administration of bendamustine must be completed within this period.

 3.3 Rituximab: 
 3.3.1 Investigational Drug Nomenclature 
 
• IDEC Pharmaceuticals code designation Rituxan® 
• Generic Name: rituximab 
• IND Number: BB-IND 4904 
 
3.3.2 Clinical Formulation: 
Clinical supplies for this study wil l be manufactured by Genentech 
Incorporated in South San Francisco, CA. 
 Rituximab will be provided to the clinical sites packaged in single 
use 10 mL (100mg) and 50 mL (500m g) Type I glass vials at a 
concentration of 10 mg of protein per mL.  The product is formulated in 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate buffer, containing 7 mg/mL 
polysorbate 80, 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride and Sterile Water for Injection.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 13 
Rituximab may be produced by the mammalian (Chinese Hamster 
Ovary) cell suspension cu lture in a nutrient m edium containing 100 
mg/mL of the antibiotic gentamicin.  The antibiotic is not detectable 
in the final product.  
3.3.3 Storage 
Rituximab for clinical us e should be stored in a secure refrigerator 
at 2-8 °C. 
 
3.3.4 Reconstitution and Dilution of Rituximab 
Using a sterile syringe and a 21 gauge or larger needle, transfer the 
necessary amount of rituximab from t he vial into a partially filled IV 
pack containing sterile, pyrogen-f ree 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP 
(saline solution).  The final conc entration of rituximab should be 1 
mg/mL.  Mix by inve rting the bag gently.   
 Caution should be taken during the preparation of the drug.  Parenteral drug products shoul d be inspected visually for 
particulate matter prior to administr ation.  Preparations of rituximab 
containing visible particles sh ould not be used.  As with all 
parenteral drug products, aseptic procedures should be used during the preparation and admin istration of rituximab. 
 NOTE:  DO NOT USE A VACUUM  APPARATUS to transfer 
rituximab from the syringe to the infusion pack.  DO NOT USE evacuated glass containers, whic h require vented administration 
sets, because this causes foaming when air bubbles pass through the solution.

5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
After patients sign informed consent and scr eening is complete, all pretreatment 
evaluations have been done, a nd eligibility is confi rmed, patients may begin 
treatment.  Drug doses for Phase I and Ph ase II are detailed below.  Phase I will 
consist of fixed doses of fludarabine (20 mg/m
2, days 2-4) and rituximab (375-
500 mg/m2, day 4 or 1) with increasing doses of bendamustine as indicated.  
Patients will receive 6 courses and wi ll have response assessment prior to 
course 4 and 3 months afte r last course of FBR. 
 Phase I: Course 1 
Fludarabine 20 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Days 2,3,4  
Bendamustine 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/m2 IV, Days 1,2,3 (after 
fludarabine) Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV (fixed), Day 4 (a fter fludarabine) 
 Courses 2-6 
Fludarabine 20 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Days 1,2,3 
Bendamustine 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/m2 IV Days 1,2,3 (after 
fludarabine) Rituximab 500 mg/m
2 IV (fixed), Day 1 
 Courses will be every 4 weeks as permitted by recovery of blood counts, for total of 6 planned course s. The next course of FBR may  
begin when absolute neutrophil c ount (ANC) and platelets (PLT) 
have recovered to within 20% of pretreatment levels or ANC ≥  
1,200/ μL and PLT ≥ 75,000/ μL. For courses 2-6, bendamustine will 
be dose reduced to the next lower dose for patients experiencing prolonged myelosuppression defined as Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
or thrombocytopenia lasting longer  than Day 42 of the course for 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 16 
patients who begin treatm ent with normal neutrophil or PLT counts.  
For patients who begin treat ment with neutropenia (ANC 
<1,000/ μL) or thrombocytopenia (PLT <100,000/ μL), dose 
reduction of bendamustine to the ne xt lower dose will occur if 
neutrophil or platelet count does not recover to within 20% of the 
pre-treatment level of the previous  course.  For courses 2-6, intra-
patient dose escalation may occur to the next higher dose level for 
which there are 3 patients evaluat ed for toxicity and a decision for 
dose level expansion or dose escalation has been made.  
Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Fact or (G-CSF growth factor) may 
be used in courses 2-6.  To prevent Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) in patients with elevated WBC who may develop tumor lysis despite allopurinol therapy, consider the use of rasburicase for C1 if ALC >50K and uric acid >5 
and daily labs during chemother apy to monitor potassium, 
phosphorus, calcium and uric acid. 
 Phase II: Course 1 
Fludarabine 20 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Days 2,3,4 
Bendamustine 30 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Days 1, 2,3 (after fludarabine) 
Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Day 4 (a fter fludarabine) 
   Courses 2-6 
Fludarabine 20 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Days 1,2,3 
Bendamustine 30 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Days 1, 2,3 (after fludarabine) 
Rituximab 500 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Day 1 
 
Courses will be every 4 weeks as permitted by recovery of blood counts, for a  total of 6 planned courses. The next course of FBR 
may begin when ANC and PLT counts have recovered to within 
20% of pretreatment level or ANC >/= 1,200/ μL and PLT >/= 
75,000/ μL. Bendamustine will be dose reduced to the next lower 
dose for patients experiencing pr olonged myelosuppression defined 
as Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or th rombocytopenia lasting longer 
than Day 42 of the course for patients who begin treatment with 
normal neutrophil or PLT counts.  For patients who begin treatment 
with neutropenia (ANC <1,000/ μL) or thrombocytopenia (PLT 
<100,000/ μL), dose reduction of bendamustine to the next lower 
dose will occur if neutrophil or platelet count does not recover to 
within 20% of the pre-tr eatment level of the previous course.  G-
CSF growth factor may be used for courses 1-6 of Phase II. 
 
Dose adjustment for toxi city during Phase II:

Bendamustine 20 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Days 1,2 
Rituximab 500 mg/m2 IV (fixed), Day 1 
 The dose of fludarabine may be adjusted in Phase II for patients with renal insufficiency with reduction according to the fludarabine package insert. 
 5.1 Suggested premedications:  Anti-emetic (ondansetron 8 mg IV or 
equivalent) premedication will be give n 30 min prior to chemotherapy 
(fludarabine/bendamustine).  Premedicati on for rituximab will consist of 
325 mg-650 mg acetaminophen orally  and 25-50 mg diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride orally or intravenously.  Steroids may also be used at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  Other premedications or modifications 
of the above may be appropriate based  on the physician or patient 
experience.   
 5.2 Suggested supportive medications:  Allopurinol is recommended for at 
least the first week of course 1 for tumor lysis prophylaxis.  Valacyclovir 
(or equivalent) is recommended for her pes virus prophylaxis and Bactrim 
DS (or equivalent) for PCP prophylaxis .  For patients who were previously 
exposed to hepatitis B and ar e seropositive, consider ation should be given 
for lamivudine prophylaxis. 
 
For courses 2-6, growth factor (Neulasta or Neupogen, Erythropoietin 
[EPO]) will be allowed and doses of bendamustine may be adjusted as indicated above.   
 5.3 Administration of fludarabine 
Fludarabine will be admi nistered intravenous over 30 minutes after 
indicated premedication given.  On days where fludarabine and 
bendamustine are to be given, fludarabine will be given prior to bendamustine. 
 5.4 Administration of bendamustine 
Bendamustine will be administer ed IV over 30 minutes.   
 
5.5 Administration of rituximab:  
 During the rituximab infusion, the patient’s vital signs (blood pressure, 
pulse, respiration, temperature) shoul d be monitored.  Available at the 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014

Page 18 
bedside prior to rituxim ab administration will be a ppropriate measures for 
management of anaphylactic reactions. 
 
 The recommended first dose administration of rituximab is 50 mg/hr for 
the first hour.  If no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be escalated 
gradually (50 mg/hour increments at 30-minute intervals)  to a 
maximum of 500 mg/hr.  If the first dose of rituximab is well tolerated, the 
starting flow rate for the administrat ion of doses 2-6 may be 100 mg/hour 
then increased gradually (100 mg/hour increments at 30-minute 
intervals) . 
 
If the first infusion of rituximab is  well-tolerated, then for subsequent 
infusions (courses 2-6), accelerated administration of rituximab may be 
given. This consists of 20% of the full dose given over the first 30 min followed by the remaining 80% of the full dose given over the subsequent 
hour if the first 30 min is tolerated. For accelerated administration place 
doses less than 1,000 mg in 250 mL of normal saline and run 100mL for the first 30 minutes then the remaini ng 200 mL over 30 minutes (or until 
completed). For doses >1000 mg , the infusion should be 500 mL, with 
200 mL/hour for the first 30 minutes, then 400 mL/hour for 60 minutes (or 
until completed). 
  Patients may experience transient fever and rigors with infusion of 
chimeric anti-CD20 (ritu ximab) antibody.  When these side effects are 
noted, the antibody infusion should be slowed or interrupted, the patient should be observed and the severity of the side effects should be 
evaluated.  The patient s hould be treated according to the best available 
local practices and procedures.  Followi ng observation, when the patient’s 
symptoms improve, the in fusion should be continued, initially, at half the 
previous rate (see Table 1. below).  Upon resolution of all side effects and 
in the judgment of the investigator , the patient’s dose may be gradually 
escalated (50 mg/hr increments at 30 mi nute intervals) to a maximum rate 
of 300 mg/hr.  Following the antibody infusion, the IV line should be kept 
open for medications, as needed.  If complications occur during the rituximab infusion, the patient should be observed for two hours after the completion of the infusion. 
 
Since transient hypotension has been r eported during rituximab infusions, 
consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive 
medications the day of the rituximab infusion.

5.6 Patients achieving a stable partia l response or demonstrating continued 
response after 3 courses will be given an additional 3 courses.  No patient 
will receive more than 6 courses. 
 5.7 Patients demonstrating progressive  disease or no response after 3 
courses of treatment will come off study. 
 5.8 Dose adjustment to the next lo wer level will be made if pneumonia, 
septicemia, or other life-threatening infe ction occurs with any course.  If 
recovery of the platelet count to t he level prior to treatment exceeds 35 
days, the dose will be decr eased 1 level.  If grade 3 or  4 toxicities to other 
organ systems develop, the dose level will be lowered 1 or 2 levels 
respectively.  
5.9 Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and 
laboratory signs of active HBV infe ction and for signs of hepatitis 
throughout their study  participation. 
 
6.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION 
 
Patients will undergo screening to evaluate and confirm eligibility.  Upon 
confirming eligibility, pat ients will proceed with treat ment on this trial.  
Screening evaluation, including l aboratory tests will be done within 2 
weeks of starting treatment. 
 
6.1 Screening will consist of medical history and physical examination and 
pertinent laboratories including SMA12 and CBC with differential, serum β-
2 microglobulin, as well as a pregnancy te st (serum or urine) for females 
of childbearing potential.  This will c onfirm eligibility and provide baseline 
measurements of lymph node,  spleen, and liver size  and blood counts that 
will be used for response assessment. 
 6.2 Patients will be screened for hepatitis  exposure and infection by serum 
HBcAb, HBsAb and HBsAg. Patients will have bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with samples sent for differ ential and morphology within 2 months 
of starting treatment.  Patients will have thei r prognostic factors 
characterized on pretreatment bl ood or bone marrow including presence 
of cytogenetic abnormalities (FISH for 13q
-, +12, 11q-, and 17p-), 
expression of ZAP70 and CD38, and serum thymidine kinase.  If already 
known, the following prognostic factors do not need to be reevaluated since they are not expected to change: leukemia cell IGHV gene 
mutational status and ZAP-70 expression.

6.3 Any appropriate radiological and radioisotopic examinations should be 
performed as clinically indicated. 
 
6.4 Optional blood (20 mL) will be taken to isolate and store pretreatment 
mononuclear cells, DNA, RNA, and plas ma.  Optional bone marrow will be 
taken (5 mL) to isolate and store cells, DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and 
marrow plasma.  Gene methylation analyses will be performed on these 
pre-treatment samples to corr elate with treatment outcome.

thereafter for both Phase I and II.  An SMA 12 (bilirubi n, creatinine, 
albumin, LDH) will be done weekly (±3 days) for the first course for Phase 
I.  For Phase I, courses 2-6 and for patients on Phase II, SMA 12 will be 
done before each course and as  clinically indicated.   Physical examination 
every follow-up visit at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). 
 
7.2 Before course 4 and after 6 courses of treatment or the last course if fewer 
than 6 given, a full evaluation for response assessment will be performed 
including CBC, platelet and differential count, SMA (bilirubin, creatinine, 
albumin, LDH), and bone marrow aspira tion and biopsy with samples sent 
for differential, flow cytometry, and morphologic analysis.  Bone marrow 
will be evaluated by flow cytometry for minimal residual disease (4-color 
flow will be done).  A confirmatory CT  of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
will be done for patients in clinical complete remission. 
 
7.3 Myelosuppression and associated complications are expected events 
during leukemia therapy and are par t of the treatment success (marrow 
emptying of leukemia cells).  Ther efore, myelosuppression and associated 
complications such as fever, in fections, bleeding, and related 
hospitalizations, will not be reported as individual ADRs, but will be summarized in the updated and final re ports.  Only prolonged Grade 3-4 
myelosuppression, as defined by the 2008 IWCLL criteria specific for 
leukemia, i.e., marrow cellularity <5% on day 42 or later (6 weeks) from 
start of therapy without  evidence of leukemia, will be reported as ADR and 
considered in defining the maxi mum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) of particular agents or regimens. 
 7.4 Repeat response assessments by ph ysical examination, blood counts, 
and bone marrow evaluation, including fo r MRD will be done 6, 12, and 24 
months after last treatment course unt il relapse.  Evaluation for MRD may 
be done on blood.  Blood or marrow for MRD evaluation may be taken by referring physician and mailed to UTMD ACC.  Follow-up will be annually 
thereafter and bone marrow examinations  will be done at t he discretion of 
the treating physician for those visits. 
 7.5 Optional blood (10 ml) may be taken to determine rituximab levels prior to 
rituximab dose with each course and on day 4 (±2 days) of course 1 and 
day 3 (±1 day) of courses 2-6. 
 
Optional blood may be taken by the referring physician in a green-top (heparin) tube and shipped overnight to  UTMDACC.  For shipping, each 
tube will be labeled with the patien ts’ name, MDACC MRN, date and time 
of drawing.  Samples will be shipped sa me day they are drawn.  Tubes will

 7.6 Optional blood (20 mL) may be ta ken at response assessment (end of 
treatment) and follow-up visits after co mpletion of treatment to monitor for 
immune reconstitution.  Immune recons titution samples will be evaluated 
for T cell and normal B cell populations, T cell receptor repertoire, T cell functional subsets defined by multi-co lor flow cytometry.  Optional blood 
may be taken by referring physician in a green-top tube (heparin) and mailed to UTMDACC. 
 
8.0 TOXICITY EVALUATIO N AND RESPONSE CRITERIA 
 
Non-hematologic toxicity  will be described and graded by the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event s (CTCAE) Version 3.  Hematologic 
toxicity will be graded according to the 2008 IWCLL criteria for grading (Table 3)
4. 
 
Protocol 2009-0546

Table 3. – Grading of Myelosuppression 
Grade Decrease in PLT* or 
HGB** (nadir) from 
pretreatment value, % Absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC)/ μl*** 
(nadir) 
0 < 10% ≥ 2000 
1 11 – 24% ≥ 1500 – < 2000 
2 25 – 49% ≥ 1000 – < 1500 
3 50 – 74% ≥ 500 – < 1000 
4 ≥ 75% < 500 
Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any level of decrease from pretreatment 
will be recorded as grade 5. 
* PLT counts must be below normal levels for grades 1-4.  If, at any level of 
decrease, the PLT count is < 20K/ μl, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, 
unless there was severe or life-threat ening low initial PLT count (< 20K/ μl) 
pretreatment, in which case the patient is not evaluable for toxicity referable 
to PLT count. 
** HGB levels must be below normal le vels for grades 1-4.  Baseline and 
subsequent HGB determinations must be performed before any given 
transfusions. 
*** If the ANC reaches <1000 /μl, it should be judged to be grade 3 toxicity.  If the 
ANC was <1000 /μl before therapy, the patient is not evaluable for toxicity 
referable to the ANC. 
 
Responses will be evaluated by the updated 2008 IWCLL Response Criteria 
(Table 4), including staging with CT  scan and bone marrow evaluation for 
minimal residual disease for patients in complete remission4.  Bone marrow will 
be evaluated for minimal residual disease by 4-color flow cytometry for patients 
in clinical complete remission.  For pat ients in clinical complete remission, a 
confirmatory CT scan of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis wi ll be done.  Lymph 
nodes 1.5 cm in diameter or smaller will be considered normal and consistent 
with complete remission.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 26 
 
 10.1 Phase I 
A standard 3+3 design will be used to evaluate for tolerability and toxicities 
of combined bendamustine (increasing doses), fludarabine, and rituximab 
in previously treated patients wit h CLL. The DLT and MTD will be 
evaluated based on the information from t he first course (4 weeks) of the 
combination therapy. 
 
DLT will be defined as treatment-related, Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic 
toxicity.  Hematologic toxicity grade ≥ 3 that lasts longer than 42 days will 
be considered a DLT (see Section 8) . Since TLS is associated with 
therapeutic activity of th is regimen and since it is medically manageable, 
TLS will not be considered a DLT (s ee Section 5). Fixed doses of 
fludarabine and rituximab will be given.  There will be up to 4 dose levels 
for bendamustine including: 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/m2 daily x3.  
 Applying the “3+3” design, the first c ohort of 3 patients will be treated at 
the first dose level and evaluated for toxicity. The algorithm is as follows: (1) If 0 out of 3 patients experiences DLT, the next cohort of 3 patients will 
be treated at the next higher dose level.  (2) If 1 out of 3 patients develop 
DLT, an additional 3 patient s will be treated at  the same dose level. At this 
level, if 1 out of 6 pat ients had DLT, the dose escalation continues. If 2 out 
of 6 patients experience DLT, the dos e level exceeds the MTD and 3 more 
patients will be treated at the next lo wer dose if there are less than 6 
patients already treated at that dose.  (3) If greater than 1 out of 3 patients 
experiences DLT, the dose level exceeds the MTD and 3 more patients will be treated at the next lower dose if there are less than 6 patients already treated at that dos e.  In summary, MTD is defined as the highest 
dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with less than or equal to 
1 patient experiencing DLT.   Toxicity evaluation will be completed within 1 
course of therapy for all 3 patients.  No patient will be enrolled in the next 
dose level until the toxicity is fully a ssessed in all 3 patients enrolled at the 
previous dose level.  For courses 2- 6, intra-patient dose escalation may 
occur to the next higher level for whic h there are 3 patients evaluated for 
toxicity and a decision for  dose level expansion or dose escalation has 
been made. Given these 4 dose levels , the maximum number of patients 
required is 24 for this Phase I trial. The 6 patients treated at the tolerated 
dose will be included in the Phase II analysis.  
10.2 Phase II 
The efficacy will be assessed in the Phase II part, using the Simon’s two-
stage MinMax design. Overall respons e will be assessed 2 months after 
the 6
th or last course if patients are not  able to receiv e all 6 intended  
courses of treatment. The treatment will be considered promising if the 
complete remission rate is 40% or hi gher, and will be c onsidered unworthy 
of further investigation if the complete remission rate is 25% or lower. The 
Protocol 2009-0546 
August 1, 2014 
Version 8 
Page 27 
sample size of 64 is chosen to differentiate between the complete 
remission rate of 40% and 25% with 90% power at a significance level of 
0.1. In particular, 39 patients will be enr olled at the first stage. If 9 or fewer 
of the first 39 patients respond, t he trial will be terminated; otherwise 
another 25 patients will be treated for a total of 64 patients. If 20 or fewer 
patients respond among 64 patients, the treatment will be concluded 
ineffective. The probability of early termination due to futility is 0.48. 
 In addition, the probability of toxici ty will be monitored based on the 
Bayesian model (beta-binomial), assumi ng a priori that p = Prob(toxicity) ~ 
beta(1,1). The trial will be terminated if Prob(p > .30 | data) > .80. This rule 
will be applied contin uously starting from the 6th evaluable patient and will 
stop the trial if [number of toxiciti es]/[number of patients evaluated] is 
greater than or equal to: 3/6, 4/8, 5/10, 6/13, 7/ 16, 8/19, 9/22, 10/25, 
11/28, 12/31, 13/34, 14/37,  15/40, 16/43, 17/46, 18/49, 19/52, 20/55, 
21/58, 22/61.   The expected rate of accrual onto the trial is 0.2 patient s per month. The 
maximum sample size in Phase I is 24. The patient s in Phase I at a dose 
level of MTD will be used for the Phas e II part since this dosage is used in 
the Phase II. The maximum number of pati ents expected to enter in to this 
Phase I/II is 82 (= 24+ 64 -6).  Phase II will include 64 patients to ev aluate the efficacy and tolerability of 
the FBR combination in previously treated patients with CLL.  We will 
estimate the complete, partial, and overall response rate with 95% confidence interval.  In addition,  we will determine the median PFS and 
TTF and 95% confidence interval.  We will also evaluate associations between the prognostic factors and re sponse and time-to-event endpoints. 
Efficacy endpoints for Phase I and II will be evaluated by the 2008 IWCLL criteria.  We will ev aluate the complete, nodular partial and partial 
response rates.  We aim to improve t he complete remission rate from the 
expected 25% for the FCR regimen to  40% as the primary objective. 
Safety end-points will be tolerability and toxicity of therapy.  The tolerated 
dose of bendamustine will be the highest dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 
patients experience grade 3,  non-hematologic, non-infusion related toxicity 
involving a major organ system.  The maximum tolerated dose will have been exceeded if 2 or more  of 6 patients experience grade 3 or higher, 
non-hematologic, non-infusion relat ed toxicity a major organ system. 
 
11.0 PHARMACODYNAMIC AND PHARMACOKINETIC ENDPOINTS  
 
These investigations will be perfo rmed in Drs. Gandhi and Plunkett’s 
laboratory.  Patients with more than 5,000 WBC/µl of peripheral blood who 
agree to participate in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
Protocol 2009-0546

investigations will be ev aluated. Not all samples will be collected in all 
patients at all time-points. 
Please page Yuling Chen (713-404-2550), Min Fu (7 13-606-2212), or call 
713-792-3336 to inform of registrati on date and to arrange for blood 
sampling. Blood samples (10 ml) will be coll ected at the following times: 
Day 1 Bendamustine alone: 
• Pre treatment (0 h), 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h,  after the start of the first bendamustine 
infusion.   
Day 2 Fludarabine followed by bendamustine: • 24 h (prior to fludarabine), 26.5 h, 28.5 h,  and 30.5 h  (2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, after 
start of bendamustine infusion).   
Day 3 Fludarabine followed by bendamustine: • 48 h (prior to fludarabine) 
These samples will be processed to collect plasma and cells.  Plasma will be 
stored for future pharmacokinetic analyses, if needed, by Cephalon .  Cells will be 
processed for the following endpoints. 
1. DNA damage response using H2AX phosphorylation as a biomarker 
2. Cell death measurements by Annexin V assay 
3. Quantitation of intracellular level of fludarabine triphosphate by HPLC 
(only in 28.5 hr sample) 
4. Cell pellet for immunoblot assays for DNA damage response, DNA repair, 
and recovery of DNA damage. 
These assays will primarily measure bendamustine induced DNA damage 
response and recovery of the DNA repair .  In addition, we will determine if 
circulating leukemia cells undergo apoptosis.  These studies will also compare if there is an increase in DNA damage response and/or cell death when bendamustine is infused alone (day 1)  versus when bendamustine is 
administered with fludarabine (day 2).  For these comparative analyses, each 
patient serves as his or her own c ontrol.  Augmentation of DNA damage 
response will be compared wit h intracellular fludarabin e triphosphate peak (peak 
occurs 4 h after fludarabine infusion
44.  Correlations will be sought between these 
laboratory endpoints and cytor eduction and/or clinical response to therapy.

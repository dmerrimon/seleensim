 CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDM ENT HISTORY  
Amendment 5  
The protocol was amended in response to recent nonclinical findings in the rabbit. The table 
below summarizes the changes and the affected sections:  
Change  Sections Changed  
In an embryofetal development toxicology 
study in rabbits, incomplete ossification of 
the 15th vertebra was observed in some 
fetuses resulting from the mating of male 
rabbits exposed to evinacumab with female 
rabbits not exposed to evinacumab. In male 
rabbits, there were measurable levels of 
evinacumab in  seminal fluid and, as a safety 
measure, the current clinical study is 
amended to require consistent use of a 
condom for all sexually active males.  Section  6.2.3  Exclusion Criteria  #28

Amendment 4  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to update the study population and entry criteria to:  
 Allow patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH ) who are not 
taking a background statin due to intolerability to at least 2 statins .  This change is 
being made to include a patient population with high unmet medical need that 
requires further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) lowering.  
 Change  the inclusion LDL -C threshold for all patients with a history of clinical 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD ) from 100 mg/dL (2.59  mmol/L) to 
70 mg/dL (1.8 1 mmol/L).  This change aligns with clinical practice and dyslipidemia 
treatment guidelines.  The study population enrolled in this study consists of high -risk 
patie nts, who are recommended to achieve an LDL -C <70  mg/dL (1.8 1 mmol/L).  
Additional major changes include increasing the duration of the open -label treatment period for 
Group  B from 24 weeks to 48 weeks.  This change has been  made to increase the amount of 
long-term safety information obtained on the evinacumab 15 mg/kg Q4W dose regimen, ensuring 
at least 52 weeks of continuous exposure with this  regimen for all patients randomized to the 
intravenous ( IV) treatment groups.

Change the inclusion LDL -C threshold for 
all patients from 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) 
to 70  mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L).  This change 
aligns with clinical practice and dyslipidemia 
treatment guidelines.  The study population 
enrolled in this study consists of high -risk 
patients, who are recomm ended to achieve 
an LDL -C <70  mg/dL (1.81  mmol/L).

treatment period.  The rationale for this 
change is that since patients in Group B/IV 
treatment groups will be in the study for over 
a year, patients’ lipid values will be disclosed 
when at steady state on evinacumab 15 Section  5.1 Study Description and Duration

mg/kg IV Q4W to allow patients and 
investigators to be aware of the patients’ 
lipid levels.  
Added a goal attainment threshold of 
50 mg/dL  as a secondary endpoint , as current 
lipid treatment guidelines are expected to 
change  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis (Secondary Endpoints)  
Section  4.2.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
For clarity, included the numbers of patients 
enrolled into each treatment group.  Section  6.1 Number of Patients Planned  
Revised the target population to allow 
patients up to 80 years of age (because they 
should respond similarly in terms  of both 
efficacy and safety ).  Clarified the target 
population to state that the study will aim to 
enroll, at a minimum, 25% of patients with 
LDL -C ≥130  mg/dL (3.37  mmol/L) to 
understand efficacy and safety in patients 
with higher baseline LDL -C levels.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis (Target Population)  
Section  6.2 Study Population  
Section  6.2.2  Inclusion Criteria  
To be consistent with the recommendations 
from the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 
(CTFG) on contraception and pregnancy 
testing in clinical trials, clarified sexual 
abstinence as “True abstinence: When this is 
in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the patient. Periodic abstinence (calendar, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), 
withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides 
only, and lactational ame norrhea method 
(LAM) are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.”  
Also included prohibiting oocyte donation.  Section  6.2.3  Exclusion Criteria  
Remov ed exclusion criterion prohibiting 
insulin usage, because uncontrolled diabetes, 
defined as HbA1c > 9%, is already an 
exclusion criterion and is sufficient to 
exclude patients with diabetes that might 
confound the safety results.  Section  6.2.3  Exclusion Criteria  
Clarified that the IV dose should be prepared 
using the patient’s most recent weight  Section  7.1 Investigational Treatments and Reference

Change  Sections Changed  
Added a 24 -week open -label treatment 
period after the 24 -week double -blind 
treatment period for the IV groups . The 
purpose of this change was  to obtain  long-
term safety  information with continuous 
exposure of evinacumab  IV for up to 48 
weeks.  
As a result, the mandatory 24 -week follow -
up period for the IV treatment groups was 
removed to allow patients to go directly into 
a separate OL study after completing the 
double -blind treatment period and open -
label treatm ent period.   Patients who do not 
participate in the OL study would enter a 24 -

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Safety and 
Efficacy of Varying Doses and Dose Regimens of Evinacumab in Patients 
with Pers istent Hypercholesterolemia Despite Maximally Tolerated Lipid 
Modifying Therapy  
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  Multi -national  (US and globally)  
Multi -center  
Objective(s)  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the reduction of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) by evinacumab in comparison 
to placebo after 16 weeks in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia 
(heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  [HeFH ], or non -HeFH with a 
history of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovas cular disease [clinical ASCVD]) 
with persistent hypercholesterolemia despite receiving maximally -tolerated 
lipid-modifying treatment (LMT).  Persistent hypercholesterolemia is 
defined as LDL -C ≥70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) for those patients with clinical 
ASCVD and LDL -C ≥100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) for those patients without 
clinical ASCVD . 
Secondary objectives of the study are:  
 To evaluate the dose -response effect of evinacumab on other lipid 
parameters ( ie, apolipoprotein [Apo] B, non -high-density 
lipoprotein chol esterol [non -HDL -C], total  cholesterol [TC], 
Lp(a), HDL -C, triglycerides [TGs], ApoA1, apolipoprotein  CIII 
[ApoCIII ], and total Angiopoietin -like 3 [ANGPTL3 ]) in patients 
with primary hypercholesterolemia  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutan eous (SC) and 
intravenous (IV) doses of evinacumab in patients with primary 
hypercholesterolemia  
 To assess systemic serum concentrations of evinacumab in patients 
with primary hypercholesterolemia  
 To evaluate the potential development of anti -evinacumab 
antibodies  
Study Design  This is a phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
dose-ranging study to assess varying doses of SC and IV regimens of 
evinacumab in patients diagnosed with primary hypercholesterolemia 
(HeFH, or non -HeFH with a history of clinical ASCVD) with persistent 
hypercholesterolemia despite receiving maximally -tolerated LMT.  
Persistent hypercholesterolemia is defined as LDL -C ≥70  mg/dL 
(1.81  mmol/L) for those patients with clinical ASCVD and LDL -C 
≥100  mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) for those patients without clinical ASCVD .

 CONFIDENTIAL  The study consists of 4  (for Group A  [SC treatment  group s]) or 5 (for 
Group  B [IV treatment group s) periods: run -in period (for patients whose 
background LMT has not been stable prior to screening, w ho are not already 
receiving a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [ PCSK9 ] inhibitor  
antibody , or whose background LMT has not been optimized), a 2-week 
screening  period , a 16-week double -blind treatment period for the SC dose 
group s or a 24-week  double -blind treatment period for the IV dose group s, 
an approximately  48-week open -label treatment period  for the IV dose 
group s, and a follow -up period that lasts 24  weeks after the last dose of study 
drug.  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for a patient is approximately 4 1 or 90 weeks, for 
the SC and IV groups, respectively.  This includes the screening, 
double -blind treatment, open -label  treatment  (for IV group) , and follow -up 
periods .  All patients who successfully complete this study (or successfully 
complete the double -blind treatmen t period and open -label treatme nt period 
for patients in the IV treatment groups) may  have the opportunity  to enroll  
in an open -label extension or safety study . All patients who enroll in the 
open -label extens ion or safety study will continue to receive evinacumab.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Expected total number of patients is 252  (Group A 144; Group B 108) . 
 Target Population:  Adult men and women, ages 18 to 80, with primary hypercholesterolemia 
(HeFH*, or non-HeFH with a history of clinical ASCVD) with LDL -C 
≥70** mg/dL  (1.81 mmol/L) , despite receiving maximally -tolerated  LMT.   
Background LMT would include a stable maximally -tolerated statin and 
stable PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for patients who are HeFH or n on-HeFH 
with a history of clinical ASCVD.  Patients with HeFH not on a statin are 
allowed to participate if there is documentation of inability to tolerate a t least 
2 statin s. 
*HeFH may be diagnosed by at least 1 of the following:  
1. Genotyping  
2. World Health Organization /Dutch Lipid Network  or Simon 
Broome criteria.  
** Efforts will be made to enroll, at a minimum,  25% of patients with 
LDL -C ≥ 130 mg/dL  (3.37 mmol/L) .  Approximately 25% of the population 
is targeted to have a baseline LDL -C ≥100 mg/dL (2.59  mmol /L). 
Please note: To ensure an adequate number of patients with HeFH, 
randomization will be stratified 2:1 (HeFH:non -HeFH; 24:12) within each 
treatment group.

 CONFIDENTIAL   Dose/Route/Schedule:  Patients will be randomized to either Group A or Group B. Completing 
enrollment and randomizing patients into Group B will occur prior to 
commencing enrollment into Group A .  The evinacumab dose regimens for 
Group A and Group B are  as follows:  
Group A  
 Evinacumab 300 mg SC once every week  (QW) , for 16 weeks, or   
 Evinacumab 300 mg SC once every 2 weeks  (Q2W) , for 16  weeks  
(alternating with placebo on opposite weeks) , or 
 Evinacumab 450 mg SC  QW, for 16 weeks  
Group B  
 Evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV once every 4 weeks  (Q4W) , for 24  weeks, 
or 
 Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W , for 24 weeks  
In the open -label  treatment period, patients in Group B will rec eive 
15 mg/kg IV of evinacumab Q4W  for 48 weeks  
 Placebo  
 Route/Schedule:   Group A:  Placebo SC QW, for 16 weeks  
 Group B:  Placebo IV Q4W , for 24 weeks  
 Background Treatment  Statin (HMG CoA reductase inhibitor)  
PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody  
Endpoint(s)   
 Primary:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in calculated LDL -C 
from baseline to week 16 in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, using all 
LDL -C values regardless of adherence to treatment and subsequent 
therapies . 
 Secondary:  The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
 Percent change in ApoB from baseline to week  16 
 Percent change in non -HDL -C from baseline to week  16 
 Percent change in TC from baseline to week  16 
 Proportion of p atients with ≥ 30% reduction in  calculated LDL -C 
at week  16 
 Proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in calculated LDL -C 
at week  16 
 Percent change in TGs from baseline to week  16 
 Perce nt change in Lp(a) from baseline to week  16

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 19 of 97 
 CONFIDENTIAL   Proportion of patients with calculated LDL -C < 70 mg/dL  
(1.81  mmol/L)  at week  16 
 Proportion of patients with calculated LDL -C < 50  mg/dL 
(1.30 mmol/L) at week 16  
 Percent change in calculated LDL -C, ApoB, non -HDL -C, TC, TG, 
and Lp(a) from baseline to week  24 (only applicable to those 
patients receiving IV route of study treatment administration)  
Procedures and Assessments  The efficacy of evinacumab will be assessed by clinical laboratory 
evaluation of lipid levels at pre -specified time points throughout the study.   
Lipid parameters include: TC, calculated LDL -C, HDL -C, TG, non -HDL -
C, Lp(a), ApoA1, ApoB, and ApoCIII.  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical evaluation of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), physical examination, vital 
signs, electrocardiogram ( ECG ), and clinical laboratory tests.  Patients will 
be monitored for all TEAEs experienced from the tim e of informed consent 
until their end of study visit.  
Pharmacokinetics  will be assessed by analysis of evinacumab drug 
concentrations.  
Immunogenicity will be assessed by analysis for anti -drug antibodies to 
evinacumab.  
Additional pharmacodynamic effects will be assessed by analysis of  total 
ANGPTL3.  
Statistical Plan  Justification of the sample size  
Four pairwise comparisons of evinacumab to a placebo control arm 
corresponding to the route of administration ( Group A or Group B ) are 
hypothesized for the primary efficacy analysis of this study.  A total of 216 
patients are planned for assessing the primary measure at week 16.  
Specifically, a sample size of 36 patients per treatment arm will have 90% 
power to detect a treatment g roup differ ence in mean percent change LDL -C 
of 20% in any 1  pairwise comparison ( ie, evinacumab mean = 27% and 
control mean =  7%), assuming that the common standard deviation (SD) is 
25 using an independent group t -test.  This sample size has been adjusted 
for a 5%  dropout rate.  The alpha level for each of the 4 pairwise 
comparisons is 0.05 (2 -sided), and assumes control of the overall type -1 
error rate using a pre -specified hierarchical inferential approach.  
Further, the evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen has been added to 
Group  B, allowing for an assessment of dose -response in the IV route of 
administration. The additional 36 patients for this second IV dose regimen 
culminate in a total of 252 patients planned for the study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Current medications for lowering low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) include statins, 
cholesterol absorption inhibitors, fibrates, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor  antibodie s.  Statins are the most commonly prescribed 
medicati ons because they are inexpensive and have demonstrated the ability to reduce coronary 
heart disease (CHD) events.  However, even with statin therapy, many patients still have residual 
cardiovascular (CV) risk ( Ridker 2009 ).  Twenty -two percent (22%) of patients with a history of 
prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 10% of patients without a history of prior CVD experience 
a CV event in statin trials ( Baigent 2005 , Baigent 2010 ).   
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  (PCSK9) inhibitors have been shown to lower 
LDL -C by approximately 60% in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
(HeFH) on maximally tolerated statin therapy ( Kastelein 2 015), and have recently been approved 
as adjunct to statins in patients with HeFH who require additional LDL -C lowering 
(Praluent®  and Repatha®  Product Information ).  In the recent Odyssey familial 
hypercholesterolemia ( FH) 1 and FH  2 studies comparing alirocumab on top of maximally 
tolerated statin  therapy  (with or without ezetimibe) in patients with HeFH and LDL -C ≥ 70 mg/dL 
with a history of myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke or LDL -C ≥ 100 mg/dL without a history of 
MI/stroke, tre atment with alirocumab reduced LDL -C by up to a mean of 48.8% after 24 weeks 
(Kastelein 2015 ).  Although the majority of patients achieved their target LDL -C goal, up to 19% 
and 28% in the FH  1 and FH 2 studies, respectively, did not meet their LDL -C target after 24  weeks 
of treatment.  
One group of patients recognized to remain far from their LDL -C goal are those patients with 
severe HeFH, often defined as having a n on -treatment  LDL -C > 200  mg/dL.  However, only 
approximately 2% of  patients with severe elevations in LDL -C, despite statin therapy, have an 
identified FH -causing mutation ( low-density lipoprotein receptor [ LDL -R], apolipoprotein  B 
[ApoB ], PCSK9) ( Khera 2016 , Abul -Husn 20 16).  Further, those patients with severely elevated 
LDL -C, but without evidence of an FH -causing mutation have a 6 -fold increased risk of coronary 
artery disease (CAD), compared with those non -FH patients with an LDL -C <130  mg/dL 
(Khera  2016 ).  Thus, pati ents who require additional LDL -C lowering, despite 
maximally  tolerated statin and PCSK9 inhibitor antibody therapy, include not only those patients 
with HeFH, but also those with polygenic etiologies.  
Data generated with both alirocumab and evolocumab in patients not able to tolerate a statin due 
to muscle -related symptoms highlight another group of patients not able to achieve their LDL -C 
goal who require additional LDL -C lowering despite available tre atment options.  The Odyssey 
Alternative study evaluated the effect of alirocumab in patients at moderate to high CV risk who 
were  unable to tolerate a statin due to muscle symptoms.  At week  24, 41.9%  of patients on 
alirocumab achieved their treatment goa l (LDL -C <70  mg/dL [1.8 1 mmol/L] in 
very-high-cardiovascular -risk patients , or <100 mg/dL [<2. 59 mmol/L] in moderate -to-high-risk 
patients) (Moriarty 2015 ).  Similarly, evol ocumab was also evaluated  in patients unable to tolerate 
a statin due to muscle -related symptoms.  In GAUSS -3, approximately 32% of the study 
population was able to achieve an LDL -C of <70 mg/dL (1.8 1 mmol/L) at week  24 (Nissen 2016 ).  
Over 50% of the study population s in these trials were not able to achieve their target LDL -C goal.  
Despite treatment with potent agents like PCSK9 inhibitor  antibodies , a sizeable proportion of the 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  patients not able to tolerate a statin will  not achieve their  LDL -C goal and will require additional 
lipid-lowering therapies.  
Angiopoietin -like 3 (ANGPTL3) has recently emerged as an attractive target for the treatment of 
elevated levels of LDL -C and triglycerides (TGs), both factors for the devel opment of CVD.  
Subjects who are homozygous for loss -of-function (LOF) mutations in ANGPTL3 have 
significantly lower levels of TGs as compared to non -carrier controls.  Those with ANGPTL3 LOF 
mutations also exhibit lower LDL -C levels (mean difference of 48 % versus non -carriers for the 
mutations).  The mechanism by which ANGPTL3 LOF mutations result in lower LDL -C levels is 
not fully understood, but appears to be independent of the effects on TGs, and occurs through a 
pathway independent of the LDL -R.  It is  noteworthy that patients with 1 or 2 ANGPTL3 LOF 
alleles also have reported reductions in serum high -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) levels.  
The mechanism for this appears to be related to the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL3 on endothelial 
lipase (E L), which is involved in the hydrolysis of HDL phospholipids.  No health deficits have 
been reported in the (relatively small number of) patients who are homozygous for ANGPTL3 
LOF mutations.  Importantly, population genetic studies indicate that patients heterozygous for 
ANGPTL3 LOF mutations have reduced CV risk.  These data suggest that inhibiting ANGPTL3 
may be a meaningful strategy for lowering serum lipids in patients whose elevated LDL -C levels 
place them at significant residual CV risk, despite othe rwise optimized lipid -lowering therapy.  
REGN1500, also known as evinacumab, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically 
binds to and inhibits ANGPTL3.  Preclinical and early clinical studies have demonstrated that the 
administration of evinacuma b results in a reduction of serum LDL -C and serum TGs.  
Non-clinical experiments performed in animals demonstrate the in vivo effects of ANGPTL3, and 
ANGPTL3 blockade with evinacumab.  Angiopoietin -like 3 knockout mice, including those fed a 
western or hig h-fat diet, have lower levels of LDL -C and TGs than those of wild -type mice.  In 
several mouse models, administration of evinacumab  induced reductions in both LDL -C (up to 
46% in ApoE -/- mice) and TGs (up to 72% in Ap oE-/- mice).  Reductions in HDL -C of 
approximately 35% were also observed in ApoE -/- mice.  In hyperlipidemic LDL -R-deficient 
(LDL -R-/-) mice, a single dose of 10 mg/kg of evinacumab reduced LDL -C levels by up to 23%, 
supporting the hypothesis that the reductions in LDL -C likely occurs through a pathway 
independent of the LDL -R. 
In a phase 1, first -in-human, placebo -controlled, double -blind, single ascending dose study 
(R1500 -HV-1214) of the safety, tolerability, and bioeffect of varying dose levels of evinacumab 
administered subcutaneously (SC)  or intravenously (IV) to patients with TGs 150 -450 mg/dL 
and/or LDL -C ≥ 100 mg/dL, administration of evinacumab was associated with dose -dependent 
reductions in LDL -C.  The maximal mean percent LDL -C decrease from baseline of 27.8% was 
observed on day 15 in the 20 mg/kg IV group (n=11) compared to a decrease of 4.5% in the placebo 
IV group (n= 12).  The duration of LDL -C reduction was dose -dependent and appeared to extend 
at least 64 days after administration of evinacumab 20 mg/kg IV.  Evinacumab was well -tolerated 
at all dose levels up to 20 mg/kg IV.  
In a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multiple ascending dose  study 
(study  R1500 -CL-1321) of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), immunogenicity, and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of e vinacumab in otherwise healthy patients with mixed 
dyslipidemia (TGs 150 -500 mg/dL and LDL -C ≥ 100 mg/dL), repeated administration of 
evinacumab over the 8 -week double -blind treatment period was associated with continuous,

 CONFIDENTIAL  dose-dependent reductions in LDL -C up to approximately 40%.  The duration of LDL -C reduction 
with evinacumab administration was dose -dependent.  It took ap proximately 6 weeks for the 
LDL -C level to return to baseline for all SC doses and 9 weeks for the IV dose group. Evinacumab 
was well -tolerated at all dose levels up to 20 mg/kg IV.  
In an ongoing open -label, single -arm, proof -of-concept (POC) study in 9 patients with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) (Study R1500 -CL-1331), evinacumab 
demonstrated a mean percent change from baseline in LDL -C at week  4 of 49%, with a duration 
of effect approximately 10 weeks after a single 15 mg/kg IV dose.   In this study, e vinacumab , at 
doses up to 15 mg/kg IV , has exhibited an acceptable safety profile.  
The primary objective of the current study is to assess the PD effect  of varying doses/dose regimens 
of SC and IV administered evinacumab on serum LDL -C in patients with primary 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH  [heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia] , or non -HeFH with a 
history of clinical  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  [ASCVD ]) with persistent 
hypercholesterolemia despite receiving maximally -tolerated lipid -modifying treatment (LMT).  
Persistent hypercholesterolemia is defined as LDL -C ≥70  mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) for those patients 
with cl inical ASCVD and LDL -C ≥100  mg/dL (2.59  mmol/L) for those patients without clinical 
ASCVD . 
Additional background information on the study drug and development program can be found in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

comparison to placebo after 16 weeks in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, or 
non-HeFH with a history of clinical ASCVD) with persistent hypercholester olemia despite 
receiving maximally -tolerated LMT.  Persistent hypercholesterolemia is defined as LDL -C

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypothesis  
It is hypothesized that evinacumab will reduce LDL -C in patients who need further LDL -C 
lowering, despite standard of c are treatment, including maximally -tolerated statin and PCSK9 
inhibitor antibody therapy.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
No randomized placebo -controlled clinical CV  outcome trials of statin treatment have been 
conducted in patients with HeFH due to  ethical concerns of withholding recommended therapy in 
this population.  Clinical management of HeFH is largely based on extrapolation from the results 
of clinical outcomes trials conducted in patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia, from studies 
in FH patients  that used carotid intima -media thickness as a surrogate outcome, and f rom a small 
number of prospective observational studies in patients with FH.  In 4 observational studies, statin 
therapy was shown to reduce the risk of CHD by 50% to 80% in patients with FH 
(Harada -Shiba  2010 , Huijgen 2010 , Vermissen 2008 ).  Unfortunately, even after treatment, the 
risk in HeFH can still be almost 2 -fold higher than the general popula tion ( Neil 2008 ). 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor antibodies have been recently approved as 
adjunct to statins in patients with HeFH who require additional LDL -C-lowering 
(Praluent®  and Repatha® Product Information ).  The PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to lower 
LDL -C by approximately 60% in patients with HeFH on maximally tolerated statin therapy 
(Kastelein 2015 ).  In the recent Odyssey FH 1 and F H 2 studies comparing alirocumab (Praluent®) 
on top of maximally tolerated statins (with or without ezetimibe) in patients with HeFH and LDL -C 
≥70 mg/dL with a history of  MI/stroke or LDL -C ≥ 100 mg/dL without a history of MI/stroke, 
treatment with alirocu mab reduced LDL -C by up to a mean of 48.8% after 24 weeks 
(Kastelein  2015 ).  Moreover, these significant reductions in LDL -C by PCSK9 inhibitors also 
result in risk reductions in CV events.  Topline results from the FOURIER study with Repatha® 
(Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated 
Risk)  demonstrated a 15% risk reduction in a composite endpo int of CV events (CV death, 
non-fatal MI, non -fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) 
in patients with clinical ASCVD treated with evolocumab  (Sabatine 2017 ).  Similarly, topline 
results from the Odyssey Outcomes study with alirocumab demonstrated a 15% risk reduction in 
the composite endpoint of major cardiac events (CHD death, non -fatal MI, ischemic stroke, or 
unstable angina requiring hospitalization) (Schwartz  2018 ).  Both studies highlight the CV 
outcome benefits associated with lowering LDL -C to target levels or even lower.  
Although the majority of patients in the Odyssey FH1 and FH2 studies achieved their target LDL -C 
goal, up to 19% and 28%, respectively, did no t meet their LDL -C target after 24  weeks of 
treatment.  One group of patients recognized to remain far from their LDL -C goal are those patients 
with severe HeFH, often defined as having a treated (statin) LDL -C >200  mg/dL.  Approximately 
2% of patients wit h severe elevations in LDL -C have an identified FH -causing mutation 
(Khera  2016 ).  Those patients with severely elevated LDL -C, but without evidence of an 
FH-causing mutation, have a 6 -fold increased risk of CAD compared with non -FH patients with 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  an LDL -C < 130 mg/dL ( Khera 2016 ).  Thus, patients with significant residual CV risk who require 
additional LDL -C lowering, despite maximally  tolerated  statin and PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, 
include not only those patien ts with HeFH, but also those with polygenic etiologies.  It is important 
for all of these patients to achieve their target LDL -C goal, because the body of evidence from the 
statin literature shows that the relationship between LDL -C reduction and CV event reduction is 
approximately linear and for every 1 mmol/ L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL -C, there is a 
corresponding 22% risk reduction in CV events ( Cholesterol  Treatment  Trialists’ Collaboration 
2010 ). 
Another population not able to  achieve their L DL-C goal with the available treatment options and 
require additional LDL -C lowering is those patients  with FH  not able to tolerate any statin 
regimen.  Even in studies conducted with potent lipid -lowering agents such as PCSK9 inhibitor 
antibodies, >50% of the study population was not able to achieve their target LDL -C 
(Moriarty  2015 ) (Nissen  2016 ), highlighting the high unmet  medical need in these patients and the 
need  for additional lipid -lowering therapies.  
This present study is a phase 2, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study 
to assess varying doses of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) regime ns of evinacumab in 
patients who need further LDL -C reductions, defined as those patients diagnosed with 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, or non -HeFH with clinical ASCVD) who have an LDL -C 
≥70 mg/dL  (1.81 mmol/L) , despite receiving a stable maximally -tolerated lipid-lowering regimen.  
This regimen is defined as including a maximally -tolerated dose of a statin and a PCSK9 inhibitor 
antibody at the top recommended doses for all patients.  Patients with HeFH on no statin will be 
allowed as long as they were treated  previously with statins and have the associated documentation 
demonstrating inability to tolerate at least 2 statin regimens . 
The primary endpoint in this study is the percent change in LDL -C from baseline to week 16 .  As 
described above, LDL -C is an acce pted surrogate endpoint for CV risk, and has repeatedly been 
used as the primary  endpoint for other lipid lowering treatments .  The primary endpoint will be 
assessed at week 16 because that treatment duration  will allow all patients in both Group A 
(SC treatment groups) and Group B (IV treatment groups) to achieve steady state and maximum 
LDL -C lowering .  As such, 16  weeks is an adequate treatment duration to obtain sufficient PK and 
PD information to guide dose selection.  
In addition to providing  key infor mation to understand  the e ffect of evinacumab in patients with 
refractory hypercholesterolemia  and to help with dose selection for future studies, long-term safety 
of IV administrations of evinacumab  will be evaluated in Group B patients . For this reason, the 
double -blind treatment period for Group B is 8 weeks longer than for Group  A (24 weeks vs 16 
weeks) and a 48-week open -label treatment period will occur for patients in Group  B. This 
additional exposure  to evinacumab  will help to define further the safety profile for evinacumab .  
Long -term safety of SC administration will not be obtained in this study, but patients in Group  A 
may have the opportunity to enroll in a n open -label extension or safety  study . The SC treatment 
period in this study is shorter due to the high burden of up to 3 weekly injections, which are 
administered  by study staff at each clinic visit .  Therefore, beyond the primary endpoint at 
week  16, patients will not be required to continue receiving evinacumab injections . 
The study design includes a run -in period of variable duration .  This run -in period will ensure 
patients have enough time to become stabilized on their background medications (if they need 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  stabilization). Since this can vary from patient to patient, depending on the potent ial changes 
needed to their background lipid modifying therapy (LMT) , the upper limit of the run -in period is 
variable .  Additionally, for all patients not on a PCSK9 inhibitor antibody that will require 
alirocumab to be provided to them, this change will allow patients to enroll into the study in 
advance of randomization and start to receive a beneficial lipid lowering therapy.  
All patients receiving study treatment will enter a 24-week follow -up period, beginning at the time 
of the last study treatment administration (double -blind or open -label study treatment).  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The doses proposed for this current study are 300 mg SC  every week ( QW), 300 mg SC every 
2 weeks ( Q2W ) (alternating with placebo on opposite weeks), 450 mg SC QW, 5 mg/kg IV every 
4 weeks ( Q4W ), and 15 mg/kg IV Q4W.  These doses have be en evaluated in the study 
R1500 -CL-1321, in patients with modestly elevated L DL-C and were shown to have an acceptable 
safety profile. Effects in lowering LDL -C have been observed with all of the proposed SC doses.  
The 15 mg/kg IV dose has been studied in the HoFH POC study.  The maximal LDL -C reduction 
from baseline ranged from approximately 15 -35% during  the 8 -week treatme nt period in the 
R1500 -CL-1321 study, whereas mean percent change in LDL -C in the HoFH POC study was 
approximately -49% at 2 weeks following a single 15 mg/kg IV dose.  
Available data show evinacumab PK is nonlinear and dose -dependent, consistent with 
target -mediated elimination. Steady -state concentrations of evinacumab are predicted to be 
achieved after approximately 16 weeks of weekly SC administration.  Target saturation with 
limited duration was observed at evinacumab concentrations of 100 mg/L and  above.  In study 
R1500 -CL-1321, the PK profiles of 300 mg SC QW, 300 mg SC Q2W and 450 mg SC QW were 
clearly separated in a dose -dependent manner.  Total ANGPTL3 concentrations increas ed with 
increasing doses, indicating dose -dependent target engagement.  Evidence of target saturation with 
limited duration was observed following 8 we eks of treatment at doses of 20  mg/kg IV Q4W and 
450 mg SC QW.  Target saturation for the duration of the  dosing interval is expected with the 15 
mg/kg IV dose.   Based on avail able data, the dosing regimens to be evaluated in the current study 
are expected to provide therapeutic benefit to patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, and will 
enable comprehensive characterization of evinacumab exposure at dose levels ranging from  low 
to high in this patient population.  Varying PD responses at each dose level, including change in 
total ANGPTL3 and LDL -C, can also be obtained to further inform evinacumab exposure -response 
relationship in this particular patient population.  Data co llected from this study are expected to 
have a wide dynamic range and support dose selection for phase 3 studies in patients with 
hypercholesterolemia, including, but not limited to, HeF H and non -HeFH.  
Five (5) mg/kg IV Q4W is selected as the alternative l ower dose as it is expected to differentiate 
from 15 mg/kg in evinacumab exposure, ANGPTL3 binding, TG reduction and possibly, LDL -C 
reduction in patients with HeFH.  In otherwise healthy subjects with elevated TGs and LDL -C in 
study R1500 -HV-1214, single -dose administrations of evinacumab 75, 150, and 250 mg SC and 
5, 10, and 20 mg/kg IV led to dose -dependent target engagement and reductions in LDL -C and 
TGs.  The total exposure (AUC)  of evinacumab after 5 mg/kg IV is 4 - to 5-fold lower than the 
predicted area under curve  for 15 mg/kg IV, due to non -linearity in PK.  In addition, the serum 
concentration of evinacumab in the single -dose study (R1500 -HV-1214) after 5 mg/kg IV was 
above 100 mg/L for 2 -3 days.  Inclusion of this dose will inform whether ANGPTL3  saturation is

 CONFIDENTIAL  needed for maximal LDL -C reduction in patients with HeFH.  On the other hand, 5 mg/kg IV Q4W 
is expected to provide some benefit in decreasing LDL -C in patients with HeFH, as evinacumab 
concentration after 5 mg/kg IV was much greater than th at after the 250 mg SC dose, which has 
shown to reduce LDL -C to a varying degree in pat ients with HoFH ( study  R1500 -CL-1331).   
Low-density lipoprotein response, although observed to lag behind drug exposure, is expected to 
be stabilized following 8 weeks of treatment with a Q4W dosing interval.   
For the open -label phase, 15 mg/kg IV Q4W will be administer ed.  Target saturation is expected 
during the 4 -week dosing interval and patients are most likely t o have a sustained, maximal LDL -C 
reduction compared to  lower doses .  In addition, safety informatio n can be collected at the highe st 
dose of evinacumab and provide the most relevant information to characterize the benefit -risk 
profile of evinacumab over long -term use . 
3.2.3 Benefit / Risk Assessment  
Of the c urrent  medications for lowering LDL -C, statins are the most commonly prescribed because 
they are inexpensive and have demonstrated the ability to reduce CHD events.  Proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  inhibitor antibodies are a newer class of agents t hat significantly 
lower LDL -C and recently demonstrated a reduction in the risk of CV events ( Sabatine 2017 ). 
Despite all of the available treatment options, particularly statins and PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies, 
some patients still do not reach their LDL -C goal , and continue to have residual CV risk.  In the 
Odyssey FH 1 and FH 2 studies, up to 19% and 28% in FH1 and FH2, respectively, did not meet 
their LDL -C target despite 24 weeks of treatment with alirocumab.  Additionally, some pat ients 
are not able to tolerate a statin, despite trials with multiple agents and regimens.  In previous studies 
of PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies in patients who are not able to tolerate statin therapy , over 50% of 
patients do not achieve their LDL -C goal.  
Patient populations that continue to need additional LDL -C lowering include those with severe 
HeFH , as well as patients with out a mutation identified as causing FH , with polygenic etiologies  
of their disease. It is important for all patients to achieve the ir LDL -C target because the body of 
evidence from the statin literature shows that the relationship between LDL -C reduction and CHD 
event reduction is approximately linear and for every 1 mmol/ L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL -C, 
there is a corresponding 22%  risk reduction in CHD events (CTT study). Moreover, the results 
from recent outcomes trials with ezetimibe (IMPROVE -IT), evolocumab (FOURIER) , and 
alirocumab (Odyssey Outcomes)  reinforce this concept, providing additional evidence for the 
relationship bet ween LDL -C lowering and reduction in risks for CV events, thereby emphasizing 
the importance for patients to achieve their target LDL -C.  
Evinacumab is a new treatment option that could get patients to their target LDL -C when added to 
a stable lipid -loweri ng regimen, including statins and a PCSK9 inhibitor antibody. In the early 
clinical studies in healthy subjects, monotherapy treatment with evinacumab resulted in up to 40% 
reduction in LDL -C and up to 80% reduction in TG. In the R1500 -CL-1331  study in pat ients with  
HoFH , treatment with evinacumab on top of a stable lipid lowering regimen resulted in peak mean 
LDL -C reductions of approximately 58%.  
It is expected that treatment with evinacumab will be well tolerated and have an acceptable safety 
profile.   The accumulated safety information from the completed and ongoing clinical studies is 
marked by the absence of any important identified risks. There are potential risks that include 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions, immunogenicity, and embryofetal toxic ity. These risks will be

risk, there is a strict risk mitigation plan, including requirements for consistent use of contraception  
for sexually active male stud y participants and sexually active female study participants of child 
bearing potential .  
Taken together, these data show the positive benefit/risk assessment of treatment with evinacumab 
in patients with HeFH, or non -HeFH with clinical ASCVD  with persiste nt hypercholesterolemia 
despite receiving maximally -tolerated LMT.  Persistent hyperch olesterolemia is defined as LDL -C 
≥70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) for those patients with clinical A SCVD and LDL -C ≥100 mg/dL 
(2.59  mmol/L) for those patients without clinical AS CVD . 
To obtain long -term safety data with evinacumab, all patie nts in Group B will receive IV study 
drug for 48 weeks. Due to the injection burden of weekly SC administration, Group A patients will 
not be required to receive study drug for 48 weeks. After the 16 -week double -blind treatment 
period, Group A patients who wish to receive treatment with evinacumab may have the opportunity 
to enroll in a n open -label extension or safety  study . Therefore, this study design took into 
consideration the objective of obtaining long -term safety data and providing potential benefit t o 
patients with continued treatment with evinacumab  while balancing the burden of frequent study 
visits and SC injections.  
4. STUDY VARIABLES  
4.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, we ight, and height), 
medical history, and medication history for each patient.  
4.2. Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
4.2.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in calculated LDL -C from baseline to week  
16 in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, using all LDL -C values regard less of adherence to 
treatment  and subsequent therapies . 
The primary endpoint is defined as:  100 x (calculated LDL -C value at week  16 - calculated LDL -C 
value at baseline)/calculated LDL -C value at ba seline.  The baseline calculated LDL -C value will 
be the last LDL -C level obtained before the first dose of study drug.  The calculated LDL -C at 
week 16 will be the LDL -C level obtained within the week 16 analysis window.  
All calculated LDL -C values (sched uled or unscheduled) may be used to provide a value for the 
primary efficacy endpoint, if appropriate, according to the above definition.  The analysis window 
used to allocate a time point to a measurement will be defined in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP).  
4.2.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are:  
 Percent change in ApoB from baseline to week  16 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL   Percent change in non -HDL -C from baseline to week  16 
 Percent change in TC from baseline to week  16 
 Proportion of patients with ≥ 30% reduction in calculated LDL -C at week  16 
 Proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in calculated LDL -C at week  16 
 Percent change in TGs from baseline to week  16 
 Percent change in Lp(a) from baseline to week  16 
 Proportion  of patients with calculated LDL -C < 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) at week  16 
 Proportion of patients with calculated LDL -C < 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at week  16 
 Proportion of patients with calculated LDL -C < 50 mg/dL (1. 30 mmol/L) at week  16 
 Percent change in calc ulated LDL -C, Apo B, non -HDL -C, TC, TG, and Lp(a) from 
baseline to week 24 (only applicable to those patients receiving IV route of study 
treatment administration)  
4.3. Pharmacokinetic Variable  
The PK variable is evinacumab concentrations at sampling times specified in the visit schedule 
(Table  3 and Table  4). 
4.4. Anti -Drug Antibody Variables  
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) variables include ADA status and titer as follows:  
 Treatment -emergent response - defined as a positive response post first dose in the 
ADA assay when baseline results are negative or missing  
 Treatment -boosted response - defined as a positive response post first dose in the ADA 
assay that is at least 9 -fold over baseline titer levels, when baselines results are positive  
The definition of persistent and transient ADA will be defined a priori in the SAP.  
 Titer category  
 Low (titer <1,000)  
 Moderate (1,000  ≤ titer ≤10,000)  
 High (titer >10,000)  
Samples positive in the ADA assay will be assessed for neutralizing activity.  
5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1. Study Description and Duration  
This is a phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study to assess 
varying doses of SC and IV regimens of evinacumab in patients diagnosed with primary 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, or non -HeFH with a history of clinical ASCVD) who  have an

 CONFIDENTIAL  LDL -C ≥70 mg/dL  (1.81 mmol/L) , despite receiving a stable maximally -tolerated LMT .  The LMT 
would include a stable , maximally -tolerated statin and stable PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for patients 
who are HeFH or non -HeFH with a history of clinical ASCVD.  Patients with HeFH not on a statin 
are eligible  if there is documentation of inability to tolerate at least 2  statin s (see Section  7.3 
Background Treatments for further information).  
The study consists of 4 (for Group A  [SC treatment group s]) or 5 (for Group B  [IV treatment 
group s]) periods: a run -in period (for patients whose background LMT has not been stable prior to 
screening, who are not already receiving a PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody , or whose background LMT 
is not optimized), a 2 -week screening period, a 16 -week double -blind treatment period for the SC 
dose group s or 24-week double -blind treatment period for the IV dose group s, an approximately  
48-week open -label treatment period  for the IV dose group s, and a follow -up period lasting 24 
weeks after the last dose of study drug  (Figure  1). 
All patients in Group B  who have successfully completed the double -blind treatment period and 
the open -label treatment period, and all patients in Group A  who have successfully completed the 
double -blind treatment period and follow -up period in this study may have the opportunity  to 
enroll  in an open -label extension or safety study .  All patients who enroll in the separate open -label 
extension study will continue to receive evinacumab.

Run-in: 
There will be a run -in period for:  
 Patients who are not receiving the maximal dose of a PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody  or 
whose dose has not been stable for at least 8 weeks before the screening visit  
 Patients whose maximally tolerated statin has not been stable for at least 4 weeks before 
the screening visit  
 Patients whose background LMT (other than statin or PCSK9 inhi bitor  antibody ) has 
not been stable for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for fibrates) before the screening visit  
During this run -in period, patients will be stabilized on their statin, PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody , and 
other background LMT (as applicable), and patie nts receiving alirocumab 75 mg SC Q2W will 
have their dose  up-titrated to the maximum dose of either 150 mg SC Q2W  or 300 mg SC Q4W . 
The duration of the run -in period will depend on the time needed for the patient to stabilize on 
their background LMT.  
Whet her or not a patient is considered to be on a maximum tolerated regimen of LMT (statin, 
PCSK9 inhibitor, ezetimibe, etc) and reasons why the patient is not taking the various treatments  
(eg, due to intolerance, lack of efficacy, etc) will need to be documented in the case report form 
(CRF ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  Screening:  
Patients who have been receiving a stable maximally tolerated statin regimen for at least 4  weeks 
and a stable PCSK9 inhibitor antibody regimen (alirocumab 150 mg SC Q2W, or 300 mg SC 
Q4W, or evolocumab 140 mg SC Q2W or 420 mg SC Q4W) for at least 8 weeks before screening, 
and whose additional LMT (as applicable) has been stable for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for 
fibrates) before screening, will enter a 2 -week screening period.  
Double -blind Tr eatment:  
Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and who meet none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized within  either Group A  (1:1:1 :1) or Group B ( 1:1:1) to receive:  
Group A  
 Evinacumab 300 mg SC QW, for 16 weeks, or  
 Evinacumab 300 mg SC Q2W , for 16 weeks (alternating with placebo on opposite 
weeks), or  
 Evinacumab 450 mg SC QW, for 16 weeks, or  
 Placebo SC  QW, for 16 weeks  
Group B  
 Evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV  Q4W , for 24 weeks, or  
 Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W , for 24 weeks, or  
 Placebo IV Q4W , for 24 weeks  
Enrollment of IV cohorts will occur before enrollment of SC cohorts, accordingly, enrollment of 
Group A will not begin until Group B enrollment is completed . 
Patients randomized within either  the SC (Group A) and IV (Group B) treatment  groups will have 
different visit schedules because of the differences in dosing frequency.   
Randomization will be stratified by high -intensity statin (Yes/No) and HeFH (Yes/No) at baseline.  
High -intensity statin is defined as rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg 
daily, or simvastatin 80 mg daily (if already on this dose for >1 year).  To ensure an adequate 
number of patients with HeFH are included in this study and expo sed to each dose, randomization 
will be stratified 2:1 (HeFH:non -HeFH; 24:12) wit hin each treatment group.  
Investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration during the double -blind treatment period 
will take place at the site and possibly, by visiting home nurses (only for the SC group).  The IMP 
will be administered at the site on the day of randomization, after all samples for clinical laboratory 
evaluation have been obtained.   In order to ease burden f or those patients randomized to receive 
SC IMP, visiting home nurses may be utilized to administer SC IMP on odd visit dates, eg . Week 1, 
week  3, and week  5. 
Open -Label Treatment Period  (Group B only)  
Patients in Group B ( the IV treatment group s) will enter a 48-week open -label treatment period 
and all patients will receive  evinacumab  15 mg/kg IV Q4W.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Follow -Up Period  (Groups A and B)  
All patients  will be followed for 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug . 
Patients should maintain their stable background LMT regimen from screening through the end  of 
study (EOS) visit.  
Patients will be reminded to adhere to a heart -healthy diet at screening, and continuing through the 
EOS visit.  Patients should maintain a stable exercise level for the duration of the study, and avoid 
rigorous exercise 24  hours before each study visit.  All lipid results will be blinded from after 
randomization until the week 36 visit  for the IV cohorts, and until database lock for the SC cohorts . 
5.1.1.  Description of Study Treatment Groups  
Group A double -blind treatment period (16 weeks):  
 Evinacumab 300 mg SC QW, or  
 Evinacumab 300 mg SC Q2W  (alternating with placebo on opposite weeks), or  
 Evinacumab 450 mg SC QW, or  
 Placebo SC QW, for 16 weeks  
Group B double -blind treatment period (24 weeks):  
 Evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV Q4W , or  
 Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W , or  
 Placebo IV Q4W , for 24 weeks  
Group B  open -label treatment period (48 weeks):  
 Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W  
5.1.2.  Follow -up 
All patients will be followed for 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  Thus, f or IV cohorts 
in which the dosing interval is Q4W, patients will be followed for an addition al 20 weeks after end 
of treatment ( EOT ).  For SC cohorts, in which the shortest dosing interval is QW, patients will be 
followed for an additional 23 weeks after the EOT visit. Patients in Group B may have the option 
of joining an open -label extension or safety study  after successfully completing the treatment 
period (48 weeks). Patients in Group A  may have the option of joining a n open -label extension or 
safety study  after successfully completing the treatment period ( 16 weeks ) and follow -up period 
(24 weeks). Those patients that do not enroll in the separate open -label study  will enter a follow -up 
period , which lasts  20 weeks for IV groups after the last dose of study drug.  It takes approximately 
24 weeks for evinacumab concentration to be below lower li mit of quantitation.    
Sexually active patients should be reminded at the EOT visit to maintain highly eff ective 
contraceptive measures for 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  At this visit, women of 
childbearing potential  (WOCBP ) may be provided urine pregnancy tests to perform at home with 
instructions to test for pregnancy 4 weeks after this visit and Q4W thereafter.  The patient should 
also be notified of Q4W follow -up phone calls to confirm contraception use, provide a reminde r 
of pregnancy reporting, and to obtain the results of the pregnancy test.

The EOS for this study is defined as th e last visit of the last patient . 
5.2. Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned.  
5.3. Study Committees  
5.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC), composed of members who are 
independent from the sponsor and the study investigators, will monitor patient safety by 
conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data  that will be blinded by treatment group; if 
requested, the IDMC may have access to the treatment allocation code or any other requested data 
for the purposes of a risk -benefit assessment.  
The IDMC will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the 
clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study.  The IDMC 
will also institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity of the study results 
during the study execution.  
All activities and responsibilities of the IDMC are described in the IDMC charter.  
5.3.2.  Clinical Events Committee  
The Clinical Events Committee is composed of experts in the field of cardiovascular  disease, 
independent from the sponsor and the investigators.  This committee will be responsible for 
defining, validating, and classifying (in a blinded fashion) pre -specified cardiovascular events, and 
all deaths.  
Patients with suspected or confirmed CV events, which occur during the time period from 
randomization until the follow -up visit, will have a corresponding adjudication package prepared 
and submitted to the CEC.  The events should also be reported as serious adverse events (SAEs ), 
as appropriate .  Adjudicated CV events include all CV adverse events ( AEs) positively 
adjudicated. The adjudication categories include:  
 CHD death  
 Non-fatal MI  
 Fatal and non -fatal ischemic stroke  
 Unstable angina requiring hospitalization  
 Congestive heart failure requirin g hospitalization  
In addition, deaths will be classified by the CEC.  All coronary revascularizations ( percutaneous 
coronary intervention  [PCI] , coronary artery bypass graft [CABG ]) will be submitted to the CEC, 
and analyzed.  
A charter and an adjudication operational manual will specify additional details regarding the 
procedures, criteria, and classification used for adjudication of these events.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6. SELECTION, WITHDRAWA L, AND REPLACEMENT O F 
PATIENTS  
6.1. Number of Patients Planned  
Approximately  252 patients , at ap proximately 80 sites in the US and globally , will be randomized 
within either  Group A  (evinacumab 300 mg SC QW: evinacumab 300 mg SC Q2W: evinacumab 
450 mg SC QW: placebo SC ) or Group B  (evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV Q4W: evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV Q4W: placebo IV).   There will be 144 patients randomized to Group A (36 patients per 
treatment group), with 108 patients exposed to SC evinacumab and 36 exposed to SC placebo.  
There will be 108 patients randomized to Group B (36 patients per treatment group), with 72 
patients exposed to IV evinacumab and 36 exposed to IV placebo.  
6.2. Study Population  
Adult men and women, ages 18 to 80, with primary hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, or non -HeFH 
with clinical ASCVD), with persistent hypercholesterolemia despite receiving maximally -
tolerated LMT.  Persistent hypercholesterolemia is defined as LDL -C ≥70  mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) 
for those patients with clinical ASCVD and LDL -C ≥100  mg/dL (2.59  mmol/L) for those patients 
without clinical ASCVD .  Background  LMT would include a stable maximally -tolerated statin and 
stable PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for patients who are HeFH or non -HeFH with a history of clinical 
ASCVD.  Patients with HeFH not on a statin are allowed to participate if there is documentation 
of inability to tolerate a t least 2  statin s due to muscle symptoms.  Inability to tolerate a statin should 
be due to skeletal muscle -related symptoms, other than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, 
aches, weakness, or cramping, that began or increased during statin therapy and stopped whe n 
statin therapy was discontinued . 
Randomization will be stratified 2:1 (HeFH:non -HeFH; 24:12) within each treatment group to 
ensure an adequate number of patients with HeFH are appropriately represented at each dose.  This 
will ensure that there is a prop ortionate distribution of  patients with HeFH in each cohort to 
adequately assess the safety and efficacy of evinacumab in patients with HeFH .   
Approximately 25% of the population is targeted to  have a baseline LDL -C ≥100 mg/dL  
(2.59 mmol/L)  and approximately 25% of the population should have a baseline LDL -C 
≥130  mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) .  The baseline value is defined as the last available value before the 
first dose of study drug.  
6.2.1.  Rescreening of Patients  
Patients  who do not meet eligibility criteria during the initial screening may rescreen only once.   
Patients  who are rescreened after the screening window ends must re -consent for study 
participation and repeat all screening procedures.  
Patients  who do not meet al l eligibility criteria during the initial screening, and are still within the 
screening window, may retest once the assessments that did not meet eligibility criteria.  
Patients with a history of ASCVD who previously failed screening due to the LDL -C thresh old of 
100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) will be eligible to rescreen once based on the eligibility criterion being 
amended to 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L).

2. Body mass index ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m2 
3. Diagnosis of primary hypercholesterolemia, either HeFH* or non -HeFH  with clinical 
ASCVD  
*Diagnosis of heFH must be made either by genotyping or by clinical criteria.  For those 
patients not genotyped, the clinical diagnosis may be based on either the Simon Broome 
criteria for definite FH ( Appendix  2) or the W orld Health Organization /Dutch Lipid 
Network criteria with a score of >8 points ( Appendix 3 ). 
4. A history of clinical ASCVD, for those patients who are non -HeFH.  Clinical ASCVD is 
defined as: acute coronary syndrome, or a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary 
or other arterial revascularization, st roke, transient ische mic attack  (TIA ), or peripheral 
arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin ( Stone 2014 ) 
5. Receiving a stable maximally  tolerated* statin (± ezetimibe ) for at least 4 weeks at 
screening  
*Patients not able to be on a high -intensity statin/statin dose should be treated with a 
regimen considered appropriate for the patient, according to the investigator's judgment.  
Some examples of acceptable reasons for a patient taking a lower statin dose or no statin 
include, but are not limited to: adverse effects, advanced age, low body mass index, 
regional practices, local prescribing information, concomitant medications, co -morbid 
conditions such as impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose.  The reason(s) for 
not receiving a high -intensity statin will be documented  in the CRF.  
“High -intensity statin” is defined as (any of  the following are acceptable):  
 Rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily  
 Atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg daily  
 Simvastatin 80 mg dai ly (if already on this dose for >  1 year)  
6. For those patients with HeFH who are not r eceiving a statin at screening, documentation 
of inability to tolerate at least 2  statins.  Inability to tolerate a statin should be due to skeletal 
muscle -related symptoms , other than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, 
weakness, or cramping, that began or increased during statin therapy and stopped when 
statin therapy was discontinued.  
7. Receiving alirocumab 150 mg SC Q2W  or 300 mg SC Q4W , OR evolocumab 140  mg SC 
Q2W or 420 mg SC Q4W for at least 8 weeks prior to the screening visit  
8. For those patients with a history of clinical ASCVD, serum LDL -C ≥70 mg/dL 
(1.81 mmol/L ) at screening (1 repeat lab is allowed) .  ASCVD is defined as:  acute coronary 
syndrome, or a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial 
revascularization, stroke, TIA, or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of 
atherosclerotic origin (Stone 2014).   Patients with  a history of ASCVD who previously

 CONFIDENTIAL   Bilateral tubal ligation  
 Vasectomized partner.  Note: Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control 
method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the  WOCBP  study  
participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
 Sexual abstinence.  Note:  Sexual abstinence is considered a highly  effective method 
only if define d as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of 
risk associated with study treatments.  
True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, pos t-ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are 
not acceptable methods of contraception  
*Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to be

6.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretab le; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  8.1.2 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study drug (permanent or temporary) are discussed in Section  7.4.2 . 
Early Termination from the Study  
If for any reason the patient refuses to continue the study, the patient should undergo an 
unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at the EOT  visit (it should take place within 
5 days of treatment discontinuatio n, if possible).  
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  For patients that discontinue the study prematurely, the patient should be followed for at least 
24 weeks from the last dose of study drug  or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed -up as specified in this protocol, whiche ver comes last.  A final EOS  visit should take 
place with assessments as specified in the EOS  visit (ie, follow -up visit) at 24 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug.  
Sexually active patients who discontinue the study prematurely should be reminded at th e 
unscheduled visit following treatment discontinuation to maintain highly effective contraceptive 
measures for 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  At this visit, WOCBP will be provided 5 
urine pregnancy tests with instructions to test for pregnan cy 4 weeks after this visit and Q4W 
thereafter.  All patients should also be notified of Q4W follow -up phone calls to confirm 
contraception use, remind them of pregnancy reporting, and to obtain the results of the urine 
pregnancy test.  
The investigator or study staff should make the best effort to contact any patient (eg, contacting 
patient’s family or private physician, review available registries or health care database) who fails 
to return to the site, and to determine health status, including at least v ital status.   Attempts to 
contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted 
telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).  The site will be provided a retention 
manual outlining the best prac tices for patient retention.   
6.4. Replacement of Patients  
Patients who prematurely discontinue from the study will not be replaced.  
7. STUDY TREATMENTS  
7.1. Investigational Treatments and Reference Treatments  
Evinacumab or placebo will be supplied for SC or IV administration .  Study treatment groups are 
defined in Section  5.1.1 .   
For patients who are not receiving  a PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody , sterile aliro cumab drug product 
will be sup plied at a concentration of 150  mg/mL in a prefilled pen.  
All SC injections will be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of the upper arm with 
rotating sites of injection.  Instructions for management of acute injection site and infusion 
reactions are provided in Section  7.5. 
For SC Q W regimen the dose should be administered ± 3 days; if ≥4 days have passed, skip the 
dose and return to the original schedule.  For IV Q4W regimen the dose should be administered 
± 14 days; if >14 days have passed, skip the dose and return to the original schedule.  
The IV dose should be prepared using the patie nt’s most recent weight.  Further instructions on 
dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
7.2. Run-in Treatment(s)  
There will be a run -in period for:  
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 43 of 97 
 CONFIDENTIAL   Patients who are not receiving the maximal dose of a PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody  or 
whose dose has n ot been stable for at least 8 weeks before the screening visit  
 Patients whose maximally tolerated statin has not been stable for at least 4 weeks before 
the screening visit  
 Patients whose background LMT (other than statin or PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody ) has 
not been stable for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for fibrates) before the screening visit  
During this run -in period, patients will be stabilized on their statin, PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody , and 
other background LMT (as applicable), and patients receiving aliroc umab 75 mg SC Q2W will 
have their dose  up-titrated to 150 mg SC Q2W  or 300 mg SC Q4W .  The duration of the run -in 
period will depend on the time needed for the patient to stabilize on their background LMT.  
Patients have to  be consented prior to entering th e run-in period.  
7.3. Background Treatment(s)  
All patients should be on a stable, maximally -tolerated LMT regimen  throughout the duration of 
the study.   
All patients should be on maximal background LMT, which include s a stable maximally tolerated 
statin and stable PCSK9 inhibitor antibody.  Patients with HeFH who are not on a statin are allowed 
to participate if there is documentation of inability to tolerate a t least 2 statin s due to muscle 
symptoms .  Inability to tol erate a statin should be due to skeletal muscle -related symptoms, other 
than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, or cramping, that began or 
increased during statin therapy and stopped when statin therapy was discontinued.  
For the background LMT, sites must follow the national product label for patient safety monitoring 
and management.  The dose of statin and of PCSK9 inhibitor, such as alirocumab or evolocumab, 
as well as other LMT (if applicable), should remain stable throughout t he study duration, from 
screening through the EOS visit.   If a patient is not considered to be on a maximum tolerated LMT 
regimen (high -intensity statin, PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody , ezetimibe, etc) at the start of the run -in 
or at screening, reasons why or w hy not (eg, due to intolerance, lack of efficacy, not marketed in 
the region) the patient is taking/not taking the various treatments will need to be documented in 
the CRF.  
7.4. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.4.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
7.4.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Study treatment should be continued whenever possible.   In the event study drug dosing is stopped, 
it should be determined if the stop can be made temporarily; permanent  discontinuation should be 
a last resort.  Regardless, the patient should remain in the study treatment period as long as 
possible.  
Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug should remain in the study and undergo all study 
visits and procedures, with the exception of dosing with study drug.  At the time of study drug 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  discontinuation, the patient should have, as soon as possible, an unscheduled visit with assessments 
normally planned at EOT visit (this should take place within 5 days of discontinuation of study 
drug, if possible), and then resume the original study schedule until the EOS  visit.   In case of early 
discontinuation bef ore week  16, all efforts should be made to perform EOT  assessments as soon 
as possible.  
Patient s who permanently discontinue from study drug, and who opt to withdraw from the study, 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  6.3. 
7.4.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in a patient in the event of the following, but not 
limited to : 
 Evidence of pregnancy  
 Acute systemic injection/infusion reactions with AEs including, but not limited to, 
anaphylaxis, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema, severe bronchospasm, chest pain, seizure, or 
severe hypotension  
 Patient requires a prohibited concomitant m edication during the study.  The principal 
investigator should contact the Regeneron study monitor.  Based on the discussion, 
study drug may be continued, or may be temporarily or permanently discontinued  
 Patient withdraws consent  
The investigator may perm anently discontinue dosing with study drug at any time, even without 
consultation with the medical monitor, if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action 
and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest.  However, the medical moni tor should 
be contacted as soon as possible in any case of permanent study drug discontinuation.  
7.5. Management of Acute Reactions  
7.5.1.  Acute Infusion Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion reactions must be available 
for immedi ate use.  All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section  9.4.1 ) 
and graded using the grading scales, as instructed in Section  9.5.1 . 
7.5.1.1.  Interruption  of the Infusion  
The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs are observed:  
 cough  
 rigors/chills  
 rash, pruritus (itching)  
 urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
 diaphoresis (sweating)

 CONFIDENTIAL   dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
 vomiting  
 flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50%  of the 
original rate.  
If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment of the reaction or need for discontinuation 
of the infusion, other than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the 
appropriate response according to typical clinical practice.  
7.5.1.2.  Termination of the Infusion  
The infusion should be terminated and NOT restarted if any of the following AEs occur:  
 anaphylaxis*  
 severe bron chospasm  
 chest pain  
 seizure  
 severe hypotension  
 other neurological symptoms (confusion, loss of consciousness, paresthesia, paralysis, 
etc.) 
 any other symptom or sign that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants 
discontinuation of the infusion  
*Consid er anaphylaxis if the following is observed  (Sampson 2006 ):  acute onset of an 
illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, 
generalized hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips-tongue -uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE 
OF THE FOLLOWING : 
a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow, hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope,  incontinence)  
7.5.2.  Acute Injection Reactions  
7.5.2.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Acute systemic reactions following administration of study drug (IV or SC ), should be treated 
using clinical judgment, based on standard clinical practice, in order to determine the appr opriate 
response.  
7.5.2.2.  Local Injection Site Reactions  
Local injection site reactions must be reported as AEs and graded according to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) September 2007 Guidance for Industry, Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  Adult and Adole scent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (provided in the 
study Regulatory Binder, also see Section  9.5.1 ). 
7.6. Method of Treatme nt Assignment  
Patients will be randomized within  either Group A (S C treatment regimens) in a 1:1:1:1  ratio or 
Group B (IV treatment regimens) in a 1:1:1 ratio.  Enrollment of IV cohorts will occur before 
enrollment of SC cohorts ; accordingly, enrollment of Group A will not begin until Group  B 
enrollment is completed .  There will be 144 patients randomized to Group A (36 patients per 
treatment group ), with 108 patients  exposed  to SC evinacumab and 36 exposed to SC  placebo .  
There  will be 1 08 patients rando mized to Group B (36 patients per treatment grou p), with 
72 patients exposed to  IV evinacumab and 36 exposed to IV placebo.  
Patients in Group A will receive treatment from day 1  through week 16  (last dose of study drug at 
week  15).  Patients in Group B will receive treatment from day 1 through week 24 (last dose of 
study drug week 20).  Patients will be randomized to a treatment group  according to  a central 
randomization scheme provided by an interactive voice response system (IVRS)/i nteractive web 
response system (IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee).  
Randomization will be stratified by study treatment route of administration (Group A or B), 
high-intensity statin (Yes/No) , and HeFH (Yes/No) at baseline.  H igh-intensity statin is defined as 
rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily, atorvastatin 40  mg or 80 mg daily, or simvastatin 80  mg daily 
(if already on this dose for >1 year).  To ensure that an adequate number of patients with HeFH 
are included, randomization will be stratified 2:1 (HeFH:non -HeFH; 24:12) within each treatment 
group.  
7.6.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, principal investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomized study treatment group assignments throughout the study.  The Regene ron Study 
Director, Medical Monitor, Study Monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research 
organization (CRO) personnel who are in regular contact with the study site will remain blinded 
to all patient randomization assignments.   All lipid results w ill be blinded from after randomization 
until the week 36 visit  for the IV cohorts, and until database lock for the SC cohorts . 
Due to differences in the color  of the study drug  as compared to  placebo, an unblinded pharmacist 
or qualified unblinded designe e will  prepare the IV infusion bags and SC injections. Further details 
are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
7.6.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
If unblinding is required:  
 Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind  the treatment assignment  
 Only the affected patient will be unblinded

 CONFIDENTIAL   The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the treatment 
assignment to the investigator.  If there is no study pharmacist, the investigator for the 
site will unblind the patient  
 The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee before unblinding  the patient, 
whenever possible  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblind ed study 
pharmacist (when applicable),  at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency.  In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at th e site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
7.7. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
7.7.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used to label blinded investigational study drug.  Lists 
linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups (or 
companies) responsible for study drug packaging.  In order to maintain the blind , these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Study drug will be stored  at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
7.7.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regul ar 
intervals or as needed during the study.  At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by the site monitor, all opened and unopened study  drug will be destroyed, or returned to the 
sponsor or designee.  
7.7.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current.  
The investigator must be able to account for all opened and unopened study drug.  These records 
should contain t he dates, quantity, and study medication  
 dispensed to each patient  
 returned from each patient  (if applicable), and  
 disposed of at the site or returned to the sponsor or designee  
All accountability records must be made available for inspection by the sponso r and regulatory 
agency inspectors; photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion of the study.  
7.7.4.  Treatment Compliance  
All drug compliance records must be kept current and made available for inspection by the sponsor 
and regulatory agency inspectors.

1. All patients will be reminded of protocol -specified contraception use and pregnancy 
reporting.  
2. All laboratory samples should be collected before the administration of study drug. All 
samples should be collected following at least an 8 -hour fast.  
3. Electrocardiograms should be performed before blood is drawn during visits requiring 
blood draws.  
4. On dosing days, PK collection should occur pre -dose for group  A and prior to IV infusion 
and at the end  of the IV infusion for group  B. 
5. LDL -R function samples will be collected from a sub -set of patients based on enrollment 
and will be determined by IWRS.  
  
 
 
7. For SC dosing, p atients will be observed  at the clinical site for at least  30 minutes following 
each SC study drug administration .  For IV dosing , patients will be monitored  for at least  
60 minutes following the end of each IV study drug administration . 
8. Starting at W1 and every odd visit week ( ie, W3, W5, W7, etc) thereafter, visiting home 
nurses may administer study drug for those patients randomi zed to Group A. 
9. WOCBP will be provided urine pregnancy tests with instructions to test for pregnancy at 
home.  
10. All subjects will be contacted by phone to query LMT compliance, inquire about AEs or 
changes to concomitant medications, confirm required contrac eption use and remind 
patients of pregnancy reporting.  Women of childbearing potential will report the results of 
their home urine pregnancy test.  All patients will also be queried regarding their low fat 
diet.  
11. Vital signs should be recorded prior to SC  injection or IV infusion, and 30 minutes and 
60 minutes post -IV infusion.  
8.1.2.  Early Termination Visit  
Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study before EOT visit  
Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study before the week  16 visit, will be asked to 
return to the clinic for 2 visits:  once for an early termination/EOT visit, consisting of the EOT 
assessments described in Table  3 and Table  4, and again at the EOS visit .  The EOT visit should 
take place within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible.   A final EOS visit should take 
place with assessments as specified in th e EOS visit (ie, follow -up visit) at 24 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug (Table  6 and Table  7).

 CONFIDENTIAL  Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after EOT Visit  
Patients who are withdrawn from the study after the EOT visit ( week  16 for SC group  or week  24 
for IV group ) will be asked to return to the clinic for early termination assessments/EOS, only.  
The EOS visit should take place with assessments as specified in the EOS visit (ie, follow -up visit) 
at 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  
Sexually active patients who discontinue the study prematurely should have an unscheduled visit 
to remind patients to maintain highly effective contraceptive measures for 24 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug.  At this visit, WOCBP will be provided urine pregnancy tests with instructions 
to test for pregnancy Q4W until the EOS visit.  All patients should  also be notified of Q4W 
follow -up phone calls to confirm contraception use, remind them of pregnancy reporting, and to 
obtain the results of the urine pregnancy test.  
8.1.3.  Unscheduled Visits  
All a ttempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule.  Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any 
other reason, as warranted.  
8.2. Study Procedures  
8.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population:  
 Demographics,  
 Past medical/surgical history, alcohol/smoking habits  
 Medication history,  
 Medication adjustments  
 Height, weight, vital signs, physical examination, ECG  
 Hepatitis B and C serology,  
 TSH,  
 FSH  
8.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
All laboratory samples will be collected before the dose of study drug is administered.  
Blood samples for lipid panels should be collected in the morning, in fasting condition (ie, 
overnight, at least 8 hours fast, only water) for all clinic visits.  Alcohol consumption within 
48 hours, and smoking or intense physical exercise within 24 hours, prec eding blood sampling are 
discouraged.  
Note:  If the patient is not in the fasting condition, the blood sample may not be collected and a 
new appointment can be scheduled the day after (or as close as possible to this date) with a

 CONFIDENTIAL  reminder to be fasted.   Patients who are not fasted should 1) be reminded that they should fast, and 
2) should be seen by study staff the next day or close as possible in fasted state . 
Total -C, HDL -C, TG, ApoB, ApoA -1, Lp(a), and ApoCIII will be directly measured by the central 
laboratory.  LDL -C will be calculated using the Friedewald formula.  If TG values exceed 
400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L), LDL -C will be measured via the beta quantification method (rather 
than via the Friedewald formula).  If the LDL -C value is less than 25 mg/dL (0. 65 mmol/L), LDL -C 
will be measured via the beta quantification method (rather than the Friedewald formula). 
Non-HDL -C will be calculated by subtracting HDL -C from TC.  Ratio ApoB/ApoA -1 will be 
calculated.  All lipid results will be blinded from after randomization until the week  36 visit for 
the IV cohorts, and until database lock for the SC cohorts .  No attempts should be  made by the 
investigator or patient to have the patient’s lipid values independently e valuated after 
randomization and through  the EOS  visit.  
Detailed procedures of sample preparation, storage, and shipment are provided in the laboratory 
manual.  
8.2.2.1.  Core Lipid Panel  
Fasting blood (at least 8 hours) samples for the core lipid panel ( TC, TG, HDL -C, non -HDL -C, 
and calculated LDL -C) will be collected at time points described in  Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, 
Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7.  These samples will also be used for specialty lipid panel 
assessment when it is scheduled at the same time as the lipid panel assessment.   All lipid results 
after the randomization visit wi ll be blinded.  
8.2.2.2.  Specialty Lipid Panel  
Fasting (at least 8 hours) blood samples for the specialty lipid  panel (ApoB, ApoA -1, 
ApoB/ApoA -1 ratio, and Lp[a]), as well as for ApoCIII will be collected  at time points according 
to in Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and  Table  7.  The specialty lipid panels will be assessed 
in the same sample that is collected for the lipid panel.   All lipid results will be blinded from after 
randomization until the week 36 visit  for the IV cohorts, and unt il database lock for the SC cohorts  
. 
8.2.3.  Safety Procedures  
8.2.3.1.  Vital Signs

 CONFIDENTIAL  At the completion of th e study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and IECs/IRB as appropriate.  
9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient ad ministered a study drug , which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease , which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that , had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room 
for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a 
hospital stay that is longer than was or iginally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged 
due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating 
physician.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct n ormal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient  or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development  of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
9.3.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AE of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern 
specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate.  Such an event might warrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  Depending on the nature of the 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  event, rapid communication by the study  sponsor to other parti es (eg, regulators) might also be 
warranted (Section  9.4.3 ). 
9.3.4.  Infusion Reactions  
Infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2 hours after the 
infusion is completed.  All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (defined in Section  9.4.1 ) 
and graded u sing the grading scales as instructed in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the EOS .  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.6 .  Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Section  9.4.5 . 
9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours.  Refer to the study reference m anual for the procedure to 
be followed.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requeste d. 
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
 SAE with an onset within 30 days of the EOS/early termination visit - the SAE will be 
reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should m ake every effort to obtain follow -up 
information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
 SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the EOS /early termination visit  - only 
fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs will be 
reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up 
information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated  Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:

NOT qualify the patient as new onset of diabetes  
For patients with several fasting plasma glucose measurements but only with the 
last one ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), this single value ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) 
will NOT be considered and will NOT qualify the patient as new onset of diabetes  
9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.  
9.4.5.  Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results  
The criteria for determi ning whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
 the test r esult leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an  abnormal test finding 
should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to b e an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale 
outlined in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse event information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit.

9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Eval uation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
 Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient normal functioning 
level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient.  
 Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 Severe:   Produces  significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degre e of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Infusion Reactions  
The severity of infusion reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of the grade):  
 Mild :  Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated.  
 Moderate :  Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤24 hour s. 
 Severe :  Prolonged (eg, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief 
interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; 
hospitalization indicated for clinical sequelae; life -threatening consequences; urgent  
intervention indicated; death.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade:  
 Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mil d discomfort to touch; <  5 cm of 
erythema or induration that does not interfere with activity  
 Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >  24 hours or 
interferes with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythem a or 
induration or induration that interferes with activity

A list of factors to consider in assessing the relation ship of AEs to injection procedure, study 
procedure, or background treatment, etc. is provided in Appendix 1 . 
The sponsor will request information to justify the causality assessment of SAEs, as needed.  
9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The med ical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  Safety 
monitoring will be performed o n an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical tr ial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that potentially meets 
the relevant requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the 
Investigator’s Brochure or this protocol, and has a reasonable suspected causal rel ationship to the 
medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the SAP for the study.  The SAP may be revised during the 
study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to 
unexpected  issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses.  The final SAP 
will be issued before the database is locked  at the time of the Group B patient s’ first step analysis .

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
Let μ0 and μ1 be the population means of the percent change from baseline in calculated LDL -C 
at week 16 under each of the 2 placebo control arms and the 4 evina cumab treatment arms, 
respectively.  For the primary efficacy variable, the following null hypothesis and alternative will 
be tested:  
H0 : μ0 = μ1  
versus  
H1 : μ0 ≠ μ1  
Study treatment route of administration (Group A or B),  HeFH diagnosis (Yes/No ), and 
high-intensity statin (Yes/No ) (high -intensity statin defined as rosuvastatin 20 mg to 40 mg daily, 
atorvastatin 40 mg to 80 mg daily, or si mvastatin 80 mg daily) will be the 3 stratification factors 
for patient randomization .  Stratification factors HeFH diagnosis and high -intensity statin will be 
accounted for in the statistical modeling for efficacy.  
10.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Four  pairwi se comparisons of evinacumab to a placebo control arm corresponding to the route of 
administration ( Group A  or Group B ) are hypothesized for the primary efficacy analysis of this 
study.  A total of 216 patients are planned for assessing the primary measure  at week 16.  
Specifically, a sample size of 36 patients per treatment arm will have 90% power to detect a 
treatment group difference in mean percent change LDL -C of 20% in any 1 pairwise comparison 
(ie, evinacumab mean = 27% and control mean = 7%), assuming that the common standard 
deviation (SD) is 25 using an independent group t -test.  This sample size has been adjusted for a 
5% dropout rate.   The alpha level for each of the 4 pairwise comparisons is 0.05 (2 -sided), and 
assumes control of the overa ll type -1 error rate using a pre -specified hier archical inferential 
approach.  
Further, the evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen has been  added to Group B, allow ing for an 
assessment of dose -response in the IV route of administration.  The additional 36 patien ts for this 
second IV dose regimen culminate in a total of 252 patients planned for the study.  
With the intent to gain evinacumab experience across these dose regimens for future study 
planning in patients with HeFH, a subgroup analysis is planned for the stratified sub -population of 
patients diagnosed with HeFH.  To ensure an adequate number of pat ients are randomized into the 
HeFH strata level, a total of 175 patients are planned for assessing the percent change LDL -C from 
baseline at week 16.  Specifically, a sample size of 36 patients per treatment arm will have 90% 
power to detect a treatment gr oup difference in mean percent change LDL -C of 20% in any 1 
pairwise comparison ( ie, evinacumab mean = 27% and Control mean = 7%), assuming that the 
common SD is 20 using an independent group t -test.  This sample size has been adjusted for a 5% 
dropout rat e. 
Blinded Sample Size Adjustment  
Referencing the ICH E9 regulatory guidance, the study sample size may be re -estimated after 
approximately 75% of the patients reach the week 8 visit in the double -blind period, to ensure 
adequate power in the case of a lar ger-than-expected variability in the data .  This sample size

 CONFIDENTIAL  re-estimation process may be performed twice; once for Group A and again for Group B.   The 
sample size re  estimation will be based on the actual blinded pooled SD (adjusted as described in  
Keiser 2003 ) for the primary efficacy measure.  Since the patients’ post -baseline LDL -C levels are 
masked to all study participants (patients, site personnel, and sponsor staff), the blinded pooled SD 
will be calculated by a designated statistician external to Regeneron who has access to the lipid 
data.  As mentioned in Kieser  2003 , the blinded sample size re -estimation does not affect type -I 
error materially for continuous endp oints.  
This re -estimation procedure will assess the need for an increase or decrease in sample size 
(unrestricted recalculation).  The result of this procedure is non -binding, since the decision to 
increase the sample size will also take into account other  study execution factors (for example, 
availability of patients).  In the case the re -estimated sample size is implemented, a protocol 
amendment will document the modification.

10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
10.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
For the double -blind primary efficacy analysis,  the percent change from baseline in cal culated 
LDL -C at week 16, as defined in Section  4.2, will be analyzed in t he ITT population using a 
mixed -effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach.  All post -baseline data available 
within week 2 to week 16 analysis windows will be used and missing data are accounte d for by 
the MMRM model.  Each model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group 
(placebo and evinacumab dose regimens), ran domization strata, time point ( weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 for  
the Group B treatment groups; weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 for the Group A treatment groups), 
strata -by-time point interaction, and treatment -by-time point interaction, as well as the continuous 
fixed covariates of baseline LDL -C value and baseline value -by-time point interaction.  Contrast 
and estimate statements will be used to assess the treatment effects (LS means with confidence 
intervals) and each dose regimen pairwise comparison to placebo (mean difference and p -values).  
This model will be run separately for each route of administration ( Group A  or Group B, with 
Group B consisting of 3 dose regimens for the variability estimate ) using an unstructured 
correlation matrix to model the within -patient errors.  Parameters will be estimated using a 
restricted maximum likelihood method with the New ton-Raphson algorithm.  Denominator 
degrees of freedom will be estimated using Satterthwaite’s approximation.  
The 4 primary treatment grou p comparisons will evaluate at week 16 each evinacumab dose 
regimen to the placebo group corresponding to the route o f administration (IV or SC).  
1. Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W compared to Placebo IV  
2. Evinacumab 450 mg SC QW compared to Placebo SC  
3. Evinacumab 300 mg SC QW compared to Placebo SC  
4. Evinacumab 300 mg SC Q2W compared to Placebo SC  
The statistical testing of the 4 pairwise comparisons for the primary measure will be evaluated at 
a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 per pair  wise comparison, adjusting for multiplicity through a 
hierarchical inferential approach.  
Robustness of this statistical method will be assessed t hrough sensitivity analyses detailed in the 
SAP, including the effects of missing data on the primary efficacy endpoint (pattern mixture 
modeling which will take into account the differing missing value patterns based on calculated 
LDL -C collected in the p resence or absence of study treatment administration), and an 
on-treatment analysis of the primary endpoint (mITT patient population).  
10.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
For secondary efficacy endpoints (defined in Section  4.2) collected in the double -blind treatment 
period , descriptive summaries and analyses will be performed in the ITT population for each of 
the 5 pairwise treatment group comparisons , including the comparison of evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV 
Q4W patient treated group to the Placebo IV group .

 CONFIDENTIAL  For descriptive summar ies, percent change, and when appropriate absolute change from baseline, 
in calculated LDL -C, total -C, HDL -C, TG, non -HDL -C, ApoB, ApoA -1, and Lp(a) will be 
provided at each time point.  All measurements, scheduled or unscheduled, will be assigned to 
analy sis windows defined in the SAP in order to provide an assessment for these time points.  
Laboratory assessments other than the ones provided by the central laboratory will be excluded.  
For TG, measurements on non -fasting patients will be excluded.  The ti me profile of each 
parameter will be plotted by treatment group with the corresponding standard errors.   
Multiple types of measurements are planned to be analyzed during differing time points in the trial, 
specifically continuous measurements expected to have a normal distribution (example:  percent 
change in calculated LDL -C), continuous measurements expected to have a non -normal 
distribution (example: TG), and binary measurements (example:  proportion of patients reaching 
LDL -C < 100mg/dL).  
I. Continuou s endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution  
Continuous secondary variables defined in Section  4.2 anticipated to have a normal distribution  
(ie, lipids other than TG and Lp [a]) will be analyzed separately for Group  A and Group  B using 
the same MMRM model as for the primary endpoint.  Specifically, the model will contain fixed 
categorical effects of treatment group, randomization strata, planned time points up to the time 
point of interest, strata -by-time point interaction and treatment -by-time point interaction, as well 
as the continuo us fixed covariates of corresponding baseline value and baseline value -by-time 
point interaction.  
II. Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a non -normal distribution  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Section  4.2 anticipated to have a non -normal 
distribution (ie, TG and Lp(a)), will be analyzed using a robust regression model (ie, 
ROBUSTREG SAS procedure with M -estimation option) w ith treatment group and randomization 
stratum as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate.  Missing values will be 
addressed using a multiple imputation approach, which will be described in the SAP.  The variables 
in the multiple imputa tion model will at least include the same variables as used in the robust 
regression model.  The treatment group combined means will be provided with respective standard 
error ( SE) estimates.  The combined mean difference between the treatment groups will be 
provided with the SE, 95% confidence interval and p -value.  
III. Binary endpoints  
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Section  4.2 will be analyzed using stratified 
logistic regression (using the strata option of the SAS logistic procedure) with treatment group and 
randomization stratum as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate.  Missing 
values will be addressed using  a multiple imputation approach , which will be described in the SAP.  
The variables in the multiple imputation model will at least include the same variables as used in 
the logistic regression model.  Treatment effects will be compared and the combined odd s ratio 
estimate between the treatment groups, with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p -
value will be provided.  
In the data dependent case that the logistic regression method is not applicable (eg, the response 
rate is zero in one treatment arm and thus the maximum likelihood estimate may not exist), the 
LOCF (last observation carried forward) approach would be used for handling of missing values 
                                        VV-RIM-00089256-1.0 Approved - 11 Oct 2019 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  and an exact conditional logistic regression would be performed to compare treatment effects.  Th e 
LOCF imputation method will consist of using the  last value obtained up to the week 16 time 
window to impute the missing week 16 value.  
10.4.3.3.  Dose -Response Analysis  
Within each route of administration ( Group A  or Group B ), a dose -response descriptive analysis 
is planned for the evinacumab dose regimens, with the placebo group in the role of the null dose, 
for patients in the ITT population.  Summary tables will provide descriptive statistics (at least 
mean, median, SD, min/max) for percent change from baseline in LDL -C at each protocol planned 
visit in the double -blind period , by treatment group.  Graphs will provide mean and standard error 
bars for percent change from baseline in calculated LDL -C at each protocol planned visit, by 
treatment group.  
In addition to the analyses results for each evinacumab dose regimen comparison to placebo, the 
comparisons among the evinacumab dose regimens will be assessed in the ITT population for the 
percent change from baseline in calculated LDL -C at week 16.  This analysis wi ll employ the same 
statistical methodology as described for the primary comparisons, specifically the MMRM 
approach, for evaluating effects among the evinacumab dose regimens.  P-values will be provided 
for descriptive purposes to aid in interpretation of the dose -response.  
10.4.3.4.  Subgroup Analysis  
To assess the evinacumab treatment effect during the double -blind treatment period  on the 
stratification variable HeFH (Yes/No), specifically the strata level containing patients diagnosed 
with HeFH (Yes), a subgroup an alysis is planned for the change from baseline LDL -C in the ITT 
population for each route of administration ( Group A  or Group B ).  Specifically, the primary 
MMRM model used to assess the treatment group pairwise comparisons will have the addit ional 
variabl es of treatment -by-HeFH strata and treatment -by time point -by HeFH strata interaction 
terms.  For each dose regimen versus placebo at week 16, the LS mean treatment group difference 
will be provided for the HeFH (Yes) strata level, along with the  correspon ding SE, 95% CI and 
p-value (p -value is provided for descriptive purposes only).  The HeFH (Yes/No) stratification 
factor to be used for this subgroup analysis will be as recorded in the electronic data capture 
system.  
In addition, evinacumab treatment ef fect will also be explored in patients with a baseline LDL -C 
≥100  mg/dL or ≥130 mg/dL  during the double -blind treatment period .  
10.4.3.5.  Multiplicity Considerations  
To control the 5% overall type -I error for the 4 pairwise comparisons in the primary analysis, the 
overall study α level will be controlled by the use of a hierarchical inferential approach.  Statistical 
significance of the first pairwise treatment comparison is required before drawing inferential 
conclusions about the second pairwise treatment comparis on at the 0.05 alpha level.  Inferential 
conclusions about successive pairwise treatment comparisons require statistical significance of the 
prior treatment comparison.  The hierarchy testing sequence is the order of treatment comparisons 
as presented in S ection  10.4.3.1 .  This fixed hierarchical approach will ensure a strong control of 
the overall type -I error rate at the 0.05 level for each evinacuma b dose regimen comparison.

treatment period .  P-values will be provided for descriptive purposes  only. 
10.4.4.  Safety Analysis  
In general, for the double -blind period, the summary of safety results for patients in the 
double -blind SAF pop ulation will be presented by route of administration ( Group A or Group B ), 
pooling the evinacumab dose regimens within each route of administration (Group  A or Group B) , 
with the intent to maximize efforts to identify potential safety signals.  The treatment group data 
(individual evinacumab dose regimens and placebo) will also be presented with the intent to 
support the pooled dose regimens.  No formal inferential testing will be performed.  Summaries 
will be descriptive in nature.  
For Group B, summ aries of safety results for the open -label period will be presented for patients 
in the open -label SAF, by the total patients administered open -label study treatment (total), as well 
as by the patient subgroups of study treatment received in the double -blind treatment period (ie, 
evinacumab dose, placebo).

Analysis  
All AEs reported in this study will be coded using the currently available version of the Medical  
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®).  Adverse event incidence tables will present 
data by system organ class (SOC) sorted alphabetically and preferred term (PT) sorted by 
decreasing frequency, and summarize the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing 
an AE.  Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in 
the tables.  Data conventions for missing or partial AE dates will be addressed in the SAP.  The 
denominator for computation of p ercentage s is the respective SAF population s (ie, double -blind 
SAF or open -label SAF)  within each treatment group.  
Summaries of TEAEs incidences will include:  
 All TEAEs (and patient listing)  
 All treatment -emergent SAEs , including patient deaths (and patient listing)  
 All TEAEs of interest, which will be defined by a PT or a prespecified grouping of 
terms  
 TEAEs by severity (according to the gr ading scale outlined in Section  9.5.1 ), depicting 
the worse TEAE severity for those patients with multiple occurrences of the same event   
 All TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation (and patient listing)

 The potentially clinically significant value (PCSV) criteria are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the sponsor according to predefined 
criteria/thresholds based on literature review and defined by the sponsor for clinical 
laboratory tests and vital signs.  PCSV criteria will be provided in the SAP.  
 PCSV criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSV during the respective 
TEAE period s (double -blind or open -label) , taking into account all evaluations 
performed during the respective TEAE period s, including unscheduled or repeated 
evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the PCSV 
percentage.   
 Double -blind t reatment period:  The treatment period used for quantitative analysis in 
the double -blind period is defined as the  day after  the first study drug administration to 
the day of the last double -blind study drug injection + 7 days for Group A. For Group 
B, the treatment period is defined from the day after the first administration of double -
blind study treatment to the da y of the last administration of double -blind study

Drug and Study Conduct or Injection Procedure, Study Procedure, or 
Background Treatment, etc.  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug or study 
conduct or injection procedure, study procedure, or background treatment, etc.?  
No: 
 due to external causes such as environmental factors or other treatment(s) being 
administered  
 due to the patient’s disease state or clinical condition  
 do not follow a reasonable temporal sequence following the time of administration of 
the dose of study drug or injection procedure, study procedure, or backgroun d 
treatment, etc.  
 do not reappear or worsen when dosing with study drug or injection procedure, study 
procedure, or background treatment, etc. is resumed  
 are not a suspected response to the study drug or injection procedure, study procedure, 
or background treatment, etc. based upon preclinical data or prior clinical data  
Yes: 
 could not be explained by environmental factors or other treatment(s) being 
administered  
 could not be explained by the patient’s disease state or clinical condition  
 follow a reasonable  temporal sequence following the time of administration of the dose 
of study drug or injection procedure, study procedure, or background treatment, etc.  
 resolve or improve after discontinuation of study drug or injection procedure, study 
procedure, or back ground treatment, etc.  
 reappear or worsen when dosing with study drug or injection procedure, study 
procedure, or background treatment, etc. is resumed  
 are known or suspected to be a response to the study drug or injection procedure, study 
procedure, or ba ckground treatment, etc. based upon preclinical data or prior clinical 
data

 CONFIDENTIAL  Appendix  2: Simon Broome Register Diagnostic Criteria for Heterozygous Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia  
Definite familia l hypercholesterolemia is defined as:  
 Total -C >6.7 mmol/l (260 mg/dL) or LDL cholesterol above 4.0 mmol/l (155  mg/dL) 
in a child <16 years or Total -C >7.5 mmol/l (290 mg/dL) or LDL cholesterol above 
4.9 mmol/l (190 mg/dL) in an adult. (Levels either pre -treatment or highest on 
treatment)  
PLUS  
 Tendon xanthomas in patient, or in 1st degree relative (parent, sibling, child), or in 2nd 
degree relative (grandparent, uncle, aunt)  
OR 
 DNA -based evidence of an LDL receptor mutation or familial defective ApoB-100 
Possible familial hypercholesterolemia is defined as:  
 Total -C >6.7 mmol/l (260 mg/dL) or LDL cholesterol above 4.0 mmol/l (155  mg/dL) 
in a child <16 years or Total -C >7.5 mmol/l (290 mg/dL) or LDL cholesterol above 
4.9 mmol/l (190 mg/dL) in an adult. (Levels either pre -treatment or highest on 
treatment)  
And at least one of the following:  
 Family history of myocardial infarction below 50 years of age in 2nd degree relative or 
below 60  years of age in 1st degree relative.  
 Family history of raised cholesterols >7. 5 mmol/l (290 mg/dL) in adult 1st or 2nd 
degree relative or >6.7 mmol/l (260 mg/dL) in child or sibling under 16 years of age.

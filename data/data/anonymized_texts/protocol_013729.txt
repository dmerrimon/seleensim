 1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a phase  II study  testing  durvalumab  and tremelimumab  in metastatic,  non-transitional  
cell carcinoma  of the urothelial  tract.  Patients  with I) any component  of small  cell carcinoma  
(or neuroendocrine  features)   II) predominant  squamous  cell carcinoma  or III) predominant  
adenocarcinoma  of the urothelial  tract will be enrolled.  A Simon ‟s minimax  two-stage  design  
will be carried  out. We will enroll  13 patients  in the first stage.  If we see  1 or more responses  
in the first stage,  we continue  to the second  stage  where  we enroll  an additional  14 patients  
for a total sample  size of 27 patients.  Patients  will be treated  in 4-week  cycles.  Patients  will 
receive  4 cycles  of the combination  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  followed  by up to 9 
cycles  of durvalumab  maintenance  or until lack of clinical  benefit  or unacceptable  toxicity.  
Cross -sectional  imaging  will be performed  every  8 weeks  until the end of treatment.  The 
best,  confirmed  overall  response  rate (ORR)  by RECIST  1.1 will be  determined   as  the 
primary  endpoint.  
 
2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  Objective:  
 
• To determine  the efficacy  of the combination  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  in 
patients  with I) carcinoma  with a small -cell component  (or neuroendocrine  features)  
II) predominant  squamous  cell carcinoma  or III) predominant  adenocarcinoma  or the 
urothelial  tract as measured  by best ORR,  which  will include  the sum of  complete  
response  (CR) + partial  response  (PR) by RECIST  v 1.1. 
Secondary  Objectives:  
 
• To assess  for other  parameters  of clinical  outcome  of the combination  of durvalumab  
plus tremelimumab  in patients  with I) carcinoma  with a small -cell component  (or 
neuroendocrine  features)  II) predominant  squamous  cell carcinoma  or III) 
predominant  adenocarcinoma  or the urothelial  tract including:  
o Progression  Free Survival  (PFS)  and duration  of response  (DOR)  rate by 
RECIST  v1.1 
o Overall  survival  (OS)  
o Best ORR  (CR + PR), PFS,  and DOR  by Immune -related  Response  Criteria  in 
Solid  Tumors  (irRECIST)  criteria  
o Clinical  benefit  (CR + PR + Stable  Disease  [SD])  rate by RECIST  v1.1 and 
irRECIST  
o Rate of immune -related  Adverse  Events  (irAE)  
o Rate of serious  adverse  events  (SAE)

associated  with poor  outcomes following  radical  
cystectomy  (3)  
Exploratory  Objectives:  
• To determine  differences  in the immune  microenvironment  between  bladder  cancer  
histologies  as determined  by PD-L1 staining,  immune  related  gene  expression  
profiles,  and multiplex  immunofluorescence  (IF) for multiple  immune  cell subsets  
• To determine  whether  bladder  cancer  histology  and the associated  immune  
microenvironment  as defined  above  is predictive  of the clinical  benefit  rate (CBR).  
• To determine  if T cell clonality  in tumors  and blood  will be associated  with the CBR.  
• To determine  whether  immune  suppressive  cells types  in the peripheral  blood  and in 
tumors  will correlate  with a decreased  CBR.  
3.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.2 Non-Transitional  Cell Carcinoma  of the Urothelial  Tract  
 
Approximately  90% of malignant  tumors  arising  from the urothelial  tract are transitional  cell 
carcinoma  (TCC)  (1). The remainder  encompasses  a variety  of subtypes  such  as 
adenocarcinoma,  squamous  cell carcinoma,  
small  cell/neuroendocrine  carcinoma,  
sarcoma,  paraganglioma,  
carcinosarcoma/sarcomatoid,  lymphoma,  or 
melanoma.  Adenocarcinoma,  squamous  
cell carcinoma,  small  cell/neuroendocrine  
carcinoma  are the most  common  of these  
non-TCC histologies  and compromise  0.5- 
2%, 3-5%,  and 0.5-1% of bladder  tumors,  
respectively  (1). TCC plus squamous  cell 
carcinoma,  adenocarcinoma,  and small  
cell/neuroendocrine  carcinoma  are the 
recognized  as distinct  clinical  entities  (2). 
Although  each  of these  tumors  is 
characterized  by unique  risk factors  and 
biology,  a unifying  feature  is their 
aggressive  course  and dismal  prognosis,  including  in patients  with organ -confined  disease  
(3) (Figure  1). For patients  with metastatic  disease,  poor outcomes  with standard,  front-line 
chemotherapeutic  regimes  have been  reported  in two small  prospective  and a variety  of 
small  retrospective  studies  (Table  1).  For patients  with metastatic  disease  that has 
progressed  despite  front-line therapy,  clinicians  have  only case  reports  and a few 
retrospective  studies  to guide  management.  Outcomes  are typically  poor,  and new 
therapeutic  strategies  are urgently  needed.

3.3 Rationale  for Immune  Checkpoint  Blockade  in Non-Transitional  Cell 
Carcinoma  of the Urothelial  Tract  
Checkpoint  blockade  is a transformative  therapeutic  approach  to a broad  spectrum  of 
malignancies  because  it increases  the power  of antitumor  immunity  to obtain  durable  
responses.  Antibodies  targeting  the programmed  death  1 (PD-1) pathway  have  
demonstrated  evidence  of activity  and been  approved  by the Federal  Drug  Administraion  
(FDA)  in untreated  and pre-treated  metastatic  TCC (10–15). Although  these  agents  have not 
yet been  investigated  in non-TCC histologies,  the promising  results  in small  cell and 
squamous  cell lung cancer  (Table  2) provide  strong  rationale  for their use in this setting.  With 
regard  to adenocarcinoma  of the urothelial  tract,  a recently  presented  phase  I expansion  
study  incorporating  immune  checkpoint  blockade  reported  that 1 in 4 patients  had a partial  
response  (16). Our group  has also had success  treating  patients  with adenocarcinoma  of the 
urothelial  tract with anti-PD-1 antibodies  (personal  communication  with Dr. Dean  Bajorin).  
Durvalumab  is a anti-PDL1  antibody,  which  demonstrated  a toxicity  profile  similar  to other  
anti-PD-1/anti -PD-L1 agents,  and was recently  granted  accelerated  approval  by the FDA for 
pre-treated  metastatic  TCC (10). 
 
Although  treatment  with PD-1 blockade  has led to dramatic  success  in patients  with 
previously  incurable  metastatic  TCC,  it is still only a minority  of patients  who benefit.  This 
finding  has driven  the field toward  developing  combination  therapies  to increase  response  
rates.  Tremelimumab  is an antibody  that blocks  cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte -associated  antigen  4 
(CTLA -4), which  is expressed  on the surface  of T cells,  where  it primarily  suppresses  their 
early stages  of activation  by inducing  inhibitory  downstream  T-cell receptor  (TCR)  signaling  
and counteracting  activity  of the T-cell costimulatory  receptor,   CD28   (17,18).   The 
combination  of CTLA -4 and PD-1 blockade  is FDA approved  in melanoma  and seems  to be 
more  efficacious  than CTLA -4 blockade  alone  (19,20)  or PD-1 blockade  alone  in patients  
whose  tumors  do not express  PD-L1 (19). In patients  with previously  treated  metastatic  
urothelial  carcinoma  who received  anti-PD-L1 therapy,  our group  recently  demonstrated  that 
the diversity  of the baseline  peripheral  TCR repertoire  was directly  correlated  with overall  
survival  (21). Importantly,  CTLA -4 blockade  has also been  shown  to increase  the diversity

Version:  2/26/16   
  
peripheral  TCR repertoire,  which  may increase  the likelihood  that a particular  anti-tumor  T 
cell population  is present  (22,23).  In addition,  anti-PD-1 monotherapy  and the combination  of 
CTLA -4 and PD-1 blockade  were  evaluated  in randomized  phase  II trial in recurrent  small  
cell carcinoma  of the lung (24). The combination  demonstrated  higher  response  rates  over 
anti-PD-1 monotherapy  is now listed  in the NCCN  compendium  guidelines  for the treatment  
of small  cell carcinoma  of the lung.  Finally,  in Checkmate  032, combined  CTLA -4/PD -1 
blockade  in patients  with previously -treated,  metastatic  TCC with nivolumab  1 mg/kg  and 
ipilimumab  3 mg/kg  led to an ORR  of 38.5%,  which  compares  favorably  with 24.4%  ORR  
seen  with nivolumab  monotherapy  (25). Although  drug-related  adverse  events  of grade  3 or 
4 are more  common  with the combination  of PD-1 and CTLA -4 therapies,  most  of these  
events  resolve  with immunosuppressive  medication.  
 
Therefore,  the anti-PD-L1 antibody  durvalumab  in combination  with the anti-CTLA -4 antibody  
tremelimumab  is a logical  therapeutic  strategy.  We hypothesize  that it will demonstrate  
activity  in patients  with adenocarcinoma,  squamous  cell carcinoma,  small   
cell/neuroendocrine  carcinoma  of the bladder.  If successful,  the proposed  trial could  change  
the standard  of care for this patient  population  with very limited  treatment  options.

3.4 Rationale  for allowing  chemo -naïve  patients  with squamous  cell 
carcinoma  and adenocarcinoma  
Atezolizumab  (anti-PD-L1) and pembrolizumab  (anti-PD-1) both have accelerated  approval  
from the FDA for front-line use in chemo -naïve,  cisplatin -ineligible  patients  with metastatic  
TCC.  Approximately  50% of patients  with metastatic  TCC are cisplatin -ineligible  (30). 
Pembrolizumab  demonstrated  a 29% ORR  with the median  duration  of response  not yet 
being  reached  after a median  follow -up of 9.5 months  (31). Atezolizumab  demonstrated  an 
ORR  of 23% with a median  overall  survival  of 15.9 months  (14), which  compares  favorably  to 
the 13.8-14.8 month  median  overall  survival  of cisplatin -eligible  patients  with metastatic  TCC 
treated  with a front-line cisplatin  based  regimens  (32). These  data have provided   the 
rationale  for multiple,  randomized,  front-line clinical  trials evaluating  immune  checkpoint  
blockade  in patients  with metastatic  TCC.  The squamous  cell and adenocarcinoma  
histologies  are generally  believed  to be chemotherapy  refractory.  Indeed,  the NCCN  
guidelines  suggest  that patients  with muscle -invasive  squamous  cell and adenocarcinoma  of

the bladder  proceed  directly  to cystectomy  without  receiving  the neoadjuvant  cisplatin -based  
chemotherapy  that is standard  of care for patients  with muscle -invasive  TCC.  Small  cell 
carcinoma,  on the other  hand,  is well known  to be chemotherapy  sensitive,  although  it almost  
uniformly  progresses  after treatment.  Thefore,  we will allow  patients  with squamous  cell 
carcinoma  and adenocarcinoma  to be chemo -naïve  while  patients  with small  
cell/neuroendocrine  must  have been  previously  treated.  
 
3.5 Durvalumab  and tremelimumab  
 
3.4.1  Durvalumab  
 
The non-clinical  and clinical  experience  is fully described  in the current  version  of the 
durvalumab  Investigato r‟s Brochure.  
Durvalumab  is a human  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of the immunoglobulin  G (IgG)  1 
kappa  subclass  that inhibits  binding  of PD-L1 and is being  developed  by 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune  for use in the treatment  of cancer.   (MedImmune  is a  
wholly  owned  subsidiary  of AstraZeneca;  AstraZeneca/MedImmune  will be referred  to 
as AstraZeneca  throughout  this document.)   As durvalumab  is an engineered  mAb,  it 
does not induce  antibody -dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  or complement -dependent  
cytotoxicity.  The proposed  mechanism  of action  (MOA)  for durvalumab  is interference  
in the interaction  of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80  (B7.1).   Blockade  of PD-L1/PD -1 and 
PD-L1/CD80  interactions  releases  the inhibition  of immune  responses,  including  
those  that may result  in tumor  elimination.   In vitro studies  demonstrate  that 
durvalumab  antagonizes  the inhibitory  effect  of PD-L1 on primary  human  T cells 
resulting  in the restored  proliferation  of IFN-γ (36).  In vivo studies  have  shown  that 
durvalumab  inhibits  tumor  growth  in xenograft  models  via a T cell dependent  
mechanism  (36).  Based  on these  data,  durvalumab  is expected  to stimulate  the 
patient‟s antitumor  immune  response  by binding  to PD L1 and shifting  the balance  
toward  an antitumor  response.  Durvalumab  has been  engineered  to reduce  antibody - 
dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  and complement -dependent  cytotoxicity.  
Durvalumab  has been  given  to humans  as part of ongoing  studies  as a single  drug or 
in combination  with other  drugs.  To date durvalumab  has been  given  to more  than 
6000  patients  as part of ongoing  studies  either  as monotherapy  or in combination  with 
other  anti-cancer  agents.  No studies  have  been  completed  or terminated  prematurely  
due to toxicity.  
 
As of 09Feb2015,  pharmacokinetic  (PK) data were  available  for 378 subjects  in the 
dose -escalation  and dose-expansion  phases  of Study  CD-ON-durvalumab -1108  
following  treatment  with durvalumab  0.1 to 10 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  or 15 
mg/kg  every  3 weeks  (Q3W).  The maximum  observed  concentration  (Cmax) increased  
in an approximately  dose -proportional  manner  over the dose  range  of 0.1 to 15 
mg/kg.  The area under  the concentration -time curve  from 0 to 14 days (AUC 0- 14) 
increased  in a greater  than dose -proportional  manner  over the dose  range  of 0.1 to 
3 mg/kg  and increased  dose -proportionally  at ≥ 3 mg/kg.  These  results  suggest

durvalumab  exhibits  nonlinear  PK likely  due to saturable  target -mediated  clearance  at 
doses  < 3 mg/kg  and approaches  linearity  at doses  ≥ 3 mg/kg.  Near complete  target  
saturation  (soluble  programmed  cell death  ligand  1 [sPD -L1] and membrane  bound)   
is expected  with durvalumab  ≥ 3 mg/kg  Q2W.  Exposures  after multiple  doses  showed  
accumulation  consistent  with PK parameters  estimated  from the first dose.  In  
addition,  PK simulations  indicate  that following  durvalumab  10 mg/kg  Q2W  dosing,  
> 90% of subjects  are expected  to maintain  PK exposure  ≥ 40 µg/mL  throughout  the 
dosing  interval.  The PK data on the 4 week  dosing  of durvalumab  is in section  3.3.3.  
 
As of 09Feb2015,  a total of 388 subjects  provided  samples  for anti-drug antibody  
(ADA)  analysis.  Only 8 of 388 subjects  (1 subject  each  in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg  
cohorts,  and 4 subjects  in 10 mg/kg  cohort)  were  ADA positive  with an impact  on 
PK/pharmacodynamics  (PDx)  in 1 subject  in the 3 mg/kg  cohort.  
 
Of note,  durvalumab  has been  granted  accelerated  FDA approval  for treatment  of 
patients  with platinum -refractory  urothelial  bladder  cancer.  The designation  was  
based  on the results  of a phase  I/2 multicenter  study  evaluating  durvalumab  in 61 
patients  (40 PD-L1–positive,  21 PD-L1–negative)  (33). The ORR  was 31.0%  (95%  CI, 
17.6 to 47.1)  in 42 response -evaluable  patients,  46.4%  (95%  CI, 27.5 to 66.1)  in the 
PD-L1–positive  subgroup,  and 0% (95%  CI, 0.0 to 23.2)  in the PD-L1–negative  
subgroup.  Responses  are ongoing  in 12 of 13 responding  patients,  with median  
duration  of response  not yet reached  (range,  4.1+ to 49.3+  weeks).  The most  
common  treatment -related  adverse  events  (AEs)  of any grade  were  fatigue  (13.1%),  
diarrhea  (9.8%),  and decreased  appetite  (8.2%).  Grade  3 treatment -related  AEs 
occurred  in three  patients  (4.9%);  there  were  no treatment -related  grade  4 or 5 AEs. 
One treatment -related  AE (acute  kidney  injury)  resulted  in treatment  discontinuation.  
3.4.2  Tremelimumab  
 
The non-clinical  and clinical  experience  is fully described  in the current  version  of the 
tremelimumab  Investigato r‟s Brochure.  
Tremelimumab  is an IgG 2 kappa  isotype  mAb directed  against  the cytotoxic  T- 
lymphocyte -associated  protein  4 (CTLA -4) also known  as CD152  (cluster  of 
differentiation  152).  This is an immunomodulatory  therapy  (IMT)  that is being  
developed  by AstraZeneca  for use in the treatment  of cancer.  
An extensive  program  of non-clinical  and clinical  studies  has been  conducted  for 
tremelimumab  both as monotherapy  and combination  therapy  with conventional  
anticancer  agents  to support  various  cancer  indications  using  different  dose  
schedules.   To date tremelimumab  has been  given  to more  than 1500  patients  as part 
of ongoing  studies  either  as monotherapy  or in combination  with other  anticancer  
agents.  Refer  to the current  tremelimumab  Investigato r‟s Brochure  for a complete  
summary  of non-clinical  and clinical  information  including  safety,  efficacy  and 
pharmacokinetics.

Tremelimumab  exhibited  a biphasic  PK profile  with a long terminal  phase  half-life of 
22 days.  Overall,  a low incidence  of ADAs  (<6%)  was observed  for treatment  with 
tremelimumab.  
3.4.3  Durvalumab  in combination  with tremelimumab  
 
Targeting  both PD-1 and CTLA -4 pathways  may have additive  or synergistic  activity  
(34) because  the mechanisms  of action  of CTLA -4 and PD-1 are non-redundant;  
therefore,  AstraZeneca  is also investigating  the use of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  
combination  therapy  for the treatment  of cancer.  
To date more  than 3000  patients  have received  the combination  using  a number  of 
doses  and dosing  schedules.  
Study  D4190C00006  is a Phase  Ib dose -escalation  study  to establish  safety,  PK/PDx,  
and preliminary  anti-tumor  activity  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  
therapy  in patients  with advanced  NSCLC  (35).  The dosing  schedule  utilized  is 
durvalumab  every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  up to week  40 or every  4 weeks  (Q4W)  up to 
Week 48 (12 months),  combined  with tremelimumab  Q4W  up to Week  24 for 7 doses  
then every 12 weeks  for 2 additional  doses  for up to 12 months.   The recently  
published  results  are discussed  below.  
Study  D4190C00006:  As of 20Feb2015,  durvalumab  PK (n = 55) and tremelimumab  
PK (n = 26) data were  available  from 10 cohorts  (1a, 2a, 3a, 3b, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 8, and 
9) following  durvalumab  every  Q4W  or Q2W  dosing  in combination  with 
tremelimumab  Q4W  regimens.  An approximately  dose -proportional  increase  in PK 
exposure  (Cmax  and area under  the concentration -time curve  from 0 to 28 days 
[AUC 0- 28]) of both durvalumab  and tremelimumab  was observed  over the dose  range  
of 3 to 15 mg/kg  durvalumab  Q4W  and 1 to 10 mg/kg  tremelimumab  Q4W.  Exposures  
following  multiple  doses  demonstrated  accumulation  consistent  with PK parameters  
estimated  from the first dose.  It is to be noted  that steady  state  PK parameters  are 
based  on limited  numbers  of subjects.  The observed  PK exposures  of durvalumab  
and tremelimumab  following  combination  were  consistent  with respective  
monotherapy  data,  indicating  no PK interaction  between  these  2 agents.  
 
As of 20Feb2015,  ADA data were  available  from 60 subjects  for durvalumab  and 53 
subjects  for tremelimumab  in Study  D4190C00006.  Four of 60 subjects  were  ADA 
positive  for anti-durvalumab  antibodies  post treatment.  One of 53 subjects  was ADA 
positive  for anti-tremelimumab  antibodies  post treatment.  There  was no clear  
relationship  between  ADA and the dose  of either  durvalumab  or tremelimumab,  and 
no obvious  association  between  ADA and safety  or efficacy.  
An update  of Study  D4190C00006  was published  in March  of 2016  (35). Between  Oct 
28, 2013,  and April 1, 2015,  102 patients  were  enrolled  into the dose -escalation   
phase  and received  treatment.  At the time of this analysis  (June  1, 2015),  median  
follow -up was 18·8 weeks  (IQR 11-33). The maximum  tolerated  dose  was exceeded

in the cohort  receiving  durvalumab  20 mg/kg  every  4 weeks  plus tremelimumab  3 
mg/kg,  with two (30%)  of six patients  having  a dose -limiting  toxicity  (one grade  3 
increased  aspartate  aminotransferase  and alanine  aminotransferase  and one grade  4 
increased  lipase).  The most  frequent  treatment -related  grade  3 and 4 adverse  events  
were  diarrhea  (11 [11%]),  colitis  (nine  [9%]),  and increased  lipase  (eight  [8%]).  
Discontinuations  attributable  to treatment -related  adverse  events  occurred  in 29 
(28%)  of 102 patients.  Treatment -related  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in 37 
(36%)  of 102 patients.  22 patients  died during  the study,  and three  deaths  were  
related  to treatment.  The treatment -related  deaths  were  due to complications  arising  
from myasthenia  gravis  (durvalumab  10 mg/kg  every  4 weeks  plus tremelimumab  1 
mg/kg),  pericardial  effusion  (durvalumab  20 mg/kg  every  4 weeks  plus tremelimumab  
1 mg/kg),  and neuromuscular  disorder  (durvalumab  20 mg/kg  every  4 weeks  plus 
tremelimumab  3 mg/kg).  Evidence  of clinical  activity  was noted  both in patients  with 
PD-L1-positive  tumors  and in those  with PD-L1-negative  tumors.  Investigator - 
reported  confirmed  objective  responses  were  achieved  by six (23%,  95% CI 9-44) of 
26 patients  in the combined  tremelimumab  1 mg/kg  cohort,  comprising  two (22%,  
95% CI 3-60) of nine patients  with PD-L1-positive  tumors  and four (29%,  95% CI 8- 
58) of 14 patients  with PD-L1-negative  tumors,  including  those  with no PD-L1 staining  
(four [40%,  95% CI 12-74] of ten patients).  
3.4.3.1  Durvalumab   + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  dose  rationale  
 
The durvalumab  + tremelimumab  doses  and regimen  selected  for this study  
are based  on the goal of selecting  an optimal  combination  dose  of durvalumab  
and tremelimumab  that would  yield sustained  target  suppression  (PD-L1), 
demonstrate  promising  efficacy,  and have an acceptable  safety  profile.  
 
In order  to reduce  the dosing  frequency  of durvalumab  to align with the Q4W  
dosing  of tremelimumab,  while  ensuring  an acceptable  PK/PDx,  safety,  and 
efficacy  profile,  cohorts  were  narrowed  to 15 and 20 mg/kg  durvalumab  Q4W.  
PK simulations  from the durvalumab  monotherapy  data indicated  that a similar  
area under  the plasma  drug concentration -time curve  at steady  state  (AUC ss; 4 
weeks)  was expected  following  both 10 mg/kg  Q2W  and 20 mg/kg  Q4W  
durvalumab.   The observed  durvalumab  PK data from the D4190C00006   
study  were  well in line with the predicted  monotherapy  PK data developed  
preclinically.   This demonstrates  similar  exposure  of durvalumab  20 mg/kg  
Q4W  and 10 mg/kg  Q2W,  with no alterations  in PK when  durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab  (doses  ranging  from 1 to 3 mg/kg)  are dosed  together.   While  
the median  Cmax  at steady  state  (Cmax,ss) is expected  to be higher  with 
20 mg/kg  Q4W  (approximately  1.5 fold) and median  trough  concentration  at 
steady  state  (Ctrough,ss ) is expected  to be higher  with 10 mg/kg  Q2W  
(approximately  1.25 fold),  this is not expected  to impact  the overall  safety  and 
efficacy  profile,  based  on existing  preclinical  and clinical  data.

Monotonic  increases  in PDx activity  were  observed  with increasing  doses  of 
tremelimumab  relative  to the activity  observed  in patients  treated  with 
durvalumab  monotherapy.   There  was evidence  of augmented  PDx activity  
relative  to durvalumab  monotherapy  with combination  doses  containing  1 
mg/kg  tremelimumab,  inclusive  of both the 15 and 20 mg/kg  durvalumab  plus 
1 mg/kg  tremelimumab  combinations.  
 
Patients  treated  with doses  of tremelimumab  above  1 mg/kg  had a higher  rate 
of adverse  events  (AEs),  including  discontinuations  due to AEs, serious  AEs 
(SAEs),  and severe  AEs.  Between  the 10 mg/kg  durvalumab  + 1 mg/kg  
tremelimumab  and 10 mg/kg  durvalumab  + 3 mg/kg  tremelimumab  cohorts  
treated  at the Q2W  schedule,  the number  of patients  reporting  any AE, Grade  
3 AEs, SAEs,  and treatment -related  AEs was higher  in the 10 mg/kg  
durvalumab  + 3 mg/kg  tremelimumab  cohort  than the 10 mg/kg  durvalumab  + 
1 mg/kg  tremelimumab  cohort.   A similar  pattern  was noted  in the Q4W  
regimens,  suggesting  that, as the dose  of tremelimumab  increased  above  1 
mg/kg,  a higher  rate of treatment -related  events  may be anticipated.   Further,  
the SAEs  frequently  attributed  to immunotherapy,  pneumonitis  and colitis,  
were  more  commonly  seen  in cohorts  using  either  3 or 10 mg/kg  of 
tremelimumab  compared  to the 1 mg/kg  dose  cohorts.   Together,  these  data 
suggest  that a combination  using  a tremelimumab  dose  of 1 mg/kg  appeared  
to minimize  the rate of toxicity  when  combined  with durvalumab.   As a result,  
all combination  doses  utilizing  either  the 3 or 10 mg/kg  doses  of 
tremelimumab  were  eliminated  in the final dose  selection.  
 
In contrast,  cohorts  assessing  higher  doses  of durvalumab  with a constant  
dose  of tremelimumab  did not show  an increase  in the rate of AEs. The data 
suggested  that increasing  doses  of durvalumab  might  not impact  the safety  of 
the combination  as much  as the tremelimumab  dose.  Further,  safety  data 
between  the 10-mg/kg  and 20-mg/kg  cohorts  were  similar,  with no change  in 
safety  events  with increasing  dose  of durvalumab.  
 
In Study  D4190C00006  (35), of all treatment  cohorts,  the cohort  of 11 patients  
treated  in the 20 mg/kg  durvalumab  + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab  group  had the 
fewest  AEs, Grade  ≥3 AEs, SAEs,  and treatment  discontinuations  due to AEs, 
but still showed  strong  evidence  of clinical  activity.  This cohort  had a lower  
number  of treatment -related  Grade  ≥3 AEs or treatment -related  SAEs.  No 
dose -limiting  toxicities  were  reported.  
Preliminary  clinical  activity  of the durvalumab  and tremelimumab  combination  
did not appear  to change  with increasing  doses  of tremelimumab.  The 15- 
and 20-mg/kg  durvalumab  Q4W  cohorts  demonstrated  objective  responses  at 
all doses  of tremelimumab,  and increasing  doses  of tremelimumab  did not 
provide  deeper  or more  rapid  responses.

Efficacy  data suggested  that the 20 mg/kg  durvalumab  + 1 mg/kg  
tremelimumab  dose  cohort  may demonstrate  equivalent  clinical  activity  to 
other  dose  combinations.   A total of 5 of 11 patients  in the 20 mg/kg  
durvalumab  + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab  cohort  were  evaluable  for efficacy  with 
at least 8 weeks  of follow -up.  Of these,  there  were  2 patients  (40%)  with 
partial  response  (PR),  1 patient  (20%)  with stable  disease  (SD),  and 1 patient  
(20%)  with progressive  disease  (PD).  (The fifth patient  had only a single  
scan,  which  was conducted  outside  the window  for these  evaluations.)  
 
Taken  together,  the efficacy  and toxicity  data suggested  that the 20 mg/kg  
durvalumab  + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab  dose  combination  should  be selected  
for further  development.  
3.4.3.2  Rationale    for  4  cycles   of  combination   therapy   followed   by 
durvalumab  monotherapy  
Long -term follow  up on melanoma  patients  treated  with ipilimumab,  an anti- 
CTLA -4 targeting  antibody  (dosed  every  3 weeks  [q3w]  for 4 doses  and then 
discontinued),  shows  that patients  responding  to ipilimumab  derive  long-term 
benefit,  with a 3-year OS rate of approximately  22%.  Furthermore,  the survival  
curve  in this  population  reached  a plateau  at 3 years   and was maintained  
through  10 years  of follow  up (31). 
 
Data from Study  D4190C00006  (Phase  I trial in NSCLC  patients  using  the 
combination  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab)  also show  an approximately  
dose-proportional  increase  in PK exposure  for durvalumab  over  the  dose  
range  of 3 to 20 mg/kg  durvalumab  Q4W  or Q2W.  (For further  information  on 
PK observations  in Study  006, please  see the current  IB). 
The observed  durvalumab  PK data from the combination  study  were  well in 
line with the predicted  monotherapy  PK data (5th median  and 95th 
percentiles)  for a Q4W  regimen.  
 
Similar  data have been  presented  for other  anti-PD-1/PD -L1 targeting  
antibodies:  
 
Nivolumab  (anti-PD-1) was dosed  Q2W  for up to 96 weeks  in a large  Phase  I 
dose -escalation  and expansion  study,  and showed  responses  were  
maintained  for a median  of 22.94  months  for melanoma  (doses  0.1 mg/kg  to 
10 mg/kg),  17 months  for NSCLC  (doses  1, 3, and 10 mg/kg),  and 12.9 
months  for renal  cell carcinoma  patients  (doses  1 and 10 mg/kg)  at the time of 
data analysis  (28,37,38).   Furthermore,  responses  were  maintained  beyond  
treatment  discontinuation  in the majority  of patients  who stopped  nivolumab  
treatment  (either  due to protocol  specified  end of treatment,  complete  
response  [CR],  or toxicity)  for up to 56 weeks  at the time of data analysis  (37).

MPDL3280a  (anti-PD-L1) and the combination  of nivolumab  with ipilimumab,  
in which  patients  were  dosed  for a finite time period  and responses  
maintained  beyond  treatment  discontinuation  have  been  reported  (39,40).  
 
Similar  long-term results  may be expected  with use of other  immune -mediated  
cancer  therapeutics  including  anti-CTLA -4 antibodies  such  as tremelimumab,  
anti PD-L1 antibodies  such  as durvalumab,  or the combination  of the two. 
3.4.3.3  Fixed  Dosing  for durvalumab  and tremelimumab  
 
A population  PK model  was developed  for durvalumab  using  monotherapy  
data from a Phase  I study  (study  1108;  N=292;  doses=0.1  to 10 mg/kg  Q2W  
or 15 mg/kg  Q3W;  solid tumors).  Population  PK analysis  indicated  only minor  
impact  of body weight  (WT)  on the PK of durvalumab  (coefficient  of ≤0.5).  The 
impact  of body WT-based  (10 mg/kg  Q2W  or 20 mg/kg  Q4W)  and fixed dosing  
(750 mg Q2W  or 1500  mg Q4W)  of durvalumab  was evaluated  by comparing  
predicted  steady  state  PK exposures  (AUCss,0 -28, Cmax,ss,  and Cmin,ss)  
using  the population  PK model.  A fixed dose  of 750 mg Q2Wwas  selected  to 
approximate  10 mg/kg  Q2W  and a fixed dose  of 1500  mg Q4W  was selected  
to approximate  20 mg/kg  Q4W  (based  on median  body  WT of ~75 kg). A total 
of 1000  patients  were  simulated  using  body WT distribution  of 40–120 kg. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  that body  WT-based  (10 mg/kg  Q2W)  and 
fixed dosing  (750 mg Q2W)  regimens  yield similar  median  steady  state  Q2W  
and a fixed dose  of 1500  mg Q4W  was selected  to approximate  20 mg/kg  
Q4W  .Similarly,  a population  PK model  was  developed   for  tremelimumab  
using  data from Phase  1 through  Phase  3 (N=654;  doses=  0.01 to 15 mg/kg  
Q4W  or Q90D;  metastatic  melanoma ) (42). Population  PK model  indicated  
minor  impact  of body WT on PK of tremelimumab  (coefficient  of ≤ 0.5). The 
WT-based  (1 mg/kg  Q4W)  and fixed dosing  (75 mg/kg  Q4W;  based   on 
median  body WT of ~75 kg) regimens  were  compared  using  predicted  PK 
concentrations  (5th, median  and 95th  percentiles)  using  population  PK model  in 
a simulated  population  of 1000  patients  with body  weight  distribution  of 40 to 
120 kg. Similar  to durvalumab,  simulations  indicated  that both body  WT-based  
and fixed dosing  regimens  of tremelimumab  yield similar  median  steady  state  
PK concentrations  with slightly  less between -subject  variability  with fixed 
dosing  regimen.  
 
Similar  findings  have been  reported  by others  (43–45). Zhang  and colleagues  
investigated  12 monoclonal  antibodies  and found  that fixed and body size- 
based  dosing  perform  similarly,  with fixed dosing  being  better  for 7 of 12 
antibodies.  In addition,  they investigated  18 therapeutic  proteins  and peptides  
and showed  that fixed dosing  performed  better  for 12 of 18 in  terms   of 
reducing  the between -subject  variability  in PK/PDx  parameters(45).

A fixed dosing  approach  is preferred  by the prescribing  community  due to 
ease  of use and reduced  dosing  errors.  Given  expectation  of similar  PK 
exposure  and variability,  we considered  it feasible  to switch  to fixed dosing  
regimens.  Based  on average  body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500  mg Q4W  
durvalumab  (equivalent  to 20 mg/kg  Q4W)  and 75 mg Q4W  tremelimumab  
(equivalent  to 1 mg/kg  Q4W)  is included  in the current  study.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single -arm, phase  II study  with a Simon  minimax  design  testing  the combination  of 
durvalumab  and tremelimumab  in patients  with non-TCC of the urothelial  tract.  In the first 
stage,  13 patients  will be accrued.  If there  are no responses  in these  13 patients,  the study  
will be stopped.  Otherwise,  14 additional  patients  will be accrued  for a total of 27. The null 
hypothesis  will be rejected  if 4 or more  responses  are observed  in 27 patients.  See section  
14 for more  details  regarding  statistical  design.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients  will receive  durvalumab  1500  mg and tremelimumab  75 mg IV Q4W  for up to 4 
doses/cycles, then durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W starting at Week 16 for 9 doses (total 
treatment  duration  of 12 months).  The rationale  for this dosing  schedule  is explained  in 
section  3.3. 
 
Tremelimumab  will be administered  first.  Durvalumab  infusion  will start approximately  1 hour 
after the end of the tremelimumab  infusion.   The duration  will be approximately  1 hour for 
each  infusion.   A 1-hour observation  period  is required  after the first infusion  of durvalumab  
and tremelimumab.   If no clinically  significant  infusion  reactions  are observed  during  or after 
the first cycle,  subsequent  infusion  observation  periods  can be at the Investigator ‟s discretion  
(suggested  30 minutes  after each  durvalumab  and tremelimumab  infusion).  The timing  is

5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
The Investigational  Products  Supply  section  of AstraZeneca/MedImmune  will supply  
durvalumab  and tremelimumab  to the investigator  as a solution  for infusion  after dilution.  
 
Based  on average  body  weight  of 75 kg, a fixed dose  of 1500  mg Q4W  durvalumab  
(equivalent  to 20 mg/kg  Q4W)  and 75 mg Q4W  tremelimumab  (equivalent  to 1 mg/kg  Q4W)  
is included  in the current  study.  
5.2 Durvalumab  
 
Durvalumab  will be supplied  by Astrazeneca  as a 500-mg vial solution  for infusion  after 
dilution.  The solution  contains  50 mg/ml  durvalumab,  26 mM histidine/histidine -hydrochloride,  
275 mM trehalose  dehydrate,  and 0.02%  (weight/volume)  polysorbate  80; it has a pH of 6.0. 
The normal  fill volume  is 10mL.  Investigational  product  vials are stored  at 2°C to 8°C (36°F  to 
46°F)  and must  not be frozen.  Durvalumab  must  be used  within  the individually  assigned  
expiry  date on the label.  
Preparation  of durvalumab  doses  for administration  with an IV bag 
 
The dose  of durvalumab  for administration  must  be prepared  by the Investigato r‟s or site‟s 
designated  (investigational  protocol)  IP manager  using  aseptic  technique.  Total  time from 
needle  puncture  of the durvalumab  vial to the start of administration  should  not exceed:  
 
• 24 hours  at 2°C to 8°C (36°F  to 46°F)  
 
• 4 hours  at room  temperature  
 
If in-use storage  time exceeds  these  limits,  a new dose  must  be prepared  from new vials.  
Infusion  solutions  must  be allowed  to equilibrate  to room  temperature  prior to 
commencement  of administration.  
 
No incompatibilities  between  durvalumab  and polyvinylchloride  or polyolefin  IV bags  have 
been  observed.  Dose  of 1500mg  durvalumab  for patients  >30 kg will be administered  using  
an IV bag containing  0.9%  (weight  per volume  [w/v])  saline  or 5% (w/v)  dextrose,  with a final 
durvalumab  concentration  ranging  from 1 to 20 mg/mL,  and delivered  through  an IV 
administration  set with a 0.2- or 0.22-μm in-line filter.   Remove  30.0 mL of IV solution  from 
the IV bag prior to addition  of durvalumab.   Next,  30.0 mL of durvalumab  (i.e., 1500  mg of 
durvalumab)  is added  to the IV bag such  that final concentration  is within  1 to 20 mg/mL  (IV 
bag volumes  100 to 1000  mL).  Mix the bag by gently  inverting  to ensure  homogeneity  of the 
dose  in the bag. 
 
A fixed dosing  of Durvalumab  (1500mg)  will be used.  Durvalumab  will be administered  at 
room  temperature  (approximately  25°C)  by controlled  infusion  via an infusion  pump  into a 
peripheral  or central  vein. Following  preparation  of durvalumab,  the entire  contents  of the IV 
bag should  be administered  as an IV infusion  over approximately  60 minutes,  using  a 0.2, or

0.22-μm in-line filter. Longer  infusions  up to 8 hours  are allowed  if interruptions  are 
necessary  (see below).  
The IV line will be flushed  with a volume  of IV solution  (0.9%  [w/v] saline  or  5%  [w/v] 
dextrose)  equal  to the priming  volume  of the infusion  set used  after the contents  of the IV 
bag are fully administered,  or complete  the infusion  according  to institutional  policy  to ensure  
the full dose  is administered  and document  if the line was not flushed.  
Standard  infusion  time is 1 hour.  However,  if there  are interruptions  during  infusion,  the total 
allowed  time should  not exceed  8 hours  at room  temperature.  The table below  summarizes  
time allowances  and temperature.  
Durvalumab  hold and infusion  times 
 
Maximum  time from needle

administration  4 hours  at room  temperature,  
24 hours  at 2°C to 8°C 
Maximum  time for IV bag 
infusion,  including  interruptions  8 hours  at room  temperature  
 
 
In the event  that either  preparation  time or infusion  time exceeds  the time limits  outlined  in 
the table,  a new dose  must  be prepared  from new vials.  Durvalumab  does not contain  
preservatives,  and any unused  portion  must  be discarded.  
 
5.2 Tremelimumab  
 
Tremelimumab  will be supplied  by AstraZeneca  as a 400-mg vial solution  for infusion  after 
dilution.  The solution  contains  20 mg/mL  of tremelimumab,  20 mM histidine/histidine  
hydrochloride,  222 m M trehalose  dihydrate,  0.02%  (w/v)  polysorbate  80, and 0.27 mM 
disodium  edetate  dihydrate  (EDTA);  it has a pH of 5.5. The nominal  fill volume  is 20 mL. 
Investigational  product  vials are stored  at 2°C to 8°C (36°F  to 46°F)  and must  not be frozen.  
Tremelimumab  must  be used  within  the individually  assigned  expiry  date on the label.  
Preparation  of tremelimumab  doses  for administration  with an IV bag 
 
The dose  of tremelimumab  for administration  must  be prepared  by the Investigato r‟s or site‟s

equilibrated  at room  temperature  for about  2 hours  prior to administration.  Tremelimumab  
does not contain  preservatives  and any unused  portion  must  be discarded.  
 
No incompatibilities  between  tremelimumab  and polyvinylchloride  or polyolefin  IV bags have 
been  observed.  Doses  of 75 mg tremelimumab  for patients  >30 kg will be administered  using  
an IV bag containing  0.9%  (w/v)  saline,  with a final tremelimumab  concentration  ranging  from 
0.1 mg/mL  to 10 mg/mL,  and delivered  through  an IV administration  set with a 0.2 μm or 0.22 
μm in-line filter.  Remove  3.8 mL of IV solution  from the IV bag prior to addition  of 
tremelimumab.   Next,  3.8 mL of tremelimumab  (i.e., 75 mg of tremelimumab)  is added  to the 
IV bag such  that final concentration  is within  0.1 mg/mL  to 10 mg/mL  (IV bag volumes  50 to 
500 mL).  Mix the bag by gently  inverting  to ensure  homogeneity  of the dose  in the bag. 
 
A fixed dose  of 75mg  of Tremelimumab  will be used.  Tremelimumab  will be administered  at 
room  temperature  (approximately  25°C)  by controlled  infusion  via an infusion  pump  into a 
peripheral  or central  vein. Following  preparation  of tremelimumab,  the entire  contents  of the 
IV bag should  be administered  as an IV infusion  over approximately  60 minutes,  using  a 0.2, 
or 0.22-μm in-line filter. Longer  infusions  up to 8 hours  are allowed  if interruptions  are 
necessary  (see below).  
 
The IV line will be flushed  with a volume  of 0.9%  (w/v)  saline  equal  to the priming  volume  of 
the infusion  set used  after the contents  of the IV bag are fully administered,  or complete  the 
infusion  according  to institutional  policy  to ensure  the full dose  is administered  and document  
if the line was not flushed.  
 
Standard  infusion  time is 1 hour.   However,  if there  are interruptions  during  infusion,  the total

In the event  of a ≤Grade  2 infusion -related  reaction,  the infusion  rate of study  drug may be 
decreased  by 50% or interrupted  until resolution  of the event  and re-initiated  at 50% of the 
initial  rate until completion  of the infusion.   For patients  with a ≤Grade  2 infusion -related  
reaction,  subsequent  infusions  may be administered  at 50% of the initial  
rate.  Acetaminophen  and/or  an antihistamine  (e.g.,  diphenhydramine)  or equivalent  
medications  per institutional  standard  may be administered  at the discretion  of the 
investigator.   If the infusion -related  reaction  is ≥Grade  3 or higher  in severity,  study  drug will 
be discontinued.  
 
As with any antibody,  allergic  reactions  to dose  administration  are possible.   Appropriate  
drugs  and medical  equipment  to treat acute  anaphylactic  reactions  must  be immediately  
available,  and study  personnel  must  be trained  to recognize  and treat anaphylaxis.   The 
study  site must  have immediate  access  to emergency  resuscitation  teams  and equipment  in 
addition  to the ability  to admit  patients  to an intensive  care unit if necessary.

male  partner  must  agree  to use at least 1 highly  effective  method  of 
contraception  (Table  3) from the time of screening  until 180 days after the last 
dose  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  or 90 days after the last 
dose  of durvalumab  monotherapy.  Cessation  of birth control  after this point should  
be discussed  with a responsible  physician.  Periodic  abstinence,  the rhythm  
method,  and the withdrawal  method  are not acceptable  methods  of birth control.  
It is strongly  recommended  that non-sterilized  male  partners  of a female  patient  
must  use male  condom  plus spermicide  throughout  this period.  Not engaging  in 
sexual  activity  for the total duration  of the drug treatment  and the drug washout  
period  is an acceptable  practice.

potential  must  use a male  condom  plus spermicide  from screening  through  180 
days after receipt  of the final dose  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  
therapy  or 90 days after receipt  of the final dose  of durvalumab  monotherapy.  
Periodic  abstinence,  the rhythm  method,  and the withdrawal  method  are not 
acceptable  methods  of birth control.  Not engaging  in sexual  activity  is an 
acceptable  practice.  Male patients  should  refrain  from sperm  donation  throughout  
this period.  It is strongly  recommended  that female  partners  (of childbearing  
potential)  of male  patients  to also use a highly  effective  method  of contraception  
(Table  3) throughout  this period.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
9.1 Intervention  
 
This is a single -arm, phase  II study  with a Simon  minimax  design  testing  the combination  of 
durvalumab  and tremelimumab  in patients  with non-TCC of the urothelial  tract.  
 
Patients  will receive  durvalumab  1500  mg and tremelimumab  75 mg IV Q4W  for up to 4 
doses/cycles, then durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W starting 4 weeks after the last combination 
treatment  for up to 9 doses.  The rationale  for this dosing  schedule  is explained  in section  3.3. Table  6.

9.2 Duration  of treatment,  treatment  beyond  progression,  and criteria   for 
retreatment  
Patients  will continue  study  treatment  until lack of clinical  benefit,  development  of 
unacceptable  toxicity,  or completion  of planned  study  treatment.  Patients  may be treated  
beyond  RECIST  progression  if the investigator  deems  them  to be continuing  to derive  clinical  
benefit  and if they meet  all of the following  criteria:  
 
• Absence  of symptoms  and signs  (including  worsening  of laboratory  values  [e.g. 
new or worsening  hypercalcemia])  indicating  unequivocal  progression  of disease  
• No decline  in ECOG performance  status  from baseline  
• Absence  of tumor  growth  at critical  anatomic  sites (e.g. leptomeningeal  disease)  
that cannot  be managed  by protocol -allowed  medical  interventions  
• Evidence  of clinical  benefit  (defined  as the stabilization  or improvement  of 
disease -related  symptoms)  as assessed  by the investigator.  
 
Patients  for whom  radiographic  disease  progression  is confirmed  at subsequent  tumor  
assessments  may be considered  for continued  study  treatment  at the discretion  of the 
investigator  if they continue  to meet  the criteria  above  and have  evidence  of clinical  benefit.  
Other  immunotherapy  studies  have demonstrated  that patients  who initially  derive  clinical  
benefit  from treatment  and have  progression  while  off treatment  can derive  clinical  benefit  
again  if they are retreated  (40,46,47).  Retreatment  is allowed  (once  only) for patients  
meeting  the retreatment  criteria  below.   The same  treatment  guidelines  followed  during  the 
initial  12-month  treatment  period  will be followed  during  the retreatment  period,  including  the 
same  dose  and frequency  of treatments  and the same  schedule  of assessments.  
 
Patients  may undergo  retreatment  in 2 clinical  scenarios,  described  below:  
 
• Patients  who achieve  and maintain  disease  control  (i.e., CR, PR, or SD) up until 
the end of the treatment  period  may restart  treatment  with durvalumab  1500  mg 
and tremelimumab  75 mg IV Q4W  for up to 4 doses/cycles,  then durvalumab  
1500  mg Q4W  beginning  4 weeks  after the last dose  of combination  therapy  for 
up to 9 doses  of durvalumab  monotherapy  upon  evidence  of PD (with  or without  
confirmation  according  to RECIST  1.1) during  follow -up provided  the study  is still 
on-going.  If patients  experienced  unacceptable  toxicity  with the combination,  they 
may resume  durvalumab  1500  mg Q4W  alone.  
• Patients  who complete  the 4 dosing  cycles  of the combination  durvalumab  plus 
tremelimumab  with clinical  benefit  per Investigator  judgment   but  subsequently  
have evidence  of PD during  the durvalumab  monotherapy  portion,  with or without  
confirmation  according  to RECIST  1.1, may restart  treatment  with the durvalumab  
dosing  at 1500  mg Q4W  with 75 mg of tremelimumab  Q4W  for 4 doses  each  
followed  by durvalumab  monotherapy  1500mg  Q4W  (for 9 additional  doses)  at the 
investigato r‟s discret ion. 
 
For  patients    who  restart   combination    durvalumab   +   tremelimumab   treatment,   before  
restarting  their assigned  treatment,  the Investigator  should  ensure  that the patient:

Version:  2/26/16   
  
a. Does  not have any significant,  unacceptable,  or irreversible  toxicities  that indicate  
continuing  treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient  
b. Still fulfills  the eligibility  criteria  for this study,  including  re-consenting  to restart  
durvalumab  and tremelimumab  and excluding  previous  treatment   with 
durvalumab  and tremelimumab.  
 
c. Has not have received  an intervening  systemic  anticancer  therapy  after their 
assigned  treatment  discontinuation.  
 
d. Has had a baseline  tumor  assessment  within  28 days of restarting  their assigned  
treatment;  all further  scans  should  occur  with the same  frequency  as during  the 
initial  13 cycles  of treatment  until study  treatment  is stopped  (maximum  of 13 
cycles  of further  treatment).  
 
During  the retreatment  period,  patients  receiving  durvalumab  + tremelimumab  may resume  
durvalumab  dosing  at 1500  mg Q4W  with 75 mg of tremelimumab  Q4W  for 4 doses  each.  
Patients  will then continue  with durvalumab  monotherapy  at 1500  mg Q4W  beginning  4 
weeks  after the last dose  of combination  therapy  for up to 9 doses  of durvalumab  
monotherapy.  
 
Treatment  through  progression  is at the Investigator ‟s discretion,  and the Investigator  should  
ensure  that patients  do not have  any significant,  unacceptable,  or irreversible  toxicities  that 
indicate  that continuing  treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient.  
 
Patients  must  resign  the informed  consent  form to be treated  through  progression.  
Patients  who the Investigator  determines  may not continue  treatment  will enter  follow -up. 
9.3 Concomitant  Treatment  
 
Patients  must  inform  the treating  investigator  about  any medication  taken  from the time of 
screening  until the end of the clinical  phase  of the study  (final study  visit).  Any concomitant  
medication(s),  including  herbal  preparations,  taken  during  the study  will be recorded.  
 
Restricted,  prohibited,  and permitted  concomitant  medications  are described  in the following  
tables.  
Permitted  concomitant  medications  
 
Investigators  may prescribe  concomitant  medications  or treatments  (e.g.,  acetaminophen,  
diphenhydramine)  deemed  necessary  to provide  adequate  prophylactic  or supportive  care 
except for those  medications  identified  as “excluded”  as listed  in the section  below.  
 
Local  therapy  (palliative  radiotherapy,  surgery,  radiofrequency  ablation)  is allowed.

The following  medications  are considered  exclusionary  during  the study.  
 
• Any investigational  anticancer  therapy  (other  than the protocol  specified  therapies)  
• Any concurrent  chemotherapy,  radiotherapy  (except  palliative  radiotherapy),  
immunotherapy,  biologic  or hormonal  therapy  for cancer  treatment.  Concurrent  use of 
hormones  for noncancer -related  conditions  (e.g.,  insulin  for diabetes  and hormone  
replacement  therapy)  is acceptable.  NOTE:  Treatment  of isolated  lesions  for palliative  
intent  is acceptable  (e.g.,  by local surgery  or radiotherapy).  
• Immunosuppressive  medications  including,  but not limited  to systemic  corticosteroids  
at doses  exceeding  10 mg/day  of prednisone  or equivalent,   methotrexate,  
azathioprine,  and TNF-α blockers , except  when  required  to treat investigational  
product -related  AEs. Use of immunosuppressive  medications  for the management  of 
investigational  product -related  AEs or in subjects  with contrast  allergies  is acceptable.  
In addition,  use of inhaled  and intranasal  corticosteroids  is permitted.  A temporary  
period  of steroids  will be allowed  for different  indications,  at the discretion  of the 
principal  investigator  (e.g.,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease, radiation,  nausea,  
etc). 
• Live attenuated  vaccines  within  30 days of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  dosing  
(i.e., 30 days prior to the first dose,  during  treatment  with durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab  for 30 days post discontinuation  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab)  are 
not permitted.  Inactivated  vaccines,  such as the injectable  influenza  vaccine,  are

only. While  on treatment,  targeted  physical  examinations  are to be utilized  by the 
Investigator  on the basis  of clinical  observations  and symptomatology.  Vital signs  are to be 
performed  at each  assessment.  All clinical  assessments  should  occur  within  +/- 4 days of the 
intended  cycle  start date.  
 
10.2 Laboratory  Studies  During  Treatment  
Complete  blood  count  (CBC)  with differential  and platelets  and comprehensive  panel  (Na, K, 
Cl, CO2,  BUN,  Cr, Ca, magnesium,  glucose,  AST,  ALT, total protein,  Albumin,  ALP, total 
bilirubin)  must  be performed  on day 1 of each  cycle.  TSH,  LDH,  amylase,  and lipase  will be 
performed  at baseline  and on day 1 of each  cycle.  
 
10.3 Radiographic  Studies  During  Treatment  
Patients  will undergo  cross -sectional  imaging  every  2 cycles  (+/- 7 days)  until lack of clinical  
benefit.  CT chest  may be with or without  contrast.  MRI chest  may be performed  if patients  
refuse  CT. Abdomen/Pelvis  imaging  should  include  IV contrast  unless  there  is an 
extenuating  circumstance  approved  by the PI. CT scans  of the abdomen/pelvis  and MRI 
abdomen/pelvis  are both acceptable.  Imaging  will be evaluated  using  RECIST  v1.1.  
 
10.4 Post -Treatment  Follow -Up 
Assessments  for subjects  who have completed  durvalumab  and tremelimumab  treatment  
and achieved  disease  control,  or have discontinued  durvalumab  or tremelimumab  due to 
toxicity  in the absence  of confirmed  progressive  disease  are provided  in Appendix  2. 
 
Assessments  for subjects  who have discontinued  durvalumab  or  tremelimumab  treatment  
due to confirmed  PD are presented  in Appendix  3. 
 
 
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
The common  terminology  criteria  for adverse  events  version  4.0 (CTCAE  v4.0)  will be used  
to grade  the severity  of adverse  events.

For adverse  events  (AEs)  that are considered  at least possibly  due to administration  of 
durvalumab  or tremelimumab  the following  adjustment  guidance  may be applied:  
• Treat  each  of the toxicities  with maximum  supportive  care (including  holding  the 
agent  suspected  of causing  the toxicity  where  required).  
• If the symptoms  promptly  resolve  with supportive  care,  consideration  should  be given  
to continuing  durvalumab  or tremelimumab  along  with appropriate  continuing  
supportive  care.   If medically  appropriate,  modifications  to the schedule  are permitted  
for durvalumab  and tremelimumab  (see Appendix  1). 
• All schedule  modifications  should  be documented  with clear  reasoning  and 
documentation  of the approach  taken.  
• Dose  reductions  are not permitted.  
In addition,  there  are certain  circumstances  in which  durvalumab  or tremelimumab  should  be 
permanently  discontinued.  
 
Following  the first dose  of durvalumab  or tremelimumab,  subsequent  administration  of 
durvalumab  or tremelimumab  can be modified  based  on toxicities  observed  (see Appendix  
1).  Dose  reductions  are not permitted.  
 
Based  on the mechanism  of action  of durvalumab  or tremelimumab  leading  to T-cell 
activation  and proliferation,  there  is the possibility  of observing  immune  related  Adverse  
Events  (irAEs)  during  the conduct  of this study.  Potential  irAEs  include  immune -mediated  
enterocolitis,  dermatitis,  hepatitis,  and endocrinopathies.  Subjects  should  be monitored  for 
signs  and symptoms  of irAEs.  In the absence  of an alternate  etiology  (e.g.,  infection  or PD) 
signs  or symptoms  of enterocolitis,  dermatitis,  hepatitis,  and endocrinopathy  should  be 
considered  to be immune -related.  
 
Schedule  modification  recommendations  and toxicity  management  guidelines  for immune - 
mediated  reactions,  for infusion -related  reactions,  and for non-immune -mediated  reactions  
are detailed  in Appendix  1. As outlined  in Appendix  1, patients  may temporarily  suspend  
study  treatment  for up to 12 weeks  beyond  the scheduled  date of delayed  infusion  if study  
drug-related  toxicity  requiring  dose  suspension  is experienced.   If study  drug is held because  
of AEs for  12 weeks  beyond  the scheduled  date of infusion,  the patient  will be discontinued  
from study  therapy.  Inability  to reduce  corticosteroid  to a dose  of ≤10 mg of prednisone  per 
day (or equivalent)  within  12 weeks  after last dose  of study  drug/regimen  will result  in study  
discontinuation.  Recurrence  of a previously  experienced  Grade  3 treatment -related  AE 
following  resumption  of dosing  will result  in study  discontinuation.  Patients  who discontinue  
study  therapy  due to toxicity  will be followed  as outlined  in Appendix  2 or 3. Dose  
interruptions  for reasons  other  than toxicity,  such  as surgical  procedures,  may be allowed.  
The acceptable  length  of interruption  will be at the discretion  of the Sponsor.

The International  Conference  on Harmonization  (ICH)  Guideline  for  Good  Clinical  Practice  
(GCP)  E6 (R1) defines  an AE as: 
Any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  or clinical  investigation  subject  administered  a 
pharmaceutical  product  and which  does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an 
abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a 
medicinal  product,  whether  or not considered  related  to the medicinal  product.  
 
An AE includes  but is not limited  to any clinically  significant  worsening  of a subject ‟s 
pre-existing  condition.  An abnormal  laboratory  finding  (including  ECG  finding)  that requires  
an action  or intervention  by the investigator,  or a finding  judged  by the investigator  to 
represent  a change  beyond  the range  of normal  physiologic  fluctuation,  should  be reported  
as an AE. 
 
Adverse  events  may be treatment  emergent  (i.e., occurring  after initial  receipt  of 
investigational  product)  or nontreatment  emergent.  A nontreatment -emergent  AE is any new 
sign or symptom,  disease,  or other  untoward  medical  event  that begins  after written  informed  
consent  has been  obtained  but before  the subject  has received  investigational  product.  
 
Elective  treatment  or surgery  or preplanned  treatment  or surgery  (that was scheduled  prior to 
the subject  being  enrolled  into the study)  for a documented  pre-existing  condition,  that did  
not worsen  from baseline,  is not considered  an AE (serious  or nonserious).  An untoward  
medical  event  occurring  during  the prescheduled  elective  procedure  or routinely  scheduled  
treatment  should  be recorded  as an AE or SAE.  The term AE is used  to include  both serious  
and non-serious  AEs. 
 
The description  and reporting  of serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  are outlined  in section  17.2.  
 
11.3 Durvalumab  + tremelimumab  adverse  events  of special  interest  
 
An adverse  event  of special  interest  (AESI)  is one of scientific  and medical  interest  specific  to 
understanding  of the Investigational  Product  and may require  close  monitoring  and rapid  
communication  by the investigator  to the sponsor.  An AESI  may be serious  or non-serious.  
The rapid  reporting  of AESIs  allows  ongoing  surveillance  of these  events  in order  to 
characterize  and understand  them  in association  with the use of this investigational  product.  
AESIs  for durvalumab  ±tremelimumab  include  but are not limited  to events  with a potential  
inflammatory  or immune -mediated  mechanism  and which  may require  more  frequent  
monitoring  and/or  interventions  such  as steroids,  immunosuppressants  and/or  hormone  
replacement  therapy.  These  AESIs  are being  closely  monitored  in clinical  studies  with 
durvalumab  monotherapy  and combination  therapy.  An immune -mediated  adverse  event  
(imAE)  is defined  as an AESI  that is associated  with drug exposure  and is consistent  with an 
immune -mediated  mechanism  of action  and where  there  is no clear  alternate  etiology.  
Serologic,   immunologic,   and  histologic   (biopsy)   data,   as  appropriate,   should   be  used   to 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018

Version:  2/26/16   
  
support   an  imAE   diagnosis.   Appropriate   efforts  should   be  made   to  rule  out  neoplastic,  
infectious,  metabolic,  toxin,  or other  etiologic  causes  of the imAE.  
If the Investigator  has any questions  in regards  to an event  being  an imAE,  the Investigator  
should  promptly  contact  the Principal  Investigator  or Co-Principal  Investigator.  
AESIs  observed  with durvalumab  ± tremelimumab  include:  
 
• Diarrhea  / Colitis  and intestinal  perforation  
 
• Pneumonitis  / ILD 
 
• Hepatitis  / Transaminase  increases  
 
• Endocrinopathies   (i.e.  events   of  hypophysitis/hypopituitarism,   adrenal   insufficiency,  
hyper - and hypothyroidism  and type I diabetes  mellitus)  
• Rash  / Dermatitis  
 
• Nephritis  / Blood  creatinine  increases  
 
• Pancreatitis   / serum  lipase  and amylase  increases  
 
• Myocarditis  
 
• Myositis  / Polymyositis  
 
• Neuropathy  / neuromuscular  toxicity  (e.g. Guillain -Barré,  and myasthenia  gravis)  
 
• Other  inflammatory  responses  that are rare / less frequent  with a potential  immune - 
mediated  aetiology  include,  but are not limited  to, pericarditis,  sarcoidosis,  uveitis  and 
other  events  involving  the eye, skin, haematological  and rheumatological  events.  
In  addition,   infusion -related   reactions   and  hypersensitivity/anaphylactic   reactions   with  a 
different  underlying  pharmacological  aetiology  are also considered  AESIs.  
Further  information  on these  risks (e.g. presenting  symptoms)  can be found  in the current  
version  of the durvalumab  and tremelimumab  Investigator ‟s Brochures.  More  specific  
guidelines  for their evaluation  and treatment  are described  in detail  in the Dosing  
Modification  and Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  (please  see Appendix  1). These  
guidelines  have been  prepared  by the Sponsor  to assist  the Investigator  in the exercise  of 
his/her  clinical  judgment  in treating  these  types  of toxicities.   These  guidelines  apply  to AEs 
considered  causally  related  to the study  drug/study  regimen  by the reporting  investigator.  
If new or worsening  pulmonary  symptoms  (e.g. dyspnea)  or radiological  abnormality  
suggestive  of pneumonitis/interstitial  lung disease  is observed,  toxicity  managemen t as 
described  in detail  in the Dosing  Modification  and Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  (see 
Appendix  1) will be applied.  The results  of the full diagnostic  workup  (including  high-

resolution  computed  tomography  (HRCT),  blood  and sputum  culture,  hematological  
parameters  etc) will be captured  in the eCRF.  It is strongly  recommended  to perform  a full 
diagnostic  workup,  to exclude  alternative  causes  such  as lymphangitic  carcinomatosis,  
infection,  allergy,  cardiogenic  edema,  or pulmonary  hemorrhage.  In the presence  of 
confirmatory  HRCT  scans  where  other  causes  of respiratory  symptoms  have been  excluded,  
a diagnosis  of pneumonitis  (ILD)  should  be considered  and the Dosing  Modification  and 
Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  should  be followed.  
Pneumonitis  (ILD)  investigation  
 
The following  assessments,  and additional  assessments  if required,  will be performed  to 
enhance  the investigation  and diagnosis  of potential  cases  of pneumonitis.  The results  of the 
assessment  will be collected.  
 
• Physical  examination  
 
− Signs  and symptoms  (cough,  shortness  of breath  and pyrexia,  etc.) including  
auscultation  for lung field will be assessed.  
 
• SpO2  
 
− Saturation  of peripheral  oxygen  (SpO2)  
 
• Other  items  
 
− When  pneumonitis  (ILD)  is suspected  during  study  treatment,  the following  
markers  should  be measured  where  possible  and deemed  appropriate  by the 
treating  physician:  
 
(i) ILD Markers  (KL-6, SP-D) and β-D-glucan  
 
(ii) Additional  Clinical  chemistry:  CRP,  LDH 
 
11.4 Immune -related  adverse  events  
 
Based  on the mechanism  of action  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  leading  to T-cell 
activation  and proliferation,  there  is a possibility  of observing  irAEs  during  the conduct  of this 
study.   Potential  irAEs  may be similar  to those  seen  with the use of ipilimumab,  BMS -936558  
(anti-PD-1 mAb),  and BMS -936559  (anti-PD-L1 mAb)  and may include  immune -mediated  
enterocolitis,  dermatitis,  hepatitis  (hepatotoxicity),  pneumonitis,  and endocrinopathies  (49– 
51). These  AEs are inflammatory  in nature  and can affect  any organ.   With anti-PD-L1 and 
anti-CTLA -4 combination  therapy,  the occurrence  of overlapping  or increasing  cumulative  
toxicities  that include  irAEs  could  potentially  occur  at higher  frequencies  than with either  
durvalumab  or tremelimumab  monotherapy.   Patients  should  be monitored  for signs  and 
symptoms  of irAEs.   In the absence  of an alternate  etiology  (e.g.,  infection  or PD), an 
immune -related  etiology  should  be considered  for signs  or symptoms  of enterocolitis,  
dermatitis,  pneumonitis,  hepatitis,  and endocrinopathy.   In addition  to the dose  modification  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018  
Page 40 of 100 
Version:  2/26/16   
  
guidelines  provided  in Appendix  1, it is recommended  that irAEs  are managed  according  to 
the general  treatment  guidelines  outlined  for ipilimumab  (52). These  guidelines  recommend  
the following:  
 
• Patients  should  be evaluated  to identify  any alternative  etiology.  
• In the absence  of a clear  alternative  etiology,  all events  of an inflammatory  nature  should  
be considered  immune  related.  
• Symptomatic  and topical  therapy  should  be considered  for low-grade  events.  
• Systemic  corticosteroids  should  be considered  for a persistent  low-grade  event  or for a 
severe  event.  
• More  potent  immunosuppressives  should  be considered  for events  not responding  to 
systemic  steroids  (e.g.,  infliximab  or mycophenolate).  
• If the Investigator  has any questions  in regards  to an AE being  an irAE,  the Investigator  
should  immediately  contact  the Study  Physician.  
11.5 Criteria  for Hy’s Law (FDA  Guidance  2009)  
 
• The drug causes  hepatocellular  injury,  generally  shown  by a higher  incidence  of 3-fold or 
greater  elevations  above  the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non-hepatotoxic)  control  drug 
or placebo  
 
• Among  trial subjects  showing  such  aminotransferase  elevations,  often  with 
aminotransferases  much  greater  than 3 x ULN,  one or more  also show  elevation  of 
serum  total bilirubin  to >2 x ULN,  without  initial  findings  of cholestasis  (elevated  serum  
alkaline  phosphatase)  
 
• No other  reason  can be found  to explain  the combination  of increased  aminotransferases  
and total bilirubin,  such  as viral hepatitis  A, B, or C; pre-existing  or acute  liver disease;  or 
another  drug capable  of causing  the observed  injury.  
 
 
12.1 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Patients  will be assessed  every  cycle  by physical  examination  for response  for disease  
progression.  Patients  will have appropriate  radiographic  diagnostic  procedures  (CT scan of 
chest  and CT or MRI of abdomen  and pelvis)  for evaluation  of  measurable   disease   at 
baseline  within  28 days of initiation  of the study.  Imaging  will be repeated  to evaluate  the 
disease  every  2 cycles  while  patients  are on study.  
12.2 Response  Criteria  
 
The response  evaluation  criteria  in solid tumors  (RECIST  1.1) will be used  as presented  in 
Appendix  4. The immune -related  RECIST  (irRECIST)  criteria  will also be used  as a response  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018

Version:  2/26/16   
  
assessment  as described  in Appendix  5. 
 
 
 
12.3 Confirmation  
 
The main  goal of confirmation  of objective  response  is to avoid  overestimating  the response  
rate observed.  In cases  where  confirmation  of response  is not feasible,  it should  be made  
clear  when  reporting  the outcome  of such  studies  that the responses  are not confirmed.  
 
To be assigned  a status  of PR or CR, changes  in tumor  measurements  must  be confirmed  
by repeat  assessments  that should  be performed  no less than 4 weeks  after the criteria  for 
response  are first met. Longer  intervals  as determined  by the study  protocol  may also be 
appropriate.  
 
In the case  of SD, follow -up measurements  must  have met the SD criteria  at least once  after 
study  entry  at a minimum  interval  (in general,  not less than 6-8 weeks)  that is defined  in the 
study  protocol.  
 
 
13.1 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
An individual  subject  will not receive  any further  investigational  product  if any of the following  
occur  in the subject  in question:  
- Withdrawal  of consent  or lost to follow -up. If consent  is withdrawn,  the subject  will not 
receive  any further  investigational  product  or further  study  observation.  Note that patients  
may withdraw  from treatment  without  withdrawing  consent  for the study.  Such  patients  
will receive  no further  investigational  treatment  but can be followed  for progression  and 
survival.  Documentation  distinguishing  these  two outcomes  should  be placed  in the 
patient ‟s chart.  
- Adverse  event  that, in the opinion  of the investigator  or the sponsor,  contraindicates  
further  dosing  
- Subject  is determined  to have  met one or more  of the exclusion  criteria  for study  
participation  at study  entry  and continuing  investigational  therapy   might   constitute   a 
safety  risk 
- Pregnancy  or intent  to become  pregnant  
- Any AE that meets  criteria  for discontinuation  as defined  in Section  11.0 
- Grade  ≥ 3 infusion  reaction  
- Subject  noncompliance  that, in the opinion  of the investigator,  warrants  withdrawal;  e.g., 
refusal  to adhere  to scheduled  visits  
- Initiation  of alternative  anticancer  therapy  including  another  investigational  agent  
Page 42 of 100 
Version:  2/26/16  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018   
  
- Prolonged  duration  of therapy -related  toxicity  as defined  in section  11.2.  
- Patients   may  be  permitted   to  continue   study  treatment   after  RECIST   v1.1-defined  
progressive  disease  if they meet  all of the following  criteria:  
• Absence  of symptoms  and signs  (including  worsening  of laboratory  values  [e.g. 
new or worsening  hypercalcemia])  indicating  unequivocal  progression  of disease  
• No decline  in ECOG performance  status  from baseline  
• Absence  of tumor  growth  at critical  anatomic  sites (e.g. leptomeningeal  disease)  
that cannot  be managed  by protocol -allowed  medical  interventions  
• Evidence   of  clinical   benefit   (defined   as  the  stabilization   or  improvement   of 
disease -related  symptoms)  as assessed  by the investigator.  
Patients  for whom  radiographic  disease  progression  is confirmed  at subsequent  tumor  
assessments  may be considered  for continued  study  treatment  at the discretion  of the 
investigator  if they continue  to meet  the criteria  above  and have evidence  of clinical  
benefit.  
 
Subjects  who are permanently  discontinued  from further  receipt  of investigational  
product,  regardless  of the reason  (withdrawal  of consent,  due to an AE, other),  will be 
identified  as having  permanently  discontinued  treatment.  
 
Subjects  who are permanently  discontinued  from receiving  investigational  product  will be 
followed  per section  9.4 for safety,  including  the collection  of any protocol -specified  blood  
specimens,  unless  consent  is withdrawn  or the subject  is lost to follow -up or enrolled  in 
another  clinical  study.  All subjects  will be followed  for survival.  Subjects  who decline  to 
return  to the site for evaluations  will be offered  follow -up by phone  every  3 months  as an 
alternative.  
 
 
14.1 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
14.2 Primary  Endpoint  and Sample  Size Justification  
 
The three  histologic  groups  (Small -Cell, Squamous  Cell Carcinoma,  and Adenocarcinoma)  
will be part of the same  cohort  given  they are expected  to have  similar  response  rates.  With 
an unacceptable  rate of 5% and acceptable  rate of 20%,  and setting  type I error to 5% and 
power  to 80%,  with Simon ‟s minimax  two-stage  design,  we will enroll  13 patients  in the first 
stage.  Non-transitional  cell carcinoma  of the urothelial  tract is  a rare entity.  Single,  arm 
phase  II studies  have been  published,  but only in the front-line setting  and only in small  
cohorts  of patients  (summarized  in table 1). To our knowledge,  there  is no published  data on 
response  rates  to second -line chemotherapy  in patients  with non-transitional  cell carcinoma  
of the urothelial  tract.  The patient  population  under  study  has no standard  treatment  options  
and, in our group ‟s clinical  experie nce, rarely  experiences  a meaningful  clinical  benefit  from 
chemotherapy.  Therefore,  we have elected  to set the null hypothesis  at an ORR  of 5%.  If no 
Page 43 of 100 
Version:  2/26/16  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018   
  
patients  in the first 13 have  achieved  a response,  enrollment  for stage  2 will be halted  until 
the 13 subjects  in the first stage  have  been  assessed  for response  (window  of 2 disease  
assessment  scans  following  initiation  of treatment).  If we see 1 or more  responses  in any of 
the histologies  in the first stage,  we continue  to the second  stage  where  we will enroll  
additional  14 patients.  If, at the end of the study,  we see 4  or more responses  out of the total 
of 27 patients,  we will consider  the therapy  promising.  As an exploratory  analysis,  we will 
also estimate  the response  rate of the small  cell/neuroendocrine,  predominant  squamous,  
and predominant  adenocarcinoma  cohorts  separately  as a proportion  of responders  with the 
corresponding  confidence  interval,  although  formal  comparisons  between  the three  cohorts  
are not planned.  
The response  evaluable  population  is defined  as all patients  with a baseline  disease  
assessment  who have received  at leat one treatment  with durvalumab  and tremelimumab  on 
study  and have had either  at least one post-baseline  disease  assessment  or withdrawn  from 
study  treatment  prior to post-baseline  disease  assessment  due to clinical  progression  or 
death.  
 
As described  in section  9.2, patients  may undergo  retreatment  after disease  progression.  
The primary  endpoint  of best overall  response  is based  on the best response  from the first 
round  of treatment.  
Patients  who discontinue  protocol  therapy  for toxicity  will be followed  for response  per 
Appendix  2. Patient  who come  off study  for withdrawal  of consent  prior to having  one post- 
baseline  disease  assessment  will be considered  inevaluable  and will be replaced.  All treated  
patients  will remain  evaluable  for toxicity.  
 
With an estimated  patient  accrual  of 1 patient  every  month,  it would  take approximately  13- 
30 months  to complete  accrual  to the trial. 
14.3 Secondary  Endpoint  Justification  
 
1. Safety  and tolerability:  Adverse  events  and immune -related  adverse  events  by  the 
current  version  of Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  version  4 (CTCAE  
v4.03)  will be tabulated  in order  to assess  the safety  profile  and tolerability  therapy  in 
treated  patients.  
 
2. Progression -free survival  (PFS):  PFS will be defined  as the duration  of time from start of 
treatment  to time of recurrence,  progression,  or death  due  to  any  cause,   whichever  
occurs  first. Patients  will be censored  at last follow  up date.  The Kap lan Meier  estimate  of 
median  PFS will be reported,  as well as the PFS rate at 24 weeks  (+/- 1 week).  
 
3. Overall  survival  (OS):  Overall  survival  will be evaluated  using  the Kaplan  Mei er Method.  
 
4. Duration  of response  (DOR):  Duration  of response  will be determined  for each  patient  
with time origin  at the first occurrence  of confirmed  response  (CR, PR) until the first 
occurrence  of progression  or date of death  if the patient  dies due to any cause  before  
progression.  Duration  of response  will be evaluated  using  the Kaplan  Meier  Method.

Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018   
  
5. Clinical  benefit  rate (CBR):  Clinical  benefit  rate will be defined  as the percentage  of 
patients  with complete  response  (CR)  + partial  response  (PR) + stable  disease  (SD) by 
24 weeks  from the start of treatment  will be reported  and the 90% confidence  interval  will 
be estimated  using  exact  binomial  proportions.  
 
6. Best confirmed  ORR,  PFS,  CBR,  and DOR  according  to immune -related  RECIST  
(irRECIST)  as presented  by Bohnsack  et al.(53)  and as proposed  in Appendix  5. The 
methodology  is the same  as described  for RECIST  1.1 except  for new lesions  do not 
automatically  denote  disease  progression  and the measurement  of longest  diameter  of 
new measurable  lesions  are included  in the sum of the measurement  of the original  
target  lesions.  This method  accounts  for some  of the delayed  response  patterns  seen  
with immune  checkpoint  blockade.   The efficacy  endpoints  based  on irRECIST  will be 
estimated  using  the same  methods  for these  endpoints  based  on RECIST.  
14.4 Exploratory  analyses  
 
Listed  below  are immune  related  hypotheses  and the plan for exploratory  analyses.  
Additional  or different  investigational  methods  will be used  to characterize  and measure  
components  of the immune  response  based  upon  the latest  available  technology  at the time 
of analysis.  Specimens  will also be stored  for future  studies  related  to non-TCC of the 
urothelial  tract immunity  for those  patients  who have consented  to an institutional  biobanking  
protocol  (e.g. 06-107, 12-245, etc). If tissue  availability  or funding  is limited,  assay  priority  will 
be determined  at the investigators  discretion.  
The exploratory  hypotheses  listed  below  are hypothesis  generating.   As such,  all four of the 
exploratory  analyses  will be descriptive  and graphical  in nature.   To test the associations  
between  binary  CBR  or subtypes  and biomarkers  we will use Fishe r‟s exact  or Wilcoxon  rank 
sum tests for binary  or continous  variables  respectively.  
Immune  Hypothesis  1: The tumor  microenvironment  will vary based  on the histologic  subtype  
of non-TCC of urothelial  tract.  
Proposed  biomarker  evaluation:  Analysis  of immune  infiltrate  will be performed  using  
immunohistochemistry  (IHC),  immunofluorescence  (IF), and computational  approaches  
based  upon  RNA  sequencing  data.  Immune  regulatory  molecules  and populations  of cells 
analyzed  may include,  but will not be limited  to PD-L1, CD4,  CD8,  Tregs,  B cells,  
macrophages,  and dendritic  cells and expression  of biologically  relevant/phenotypic  markers  
thereof.  The Ventana  SP263  assay  (performed  in accordance  with the package  insert  on the 
Ventana  Benchmark  platform  (Ultra  or XT) should  be used  to measure  PD-L1. 
 
Immune  Hypothesis  2: The composition  and phenotype  of the tumor  microenvironment  at 
baseline  will correlate  with the clinical  benefit  rate (CBR).  
 
Proposed  Biomarker  Evaluation:  See immune  hypothesis  1. 
 
Immune  Hypothesis  3: High T cell clonality  in the tumor  plus peripheral  expansion  of 
dominant  tumor -resident  T cell receptor  clones  will be associated  with the CBR.

Proposed  Biomarker  Evaluation:  We will perform  high throughput  DNA  sequencing  of the 
CDR3  region  of the TCR beta chain  in baseline  tumors  and pre- and post-treatment  
peripheral  blood.  
 
Immune  Hypothesis  4: High levels  of myeloid  derived  suppressor  cells (MDSCs)  and T 
regulatory  cells (Tregs)  in the peripheral  blood  and high levels  of immunosuppressive  tumor  
associated  myeloid  cells and T regulatory  cells in will correlate  with a decreased  CBR.  
Proposed  Biomarker  Evaluation:  We will perform  a whole  blood  flow cytometry  based  assay  
to determine  the MDSC  and Treg percentage  in pre- and post-treatment  blood  samples.  We 
will analyze  tumor  associated  myeloid  cells and T regulatory  cells in the tumor  using  
immunohistochemistry  (IHC),  immunofluorescence  (IF), and computational  approaches  
based  upon  RNA  sequencing  data.  
 
 
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES 
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria.  Obtain  
informed  consent,  by following  procedures  defined  in section  entitled  Informed  Consent  
Procedures.  During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to 
complete  a protocol  specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  The individual  signing  the Eligibility  Checklist  
is confirming  whether  or not the participant  is eligible  to enroll  in the study.  Study  staff are 
responsible  for ensuring  that all institutional  requirements  necessary  to enroll  a participant  to 
the study  have been  completed.  See related  Clinical  Research  Policy  and Procedure  #401  
(Protocol  Participant  Registration).

IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018   
  
Weekly  registration  reports  may be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  
of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates,  accuracy  of evaluations,  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study  period.  Potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of 
the study  team.  
 
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety   Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
(MSKCC)  were  approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.    The plans  
address  the new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  
Cancer   Institute   for  Data  and  Safety   Monitoring   of  Clinical   Trials”   which   can  be  found  
at:   http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm -guidelines/page1.  The DSM  Plans  at 
MSKCC   were   established   and  are  monitored   by  the  Office  of  Clinical   Research.  The 
MSKCC   Data  and  Safety   Monitoring   Plans   can  be  found   on  the  MSKCC   Intranet   at:  
http://inside2/clinresearch/Do cuments/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20Monitoring%    
20Plans.pdf  
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical  trials report  to the Cente r‟s Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
The study  will be performed  in accordance  with ethical  principles  that have  their origin  in the 
Declaration  of Helsinki  and are consistent  with ICH/Good  Clinical  Practice,  and applicable  
regulatory  requirements  Subject  data protection.  
 
Potential  risks to human  subjects  include  drug-related  toxicity,  pain and discomfort  
associated  with durvalumab  and tremelimumab,  placement  of IV catheters,  phlebotomy,  and 
possible  psychological  discomfort  from the stresses  associated  with obtaining  imaging  
studies  (e.g.,  CT scan).  The side effects  and potential  toxicities  of durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab  are listed  in the informed  consent  form. All efforts  will be made  to avoid  any 
complication  by completely  reviewing  patients ‟ symp toms,  providing  appropriate  
management,  and monitoring  blood  tests.  If an adverse  medical  event  occurs,  the patient  will 
first contact  the primary  oncologist  or the principal  investigator.  At nights  and weekends,  
there  is an oncology  physician  on call at all times.  Patients  may either  call or come  directly  to

Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018   
  
the urgent  care center  at Memorial  Hospital  (or to their local emergency  room)  to be seen.  
Patients  suffering  serious  adverse  reactions  must  be carefully  followed  and all follow -up 
information  recorded.  
Alternatives/Options  for treatment  
 
Patients  can elect to receive  chemotherapy  or supportive/hospice  care.  They  can also elect  
to participate  in another  clinical  trial. Participation  in a clinical  trial is voluntary.  
Costs  
 
The patient  will be responsible  for all costs  related  to treatment  and complications  of 
treatment.  Durvalumab  and tremelimumab  will be provided  without  charge.   Costs   to  the 
patient  (or third party  insurer)  will include  the cost of hospitalizations,  routine  blood  tests  and 
diagnostic  studies,  office  visits,  baseline  EKG,  other  medications  such  as antibiotics  and 
docto r‟s fees.  Tests  done  solely  for research  purposes  will not be billed  to the patient.  
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSK‟s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,   be  life  threatening,   or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE  reporting   is  required   as  soon   as  the  participant   signs   consent.  SAE  reporting   is 
required  for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any

Version:  2/26/16  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018   
  
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events ‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other  reports  should  be sent to saemskind@mskcc.org . 
 
For all other  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other  reports  should  be sent to sae@mskcc.org . 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
• Subject ‟s initials  
• Medical  record  number  
• Disease/histology  (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number  and title 
Data needing  to be entered:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment  (drug,  device,  or intervention)  
• If the AE was expected  
• The severity  of the AE 
• The intervention  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o A explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the subject ‟s condition  
o Indication  if the subject  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem  
 
The PI or Co-PI‟s signature  and the date it was signed  are required  on the completed  report.  
 
The CRDB  SAE report  should  be completed  as per above  instructions.   If appropriate,  the 
report  will be forwarded  to the FDA by the SAE staff through  the IND Office.  
 
17.3.1  Requirement SAE Reporting to AstraZeneca/MedImmune

17.2.1.1  Serious  adverse  events  
 
* Send  deidentified  SAE report  and accompanying  cover  page  by way of email  
to AstraZeneca’s  designated  mailbox:  
AE MailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com  
 
If a non-serious  AE becomes  serious,  this and other  relevant  follow -up information  
must  also be provided  to AstraZeneca  and the FDA.  
The study  PI will request  additional  information  for any subject  with ongoing  AE(s)  / 
SAE(s)  at the end of the study,  if judged  necessary  
 
Serious  adverse  events  that do not require  expedited  reporting  to the FDA still need  
to be reported  to AstraZeneca  preferably  using  the MedDRA  coding  language  for 
serious  adverse  events.   This information  should  be reported  on a monthly  basis  and 
under  no circumstance  less frequently  than quarterly.  
 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune  retains  the right to request  additional  information  for any 
subject  with ongoing  AE(s)/SAE(s)  at the end of the study,  if judged  necessary.  
17.2.1.2 Reporting of deaths to AstraZeneca 
 
All deaths  that occur  during  the study,  or within  the protocol -defined  90-day post-last 
dose  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  safety  follow -up period  must  be reported  to 
AstraZeneca  as follows:  
 
• Death  that is clearly  the result  of disease  progression  should  be documented  but 
should  not be reported  as an SAE.  
 
• Where  death  is not due (or not clearly  due) to progression  of the disease  under  
study,  the AE causing  the death  must  be reported  to AstraZeneca  as a SAE within  
24 hours.  The report  should  contain  a comment  regarding  the co-involvement  of 
progression  of disease,  if appropriate,  and should  assign  main  and contributory  
causes  of death.  
• Deaths  with an unknown  cause  should  always  be reported  as a SAE.  
 
17.2.1.3  Overdose  
 
An overdose  is defined  as a subject  receiving  a dose  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  
in excess  of that specified  in the Investigato r‟s Brochure,  unless  otherwise  specified  
in this protocol.  
Any overdose  of a study  subject  with durvalumab  + tremelimumab,  with or without  
associated  AEs/SAEs,  is required  to be reported  within  24 hours  of knowledge  of the 
event  to the sponsor  and AstraZeneca/MedImmune  Patient  Safety  or designee  using  
the designated  Safety   e-mailbox   (AE MailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com ).  If 
the overdose  results  in an AE, the AE must  also be recorded  as an AE. Overdose

does not automatically  make  an AE serious,  but if the consequences  of the overdose  
are serious,  for example  death  or hospitalization,  the event  is serious  and must  be 
recorded  and reported  as an SAE (see Section  17.2).  There  is currently  no specific  
treatment  in the event  of an overdose  of durvalumab  or tremelimumab.  
 
The investigator  will use clinical  judgment  to treat any overd  ose. 
 
17.2.1.4  Hepatic  function  abnormality  
 
Hepatic  function  abnormality  (as defined  per Hy‟s law in Section  11.5)  in a study  
subject,  with or without  associated  clinical  manifestations,  is required  to be reported  
as “hepatic  function  abnormal”  within  24 hours of knowledge  of the event  to the 
sponsor  and AstraZeneca/MedImmune  Patient  Safety  using  the designated  Safety  e- 
mailbox  (AE MailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com ), unless  a definitive  
underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  (e.g., cholelithiasis  or bile duct obstruction)  
that is unrelated  to investigational  product  has been  confirmed.  
 
• If the definitive  underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  has been  established  
and is unrelated  to investigational  product,  the decision  to continue  dosing  of 
the study  subject  will be based  on the clinical  judgment  of the investigator.  
• If no definitive  underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  is established,  dosing  
of the study  subject  must  be interrupted  immediately.  Follow -up investigations  
and inquiries  must  be initiated  by the investigational  site without  delay.  
Each  reported   event   of  hepatic    function   abnormality   will  be  followed   by  the 
investigator  and evaluated  by the sponsor  and AstraZeneca/MedIm  mune.  
17.2.1.5  Maternal  Exposure  
 
If  a patient  becomes   pregnant  during  the  course  of the study,  the  IPs should  be 
discontinued  immediately.  
Pregnancy  itself is not regarded  as an AE unless  there  is a suspicion  that the IP  
under  study  may have interfered  with the effectiveness  of a contraceptive  medication.  
Congenital  abnormalities  or birth defects  and spontaneous  miscarriages  should  be 
reported  and handled  as SAEs.   Elective  abortions  without  complications  should  not 
be handled  as AEs.  The outcome  of all pregnancies  (spontaneous  miscarriage,  
elective  termination,  ectopic  pregnancy,  normal  birth,  or congenital  abnormality)  
should  be followed  up and documented  even if the patient  was discontinued  from the 
study.  
 
If any pregnancy  occurs  in the course  of the study,  then the Investigator  or other  site 
personnel  should  inform  the appropriate  AstraZeneca  representatives  within  1 day, 
i.e., immediately,  but no later than 24 hours  of when  he or she becomes  aware  of it.

IRB Number: 17 -511 A(3)  
Approval date: 13 -Nov-2018   
  
The designated  AstraZeneca  representative  will work  with the Investigator  to ensure  
that all relevant  information  is provided  to the AstraZeneca  Patient  Safety  data entry  
site within  1 to 5 calendar  days for SAEs  and within  30 days for all other  pregnancies.  
 
The same  timelines  apply  when  outcome  information  is available.  
 
It is the MSK IRB stance  that pregnant  partners  are out of our human  subject  
protection  (HSP)  purview  since  the pregnant  partners  are not our patients.  If notified,  
MSK will provide  the external  sponsor  the information  for their further  action,  but MSK 
will not be involved  in the consent  or data oversight  of that pregnant  individual.  
 
 
18.1 INFORMED  CONSENT  PROCEDURES  
 
Before  protocol -specified  procedures  are carried  out, consenting  professionals  will explain  
full details  of the protocol  and study  procedures  as well as the risks involved  to participants  
prior to their inclusion  in the study.  Participants  will also be informed  that they are free to 
withdraw  from the study  at any time.  All participants  must  sign an IRB/PB -approved  consent  
form indicating  their consent  to participate.  This consent  form meets  the requirements  of the 
Code  of Federal  Regulations  and the Institutional  Review  Board/Privacy  Board  of this Center.  
The consent  form will include  the following:  
 
1. The nature  and objectives,  potential  risks and benefits  of the intended  study.  
2. The length  of study  and the likely  follow -up required.  
3. Alternatives  to the proposed  study.  (This  will include  available  standard  and 
investigational  therapies.  In addition,  patients  will be offered  an option  of supportive  
care for therapeutic  studies.)  
4. The name  of the investigator(s)  responsible  for the protocol.  
5. The right of the participant  to accept  or refuse  study  interventions/interactions  and to 
withdraw  from participation  at any time.  
 
Before  any protocol -specific  procedures  can be carried  out, the consenting  professional  will 
fully explain  the aspects  of patient  privacy  concerning   research   specific   information.   In 
addition  to signing  the IRB Informed  Consent,  all patients  must  agree  to the Research  
Authorization  component  of the informed  consent  form.  
 
Each  participant  and consenting  professional  will sign the consent  form.  The participant  must  
receive  a copy of the signed  informed  consent  form.

 20.1 APPENDICES 
 
Appendix  1 Dosing  Modification  and Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  for Immune -Mediated,  
Infusion-Related, and Non-Immune –Mediated  Reactions  (MEDI4736  Monotherapy  or 
Combination  Therapy  With  Tremelimumab  or Tremelimumab  Monotherapy) - 
(1 November  2017  Version)  
General  Considerations  
Dose  Modifications  Toxicity  Management  
Drug  administration modifications  of study  drug/study  regimen  will be made  to 
manage  potential  immune -related  AEs based  on severity  of treatment -emergent  
toxicities  graded  per NCI CTCAE  v4.03.  
In addition  to the criteria  for permanent  discontinuation  of study  drug/study  
regimen  based  on CTC  grade/severity  (table  below),  permanently  discontinue  
study  drug/study  regimen  for the following  conditions:  
• Inability  to reduce  corticosteroid  to a dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone  per 
day (or equivalent)  within  12 weeks  after last dose of study  drug/study  
regimen  
• Recurrence  of a previously  experienced  Grade  3 treatment -related AE 
following  resumption  of dosing  
Grade  1 No dose modification  
Grade  2 Hold  study  drug/study  regimen  dose until Grade  2 resolution  to 
Grade  ≤1. 
If toxicity  worsens,  then treat as Grade  3 or Grade  4. 
Study  drug/study  regimen  can be resumed  once  event  stabilizes  to 
Grade  ≤1 after completion  of steroid taper.  
Patients  with endocrinopathies  who may require  prolonged  or 
continued  steroid replacement  can be retreated  with study  
drug/study  regimen  on the following  conditions:  
1. The event  stabilizes  and is controlled.  
2. The patient  is clinically  stable  as per Investigator  or treating  
physician’s  clinical  judgement.  
3. Doses  of prednisone  are at ≤10 mg/day  or equivalent.  It is recommended  that management  of immune -mediated  adverse  events  (imAEs)  
follows  the guidelines  presented  in this table:  
− It is possible  that events  with an inflammatory  or immune  mediated  
mechanism  could  occur in nearly  all organs,  some  of them  not noted  
specifically  in these  guidelines.  
− Whether  specific  immune -mediated  events  (and/or  laboratory  indicators  of 
such events) are noted in these  guidelines  or not, patients should  be 
thoroughly  evaluated  to rule out any alternative  etiology  (e.g.,  disease  
progression,  concomitant  medications,  and infections) to a possible  immune - 
mediated  event.  In the absence  of a clear alternative  etiology, all such events  
should  be managed  as if they were  immune  related. General  
recommendations  follow.  
− Symptomatic  and topical  therapy  should  be considered  for low-grade  (Grade  
1 or 2, unless  otherwise  specified)  events.  
− For persistent  (>3 to 5 days)  low-grade  (Grade  2) or severe  (Grade  ≥3) 
events, promptly start prednisone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  PO or IV  equivalent.  
− Some  events  with high likelihood  for morbidity  and/or  mortality  – e.g., myo- 
carditis,  or other similar  events  even if they are not currently  noted  in the 
guidelines  – should  progress  rapidly to high dose IV corticosteroids  
(methylprednisolone  at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day)  even if the event  is Grade  2, and if 
clinical  suspicion is high and/or there  has been clinical  confirmation.  
Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with the study physician,  and promptly  
pursue  specialist  consultation.  
− If symptoms recur  or worsen during  corticosteroid  tapering  (28 days  of 
taper),  increase  the corticosteroid  dose (prednisone  dose [e.g.,  up to 2 to 
4 mg/kg/day  PO or IV  equivalent])  until stabilization or improvement  of 
symptoms, then resume  corticosteroid  tapering  at a slower  rate (>28  days of 
taper).  
− More  potent  immunosuppressives  such as TNF inhibitors  (e.g.,  infliximab)  
(also  refer to the individual  sections  of the imAEs  for specific  type of

General  Considerations  
 
Dose  Modifications  Toxicity  Management  
Grade  3 Depending  on the individual  toxicity,  study  drug/study  regimen  
may be permanently  discontinued.  Please  refer to guidelines  below.  
Grade  4 Permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  regimen.  
Note:  For Grade  ≥3 asymptomatic  amylase  or lipase  levels,  hold study  drug/study  
regimen,  and if complete  work  up shows  no evidence  of pancreatitis, study  
drug/study  regimen  may be continued  or resumed.  
Note:  Study  drug/study  regimen  should  be permanently  discontinued  in Grade  3 
events  with high likelihood  for morbidity  and/or  mortality  – e.g., myocarditis,  or 
other similar  events  even if they are not currently  noted  in the guidelines.  
Similarly,  consider  whether study  drug/study  regimen  should  be permanently  
discontinued  in Grade  2 events  with high likelihood  for morbidity  and/or  mortality  
– e.g., myocarditis,  or other similar  events  even if they are not currently  noted  in 
the guidelines  – when  they do not  rapidly  improve  to Grade  <1 upon  treatment  
with systemic  steroids  and following  full taper  
Note:  There  are some  exceptions  to permanent  discontinuation  of study  drug for 
Grade  4 events  (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism,  Type  1 diabetes  mellitus).  immunosuppressive)  should  be considered  for events  not responding  to 
systemic  steroids. Progression  to use of more  potent  immunosuppressives  
should  proceed  more  rapidly  in events  with high likelihood  for morbidity  
and/or  mortality  – e.g., myocarditis,  or other similar  events  even if they are 
not currently  noted  in the guidelines  – when  these  events  are not responding  
to systemic  steroids.  
− With  long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive  use, consider  need for 
Pneumocystis  jirovecii  pneumonia  (PJP,  formerly  known as Pneumocystis  
carinii  pneumonia)  prophylaxis,  gastrointestinal  protection,  and glucose  
monitoring.  
− Discontinuation  of study  drug/study  regimen  is not mandated  for Grade  
3/Grade  4 inflammatory  reactions  attributed  to local tumor response  
(e.g.,  inflammatory  reaction  at sites of metastatic  disease  and lymph  nodes).  
Continuation of study  drug/study  regimen  in this situation should  be based  
upon  a benefit -risk analysis  for that patient.

Pediatric  Considerations  
Dose  Modifications  Toxicity  Management  
The criteria  for permanent  discontinuation  of study  drug/study  regimen  based  on 
CTC  grade/severity  is the same  for pediatric  patients as it is for adult  patients, as 
well as to permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  regimen  if unable  to reduce  
corticosteroid  ≤ a dose equivalent  to that required  for corticosteroid  replacement  
therapy  within  12 weeks  after last dose of study  drug/study  regimen  − All recommendations  for specialist  consultation should  occur  with a 
pediatric  specialist  in the specialty  recommended.  
− The recommendations  for dosing  of steroids  (i.e., mg/kg/day) and for IV  IG 
and plasmapheresis  that are provided for adult  patients  should  also be used 
for pediatric  patients.  
− The infliximab  5 mg/kg  IV dose recommended  for adults  is the same  as 
recommended  for pediatric  patients  ≥ 6 years  old. For dosing  in children  
younger  than 6 years  old, consult  with a pediatric  specialist.  
− For pediatric  dosing  of mycophenolate  mofetil,  consult  with a pediatric  
specialist.  
− With  long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive  use, consider  need for 
PJP prophylaxis,  gastrointestinal  protection, and glucose  monitoring.

version  4.03)  Dose  Modifications  Toxicity  Management  
Pneumonitis/Interstitial  
Lung  Disease  (ILD)  Any Grade  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor patients  for signs  and symptoms  of pneumonitis  or 
ILD (new  onset  or worsening  shortness  of breath  or cough).  
Patients  should  be evaluated  with imaging  and pulmonary  
function  tests,  including  other diagnostic  procedures  as 
described  below.  
− Initial  work -up may include  clinical  evaluation,  monitoring  of 
oxygenation  via pulse  oximetry  (resting  and exertion),  
laboratory  work -up, and high- resolution  CT scan.  
 Grade  1 
(asymptomatic, clinical  
or diagnostic  
observations  only;  
intervention  not 
indicated)  No dose modifications  required.  However,  
consider  holding  study  drug/study  
regimen  dose as clinically  appropriate  and 
during  diagnostic  work -up for other  
etiologies.  For Grade  1 (radiographic  changes  only):  
− Monitor and closely  follow  up in 2 to 4 days for clinical  
symptoms, pulse  oximetry  (resting  and exertion), and 
laboratory  work -up and then as clinically  indicated.  
− Consider  Pulmonary  and Infectious  disease  consult.  
 Grade  2 
(symptomatic;  medical  
intervention  indicated;  
limiting  instrumental  
ADL)  Hold  study  drug/study  regimen  dose until 
Grade  2 resolution  to Grade  ≤1. 
• If toxicity  worsens,  then treat as 
Grade  3 or Grade  4. 
• If toxicity  improves  to Grade  ≤1, 
then the decision  to reinitiate  study  
drug/study  regimen  will be based  
upon  treating  physician’s  clinical  
judgment  and after completion  of 
steroid taper.  For Grade  2 (mild  to moderate  new symptoms):  
− Monitor symptoms daily  and consider  hospitalization.  
− Promptly  start systemic  steroids  (e.g.,  prednisone  1 to 
2 mg/kg/day  PO or IV  equivalent).  
− Reimage  as clinically  indicated.  
− If no improvement  within 3 to 5 days,  additional  workup  
should  be considered  and prompt  treatment  with IV

depending  on type of 
skin rash)  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor for signs  and symptoms of dermatitis  (rash  and 
pruritus).  
− IF THERE  IS ANY  BULLOUS  FORMATION,  THE  STUDY  
PHYSICIAN  SHOULD  BE CONTACTED  AND  STUDY  
DRUG  DISCONTINUED.  
 Grade  1 No dose modifications.  For Grade  1: 
− Consider  symptomatic treatment, including  oral antipruritics  
(e.g.,  diphenhydramine  or hydroxyzine) and topical  therapy  
(e.g.,  urea cream).  
 Grade  2 For persistent  (>1 to 2 weeks)  Grade 2 
events, hold scheduled  study  drug/study  
regimen  until resolution  to Grade  ≤1 or 
baseline.  
• If toxicity  worsens,  then treat as 
Grade  3. 
• If toxicity  improves  to Grade  ≤1 
or baseline,  then resume  
drug/study regimen  after 
completion  of steroid  taper.  For Grade  2: 
− Obtain dermatology  consult.  
− Consider  symptomatic treatment, including  oral antipruritics  
(e.g.,  diphenhydramine  or hydroxyzine) and topical  therapy  
(e.g.,  urea cream).  
− Consider  moderate -strength  topical  steroid.  
− If no improvement  of rash/skin  lesions  occurs  within 3 to 
5 days or is worsening  despite  symptomatic  treatment  and/or  
use of moderate  strength topical  steroid, consider,  as necessary,  
discussing  with study physician  and promptly  start systemic  
steroids  such as prednisone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  PO or IV  
equivalent.  
− Consider  skin biopsy  if the event  is persistent  for >1 to 2 weeks  
or recurs.

If temporarily  holding  the study  
drug/study  regimen  does not provide  
improvement  of the Grade  3 skin rash to 
Grade  ≤1 or baseline  within 30  days,  then 
permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  
regimen.  
 
 
For Grade  4: 
Permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  
regimen.  − Promptly  initiate  empiric  IV methylprednisolone  1 to 
4 mg/kg/day  or equivalent.  
− Consider  hospitalization.  
− Monitor extent  of rash [Rule  of Nines].  
− Consider  skin biopsy  (preferably  more  than 1) as clinically  
feasible.  
− Once  the patient  is improving,  gradually  taper  steroids  over 
≥28 days  and consider  prophylactic  antibiotics,  antifungals,  and 
anti-PJP treatment  (refer  to current  NCCN  guidelines  for 
treatment  of cancer -related  infections  [Category  2B 
recommendation]).a

section)  Any Grade  
(depending  on the type 
of endocrinopathy,  
refer to NCI CTCAE  
v4.03 for defining  the 
CTC  grade/severity)  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Consider  consulting an endocrinologist  for endocrine  events.  
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with study physician.  
− Monitor patients  for signs  and symptoms  of endocrinopathies.  
Non-specific  symptoms  include  headache,  fatigue, behavior  
changes,  changed  mental  status,  vertigo,  abdominal  pain,  
unusual  bowel  habits, polydipsia, polyuria,  hypotension, and 
weakness.  
− Patients  should  be thoroughly  evaluated  to rule out any 
alternative  etiology  (e.g.,  disease  progression  including  brain  
metastases, or infections).  
− Depending  on the suspected  endocrinopathy, monitor  and 
evaluate  thyroid  function  tests:  TSH, free T3 and free T4 and 
other relevant  endocrine  and related labs (e.g.,  blood  glucose  
and ketone  levels,  HgA1c).  
− For modest  asymptomatic  elevations  in serum  amylase  and 
lipase,  corticosteroid  treatment  is not indicated  as long as there  
are no other signs  or symptoms  of pancreatic  inflammation.  
− If a patient  experiences  an AE that is thought  to be possibly  of 
autoimmune  nature  (e.g.,  thyroiditis,  pancreatitis, hypophysitis,  
or diabetes  insipidus), the investigator  should  send a blood  
sample  for appropriate  autoimmune  antibody  testing.

 Grade  1 No dose modifications.  For Grade  1 (including those  with asymptomatic  TSH  elevation):  
− Monitor patient  with appropriate  endocrine  function  tests.  
− For suspected  hypophysitis/hypopituitarism,  consider  consultation of an endocrinologist  to guide assessment  of early- morning  ACTH,  cortisol,  TSH  and free T4; also consider  gonadotropins, sex hormones,  and prolactin levels,  as well as 
cosyntropin stimulation  test (though  it may not be useful  in diagnosing  early  secondary  adrenal  insufficiency).  
− If TSH  < 0.5 ×  LLN,  or TSH  >2 × ULN, or consistently  out of range  in 2 subsequent  measurements,  include  free T4 at subsequent  cycles  as clinically  indicated  and consider  consultation of an endocrinologist.  
 Grade  2 For Grade  2 endocrinopathy  other  than 
hypothyroidism  and Type  1 diabetes  
mellitus,  hold study  drug/study  regimen

1. The event  stabilizes  and is 
controlled.  
2. The patient  is clinically  stable  as per 
investigator  or treating  physician’s  
clinical  judgement.  
3. Doses  of prednisone  are ≤10 mg/day  
or equivalent.  For Grade  2 (including those  with  symptomatic  endocrinopathy):  
− Consult  endocrinologist  to guide evaluation  of endocrine  function  and, as indicated  by suspected endocrinopathy  and as clinically  indicated,  consider  pituitary  scan.  
− For all patients  with abnormal  endocrine  work  up, except  those  with isolated  hypothyroidism  or Type  1 DM,  and as guided  by an  endocrinologist,  consider  short -term  corticosteroids  (e.g.,  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone  or IV  
equivalent)  and 
prompt initiation  of treatment  with relevant  hormone  replacement  (e.g.,  hydrocortisone, sex hormones).  
− Isolated  hypothyroidism  may be treated with replacement  therapy,  without  study  drug/study  regimen  interruption,  and without corticosteroids. 
− Isolated  Type  1 diabetes  mellitus  (DM)  may be treated with appropriate  diabetic  therapy,  without  study  drug/study  regimen  interruption, and without  corticosteroids.  
− Once  patients  on steroids  are improving,  gradually  taper  immunosuppressive  steroids  (as appropriate  and with guidance  of endocrinologist)  over ≥28 days  and consider  prophylactic  antibiotics,  antifungals,  and anti-PJP treatment  (refer  to

an  endocrinologist,  promptly  initiate  empiric  IV 
methylprednisolone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  or equivalent,  as well as 
relevant  hormone  replacement  (e.g.,  hydrocortisone, sex 
hormones).  
− For adrenal  crisis, severe  dehydration, hypotension,  or shock,  
immediately  initiate  IV corticosteroids  with mineralocorticoid  
activity.  
− Isolated  hypothyroidism  may be treated with replacement  
therapy,  without  study  drug/study  regimen  interruption,  and 
without corticosteroids. 
− Isolated  Type  1 diabetes  mellitus  may be treated with 
appropriate  diabetic  therapy,  without  study  drug/study  regimen

regimen  dose until resolution  to Grade  ≤1. 
For sensory  neuropathy/neuropathic  pain,  
consider  holding  study  drug/study  
regimen  dose until resolution  to Grade  ≤1. 
If toxicity  worsens,  then treat as 
Grade  3 or 4.  
Study  drug/study  regimen  can be resumed  
once event  improves  to Grade  ≤1 and 
after completion  of steroid taper.  For Grade  2: 
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with the study physician.  
− Obtain neurology  consult.  
− Sensory  neuropathy/neuropathic  pain may be managed  by 
appropriate  medications  (e.g.,  gabapentin or duloxetine).  
− Promptly  start systemic  steroids  prednisone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  
PO or IV  equivalent.  
− If no improvement  within 3 to 5 days despite  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  
prednisone  PO or IV  equivalent,  consider  additional  workup  
and promptly  treat with additional  immunosuppressive  therapy  
(e.g.,  IV IG).

Hold  study  drug/study  regimen  dose until 
resolution  to Grade  ≤1. 
Permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  
regimen  if Grade  3 imAE  does not resolve  
to Grade  ≤1 within 30 days.  
 
 
For Grade  4: 
Permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  
regimen.  For Grade  3 or 4: 
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with study physician.  
− Obtain neurology  consult.  
− Consider  hospitalization.  
− Promptly  initiate  empiric  IV methylprednisolone  1 to 
2 mg/kg/day  or equivalent.  
− If no improvement  within 3 to 5 days despite  IV 
corticosteroids,  consider  additional  workup  and promptly  treat 
with additional  immunosuppressants  (e.g.,  IV IG). 
− Once  stable,  gradually  taper steroids  over ≥28 days.  
Peripheral  neuromotor  
syndromes  
(such  as Guillain -Barre  
and myasthenia  gravis)  Any Grade  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− The prompt  diagnosis  of immune -mediated  peripheral  
neuromotor  syndromes  is important,  since  certain  patients  may 
unpredictably  experience  acute  decompensations  that can result  
in substantial  morbidity  or in the worst  case,  death.  Special  care 
should  be taken  for certain  sentinel  symptoms  that may predict  
a more  severe  outcome,  such as prominent  dysphagia,  rapidly  
progressive  weakness,  and signs  of respiratory  insufficiency  or 
autonomic  instability.  
− Patients  should  be evaluated  to rule out any alternative  etiology  
(e.g.,  disease  progression,  infections, metabolic  syndromes  or

medications).  It should  be noted  that the diagnosis  of immune - 
mediated  peripheral  neuromotor  syndromes  can be particularly  
challenging  in patients  with underlying  cancer,  due to the 
multiple  potential  confounding  effects  of cancer  (and its 
treatments)  throughout  the neuraxis.  Given  the importance  of 
prompt and accurate  diagnosis,  it is essential  to have a low 
threshold to obtain  a neurological  consult.  
− Neurophysiologic  diagnostic  testing  (e.g.,  electromyogram  and 
nerve  conduction  investigations,  and “repetitive  stimulation”  if 
myasthenia  is suspected) are routinely  indicated  upon  suspicion  
of such conditions  and may be best facilitated  by means  of a 
neurology  consultation.  
− It is important  to consider  that the use of steroids  as the primary  
treatment  of Guillain -Barre  is not typically  considered   
effective.  Patients  requiring  treatment  should  be started  with IV 
IG and followed  by plasmapheresis  if not responsive  to IV IG. 
 Grade  1 No dose modifications.  For Grade  1: 
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with the study physician.  
− Care should  be taken  to monitor  patients  for sentinel  symptoms 
of a potential  decompensation  as described  above.  
− Obtain a  neurology  consult.  
 Grade  2 Hold  study  drug/study  regimen  dose until 
resolution  to Grade  ≤1. 
Permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  
regimen  if it does not resolve  to Grade  ≤1 
within 30 days or if there  are signs  of 
respiratory  insufficiency  or autonomic  
instability.  For Grade  2: 
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with the study physician.  
− Care should  be taken  to monitor  patients  for sentinel  symptoms 
of a potential  decompensation  as described  above.  
− Obtain a  neurology  consult  
− Sensory  neuropathy/neuropathic  pain may be managed  by 
appropriate  medications  (e.g.,  gabapentin or duloxetine).  
MYASTHENIA  GRAVIS:  
o Steroids  may be successfully  used to treat myasthenia  
gravis.  It is important  to consider  that steroid  therapy  
(especially  with high doses) may result  in transient  
worsening  of myasthenia  and should  typically  be 
administered  in a monitored  setting  under  supervision  
of a consulting  neurologist.  
o Patients  unable  to tolerate  steroids  may be candidates  
for treatment  with plasmapheresis  or IV  IG. Such

decisions  are best made  in consultation with a 
neurologist,  taking  into account  the unique  needs  of 
each patient.  
o If myasthenia  gravis -like neurotoxicity  is present,  
consider  starting  AChE  inhibitor therapy  in addition

Myocarditis  Any Grade  General  Guidance  
Discontinue  drug permanently  if biopsy - 
proven  immune -mediated  myocarditis.  For Any Grade:  
− The prompt  diagnosis  of immune -mediated  myocarditis  is 
important,  particularly  in patients  with baseline  
cardiopulmonary  disease  and reduced  cardiac  function.  
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with the study physician.  
− Monitor patients  for signs  and symptoms  of myocarditis  (new  
onset  or worsening  chest  pain, arrhythmia,  shortness  of breath,  
peripheral  edema).  As some  symptoms  can overlap  with lung 
toxicities,  simultaneously  evaluate  for and rule out pulmonary  
toxicity  as well as other causes  (e.g.,  pulmonary  embolism,  
congestive  heart  failure,  malignant  pericardial  effusion).  A 
Cardiology  consultation should  be obtained  early,  with prompt  
assessment  of whether and when  to complete  a cardiac  biopsy,  
including any other diagnostic  procedures.  
− Initial  work -up should  include  clinical  evaluation,  BNP,  
cardiac  enzymes,  ECG,  echocardiogram  (ECHO), monitoring  
of oxygenation  via pulse  oximetry  (resting  and exertion),  and 
additional  laboratory  work -up as indicated.  Spiral  CT or 
cardiac  MRI  can complement  ECHO  to assess  wall motion  
abnormalities  when  needed.  
− Patients  should  be thoroughly  evaluated  to rule out any 
alternative  etiology  (e.g.,  disease  progression,  other  
medications,  or infections)  
 Grade  1

immunosuppressive  therapy  such as TNF inhibitors  
(e.g.,  infliximab  at 5 mg/kg  every  2 weeks).  Caution:  It is 
important  to rule out sepsis  and refer to infliximab  label  for 
general  guidance  before  using  infliximab.  
− Once  the patient  is improving,  gradually  taper  steroids  over 
≥28 days  and consider  prophylactic  antibiotics,  antifungals,  or 
anti-PJP treatment  (refer  to current  NCCN  guidelines  for 
treatment  of cancer -related  infections  [Category  2B 
recommendation]).a 
Myositis/Polymyositis  
(“Poly/myositis”)  Any Grade  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor patients  for signs  and symptoms  of poly/myositis. 
Typically,  muscle  weakness/pain occurs  in proximal  muscles  
including  upper  arms,  thighs,  shoulders,  hips,  neck and back,  
but rarely  affects  the extremities  including  hands  and fingers;  
also difficulty  breathing  and/or  trouble  swallowing  can occur  
and progress  rapidly.  Increased  general  feelings  of tiredness  
and fatigue  may occur,  and there  can be new-onset  falling,  
difficulty  getting  up from  a fall, and trouble  climbing  stairs,  
standing  up from  a seated  position,  and/or  reaching  up. 
− If poly/myositis  is suspected, a  Neurology  consultation should  
be obtained  early,  with prompt guidance  on diagnostic  
procedures.  Myocarditis  may co-occur  with poly/myositis; 
refer to guidance  under  Myocarditis. Given  breathing  
complications,  refer to guidance  under  Pneumonitis/ILD.  
Given  possibility  of an existent  (but previously  unknown)  
autoimmune  disorder,  consider  Rheumatology  consultation.  
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  with the study physician.  
− Initial  work -up should  include  clinical  evaluation,  creatine  
kinase,  aldolase,  LDH, BUN/creatinine,  erythrocyte  
sedimentation  rate or C-reactive  protein  level,  urine  myoglobin,  
and additional  laboratory  work -up as indicated,  including  a 
number  of possible  rheumatological/antibody  tests (i.e., 
consider  whether a  rheumatologist  consultation is indicated  and 
could  guide need  for rheumatoid factor,  antinuclear  antibody,  
anti-smooth muscle,  antisynthetase  [such  as anti-Jo-1], and/or  
signal -recognition  particle  antibodies).  Confirmatory testing

may include  electromyography,  nerve  conduction  studies,  MRI  
of the muscles,  and/or  a muscle  biopsy. Consider  Barium  
swallow  for evaluation  of dysphagia  or dysphonia.  
Patients  should  be thoroughly  evaluated  to rule out any alternative  
etiology  (e.g.,  disease  progression, other medications,  or infections).

Appendix  4 The Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST  1.1) 
 
Modified  Excerpt  from  Original  Publication  
 
Selected  sections  from the Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST),  Version  1.11 
are presented  below,  with slight  modifications  and the addition  of explanatory  text as needed  for 
clarity.2 
I. Measurability  of Tumor  at Baseline  
 
Definitions  
At baseline,  tumor  lesions/lymph  nodes  will be categorized  measurable  or non-measurable  as 
follows:  
 
A. Measurable  Tumor  Lesions  
Tumor  Lesions.   Tumor  lesions  must  be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  
diameter  in the plane  of measurement  is to be recorded)  with a minimum  size of: 
o 10 mm by CT or MRI scan  (CT/MRI scan  slice thickness/interval  no greater  than 5 mm) 
o 10-mm caliper  measurement  by clinical  examination  (lesions  that cannot  be accurately  
measured  with calipers  should  be recorded  as non-measurable)  
o 20 mm by chest  X-ray 
 
Malignant  Lymph  Nodes.   To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  
node  must  be  15 mm in the short  axis when  assessed  by CT scan (CT scan  slice thickness  
recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).   At baseline  and in follow -up, only the short  axis will be 
measured  and followed.   See also notes  below  on “Baseline  Documentation  of Target  and Non- 
Target  Lesions”  for information  on lymph  node  measurement.  
 
B. Non-Measurable  Tumor  Lesions  
Non-measurable  tumor  lesions  encompass  small  lesions  (longest  diameter   10 mm or pathological  
lymph  nodes  with  10 to  15 mm short  axis),  as well as truly non-measurable  lesions.   Lesions  
considered  truly non-measurable  include:   leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural  or pericardial  
effusion,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  lymphangitic  involvement  of skin or lung,  peritoneal  spread,

and abdominal  masses/abdominal  organomegaly  identified  by physical  examination  that is not 
measurable  by reproducible  imaging  techniques.  
 
C. Special  Considerations  Regarding  Lesion  Measurability  
 
Bone  lesions,  cystic  lesions,  and lesions  previously  treated  with local therapy  require  particular  
comment,  as outlined  below.  
 
Bone  lesions:  Bone  scan,  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  scan,  or plain films are 
not considered  adequate  imaging  techniques  to measure  bone  lesions.   However,  these  techniques  
can be used  to confirm  the presence  or disappearance  of bone  lesions.  
o Lytic bone  lesions  or mixed  lytic-blastic  lesions,  with identifiable  soft tissue  components,  that can 
be evaluated  by cross -sectional  imaging  techniques  such  as CT or MRI can be considered  
measurable  lesions  if the soft tissue  component  meets  the definition  of measurability  described  
above.  
o Blastic  bone  lesions  are non-measurable.  
 
Cystic  lesions:  Lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should  not be 
considered  malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable  nor non-measurable)  since  they are, by definition,  
simple cysts. 
o Cystic  lesions  thought  to represent  cystic  metastases  can be considered  measurable  lesions  if 
they meet  the definition  of measurability  described  above.   However,  if non-cystic  lesions  are 
present  in the same  patient,  these  are preferred  for selection  as target  lesions.  
 
Lesions  with prior  local  treatment:  Tumor  lesions  situated  in a previously  irradiated  area,  or in an 
area subjected  to other  loco-regional  therapy,  are usually  not considered  measurable  unless  there  
has been  demonstrated  progression  in the lesion.   Study  protocols  should  detail  the conditions  
under  which  such  lesions  would  be considered  measurable.  
 
II. Target  Lesions:  Specifications  by Methods  of Measurements  
 
A. Measurement  of Lesions  
All measurements  should  be recorded  in metric  notation,  using  calipers  if clinically  assessed.  All 
baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as close  as possible  to the treatment  start and never  
more  than 4 weeks  before  the beginning  of the treatment.

B. Method  of Assessment  
The same  method  of assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used  to characterize  each  
identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during  study.   Imaging -based  evaluation  should  always  
be the preferred  option.  
 
Clinical  Lesions.   Clinical  lesions  will only be considered  measurable  when  they are superficial  and 
 10 mm in diameter  as assessed  using  calipers  (e.g.,  skin nodules).   For the case  of skin lesions,  
documentation  by color  photography,  including  a ruler to estimate  the size of the lesion,  is 
suggested.  
 
Chest  X-Ray.  Chest  CT is preferred  over chest  X-ray, particularly  when  progression  is an important  
endpoint,  since  CT is more  sensitive  than X-ray, particularly  in identifying  new lesions.   However,  
lesions  on chest  X-ray may be considered  measurable  if they are clearly  defined  and surrounded  by 
aerated  lung.  
 
CT, MRI.  CT is the best currently  available  and reproducible  method  to measure  lesions  selected  
for response  assessment.   This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions  on CT scan  based  on 
the assumption  that CT slice thickness  is 5 mm or less. When  CT scans  have slice thickness  
greater  than 5 mm, the minimum  size for a measurable  lesion  should  be twice  the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable. 
 
If prior to enrollment  it is known  that a patient  is unable  to undergo  CT scans  with intravenous  
(IV) contrast  due to allergy  or renal  insufficiency,  the decision  as to whether  a non-contrast  CT or 
MRI (without  IV contrast)  will be used  to evaluate  the patient  at baseline  and during  the study  should  
be guided  by the tumor  type under  investigation  and the anatomic  location  of the disease.   For 
patients  who develop  contraindications  to contrast  after baseline  contrast  CT is done,  the decision  
as to whether  non-contrast  CT or MRI (enhanced  or non-enhanced)  will be performed  should  also  
be based  on the tumor  type and the anatomic  location  of the disease  and should  be optimized  to 
allow  for comparison  with the prior studies  if possible.   Each  case  should  be discussed  with the 
radiologist  to determine  if substitution  of these  other  approaches  is possible  and, if not, the patient  
should  be considered  not evaluable  from that point  forward.   Care  must  be taken  in measurement  of 
target  lesions  on a different  modality  and interpretation  of non-target  disease  or new lesions  since  
the same  lesion  may appear  to have  a different  size using  a new modality.  
 
Ultrasound.   Ultrasound  is not useful  in assessment  of lesion  size and should  not be used  as a 
method  of measurement.  
 
Endoscopy,  Laparoscopy,  Tumor  Markers,  Cytology,  Histology.   The utilization  of these  
techniques  for objective  tumor  evaluation  cannot  generally  be advised.

III. Tumor  Response  Evaluation  
 
A. Assessment  of Overall  Tumor  Burden  and Measurable  Disease  
To assess  objective  response  or future  progression,  it is necessary  to estimate  the overall  tumor  
burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequen t measurements. Measurable 
disease  is defined  by the presence  of at least one measurable  lesion,  as detailed  above.  
 
B. Baseline  Documentation  of Target  and Non-Target  Lesions  
When  more  than one measurable  lesion  is present  at baseline,  all lesions  up to a maximum  of five 
lesions  total (and a maximum  of two lesions  per organ)  representative  of all involved  organs  should  
be identified  as target  lesions  and will be recorded  and measured  at baseline.   This means  in 
instances  where  patients  have only one or two organ  sites involved,  a maximum  of two lesions  (one 
site) and four lesions  (two sites),  respectively,  will be recorded.   Other  lesions  (albeit  measurable)  in 
those  organs  will be recorded  as non-measurable  lesions  (even  if the size is  10 mm by CT scan).  
 
Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  with the longest  diameter)  and  
be representative  of all involved  organs,  but additionally,  should  lend themselves  to reproducible  
repeated  measurements.   It may be the case  that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion  does not lend itself 
to reproducible  measurement,  in which  circumstance  the next largest  lesion  that can be measured  
reproducibly  should  be selected.  
 
Lymph  nodes  merit  special  mention  since  they are normal  anatomical  structures  that may be visible  
by imaging  even  if not involved  by tumor.  As noted  above,  pathological  nodes  that are defined  as 
measurable  and may be identified  as target  lesions  must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of  15 
mm by CT scan.   Only the short  axis of these  nodes  will contribute  to the baseline  sum.   The short  
axis of the node  is the diameter  normally  used  by radiologists  to judge  if a node  is involved  by solid 
tumor.   Nodal  size is normally  reported  as two dimensions  in the plane  in which  the image  is 
obtained  (for CT scan,  this is almost  always  the axial plane;  for MRI the plane  of acquisition  may be 
axial,  sagittal,  or coronal).   The smaller  of these  measures  is the short  axis.  For example,  an 
abdominal  node  that is reported  as being  20 mm  30 mm has a short  axis of 20 mm and qualifies  as 
a malignant,  measurable  node.   In this example,  20 mm should  be recorded  as the node  
measurement.   All other  pathological  nodes  (those  with short  axis  10 mm but  15 mm) should  be 
considered  non-target  lesions.   Nodes  that have  a short  axis  10 mm are considered  
non-pathological  and should  not be recorded  or followed.  
 
A sum of the diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  axis for nodal  lesions)  for all target  
lesions  will be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum of diameters.   If lymph  nodes  are to be 
included  in the sum,  then,  as noted  above,  only the short  axis is added  into the sum.   The baseline

sum of diameters  will be used  as a reference  to further  characterize  any objective  tumor  regression  
in the measurable  dimension  of the disease.  
 
All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including  pathological  lymph  nodes,  should  be identified  as 
non-target  lesions  and should  also be recorded  at baseline.   Meas  urements  are not required  and 
 thes e les ions s hould  be follow  ed as “pres  ent,” “abs ent,” or in rare c as es “unequivoc  al progres  s ion.”  
 
In addition,  it is possible  to record  multiple  non-target  lesions  involving  the same  organ  as a single  
item on the Case  Repor t Form  (CRF)  (e.g.,  “multiple  enlarged  pelvic  lymph  nodes”  or “multiple  liver 
metastases”).  
 
IV. Response  Criteria  
 
A. Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
This section  provides  the definitions  of the criteria  used  to determine  objective  tumor  response  for 
target  lesions.  
o Complete  response  (CR):  disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  
nodes  (whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction  in short  axis to  10 mm. 
o Partial  response  (PR):   at least a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the baseline  sum of diameters  
o Progressive  disease  (PD):  at least a 20% increase  in the sum of diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the smallest  sum on study  (nadir),  including  baseline  
 
In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate  an absolute  
increase  of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance  of one or more  new lesions  is also considered  progression.  
Stable  disease  (SD):   neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  to 
qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum on study.  
 
 
B. Special  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target  Lesions  
 
Lymph  Nodes.   Lymph  nodes  identified  as target  lesions  should  always  have the actual  short  axis 
measurement  recorded  (measured  in the same  anatomical  plane  as the baseline  examination),  even  
if the nodes  regress  to  10 mm on study.   This means  that when  lymph  nodes  are included  as target  
lesions,  the sum of lesions  may not be zero even if CR criteria  are met since  a normal  lymph  node  is 
defined  as having  a short  axis  10 mm.

Target  Lesions  That  Become  Too Small  to Measure.   While  on study,  all lesions  (nodal  and non- 
nodal)  recorded  at baseline  should  have  their actual  measurements  recorded  at each  subsequent  
evaluation,  even  when  very small  (e.g.,  2 mm).   However,  sometimes  lesions  or lymph  nodes  that 
are recorded  as target  lesions  at baseline  become  so faint on CT scan  that the radiologist  may not 
feel comfortable  assigning  an exact  measure  and may report  them  as being  too small  to measure.  
When  this occurs,  it is important  that a value  be recorded  on the CRF as follows:  
 
• If it is the opinion  of the radiologist  that the lesion  has likely  disappeared,  the measurement  
should  be recorded  as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion  is believed  to be present  and is faintly  seen  but too small  to measure,  a default  
value  of 5 mm should  be assigned  and BML (below  measurable  limit) should  be ticked.  
(Note:   It is less likely that this rule will be used  for lymph  nodes  since they usually  have  a 
definable  size when  normal  and are frequently  surrounded  by fat such  as in the 
retroperitoneum;  however,  if a lymph  node  is believed  to be present  and is faintly  seen  but 
too small  to measure,  a default  value  of 5 mm should  be assigned  in this circumstance  as 
well and BML should  also be ticked.)  
 
To reiterate,  however,  if the radiologist  is able to pr ovide  an actual  measure,  that should  be recorded,  
even if it is below  5 mm, and, in that case,  BML should  not be ticked.  
 
Lesions  That  Split  or Coalesce  on Treatment.   When  non-nodal  lesions  fragment,  the longest  
diameters  of the fragmented  portions  should  be added  together  to calculate  the target  lesion  sum.  
Similarly,  as lesions  coalesce,  a plane  between  them  may be maintained  that would  aid in obtaining  
maximal  diameter  measurements  of each  individual  lesion.   If the lesions  have truly coalesced  such  
that they are no longer  separable,  the vector  of the longest  diameter  in this instance  should  be the 
maximal  longest  diameter  for the coalesced  lesion.  
 
C. Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
This section  provides  the definitions  of the criteria  used  to determine  the tumor  response  for the 
group  of non-target  lesions.   While  some  non-target  lesions  may actually  be measurable,  they need  
not be measured  and, instead,  should  be assessed  only qualitatively  at the timepoints  specified  in 
the protocol.  
o Complete  Response  (CR):   disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and (if applicable)  
normalization  of tumor  marker  level)  
 
All lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size ( 10 mm short  axis).  
o Non-CR/Non -PD:  persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  (if applicable)  
maintenance  of tumor  marker  level above  the normal  limits

o Progressive  Disease  (PD):   unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  The 
appearance  of one or more  new lesions  is also considered  progression.  
o 
 
D. Special  Notes  on Assessment  of Progression  of Non-Target  Disease  
 
When  the Patient  Also Has Measurable  Disease.   In this setting,  to achieve  unequivocal  
progression  on the basis  of the non-target  disease,  there  must  be an overall  level of substantial  
worsening  in non-target  disease  in a magnitude  that, even  in the presence  of SD or PR in target  
disease,  the overall  tumor  burden  has increased  sufficiently  to merit  discontinuation  of therapy.   A 
modest  increase  in the size of one or more  non-target  lesions  is usually  not sufficient  to qualify  for 
unequivocal  progression  status.   The designation  of overall  progression  solely  on the basis  of 
change  in non-target  disease  in the face of SD or PR of target  disease  will therefore  be extremely  
rare. 
 
When  the Patient  Has Only  Non-Measurable  Disease.   This circumstance  arises  in some  Phase  
III trials  when  it is not a criterion  of study  entry  to have  measurable  disease.   The same  general  
concepts  apply  here as noted  above;  however,  in this instance,  there  is no measurable  disease  
assessment  to factor  into the interpretation  of an increase  in non-measurable  disease  burden.  
Because  worsening  in non-target  disease  cannot  be easily  quantified  (by definition:   if all lesions  are 
truly non-measurable),  a useful  test that can be applied  when  assessing  patients  for unequivocal  
progression  is to consider  if the increase  in overall  disease  burden  based  on the change  in 
non-measurable  disease  is comparable  in magnitude  to the increase  that would  be required  to 
declare  PD for measurable  disease,  that is, an increase  in tumor  burden  representing  an additional  
73% increase  in volume  (which  is equivalent  to a 20% increase  in diameter  in a measurable  lesion).  
Examples  include  an increase  in a pleural  effusion  from “trace”  to “large”  or an increase  in 
lymphangitic  disease  from localized  to widespread  or may be described  in protocols  as “sufficient  to 
require  a change  in therapy.”   If unequivocal  progression  is seen,  the patient  should  be considered 
to have had overall  PD at that point.   While  it would  be ideal to have  objective  criteria  to apply to 
non-measurable  disease,  the very nature  of that disease  makes  it impossible  to do so; therefore,  
the increase  must  be substantial.  
E. New  Lesions  
The appearance  of new malignant  lesions  denotes  disease  progression;  therefore,  some  comments  
on detection  of new lesions  are important.   There  are no specific  criteria  for the identification  of new 
radiographic  lesions;  however,  the finding  of a new lesion  should  be unequivocal,  that is, not 
attributable  to differences  in scanning  technique,  change  in imaging  modality,  or findings  thought  to 
represent  something  other  than tumor  (for example,  some  “new”  bone  lesions  may be simply  healing  
or flare of pre-existing  lesions).   This is particularly  important  when  the patient ‟s baseline  lesions

show  partial  or complete  response.   For example,  necrosis  of a liver lesion  may be reported  on a CT 
scan report  as a “new”  cystic  lesion,  which  it is not. 
 
A lesion  identified  dur ing the study  in an anatomical  location  that was not scanned  at baseline  is 
considered  a new lesion  and will indicate  disease  progression.  
 
If a new lesion  is equivocal,  for example  because  of its small  size, continued  therapy  and follow -up 
evaluation  will clarify if it represents  truly new disease.   If repeat  scans  confirm  there  is definitely  a 
new lesion,  then progression  should  be declared  using  the date of the initial  scan.  
 
V. Evaluation  of Response  
 
A. Timepoint  Response  (Overall  Response)  
It is assumed  that at each  protocol -specified  timepoint,  a response  assessment  occurs.  Table  1 
provides  a summary  of the overall  response  status  calculation  at each  timepoint  for patients  who 
have measurable  disease  at baseline.  
 
When  patients  have non-measurable  (therefore  non-target)  disease  only, Table  2 is to be used.  
 
Table  1. 
Timepoint  Response  :  Patients  with Target  Lesions  (with  or without  Non-Target  Lesions)  
Target  Lesions  Non-Target  Lesions  New Lesions  Overall  Response

SD Non-PD or not

Not all evaluated  Non-PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or no PD 
Any PD Yes or no PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR =complete response;  NE = not evaluable;  PD =progressive disease;  PR = partial  response;  
SD =stable disease.

Table  2.  Timepoint  Response  :  Patients  with Non-Target  Lesions  Only

Not all evaluated  No NE 
Unequivocal  PD  Yes or no PD 
Any Yes PD 
CR = complete  response;  NE = not evaluable;  PD = progressive  disease. 
a    “Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred  over “stable  disease”  for non-target  disease  since  stable  
disease  is increasingly  used  as an endpoint  for assessment  of efficacy  in some  trials;  thus,  
assigning  “stable  disease”  when  no lesions  can be measured  is not advised. 
 
 
B. Missing  Assessments  and Not-Evaluable  Designation  
When  no imaging/measurement  is done  at all at a particular  timepoint,  the patient  is not evaluable  at 
that timepoint.   If only a subset  of lesion  measurements  are made  at an assessment,  usually  the 
case  is also considered  not evaluable  at that timepoint,  unless  a convincing  argument  can be made  
that the contribution  of the individual  missing  lesion(s)  would  not change  the assigned  timepoint  
response.   This would  be most  likely to happen  in the case of PD.  For example,  if a patient  had a 
baseline  sum of 50 mm with three  measured  lesions  and, during  the study,  only two lesions  were  
assessed,  but those  gave a sum of 80 mm; the patient  will have  achieved  PD status,  regardless  of 
the contribution  of the missing  lesion.  
 
If one or more  target  lesions  were  not assessed  either  because  the scan  was not done  or the scan  
could  not be assessed  because  of poor image  quality  or obstructed  view,  the response  for target  
lesions  should  be “unable  to assess”  since  the patient  is not evaluable.   Similarly,  if one or more  
non-target  lesions  are not assessed,  the response  for non-target  lesions  should  be “unable  to 
assess” except  where  there  is clear  progression.   Overall  response  would  be “unable  to assess”  if 
either  the target  response  or the non-target  response  is “unable  to assess,”  except  where  this is 
clear  evidence  of progression  as this equates  with the case  being  not evaluable  at that timepoint.

a    If a CR is truly met at the first timepoint,  any disease  seen  at a subsequent  timepoint,  
even  disease  meeting  PR criteria  relati  ve to baseline,  qualifies  as PD at that point  
(since  disease  must  have  reappeared  after CR).  Best response  would  depend  on whether  
the minimum  duration  for SD was met.  However, sometimes  CR may be claimed  when  
subsequent  scans  suggest  small  lesions  were  likely  still present  and in fact the patient  had 
PR, not CR, at the first timepoint.  Under  these  circumstances,  the original  CR should  be 
changed  to PR and the best response  is PR. 
 
C. Special  Notes  on Response  Assessment  
When  nodal  disease  is included  in the sum of target  lesions  and the nodes  decrease  to “normal”  size 
( 10 mm),  they may still have a measurement  reported  on scans.  This measurement  should  be 
recorded  even though  the nodes  are normal  in order  not to overstate  progression  should  it be based  
on increase  in size of the nodes.   As noted  earlier,  this means  that patients  with CR may not have a 
total sum of “zero”  on the CRF.  
 
Patients  with a global  deterioration  of health  status  requiring  discontinuation  of treatment  without  
objective  evidence  of disease  progression  at that time should  be reported  as “symptomatic  
deterioration.”   Every  effort  should  be made  to document  objective  progression  even after

discontinuation  of treatment.   Symptomatic  deterioration  is not a descriptor  of an objective  response;  
it is a reason  for stopping  study  therapy.   The objective  response  status  of such  patients  is to be 
determined  by evaluation  of target  and non-target  disease  as shown  in Tables  1 − 3. 
 
For equivocal  findings  of progression  (e.g.,  very small  and uncertain  new lesions;  cystic  changes  or 
necrosis  in existing  lesions),  treatment  may continue  until the next scheduled  assessment.   If at the 
next scheduled  assessment  progression  is confirmed,  the date of progression  should  be the earlier  
date when  progression  was suspected.  
 
In studies  for which  patients  with advanced  disease  are eligible  (i.e., primary  disease  still or partially  
present),  the primary  tumor  should  also be captured  as a target  or non-target  lesion,  as appropriate.  
This is to avoid  an incorrect  assessment  of complete  response  if the primary  tumor  is still present  
but not evaluated  as a target  or non-target  lesion.

Appendix  5 Immune -Related  RECIST  Criteria  
 
Immune -related  RECIST  (irRECIST)  is derived  from RECIST  1.1 conventions  (Eisenhauer  et al, 
2009).  The implementation  of irRECIST  (Perrone,  2016)  is identical  to RECIST  1.1 until progressive  
disease  (PD) is identified.  Upon  demonstration  of PD per RECIST  1.1, patients  may remain  on study  
per Investigator  discretion,  assuming  the patient  remains  clinically  stable,  as defined  in the protocol.  
Patients  that remain  on study  will have an imaging  disease  assessment  performed  at least 4 weeks  
after the initial  PD is demonstrated  in order  to confirm  PD. 
 
EVALUATION OF LESIONS 
 
1.1 Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
• Immune -related  Complete  Response  (irCR):  Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any 
pathological  lymph  nodes  (whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction  in short  axis to 
<10 mm. 
 
• Immune -related  Partial  Response  (irPR):  At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  
of target  lesions  (i.e., Percentage  Change  in Tumor  Burden),  taking  as reference  the 
baseline  sum diameters.  
 
• Immune -related  Progressive  Disease  (irPD):  Same  requirements  for PD as standard  RECIST  
1.1, with exception  that progressive  disease  must  be confirmed.  After demonstration  of PD  
by standard  RECIST  1.1 criteria,  patients  remain  on study  and are re-imaged  after >4 weeks.  
Confirmation  of target  lesion  PD is constituted  by the following:  
 
o Sum of linear  diameters  (SLD)  reaches  PD threshold  of ≥ 20% increase  from nadir  
OR 
o SLD remains  ≥ 20% increased  above  baseline  (if already  ≥ 20% increased  at initial  
PD) 
 
• Immune -related  Stable  Disease  (irSD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for irPR nor 
sufficient  increase  to qualify  for irPD,  taking  as reference  the smallest  sum diameters  while  
on study.  
1.2 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions 
 
Lymph  Nodes  
 
Lymph  nodes  merit  special  mention  since  they are normal  anatomical  structures  which  may be 
visible  by imaging  even  if not involved  by tumor.  Pathological  nodes  which  are defined  as 
measurable  and may be identified  as target  lesions  must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of ≥ 15 
mm by CT scan.  Only the short  axis of these  nodes  will contribute  to the baseline  sum.  Nodes  that 
have a short  axis < 10 mm are considered  non-pathological  and should  not be recorded  or followed.

Target  Lesions  that Become  “Too  Small  to Measure”  
 
All lesions  (nodal  and non-nodal)  recorded  at baseline  should  have  their actual  measurements  
recorded  at each  subsequent  evaluation,  even  when  very small  (e.g.,  2 mm).  If the radiologist  is able 
to provide  an actual  measurement,  that should  be recorded,  even if it is below  5 mm. However,   
when  such  a lesion  becomes  difficult  to assign  an exact  measure  to then:  
 
• If it is the opinion  of the radiologist  that the lesion  has likely  disappeared,  the measurement  
should  be recorded  as 0 mm. 
 
• If the lesion  is believed  to be present  and is faintly  seen  but too small  to measure,  a default  
value  of 5 mm should  be assigned  (note:  in case  of a lymph  node  believed  to be present  and 
faintly  seen  but too small  to measure,  a default  value  of 5 mm should  be assigned  in this 
circumstance  as well).  This default  value  is derived  from the 5 mm CT slice thickness  (but 
should  not be changed  with varying  CT slice  thickness).  
 
Target  Lesions  that Split  or Coalesce  on Treatment  
 
When  non-nodal  lesions  „fragment, ‟ the longest  diameters  of the fragmented  portions  should  be 
added  together  to calculate  the target  lesion  sum.  As lesions  coalesce,  a plane  between  them  may 
be maintained  that would  aid in obtaining  maximal  diameter  measurements  of each  individual  lesion.  
If the lesions  have truly coalesced  such  that they are no longer  separable,  the vector  of the longest  
diameter  in this instance  should  be the maximal  longest  diameter  for the “coalesced  lesion.”  
1.3 Evaluation  of Non-target  Lesions  
 
While  some  non-target  lesions  may actually  be measurable,  they need  not be measured  and instead  
should  be assessed  only qualitatively  at the time points  specified  in the protocol.  
 
• Immune -related  Complete  Response  (irCR):  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions.  All 
lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size (< 10 mm short  axis).  
• Immune -related  Non-CR/Non -PD (ir-Non-CR/Non -PD): Persistence  of one or more  non- 
target  lesion(s).  This also includes  non-target  lesions  that demonstrated  unequivocal  
progression  at the initial  demonstration  of PD but then stabilized  or regressed  on subsequent  
scans. 
 
• Immune -related  Progressive  Disease  (irPD):  Unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  
lesions  on a disease  assessment  subsequent  to initial  demonstration  of PD. Therefore,  irPD 
by non-target  lesions  requires  one of the following  on a disease  assessment  >4 weeks  after 
the initial  demonstration  of PD: 
 
o New unequivocal  progression

Version:  2/26/16   
  
 
o Further  unequivocal  progression  (if unequivocal  progression  present  at initial  PD) 
1.4 New Lesions  
 
Recording  of New Target  Lesions  
 
The longest  diameters  of new non-nodal  measurable  lesions  and short  axes of new nodal  
measurable  lesions  will be recorded.  They  will be added  into the sum of diameters  of target  lesions  
(i.e. incorporated  into the total Tumor  Burden)  for this and all subsequent  follow -up assessments.  
 
In order  to be selected  as new measurable  lesions  (≤ 2 lesions  per organ,  ≤ 5 lesions  total, per time 
point),  new lesions  must  meet  criteria  as defined  for baseline  target  lesion  selection  and meet  the 
same  minimum  size requirements  of 10 mm in long diameter  and minimum  15 mm in short  axis for 
new measurable  lymph  nodes.  New measurable  lesions  shall be prioritized  according  to size, and 
the largest  lesions  shall be selected  as new measured  lesions.  
 
Recording  of New Non-Target  Lesions  
 
All new lesions  not selected  as new measurable  lesions  are considered  new non-target  lesions  and 
are followed  qualitatively.  Only a massive  and unequivocal  progression  of new non-measurable  
lesions  leads  to an overall  assessment  of irPD for the time point.  Persisting  new nonmeasurable  
lesions  prevent  irCR.  
 
Progression  by New Lesions  
 
irPD by new lesions  requires  one of the following  on a disease  assessment  >4 weeks  after the initial  
demonstration  of PD: 
 
• New lesions  appear  
 
OR 
 
• Additional  new lesions  appear  
OR 
• Prior new lesions  grow  (if new lesions  were  present  at initial  PD) 
 
1.5 Confirmation  of Progressive  Disease  
 
As described  above,  irPD requires  that an initial  demonstration  of PD is confirmed  in a subsequent  
disease  assessment  performed  >4 weeks  after the initial  demonstration  of PD. The above  section  
describes  what constitutes  irPD with respect  to Target  Lesions,  Non-target  Lesions  and New 
Lesions.  For the sake of clarity,  the presence  of ALL of the following  >4 weeks  after initial  PD means  
that PD IS NOT confirmed:  
• Target  lesions

o SLD is <20%  increased  from nadir  
 
• Non-target  lesions  
 
o No additional  unequivocal  progression  from prior scan 
• New lesions  
 
o No additional  new lesions  
 
o Any prior new lesions  are stable  or shrinking  (qualitatively)  
 
• Clinical  status  
 
o Patient  remains  clinically  stable  
RESPONSE  CRITERIA  
 
2.1 Time  Point  Response  
 
A response  assessment  should  occur  at each  time point specified  in the protocol.  
 
• Immune -related  Complete  Response  (irCR):  Complete  disappearance  of all tumor  lesions  
(target  and non-target),  together  with no new measurable  or unmeasurable  lesions,  for at 
least 4 weeks  from the date of documentation  of irCR.  All lymph  nodes  short  axes must  be < 
10 mm. 
• Immune -related  Partial  Response  (irPR):  The sum of the linear  diameters  (SLD)  of all 
target  lesions  is measured  and captured  as the sum of diameters  at baseline.  At each  
subsequent  tumor  assessment,  the SLD of all target  lesions  is calculated.  A decrease  in 
SLD,  relative  to baseline  SLD,  of 30% or greater  is considered  an irPR,  in the absence  of 
irCR or irPD.  
• Immune -related  Stable  Disease  (irSD):  irSD is defined  as the failure  to meet  criteria  for 
irCR,  irPR or irPD.  
• Immune -related  Progressive  Disease  (irPD):  It is recommended  for patients  that are 
clinically  stable  to confirm  PD at the following  tumor  assessment.  Any of the following  will 
constitute  progressive  disease:  
 
o Overall  ir-response  of irPD (per Table  1) after confirmation  of PD with disease  
assessment  >4 weeks  after initial  demonstration  of PD 
 
o PD per RECIST  1.1 in a patient  that is not clinically  stable  enough  to remain  on study  
for confirmation

2.2 Best  Overall  Response:  All Time  Points  
 
Best Overall  Response  and Date of Progression  Using  irRECIST  1.1 (irBOR):  The investigator  will 
be asked  to provide  all responses  on study  and date(s)  of progression,  if applicable,  and the best 
overall  response  will be calculated  based  on the time point responses  and tumor  measurements  
provided  by the investigator.

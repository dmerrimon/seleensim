Name of Test Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP):  Albuterol sulfate (ABS) multidose 
dry powder inhaler with an eModule (eMDPI) 
EudraVigilance (EV) code for the IMP, if applicable: Not applicable  
Type of the Study:  Phase 3B 
Indication:  Exacerbation -prone chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Is This Study Conducted to Investigate the New Use of an Approved, Marketed Product? 
No 
Number of Investigational Centers Planned: Approximately 40  
Countries Planned: United States  
Planned Study Period: Approximately 9 months  
Number of Patients Planned (Total):  Approximately 500 patients will be screened to achieve 
400 enrolled patients. A subset of patients (n=100) who agree to participate at specific investigational centers will wear an accelerometer on the wrist to measure sleep disruption index 
(SDI) . A second subset of patients (n=100) who agree to participate at specific investigational 
centers  will wear an accelerometer on the ankle to measu re total daily steps (TDS) .  
Study Population: The cohort will consist of patients 40 years of age or older with moderate or 
severe clinical exacerbation of COPD ( CE-COPD; defined in Section  6.1.1 of the protocol) in the 
past 12 months.  
Objectives and Endpoints  
The objectives  of this study are  to explore the pattern and amount of albuterol use (as captured in 
the ABS eMDPI) , alone or in combination with other study data, preceding a moderate or severe 
CE-COPD (as diagnosed by the investigators per the protocol). The hypothesis is that albuterol 
use will increase several days prior to a moderate or severe CE -COPD and can serve as a mark er 
of COPD deterioration. 
The endpoints of the trial are the primary outcome measure ( ie, CE -COPD) and the primary  
outcome predictor (ie, albuterol use) alone or in combination with secondary predictors (ie, other 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
6 study data). These predictors  of CE -COPD will be modeled to determine which patterns best 
predict the subsequent development of CE -COPD. 
For albuterol use, parameters of interest will include (1) the total number of inhalations in the 
days preceding the peak of a CE-COPD, (2) the number of days prior to the peak of a CE -COPD 
when albuterol use increased, and (3) the number of albuterol uses in the 24 hours preceding a CE-COPD. Therefore, endpoints are not designated as either primary or secondary.  
In addition to albuterol use, inspiratory flow values (maximal inhalational flow [MIF], 
inhalational volume, inhalation duration, and time to MIF), SDI, TDS, and baseline information 
regarding disease state and demographics will be studied. These data will be analyzed using both a univariate and multivariate approach, to determine which patterns best predict the subsequent 
development of a CE-COPD. Inspiratory flow values are obtained from the eMDPI, SDI is 
obtained for a subset of patients who agree to participate at specific investigational centers (n=100) from an accelerometer worn on the wrist, and TDS is obtained for a subset of patients 
who agree to participate at specific investigational centers (n=100) from an accelerometer worn on the ankle. Baseline disease state and demographic information will  be obtained at screening.  
An additional objective for this study is to evaluate the safety of ABS eMDPI use in patients with exacerbation -prone COPD. 
The safety endpoints  for this study include the following: 
• adverse event  data  
• physical examinations  
General Design:  This is a 12-week, multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the relationship 
between as -needed usage of ABS eMDPI and CE-COPD in adult patients at least 40 years of age 
with exacerbation -prone COPD. A BS eMDPI is a rescue/reliever agent that includes an eModule 
on top of the approved PROAIR® RESPICLICK  inhaler. The on-board electronics and power 
source are fully integrated into the inhaler and are designed to operate for the life of the inhaler 
without intervention. The electronic module records timestamped, pre-defined events such as cap 
open and inhalation parameters. The inclusion of the eModule has been shown to have no impact on the dose delivery compared with the approved product without the eModule. 
The study will consist of a screening period  of up to 2 weeks and a 12-week intervention period. 
After providing written informed consent, patients will complete a screening visit ( visit 1) to 
determine eligibility for the study . Patients will provide medical history (including prior 
medication s), complete  a physical exam ination , pregnancy test , if applicable, and review COPD 
exacerbation history.  Eligible  patients will return to the investigational center  within 2  weeks for 
the baseline visit (visit 2). Those meeting entry criteria will be trained on the use of the eMDPI 
device and , upon demonstrated competency , will receive ABS  eMDPI devices for use as rescue 
bronchodilators during the study. The screening visit and baseline visit may be combined. 
Patients  must use ABS eMDPI as their only rescue agent for the duration of their participation in 
this study and will be advised to place any current rescue pills, inhalers, or nebulizers, including 
short- acting beta
2 agonists ( SABA ), short- acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs ), or 
SABA/SAMA combination , into storage. Patients may  continue the use of other COPD and 
non-COPD medications as advised by their physician without changes unless a change is deemed 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
7 necessary by their physician . Patients will be managed  according to routine clinical practice by 
their treating physician with no specific study -related instructions provided other than those on 
the proper use of ABS eMDPI . 
Patients will be contacted by phone on a monthly basis for the collection of information about 
COPD exacerbations and treatments, concomitant medications, and adverse events. A review of 
the instructions for the use of ABS eMDPI and the procedure for replacement and return of ABS  eMDPI will also occur during the monthly call. 
Patients will receive initial eMDPI devices at visit 2 based on anticipated usage pattern. In the event that additional eMDPI devices are needed, patients will be required to visit the investigational center to receive them. Patients will be instructed to retur n all inhalers to the 
investigational center  at the last study visit or earlier,  including at the early termination  visit, as 
well as at any other point if there is a problem with the inhaler . At the last study visit or early 
termination, patients will be queried for adverse events, concomitant medications, and COPD 
exacerbations ; a physical examination  will be completed ; and the patient will subsequently be 
discharged from the trial.  
Two s ubsets of patients who agree to participate at specific investigational centers  and to wear an 
accelerometer either on the ankle to measure TDS  (n=100) or on the wrist to measure  SDI 
(n=100) will be instructed on the proper use of these devices at the baseline visit ( visit 2).  The 
devices will be worn throughout the 12-week intervention period and will be returned to the 
investigational center  at the final visit or upon early termination . 
Brief Summary of Study Design for the Trial Registry:

8 Inclusion Criteria: Patients may be enrolled in the study only if they meet all of the following 
criteria:  
a. The patient is male or female, 40 years of age or older, with a physician diagnosis of 
COPD. The diagnosis should include a history of forced expiratory volume in 
1 second ( FEV 1)/forced vital capacity <70% predicted and FEV 1 <80% predicted  
documented in the patient’s chart . 
b. The patient is currently using a SABA reliever plus at least one of the following: long- acting beta agonist ( LABA ), an inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS)/LABA, a 
long- acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ), or a LABA/LAMA.  
c. The patient has had at least 1 episode of moderate or severe CE -COPD ( as described 
in Section  6.1.1 of the protocol) over the past 12 months before screening . 
d. The patient must be able to demonstrate appropriate use of albuterol from the 
ABS  eMDPI.  
e. The patient is able to provide written informed consent. 
f. The patient must be willing and able to comply with study requirements as specified in the protocol, including the use of a wearable accelerometer for the subset of patients who consent to use of the device. 
g. The patient is willing to discontinue all other rescue or maintenance SABA or short- acting anti -muscarinic agents and replace them with the study-provided ABS 
eMDPI for the duration of the trial.  
h. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or ≥2 years postmenopausal) must have exclusively same- sex partners or use a highly effective or acceptable 
method of birth control and must agree to continue the use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of the IMP. Highly 
effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that 
result in a low failure rate (ie, < 1% per year) wh en used consistently and correctly. 
Highly effective methods of birth control in this study include combined (estrogen- 
and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone- releasing 
system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, and sexual abstinence. Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year 
include: progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, for which the inhibition of 
ovulation is not the primary mode of action; male or female condom with or without spermicide; and cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide. The combination of male 
condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (doubl e barrier 
methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, methods of birth 
control. 
Exclusion Criteria: Patients will not be enrolled in this study if they meet any of the following criteria:  
a. The patient has any clinically significant medical condition (treated or untreated) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with participation in the study.  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065

the study. 
e. The patient is either an employee or an immediate relative of an employee of the investigational center.  
f. The patient is known to be allergic to albuterol or any of the excipients in the IMP or rescue medication formulation (ie, lactose [milk protein]). Dietary lactose intolerance 
does not exclude the patient from inclusion in the study or as per the investigator’s 
medical discretion.   
g. The patient has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 2 y ears prior to the screening 
visit.  
h. The patient has a history of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus 
types  1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. Note: A history of a positive 
tuberculosis skin test without active tuberculosis ma y be acceptable only if the patient 
has received an accepted prophylactic treatment regimen and has no clinical evidence of active disease. Patients with a history of hepatitis C who have undergone treatment 
and achieved a sustained virologic response may be eligible if they meet all other 
selection criteria and receive medical monitor approval.  
i. The patient has symptomatic congestive heart failure.  
j. A member of the patient’s household is participating in the study at the same time.  
Statistical Considerations:   
Sample Size Rationale:  Assuming an expected dropout rate of 10%, it is recommended that 
400 patients be enrolled, so that 360 evaluable patients complete the study. This rationale is based on a review of relevant literature, as follows. 
Based on previous studies of an exacerbation-prone COPD cohort ( Dransfield et al 2013, 
Vogelmeier et al 2011 , Wedzicha et al 2013 , Wedzicha et al  2016), it is expected that 91 (range, 
73 to 110) CE -COPD events will occur over the 12 -week evaluation period in this study based 
on reported CE-COPD exacerbation rates of 1.05 and 1.14 events per year. Furthermore, it is 
expected that 14% (14) of total e xacerbations will be severe.  
This sample size (ie, n=400 patients, 73 to 110 CE -COPD events) is considered adequate for the 
fulfillment of the study objectives to evaluate the relationship of albuterol use, inspiratory flow, 
SDI, and TDS data associated with a subsequent CE -COPD event. Per a previous study (Jenkins 
et al 2013), a statistically significant relationship was established between daily SABA usage and 
subsequent CE- COPD.  
In the present study, approximately 73 to 110 CE -COPD events are desired because the model’s 
fitting of the current study involves the analysis of multiple predictors as described in more detail 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
10 below. Because the largest model considered has 7 covariates, it is desirable to have at least 
70 events. The probability to observe at least 70 CE-COPD events is higher than 0.99. 
Risk models published in the literature have typically included between 4 and 6 covariates/risk 
factors ( Bateman et al 2015 , Greenberg et al 2012 , Quezada et al 2016 ) to examine the 
relationship between possible risk factors and a disease. When there is more than 1 covariate (risk factor) in the model, multiple logistic regression may be used to estimate the relationship of a specific covariate of interest (ie, albute rol use) to a primary outcome (ie, CE-COPD), adjusting 
for the other/remaining covariates (risk factors). In this case, the required sample size to estimate such a relationship is greater than that for univariate logistic regression.  
The number of events per variable has been suggested as a criterion for the size of a data set 
(Harrell et al 1984 , Laupacis et al 1997 , Peduzzi et al 1996). The rule of thumb when buildi ng 
logistic regression models is 1 predictor variable for every 10 events ( Peduzzi et al 1996, 
Vittinghoff and McCulloch 2007). Therefore, this sample size would be adequate for predicting the pri mary outcome (CE -COPD) using multiple logistic regression, including the covariate of 
primary interest (ie,  albuterol use) and the remaining multiple predictors (inspiratory flow values, 
SDI, and TDS) as potential risk factors for CE-COPD in the model for this patient population. 
Analysis of Endpoints:  The relationship between albuterol us age and CE -COPD will be 
analyzed  as follows, without controlling for multiplicity.  
The multiple device -use- measures will be used as predictors of CE -COPD in the following 
stepwise selection logistic regression models to select significant predictors in a forward manner: 
1. albuterol usage 
2. albuterol usage + inspiratory flow values 
3. albuterol usage + SDI  
4. albuterol usage + TDS  
5. albuterol usage + inspiratory flow values + SDI  
6. albute rol usage + inspiratory flow values + TDS  
The sele ction of covariates will be performed at the 0.2 level. 
Baseline disease state and demographic variables collected at study enrollment will also be 
considered as predictors . Because the device -use- measures will be collected continuously over 
time, these measures could be used to derive many potential predictors of risk. For example, with 
respect to albuterol use, a patient using the inhaler 3 times in the span of a 2-day or 3-day period 
could be a strong predictor of a CE-COPD, but a better marker for risk might be 10 times in the 
span of a week. There are no prior robust data to inform these decisions; 1 possible benefit of this work will be to examine the relationship between multiple functional forms for the device-use- measures to determine which forms have predictive power.  
Furthermore, the effect of including interaction terms in the model (ie, testing the assumption of additivity of predictors on the log odds scale) will also be studied. Pair- wise interactions will be 
assessed at the 0.01 significance level to avoid weak interaction signals that would potentially not translate when applying the risk score to new cohorts. Goodness-of- fit tests may be applied 
to make sure that the finally selected model fits the data closely. The C -statistic, as described by 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
11 Hosmer et al will be used to compare the goodness of fit of various logistic regression models in 
terms of how well the predictor(s) discriminate between patients with and without CE -COPD.

19 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1. Introduction  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a disease composed of the respiratory 
illnesses chronic bronchitis and emphysema and is the third leading cause of death in the United 
States ( American Lung Association 2011, Miniño et al 2010). Unfortunately, COPD is often 
underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading to a large population of untreated patients. At present, 
more than 12 million Americans are diagnosed with COPD; it is estimated that another 
12 million Americans have undiagnosed COPD ( US Dept of HHS 2009). According to a 2012 
survey, physicians reported that 28% of their COPD patients had mild COPD, 35% had moderate 
COPD, and 38% had severe COPD. This equates to just over 3.3 to 4.5 million Americans in 
each category ( American Lung Association 2011, Forest Laboratories 2012 , Forest Laboratories 
2009).  
The association among symptoms, spirometric classification, and future risk of exacerbation is 
routinely evaluated and risk assigned according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease categories ( GOLD 2011). G OLD patient groups are as follows: A –low risk , less 
symptoms; B –low risk , more s ymptoms; C–high risk, less symptoms; D –high risk, m ore 
symptoms.  
Patients with COPD may experience periodic increases in their symptoms. An exacerbation is an episode character ized by worsening of symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, and the volume and 
purulence of sputum associated with bronchospasm and frequently bronchospasm-promoting events such as infection and heart failure. Exacerbations may also be associated with physiologic deterioration (eg, a decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [ FEV
1]) and increases in 
airway and systemic inflammation, as evidenced by an increase in inflammatory markers in the airways ( Wedzicha and Wilkinson 2006). Patients may have other symptoms such as fever or 
sore throat, indicating an infectious process ( Reilly et al 2011 ). 
As the recommended drug for relief of acute bronchospasm, short- acting beta
2 agonists (SABA), 
such as albuterol, are a mainstay of asthma management. The use of inhaled aerosol medications for COPD is ideal because inhalation delivers relatively low doses of the drug rapidly to the site 
of action. This preferred administration mode achieves high drug concentrations in the airways 
while minimizing systemic side effects ( Dolovich et al 2005). Inhaled albuterol aerosols are the 
most commonly prescribed treatments for  the relief of bronchoconstriction. PRO AIR
® (albuterol 
sulfate  [ABS] ) RESPICLICK Inhalational  Powder is approved for the treatment or prevention of 
bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease and delivers the equivalent of 90 mcg of albuterol base ex -mouthpiece per actuation. More detailed prescribing information 
for this product may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
Although albuterol has traditionally been administered via conventional “press- and-breath e” 
metered  dose inhalers (MDIs), inefficient inhaler technique (ie, inability to properly coordinate 
actuation with inspiration) is a common problem with these devices; as a consequence, delivery 
of the active drug to the airways can be compromised , potentially resulting in suboptimal clinical 
benefits ( Allen et al 2003, Kamps et al 2000, Larsen et al 1994 , Molimard et al 2003). To 
eliminate the necessity for coordinating actuation with in spiration, Teva has developed the 
breath -actuated  inhaler PROAIR
® RESPICLICK, which utilizes a formulation blend of ABS 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
20 with lactose as an excipient . Breath actuation has been found to reduce administration errors in 
comparison with conventional MDIs ( Lenney et al 2000, Price et al 1999 ). ABS is a 
beta 2-adrenergic agonist with the chemical name α1 [(tert butylamino) methyl] -4-hydroxy-m-
xylene -α,αʹ-diol sulfate (2:1) [salt]. PROAIR® RESPICLICK deliv ers the equivalent of 90 mcg 
of albuterol base ex -mouthpiece per actuation  and has been approved in the United States since 
March of 2015.  
In this study, 90 mcg of ABS is delivered via a multidose dry powder inhaler ( MDPI ) with an 
eModule (eMDPI) sitting on the upper part of the device for the purposes of detecting and 
storing usage information. A more detailed description of the product is given in Section  5.1.1. 
The eMDPI stores information on the date, time, and inspiratory flow values each time a patient 
takes a dose. In addition, a subset of patients who agree to participate at specific investigational 
centers  will wear an accelerometer on the wrist as a marker o f sleep disruption, and a second 
subset of patients who agree to participate at specific investigational centers  will wear an 
accelerometer on the ankle to quantify daily physical activity.  Information from eMDPI and 
wearable devices will be used to determine if they can help predict the subsequent development of a clinical exacerbation of COPD ( CE-COPD).  
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
In the clinical development program for PROAIR® RESPICLICK, the investigational medicinal 
product ( IMP) was reported using nomenclature other than that of the then-unbranded product. 
Within this document, we update the name of the IMP to the marketed product, PROAIR® 
RESPICLICK, to promote alig nment with current medical practice.  
Brief summaries of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and clinical studies are provided in the following sections. More detailed information is provided in the IB and the package insert for PROAIR
® RESPICLICK.  
1.2.1. Nonclinical Studies  
In a 2 -year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, ABS caused a dose- related increase in the incidence of 
benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at and above dietary doses of 2 mg/kg (approximately 
15 times the maximum recommended daily  inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2 basis). In 
another study, this effect was blocked by the co-administration of propranolol, a nonselective 
beta-adrenergic antagonist. In an 18-month study in CD-1 mice, ABS showed no evidence of 
tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 210 times the maximum 
recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2 basis). ABS was not mutagenic in the 
Ames test or a mutation test in yeast. ABS was not clastogenic in a human peripheral 
lymphocyte as say or in an AH1 strain mouse micronucleus assay. Reproduction studies in rats 
demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 
310 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2 basis).  
Pre-clinical intravenous studies in rats with ABS have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the 
blood-brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5% of the plasma concentrations. In structures outside the blood- brain barrier ( pineal and pituitary glands), 
albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those in the whole brain. Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (with histologi c evidence of myocardial necrosis) when 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
21 beta- agonists and methylxanthines were administered concurrently. The clinical significance of 
these findings is unknown.  
1.2.2. Clinical Studies  
Summary of SABA Studies from the Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD) : Per the GOLD 
guidelines, bronchodilator medications such as albuterol are central to symptom management in 
COPD ( Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [ GOLD ] GOLD 2016).  Regular 
and as -needed use of SABA, including albuterol, improve FEV 1 and symptoms in COPD 
(GOLD 2016). Generally, the inhalational route is preferred for the delivery of bronchodilators 
in COPD ( GOLD 2016).   
A Prospective, Open -label Assessmen t of the ABS MDPI with Integrated Dose Counter in 
Asthma and COPD: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the ABS MDPI with dose counter; the secondary objective was to evaluate the handling 
characteristics (eg, ruggedness) of the device. ASB MDPI (90 mcg/inhalation) was administered to patients ag es 4 years and older with asthma or COPD as 2 inhalations/dose cycles twice daily 
for up to 50 days in an open-label study design. 
Approximately 15% of patients would complete the study in 5 weeks. The per- protocol (PP) 
population was considered primary for analysis purposes. Data identified as likely errors were 
excluded from the PP analysis. The intent- to-treat (ITT) population included all enrolled patients, 
and analyses also incl uded data likely to involve patient- recording errors.  
A total of 345 patients with asthma or COPD with symptoms of bronchoconstriction requiring the use of SABA were screened for enrollment into this study; 317 patients were enrolled at 
30 centers in the United States. The safety population consisted of 316 patients due to 1 patient being lost to follow-up. The PP population, all of whom completed the study, consisted of 
253 patients. A total of 16 patients withdrew from the study. All enrolled patients had a diagnosis 
of asthma or COPD as required by the protocol. The mean age of the 317 patients  in the ITT 
population was 51.3 years, and the age range was from 5 years to 88 years, with patients enrolled 
in 3 age groupings. The majority of patients were female (n=178, 56%), and the vast majority 
were white (n=268, 85%). Approximately half of the patients had a diagnosis of asthma (53%) 
and half had a diagnosis of COPD (47%). 
The total number of patient-reported dose cycles for the PP population (n=253) in the study was 
49454. For the ITT population (n=317), the number of dose cycles was 57471. The overall rate of discrepancies for the primary endpoint, dose cycle not counted, was 2.05 per 200 dose cycles 
for the PP population. This was slightly lower than the rate of 2.34 per 200 dose cycles for the 
ITT population. These accounted for less than half of all dosing discrepancies. The mean ±standard deviation number of dose cycles not counted in the PP population was 1.1±0.37, 
with a range from 1 to  4. This was smaller than for the ITT population in which a large range 
was present, indicative of higher variation among patients included in the ITT population. 
The model- estimated mean of the absolute value of the total discrepancy size after 200 doses was 
low (2.07 for the PP and 2.31 for the ITT populations). The estimated probability of exceeding a 
total discrepancy  size of 10 dose cycles per 200 dose cycles, the projected life of the inhaler, is 
very low (0.0009 and 0.003 for the PP and ITT populations, respectively).  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
22 In general, the patients with a diagnosis of COPD has a lower discrepancy rate for “dose cycle 
not count” than did the patients with asthma, but this may be related to patient characteristics 
rather than inhaler characteristics. The dis crepancy  rates per 200 dose cycles in the PP 
population were 1.81 and 2 .30 and in the ITT population were 1.93 and 2.73 for COPD and 
asthma patients, respectively. As with the primary endpoint, the patients with a diagnosis of COPD had a lower discrepancy rate for dose cycle overcount (2.18 in the PP population and 2.11 in the ITT population) than did the patients with a diagnosis of asthma (2.78 in the PP population 
and 3.10 in the ITT population). The rates for count unknown cycle and count up unknown cyc le 
were much lower for patients with a diagnosis of COPD.  
Overall, of the 253 patients in the PP population, 86 (34%) preferred the trial device, 65 (26%) 
their prescribed device, and 102 (40%) had no preference. Some 70% of patients were 
(somewhat to very) likely to use the new inhaler, while 20% were unlikely to use the new inhaler, compared with 78% of patients who were (somewhat to very) likely to use their 
prescribed inhaler and only 13% unlikely to use their prescribed inhaler among the PP 
population. 
Each use of the inhaler was generally high, as 209 patients (83%) in the PP population were 
somewhat to very satisfied  with the study inhaler, with another 21 (8%) patients expressing 
neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction. Other measures, such as ease of use and ease of dosing, 
generally showed satisfaction in about 90% of patients. The device was considered quite rugged 
as only 3 patients reported non- counter device issues , of which 2 were confirmed independently 
by the study site.  
A total of 29 patients (8%) out of the 345 screened patients had 1 or more adverse events during the screening/run-in period and 85 patients (27%) out of the 316 included in the safety analysis 
set following enrollment into the study reported adverse events. There were no deaths reported in the study. Two patients had serious adverse events (atrial fibrillation and supraventricular 
tachycardia judged related to study drug in 1 patient, and skin eruption due to metformin in the 
second patient) while on study, and 1 patient was withdrawn due to an unrelated adverse event of sinusitis.  
The most frequently occurring adverse event in the enrolled patients was headache in 4 patients  
during the run-in and 8 patients on study, followed by respiratory infections and disorders. These consisted of sinusitis in 7 patients, cough in 6 patients, upper respiratory infection in 6 patients, 
and nasopharyngitis in 4 patients while on study. The adverse events judged related to study drug 
were those commonly associated with albuterol products in the treatment of asthma, including abdominal pain, feeling jittery, irritability, weight increase, tremor, nervousness, coughing, and sneezing.  
In conclus ion, ABS MDPI with integrated dose counter is robust, and the counter functioned 
reliably and accurately in the clinical setting of twice daily dosing for up to 50 days (projected 
inhaler actuation life of 200 doses). Importantly, the discrepancy rate for “dose cycle not count” 
(undercount) for the PP population was low (2.05 per 200 dose cycles), as were the overall rate of discrepancies (5.11 per 200 dose cycles) and other discrepancies. The most common 
discrepancy was dose cycle overcount (2.46 per 200 dose cycles). The model -estimated mean of 
the absolute value of the total discrepancy size after 200 doses was low (2.07 for the PP 
population), and the estimated probability of exceeding a total discrepancy size of 10 dose cycles 
per 200 dose cycles is very low. ABS MDPI with integrated dose counter was well tolerated in 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
23 this study. The observed safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of albuterol 
and was not altered by the inclusion of the integrated dose counter. 
Bronchospasm Associate d with Asthma: In two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled studies of identical design (Study 1 and Study 2), PROAIR® RESPICLICK  
was compared to a matched placebo dry powder inhaler in 153 and 163 asthmatic patients , 
respectively,  12 to 76 years of age , at a dose of 180 mcg albuterol 4  times daily. Patients were 
maintained on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment. Serial measurements of FEV 1 
demonstrated that 2 inhalations of PROAIR® RESPICLICK produced significantly greater 
improvement in  FEV 1 area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to 6 hours 
after IMP administration over the pre-treatment value than placebo in Study 1. Results of Study 2 
were consistent with those of Study 1. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
single -dose, crossover study evaluating PROAIR® RESPICLICK and PROAIR® 
hydrofluoroalkane in 71 adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older with persistent 
asthma, PROAIR® RESPICLICK had bronchodilator efficacy that was significantly greater than 
placebo at administered doses of 90 and 180 mcg.  
Exercise- Induced Bronchospasm:  In a randomized, single-dose, crossover study in 38 adult 
and adolescent patients with exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), 2 inhalations of PROAIR® 
RESPICLICK t aken 30 minutes before exercise prevented EIB for the hour following exercise 
(defined as the maintenance of FEV 1 within 80% of postdose, pre- exercise baseline values) in 
97% (37 of 38) of patients as compared to 42% (16 of 38) of patients who  received placebo. 
Patients who participated in these clinical studies were allowed to use concomitant steroid 
therapy.  
More detailed information is provided in the IB and the package insert for PROAIR® 
RESPICLICK.  
1.2.2.1. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies  
A total of 1120 patients with asthma were treated with PROAIR® RESPICLICK during the 
clinical development program. The most common adverse reactions (≥1% and >placebo) were back pain, pain, gastroenteritis viral, sinus headache, and urinary tract infection. In a long- term 
study of 168 patients treated with PROAIR
® RESPICLICK for up to 52 weeks (including a 
12-week, double- blind period), the most commonly reported adverse events (≥5%) were upper 
respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, cough, oropharyng eal pain, headache, 
and pyrexia. In a small cumulative -dose study, tremor, palpitations, and headache were the most 
frequently occurring (≥5%) adverse events.  
More detailed information is provided in the IB and the package insert for PROAIR® 
RESPICLICK . 
1.3. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks to Patients  
1.3.1. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks of the Test Investigational Medicinal 
Product  
This study is being undertaken to determine if a specific pattern of changes in ABS eMDPI use 
can predict a patient’s  risk for subsequent development of a CE -COPD event. In addition to ABS 
eMDPI use, inhalation flow values, sleep disruption index ( SDI), and total daily steps ( TDS ) data 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
24 will be used to determine if changes in these measures can further improve the predict ion of risk 
for CE -COPD.  
ABS eMDPI is a rescue/reliever agent that includes an eModule on top of the approved 
PROAIR® RESPICLICK inhaler. The on- board electronics and power source are fully integrated 
into the inhaler and are designed to operate for the life of the inhaler without intervention. The electronic module records timestamped pre-defined events such as cap open and inhalation parameters. The inclusion of the eModule has been shown to have no impact on the dose 
delivery compared with the approved product without the eModule. Furthermore, the instructions 
for the use of ABS eMDPI are identical to that of the currently approved PROAIR
® 
RESPICLICK.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the inclusion of the eModule will add additional risk 
to the approved product. Information on the risks of PROAIR® RESPICLICK can be found in 
the package insert.  Additional information regarding benefits and risks of ABS eMDPI  to 
patients may be found in the IB. 
In summary, the benefit and risk assessment for ABS eMDPI is favorable following review of 
the outlined data. 
1.3.2. Overall Benefit and Risk Assessment for This Study  
This study is  in patients 40 years of age or older with exacerbation -prone COPD being conducted 
for assessment of the relationship  of the use of ABS eMDPI a nd other electronically collected 
data with a CE -COPD event. The study data will be used  to inform patients, providers, and the 
design of future intervention trials to demonstrate improved clinical outcomes . It is anticipated 
that risks to patients beyond those listed in the PROAIR® RESPICLICK label are unlikely.

25 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND  ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Study Objectives and Endpoints  
The study objectives and endpoints are as follows : 
Objective  Endpoints  
The objective s of this study are to explore the 
pattern and amount of albuterol use (as captured in 
the ABS eMDPI) , alone or in combination with 
other study data,  preceding  a moderate or severe 
CE-COPD  (as diagnosed by the investigators per 
the protocol). The hypothesis is that albuterol use 
will increase several d ays prior to a moderate or 
severe CE -COPD and can serve as a marker of 
COPD deterioration.  The endpoints of the trial are the primary outcome measure 
(ie, CE-COPD) and the primary outcome predictor (ie, 
albuterol use) alone or in combination with secondary  
predictors (ie, other study data).  These predictors  of 
CE-COPD  will be modeled to determine which patterns 
best predict the subsequent development of CE -COPD .  
For albuterol use, parameters of interest will include (1)  the 
total number of inhalations in the days preceding the peak of a CE-COPD , (2) the number of days prior to the peak of 
a CE-COPD  when albuterol use increased,  and (3) the 
number of albuterol uses in the 24 hours preceding a 
CE-COPD . Therefore, endpoints are not designated as 
either primary or secondary.  
In addition to albuterol use, inspiratory flow values ( MIF, 
inhalational volume, inhalation duration, and time to  MIF), 
SDI, TDS, and baseline information regarding disease state 
and demographics will be studied. These data will be 
analyzed using both a univariate and multivariate approach , 
to determine which pattern s best predict the subsequent 
development of a CE -COPD . Inspiratory flow values are 
obtained from the eMDPI, SDI is obtained for a subset of 
patie nts who agree to participate at specific investigational 
centers  (n=100) from an accelerometer worn on the wrist, 
and TDS is obtained for a subset of patients who agree to 
participate at specific investigational centers  (n=100) from 
an accelerometer worn on the ankle. Baseline disease state and demographic information will be obtained at screening.  
Another  objective for this study is to evaluate the 
safety of ABS eMDPI use  in patients with 
exacerbation -prone  COPD . The safety endpoints for this study include the following:  
• adverse event data 
• physical examinations  
ABS = albuterol sulfate; CE -COPD = clinical exacerbation of COPD; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease; eMDPI = multidose dry powder inhaler with an eModule; MIF = maximal inhalational flow; SDI  = sleep 
disruption index; TDS = total daily steps . 
2.1.1. Justification of the Endpoints   
The endpoints of the trial are the primary outcome measure ( ie, CE -COPD) and the primary 
outcome predictor (ie, albuterol use) alone or in combination with secondary predictors (ie, other 
study data). These predictors  of CE -COPD will be modeled to determine which patterns best 
predict the subsequent development of CE -COPD.  
The relationship between subsequent occurrence of CE -COPD and t he increased use of SABA, 
deterioration in peak ex piratory flow, worsening of symptoms , and physical activity were also 
studied ( Jenkins et al 2015, Moy  et al 2013).  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
26 In the present trial, SABA use will be monitored electronically  concomitant with the CE -COPD 
event. Inspiratory flow values will be used as a surrogate for peak expiratory flow, because the 
study data require no additional patient effort and are also digital and concurrent. SDI is an 
effortless, digital concomitant correlate of sleep disruption, a key COPD symptom complex. 
Furthermore, TDS is an effortless, digital concomitant correlate of dyspnea on exertion, which is 
also a key symptom of C OPD deterioration. These parameters therefore are likely to help predict 
the subsequent development of a CE -COPD.

27 3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. General Design  
This is a 12 -week, multicenter, open- label study to evaluate the relationship between as-needed 
usage of ABS eMDPI and CE -COPD in adult patients at least 40 years of age with exacerbation -
prone COPD. ABS eMDPI is a rescue/reliever agent that includes an eModule on top of the 
approved PROAIR® RESPICLICK  inhaler. The on-board electronics and pow er source are fully 
integrated into the inhaler and are designed to operate for the life of the inhaler without 
intervention. The electronic module records timestamped, pre- defined events such as cap open 
and inhalation parameters. The inclusion of the eModule has been shown to have no impact on 
the dose delivery compared with the approved product without the eModule. 
The study will consist of a screening period  of up to 2 weeks and a 12-week intervention period. 
After providing written informed consent, pa tients will complete a screening visit ( visit 1) to 
determine eligibility for the study. Patients will provide medical history  (including prior 
medications ), complete  a physical exam ination , pregnancy test , if applicable, and review COPD 
exacerbation histo ry. Eligible patients will return to the investigational center  within 2  weeks for 
the baseline visit ( visit 2). Those meeting entry criteria will be trained on the use of the eMDPI 
device and , upon demonstrated competency, will receive ABS eMDPI devices for use as rescue 
bronchodilators during the study. The screening visit and baseline visit may be combined. Patients must use ABS eMDPI as their only rescue agent for the duration of their participation in 
this study and will be advised to place any current rescue pills, inhalers, or nebulizers, including 
SABA, short- acting  muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs), or SABA/SAMA combination into 
storage. Patients may continue the use of other COPD  and non- COPD medications as advised by 
their physician without changes unless deemed necessary by their physician. Patients will be managed according to routine clinical practice by their treating physician with no specific study-related instructions provided other than those on the proper use of ABS eMDPI.  
Patients will be contacted by phone on a monthly basis for the collection of information about COPD exacerbations and treatments, concomitant medications, and adverse events. A review of the instructions for the use of ABS eMDPI and the procedure for replacement and return of ABS eMDPI will also occur during the monthly call.  
Patients will receive initial eMDPI devices at visit 2 based on anticipated usage pattern . In the 
event that additional eMDPI devices are needed, patients will be require d to visit the 
investigational center to receive them . Patients will be instructed to return all inhalers to the 
investigational center  at the last study visit or earlier, including at the early termination  visit, as 
well as at any other point if there is a problem with the inhaler. At the last study visit or early 
termination, patients will be queried for adverse events, concomitant medications, and COPD 
exacerbations ; a physical examination  will be completed; and the patient will subsequently be 
discharged from the trial.  
Two subsets of patients who agree to participate at specific investigational centers  and wear an 
accelerometer either on the ankle to measure TDS (n=100) or on the wrist to measure SDI (n=100) will be instructed on the proper use of these devices at the baseline visit ( visit 2). The 
devices will be worn throughout the 12-week intervention period and will be returned to the investigational center  at the final visit or upon early termination  (visit 5). 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
28 The end of study is defined as the last visit of the last patient.  
The study duration will be approximately 9 months. 
3.2. Planned Number of Patients and Countries  
Approximately 500 patients will be screened to achieve 400 enrolled patients.  A subset of 
patien ts (n=100) who agree to participate at specific investigational centers  will wear an 
accelerometer on the wrist to measure SDI . A second subset of patients (n=100) who agree to 
participate at specific investigational centers  will wear an accelerometer on t he ankle to measure 
TDS . 
The number of evaluable patients is planned to be 360. Details on the definition of evaluable 
patients and sample size are given in Section  9. 
The study is planned to be conducted in the United States in approximately 40 investigational centers.  
3.3. Justification for Study Design and Selection of Population  
The current study is designed to capture the natural history of CE -COPD and to assess the 
relationship of exacerbation events with data that are readily obtainable using ABS eMDPI in a routine clinical setting. Thus, there is no control group, and intervention is kept to a minimum 
(ie, only an eModule in surveillance mode and wearable accelerometer s are added to routine 
care).  
Prior work has documented a relationship between SABA usage rates and the subsequent occurrence of CE -COPD . The hypothesis that SABA reliev er use predicts short- and long- term 
exacerbation risk in COPD patients has been evaluated ( Jenkins et al 2015). A retrospective 
analysis of data from a study ( Sharafkhaneh et al 2012) compar ing budesonide/formoterol 
320/9 μg with formoterol 9 μg (both twice daily) in patients with moderate -to-very severe COPD 
was undertaken; reliever salbutamol 90 μg was provided. The f irst occurrence of reliever use >4 
(low), >10 (medium), and >20 (high) inhalations/day was assessed as a predictor of short- term 
(3-week) exacerbation risk. Mean daily reliever use in the week preceding the 2 -month visit was 
investigated as a predictor of the long -term (10 -month) exacerbation risk, using intervals of 2 to 
5, 6 to 9, and ≥ 10 inhalations/day.  
Overall, 810 patients were included (61% male; mean age 63.2 years; post-bronchodilator FEV
1 
of 37.7% of predicted). The f irst occurrence of low, medium, or high reliever use was predictive 
of an exacerbation within the following 3 weeks; exacerbation risk increased significantly with increasing reliever use. Mean reliever use over 1 week was predictive of long -term exacerbation 
risk. Patients with a mean use of 2  to 5, 6 to 9, and ≥10 inhalations/day exhibited 21%, 67%, and 
135% higher exacerbation rat es, respectively, in the following 10 months, compared with those 
with <2  inhalations/day. Budesonide/formoterol was associated with lower short- and long- term 
exacerbation risk than formoterol in all reliever -use groups. The authors concluded that SABA 
reliever use is a predictor of short- and long- term exacerbation risk in moderate -to-very-severe 
COPD patients with a history of exacerbations receiving budesonide/formoterol or formoterol. 
Previous work has also documented a relationship between physical activity and the subsequent 
occurrence of CE -COPD. In an observational cohort study of 169 persons with COPD 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
29 (Moy  et al 2013), physical activity  was directly assessed using the StepWatch Activity Monitor, 
an ankle- worn accelerometer that measures daily step count. Also assessed were exercise 
capacity, using the 6 -minute walk test (6MWT), and patient- reported physical activity using the 
St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire Activity Score (SGRQ -AS). Adverse events and 
COPD- related hospitalizations were assessed and validated prospectively over a median of 
16 months. 
Mean daily step count was 5804±3141 steps. Over 209 person- years of observation, there were 
263 adverse events  (incidence rate 1.36 ±1.6 per person-year) and 116 COPD- related 
hospitalizations (incidence rate 0.56±1.09 per person-year). Adjusting for FEV 1 percent 
predicted and prednisone use for adverse events  in the previous year, for each 1000 fewer steps 
per day walked at baseline, there was an increased rate of adverse events  (rate ratio 1.07; 95% 
CI=1.003 to 1.15) and COPD-related hospitalizations (rate ratio 1.24; 95% CI=1.08 to 1.42). 
There was a significant linear trend in decreasing daily step count by quartiles and increasing 
rate ratios for adverse events  (p=0.008) and COPD- related hospitalizations ( p=0.003). Each 
30-m decrease in 6MWT distance was associated with an increased rate ratio of 1.07 (95% 
CI=1.01 to 1.14) for adverse events  and 1.18 (95% CI=1.07 to 1.30) for COPD- related 
hospitalizations. Worsening of SGRQ- AS by 4 points was associated with an increased rate ratio 
of 1.05 (95% CI=1.01 to 1.09) for adverse events  and 1.10 (95% CI=1.02 to 1.17) for 
COPD-related hospitalizations. Lower daily step count, lower 6MWT distance, and worse SGRQ- AS predict  future adverse events  and COPD-related hospitalizations, independent of 
pulmonary function and previous adverse event  history. These results support the importance of 
assessing physical activity in patients with COPD and provide the rationale to promote physical 
activity as part of exacerbation -prevention strategies.  
The results of the studies reviewed above suggest that patients who develop severe CE- COPDs 
will have a predictable change in their clinical course that  could be used to identify patients at 
risk for a severe event. In the current study, information from the eMDPI and the accelerometer s 
will be used to determine if changes in these measures can predict the development of severe CE-COPD. If appropriate predictors of risk can be determined, patients at risk for severe 
morbidity and possibly mortality could be identified and receive interventions that  could change 
the subsequent clinical outcomes. 
3.4. Stopping Rules for the Study  
There are no formal rules for early termination of this study. During the conduct of the study, 
serious adverse events will be reviewed as they are reported from the in vestigational centers  to 
identify safety concerns  (Section  7.1.5). 
The study may be terminated by the sponsor for any reason at any time. For example, the 
sponsor should terminate the study in the event of: 
• new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safety issues invalidating the earlier 
positive benefit- risk assessment  
• discontinuation of the development of the IMP 
• the number of severe CE -COPDs collected  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD

30 If the whole study will be stopped, the patients that are terminated early will be followed 
according to Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient ( Section  4.3).

33 4. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF PATIENTS  
Prospec tive waivers (exceptions) from study inclusion and exclusion criteria to allow patients to 
be enrolled are not granted by Teva ( Appendix C ). 
4.1. Patient  Inclusion Criteria  
Patients may be enrolled in this study only if they meet all of the following criteria:  
a. The patient is male or female, 40  years of age or older, with a physician diagnosis of 
COPD. The diagnosis should include a history of FEV 1/forced vital capacity <70% 
predicted and FEV 1 <80% predicted documented in the patient’s chart. 
b. The patient is currently using a SABA reliever plus at least one of the following: 
long- acting beta agonist ( LABA ), an ICS/LABA, a long- acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA) , or a LABA/LAMA.  
c. The patient has had at least 1 episode of moderate or severe CE -COPD as described 
in Section  6.1.1 over the past 12 months before screening.  
d. The patient must be able to demonstrate appropriate use of albuterol from the ABS eMDPI.  
e. The patient is able to provide written informed consent. 
f. The patient must be willing and able to comply with study requirements as specified in the protocol, including the use of a wearable accelerometer for the subset of patients who consent to use of the device. 
g. The patient is willing to discontinue all other rescue or maintenance SABA or short- acting anti -muscarinic agents and replace them with the study-provided ABS 
eMDPI for the duration of the trial.  
h. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or ≥2 years postmenopausal) must have exclusively same- sex partners or use a highly effective or acceptable 
method of birth control and must agr ee to continue the use of this method for the 
duration of the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of the IMP. Highly 
effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (ie, <1% per ye ar) when used consistently and correctly. 
Highly effective methods of birth control in this study include combined (estrogen- 
and progestogen -containing) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone- releasing 
system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, and sexual abstinence. Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include: progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, for which the inhibition of 
ovulation is not the primary mode of action; male or female condom with or without 
spermicide; and cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide. The combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier 
methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, methods of birth 
control. Additional details can be found in Appendix E .

the study. 
e. The patient is either an employee or an immediate relative of an employee of the investigational center.  
f. The patient is known to be allergic to albuterol or any of the excipients in the IMP or rescue medication formulation (ie, lactose [milk protein]). Dietary lactose intolerance 
does not exclude the patient from inclusion in the study or as per the investigator’s 
medical discretion.  
g. The patient has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to the screening 
visit.  
h. The patient has a history of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus 
types  1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. Note: A history of a positive 
tuberculosis skin test without active tuberculosis may be acceptable only if the patient has received an accepted prophylactic treatment regimen and has no clinical evidence of active disease. Patients with a history of hepatitis C who have undergone treatment 
and achieved a sustained virologic response may be eligible if they meet all other 
selection criteria and receive medical monitor approval.

pregnancy test. 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
35 f. The sponsor requests withdrawal of the patient. 
g. Patient experiences an adverse event or other medical condition that indicates to the 
investigator that continued participation is not in t he best interest of the patient.  
Patients should be treated with standard of care after withdrawal from or termination of the study, as appropriate.  
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on patients in the case of withdrawal or discontinuation. Results of any evaluations and observations, together with a narrative describing 
the reason(s) for withdrawal, must be recorded in the source documents. The electronic case 
report form ( eCRF ) must document the primary reason for withdrawal or discontinuation. 
See Appendix F  for information regarding how the study will define and address patients who 
are lost to follow -up to help limit the amount and impact of missing data.  
If the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event, monitoring will be continued as applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a 
healthcare professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The specific event or test result (including repeated test results, as applicable) must be recorded both on the source documentation and in the e CRF; both the 
adverse events eCRF  and termination e CRF will be completed at that time . 
All assessments sho uld be performed according to the protocol for the final visit or early 
termination ( visit 5) if possible. Patients are required to return the ABS eMDPI (used and 
unused) upon withdrawal from the study.  
4.4. Replacement of Patients  
A patient who is enrolled but does not complete the 12- week intervention period will not be 
replaced.  
4.5. Rescreening  
A patient who is screened but not enrolled (eg, because inclusion and exclusion criteria were not 
met or enrollment did not occur within the specified time) may be consid ered for screening again 
if, eg, there is a change in the patient’s medical background or a modification of study inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.  
If the patient is rescreened, an informed consent form (ICF) will need to be re-signed. 
4.6. Screening Failure  
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently enrolled. Minimal information includes, but is not limited to, demography, screening failure details, eligibility criteria, and any ser ious adverse events.

36 5. TREATMENTS 
5.1. Investigational Medicinal Products Used in the Study  
Patients will receive initial eMDPI devices at visit 2 based on anticipated usage pattern. In the 
event that additional eMDPI devices are needed, patients will be required  to visit the 
investigational center to receive them.  Patients will be instructed on proper use of the device, 
including the requirement for use within 60 seconds of opening the cap. Patients will be instructed to return all inhalers to the investigational center  at the last study visit or earlier , 
including at the  early termination  visit (visit 5) , as well as at any other point if there is a problem 
with the inhaler . Compliance to ABS eMDPI  administration will be monitored.   
5.1.1. Test Investigational Medicinal Product  
ABS eMDPI  is an inhalation-driven MDPI containing a blend of ABS  and alpha- lactose 
monohydrate. The inhaler contains 200 actuations , each delivering  90 mcg of albuterol base 
ex-mouthpiece; the inhaler is equipped with a dose counter that shows only even numbers and 
counts down to “0”. 
The plastic inhaler comprise s a reservoir containing inhalation powder, a metering system, a 
mouthpiece with dust cover, and an eModule sitting on top of the drug delivery compartment. 
The on-board electronics and powe r source are fully integrated into the inhaler and are designed 
to operate for the life of the inhaler without intervention. The electronic module records timestamped, predefined events such as cap opening and inhalation. 
Additional details may be found in Table 2 and in the IB . 
5.1.1.1. Starting Dose and Dose Levels 
The prescribed dose will be 90 mcg, 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 hours as needed. No dose 
escalations are planned.

5.2. Preparation, Handling, Labeling, Storage, and Accountability for 
Investigational Medicinal Product s 
5.2.1. Storage and Security  
The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for all IMPs received, and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of 
the IMP.  
The IMP must be stored at monitored room temperature (15 °C to 25°C [59°F to 77°F]) and not 
exposed to extreme heat, cold, or humidity. 
5.2.2. Labeling  
Supplies of IMP will be labeled according to the current International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice and will include any locally required statements.  
5.2.3. Accountability  
Each IMP ship ment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, return 
instructions, and any applicable forms. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMPs for initial distribution to 
patients and other study materials from the sponsor are correctly received, recorded, handled, and safely and properly stored in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and  used 
in accordance with this protocol. All additional dispensing of the IMP will take place at the investigational center  as needed.  
Only patients enrolled in the study may receive IMP. The investigator (or designee) will instruct 
the patient to store the IMP according to the instructions on the label, if applicable, or will give 
instructions in an appropriate form. Patients will be instructed to return all IMP (empty, partially 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
38 used, and unused inhalers) to the investigational center  at the final visit or earlier,  including at 
the early termination  visit, as well as at any other point if there is a problem with the inhaler . 
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records). Patients will return all inhalers at the end of the 
study to the investigational center  for reconciliation.  
A record of IMP accountability (ie, IMP and other study materials received, used, retained, and 
returned) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, with an account given for any discrepancies. Empty, partially used, and unused inhalers will be disposed of at the end of the study following collection of data from the device and with sponsor’s approval. 
Further guidance and  information may  be provided in the Study Reference Manual. 
5.3. Justification for Investigational Medicinal Products  
5.3.1. Justification for Dose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product 
The prescribed dose of ABS eMDPI  used in this study (ie, 90 mcg, 1 to 2 inhalations every 
4 hours as needed) was selected based on the prescribing information  for PROAIR® 
RESPICLICK , which has the same drug delivery design as ABS eMDPI.   
PROAIR® RESPICLICK is indicated in patients 4 years of age and older for the treatment or 
prevention of bronchospasm with reversible obstructive airway disease and for the prevention of 
EIB. For the relief of acute bronchospasm symptoms, PROAIR® RESPICLICK is recommended  
at a dosage of 2 inhalations (ie,  180 mcg of albuterol base ex-mouthpiece) repeated every 4 to 
6 hours. More frequent administration or a larger number of inhalations is not recommended. In some patients, 1 inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient. The recommended dosage for 
PROAIR
® RESPICLICK for prevention of EIB in adults and children 4 years of age or older is 
2 inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise. To date, the overall results of clinical studies 
provide robust and consistent evidence that PROAIR® RESPICLICK  is effective for the 
treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in adult and adolescent patients with obstructive airway 
disease.  
5.4. Treatment A fter the End of the Study  
No treatment is planned by the sponsor after the end of the study. Patients should be treated with standard of care after withdrawal from or termination of the study, as appropriate.  
5.5. Restrictions 
There are no additional restrictions beyond the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study. 
5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Therapy  
Any prior or concomitant medication a patient has had within 30 days before enrollment and up to the end of study will be recorded on the e CRF. Trade name and international nonproprietary 
name (if available), indication, dose, and start and end dates of the administered medication will 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
39 be recorded. The sponsor will encode all medication according to the World Health Organization 
drug dictionary. 
The following medications will be prohibited during this study: 
• any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents including, but not limited to, 
methotrexate, cyclosporine, and interferon- α for 2 months prior to V isit 2 
• levalbuterol during the 12-week intervention period 
• other forms of albuterol MDI during the 12-week intervention period 
• any rescue nebulizer (SA BA, SAMA or SABA/SAMA)  outside of a CE- COPD 
At each investigational center visit and during monthly phone calls , the patients will be asked 
whether they have taken any medications (other than IMP), including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. 
Concomitant medication and treatment will be recorded through visit 5. 
5.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance  
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. A check of compliance 
with IMP intake will be performed during each monthly phone call after the IMP has been 
dispensed, and IMP accountability records will be completed. 
If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study 
protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be 
withdrawn from the study. 
Exposure to IMP will be assessed as required. 
5.8. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a nonrandomized study. All patients will use the one Test IMP, the ABS eMDPI. 
Blinding is not applicable.  
5.9. Total Blood Volume  
No blood will be collected for study- related assessments.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
40 6. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Efficacy will not be assessed in this study.  
The endpoints of the trial are the primary outcome measure ( ie, CE -COPD) and the primary 
outcome predictor (ie, albuterol use) alone or in combination with secondary predictors (ie, other 
study data). These predictors  of CE -COPD will be modeled to determine which patterns best 
predict the subsequent development of CE -COPD. Albuterol use, inspiratory flow, SDI, TDS, 
disease state at baseline and demographics at baseline, will be used to evaluate these endpoints.  
6.1. Assessments  
6.1.1. Clinical Exacerbation of Mild, Moderate, and Severe CE -COPD  
The diagnosis of CE -COPD  will be determined by investigators using the following definitions, 
which are based on the GOLD guidelines and those from a publication by Anzueto et al , 
Dransfield et al , and Wedzicha et al . 
In this study, “CE- COPD” is an occurrence of either “severe CE -COPD” or “moderate 
CE-COPD.”  “Mild CE -COPD” is defined below for investigator information but is not used 
either for entry criteria or  as a measure in this study.  
• Severe CE -COPD is defined as an event  that involves worsening respiratory 
symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids ( SCS; at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline [ Table 3] ) 
and/or systemic  antibiotics  and a hospitalization  for CE -COPD. 
• Moderate CE -COPD is defined as an event that involves worsening respiratory 
symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS  (at least 
10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline [ Table 3]) , and/or systemic antibiotics , 
and an unscheduled encounter  (such as  a phone call, an office visit, an urgent care 
visit, or an emergency care visit ) for a CE -COPD, but not a hospitalization.  
• Mild CE -COPD is defined as a worsening of respiratory  symptoms  for at least 
2 consecutive days requiring self -manage ment  by the patient , such as increased 
inhaler use,  but not requiring treatment with SCS  and/ or antibiotics , nor an 
unscheduled visit of any kind.

6.1.2. Albuterol Use  
Albuterol us age data will be downloaded using extraction software directly from eMDPI devices 
collected from the patients at their final study visit after return of the device to the depot.  
For albuterol use, parameters of interest will include (1) the total number of inhalations in the 
days preceding  the peak of a CE -COPD, (2) the number of days prior to the peak of a CE -COPD 
when albuterol use increased, and (3) the number of albuterol uses in the 24  hours preceding a 
CE-COPD. 
6.1.3. Inspiratory  Flow Values U pon Albuterol  Dosing  
Inspiratory flow values will include (1) maximal inhalational flow  (MIF), (2) inhalational 
volume, (3) inhalational duration and (4) time to MIF. The inhalational flow data will be 
downloaded using extraction software directly from eMDPI devices collected from the patients 
at their final study visit after return of the device to the depot. 
6.1.4. Accelerometry  
From a subset of patients who agree to parti cipate at specific investigational centers , SDI and 
TDS data will be  downloaded using extraction software directly from the wearable accelerometer 
devices collected from the patients at their final study visit. A description of the analysis is 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
The wearable Philips accelerometer falls into a product classification that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has deemed 510(k) exempt.  
See the User Guide  for a description of care and use of wearable devices.

42 7. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
In this study, safety will be assessed by qualified study personnel by eval uating reported adverse 
events and physical examinations . 
7.1. Adverse Events  
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this  study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study, or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the test IMP. A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing condition 
will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present 
before study entry and do not worsen during this  study will not be considered adverse events. 
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any o f the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• drug interactions 
All CE -COPD events require documentation by the Investigator in the CE- COPD Exacerbation 
Page in the eCRF. All evaluations entered  into the CE- COPD exacerbation page require an 
in-person visit (Vz “Exacerbation Visit”, see Table  1). This visit can coincide with an 
unscheduled provider visit ( Section  6.1.1) or can  be scheduled separately if an unscheduled 
provider visit has not occurred. Investigational centers must obtain source documentation of all exacerbations of COPD that occur during the treatment period to confirm the accuracy of the information obtained fro m the patient.  
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
For recording of adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period from signature of the ICF to the end of visit 5 ( Table 1). The period for reporting 
treatment -emergent adverse events is defined as the period after the 1
st dose of IMP is 
administered and until end of visit 5. 
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded both on the 
source documentation and in  the electronic data capture (EDC) system on the adverse event 
eCRF, regardless of the severity of the event or the site investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the event to the test IMP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be completed, and the serious adverse event must be reported in the EDC system 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event  (Section  7.1.5.3.1).  The investigator does not need to 
actively monitor patients for adverse events after the defined period. 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
43 At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events by asking an open -ended question such as “Have you had any unusual symptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be recorded collectively as a single diagnosi s on the eCRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on 
the serious adverse event form, which will then automatically result in the distribution of an email to the sponsor. 
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals u ntil resolved, 
stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a 
healthcare professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the test IMP or study procedure is made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded both on the source documentation and on the e CRF.  
The relationship of each adverse event to test IMP and study procedures and the severity and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described below. 
Further details are given in the Safety Monitoring Plan.  
7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of  each adverse event must be recorded as one of the following:  
• Mild:  No limitation of usual activities  
• Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities  
• Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities  
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Test Investigational Medicinal Product  
The relationship of an adverse event to the test IMP is characterized as follows:  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
44 Table 4: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Test IMP  
Term  Definition  Clarification 
No reasonable 
possibility  
(not related)  This category applies to adverse events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the IMP.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the admi nistration of the IMP.  
• It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to 
the IMP.  
• It does not reappe ar or worsen when the IMP is 
re-administered.  
Reasonable 
possibility  
(related)  This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection 
with the administration of IMP cannot be ruled out with certainty.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP.  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by t he known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear after 
discontinuation of the IMP, yet an IMP relationship 
clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.  
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events  
7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes or actions: 
• results in death  
• is life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of an adverse event, or that they  occurred as a consequence of the event   
Hospitalizations scheduled before the patient signed the ICF will not be considered 
serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the pre- existing condition 
during the patient’s participation in this study.  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
45 • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (refers to a substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threaten ing, or require 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any 
suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an 
important medical event. 
All occurrences of possible drug- induced liver injury that meet Hy’s law criteria, defined as all  
of the below, must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor as a serious adverse event by completing the serious adverse event form in the EDC system: 
• alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase increase of >3x  the upper limit 
of normal (ULN)  
• total bilirubin increase of >2x  ULN  
• absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of alkaline phosphatase) 
An adverse event tha t does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event  and recorded on the adverse event form as indicated in 
Section   7.1.2. 
7.1.5.2. Expectedness  
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant reference safety information (RSI) by its specificity, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI of the ABS eMDPI in this study is the IB. 
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Listing of Adverse Reactions in the IB by its specificity, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event.  
The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events.  
For the purpose of suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ) reporting, the 
version of the IB at the time of occurrence of the SUSAR applies.  
7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study, 
regardless of judged  relationship to administration of the test IMP, must be reported to the 
sponsor by the investigator. The event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
46 learns about it. Completing the serious adverse event form and reporting the event must not be 
delayed, even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to actively 
monitor patients for adverse events once this study has ended. 
Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after completion of that patient’s last administration 
of IMP should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of such serious 
adverse events . 
The investigator/qualified designee will enter the required information (detailed below) 
regarding the serious adverse event into the appropriate module of the serious adverse event 
form, which will automatically result in distribution of the information to the appropriate sponsor contact. If the EDC  system is temporarily unavailable or the study has ended, the event, 
including the inves tigator -determined relationship to IMP, should be reported via a paper 
back -up serious adverse event form to the appropriate sponsor contact. Upon return of the 
availability of the EDC system, the serious adverse event information must be entered into the form  in the system.  
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely: 
• study number 
• investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number 
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event 
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the test IMP (no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information includes: 
• age and sex of patient  
• date of first dose of IMP  
• date and amount of last administered dose of IMP  
• action taken  
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of relatedness  
• concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and regimens) and 
treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data 
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known 
• for an adverse event resulting in death  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to IMP)  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
47 − autopsy findings (if available) 
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the test IMP, study procedures, and to underlying disease. 
Follow-up: When additional relevant information becomes available, the investigato r will record 
follow-up information according to the same process used for reporting the initial event as 
described above. The investigator will follow all reportable events until resolved, stabilized, or 
returned to baseline; or until the patient is refer red for continued care to a healthcare 
professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the test IMP or study procedure is made.  
Duke Clinical Research Institute ( DCRI ) Safet y Surveillance will follow all serious adverse 
event s until resolution, stabilization, until otherwise explained, or until the last subject completes 
the final follow -up, whichever occurs first. DCRI Safety Surveillance will report all serious 
adverse event s to the sponsor within 1  to 2 business day(s) of receipt. 
For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP will distribute the Council for International Organizations 
of Medical Sciences form/Extensible Markup Language file to the contract research organization 
(CRO ) for submission to the competent authorities, Independent Ethics C ommittee/Institutional 
Review Board ( IEC/IRBs ), and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator must 
ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event in accordance with national and local regulations. 
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility  
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the test IMP or study 
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of ABS eMDPI and the appropriate competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate). 
In addition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other action may be required, including the following: 
• altering existing research by modifying the protocol 
• discontinuing or suspending the study 
• modifying the existing consent form and informing all study participants of new findings 
• modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as related to ABS eMDPI  
7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events not for Expedited Reporting  
For purposes of this protocol, there are no anticipated or previously recognized serious adverse 
events or reactions to  be reported to competent authorities in an expedited procedure. 
7.1.7. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest  
No protocol-defined adverse events of special interest were identified for this study. 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
48 7.1.8. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event  
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case- by-case basis. To ensure patient safety, after the event has stabilized or 
treatment has  been administered (or both), the investigator or other physician in attendance must 
contact the physician identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study. 
7.2. Pregnancy  
Any female patient becoming pregnant during  the study will discontinue the test IMP.  
All pregnancies of women participating in the study that occur during the study, within at least 5 half -lives after the end of study are to be reported immediately to the individual identified in 
the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol, and the investigator 
must provide the sponsor ( local safety officer /CRO) with the completed pregnancy form, which 
is a form outside of the eCRF (Section  7.1.5.3).  
The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between screening and baseline, provided no protocol- related procedures were applied.  
All female patients who  become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy 
(including spontaneous, elective, or voluntary abortion). If the pregnancy continues to term, the 
outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presen ce or 
absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, 
will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any 
complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of aft er withdrawal from the 
study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.  
If the pregnancy in the woman participating in the study does not continue to term, one of the 
following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event and on the pregnancy 
form . 
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event  and on the pregnancy form . 
• For an elective abortion not  due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an adverse event. 
7.3. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investigational Medicinal Products  
Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported 
either as a vi olation, if it meets the violation criteria specified in the protocol ( Appendix C ), or as 
a deviation, in the patient’s source documents, regardless of whether or not an adverse event occurs as a result. When meeting protocol violation criteria, all instances of incorrect IMP administration should be categorized as “Non- Compliance to investigational medicinal product 
(IMP).”  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
49 The following are types of medication errors and special situations: 
1. Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer. 
2. Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. Any dose of 
IMP (whether the test IMP , reference IMP, or placebo IMP), whether taken intentionally 
or unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the 
sponsor.  
3. Misuse: Situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with t he authorized product information. 
4. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects.  
5. Off-label use: Situations where an IMP is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with the authorized product information. 
6. Occupational exposure: Exposure to an IMP, as a result of one’s professional or non-professional occupation. 
7. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions which occur in infants following exposure to a medicinal product from breast milk. 
7.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Any patient who experiences menarche following screening will be required to have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to dosing with IMP . If a patient has a positive urine pregnancy test, 
then they will be discontinued from the study. Procedures for reporting pregnancy are provided 
in Section  7.1.5.3. 
7.5. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinat ions, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only) and weight, 
will be performed at  the time points detailed in Table 1.  
A physical examination will include, at a minimum, skin, lungs, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological assessments. Height (to be obtained at the screening visit only) and weight will also be measured and recorded. 
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.  
7.6. Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure [systolic/diastolic] , respiratory rate, and heart rate)  will be measured 
at the screening visit ( Table  1) for inclusion criteria assessment only and will not be used for 
safety assessment.

52 9. STATISTICS  
This section describes the statistical analysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study. 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analyses will be described in the statistical 
analysis plan. After finalization of the statistical analysis plan, an y additional analyses or 
changes to analyses that may be required will be fully disclosed and justified in the clinical study report (CSR). 
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
Assuming an expected dropout rate of 10%, it is recommended that 400 patients be enrolled so that 360 evaluable patients complete the study. These conclusions are based on a review of the relevant literature , as follows. 
Based on previous studies of an exacerbati on-prone COPD cohort ( Dransfield et al 20 13, 
Vogelmeier et al 2011 , Wedzicha et al 2013 , Wedzicha et al 2016 ), it is expected that 91 (range, 
73 to 110) CE -COPD events will occur over the 12 -week evaluation period in this study based 
on reported CE-COPD exacerbation rates of 1.05 and 1.14 events per year. Furthermore, it is expected that 14% ( 14) of total exacerbations will be severe.  
This sample size (ie, n=400 patients, 73 to 110 CE -COPD events) is considered adequate for the 
fulfillment of the study objectives to evaluate the relationship of albuterol use, inspiratory flow, SDI, and TDS data associated with a subsequent CE -COPD event. Per a previous study ( Jenkins 
et al 2013), a statistically significant relationship was established between daily SABA usage and subsequent CE- COPD.  
In the present study, approximately 73 to 110 CE -COPD events are desired because the model’s 
fitting of the current study involves the analysis of multiple predictors as described in more detail 
below. Because the largest model considered has 7 covariates, it is desirable to have at least 
70 events. The probability to observe at least 70 CE-COPD events is higher than 0.99. 
Risk models published in the literature have typically included between 4 and 6 covariates/risk 
factors ( Bateman et al 2015 , Greenberg et al 2012 , Quezada et al 2016 ) to examine the 
relationship between possible risk factors and a disease. When there is more than 1 covariate 
(risk factor) in the model, multiple logistic regression may be used to estimate the relationship of 
a specific covariate of interest (ie, albuterol use) to a primary outcome (ie, CE-COPD), adjusting 
for the other/remaining covariates (risk factors). In this case, the required sample size to estimate 
such a relationship is greater than that for univariate logistic regression.  
The number of events per variable has been suggested as a criterion for the size of a data set 
(Harrell et al 1984 , Laupacis et al 1997 , Peduzzi et al 1996,). The rule of thumb when building 
logistic regression models is 1 predictor variable for every 10 events ( Peduzzi et al 1996, 
Vittinghoff and McCulloch 2007). Therefore, this sample size would be adequate for predicting the primary outcome ( CE-COPD) using multiple logistic regression, including the covariate of 
primary interest (ie, albuterol use) and the remaining multiple predictors (inspiratory flow values, SDI, and TDS) as potential risk factor s for CE-COPD  in the model for this patient population.

53 9.2. Analysis Sets 
9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all enrolled patients regardless of whether or 
not a patient took any IMP. A patient is considered enrolled according to the status reported in 
the database. This analysis population will be used for summarization of patient disposition. 
9.2.2. Modified Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set 
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set that will 
include only the patients who used the IMP at least once during the study. This analysis 
population will be used for endpoint analyses. 
9.2.3. Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will include all enrolled patients who receive at least 1 dose of the test 
IMP. This analysis population will be used for analysis and summarization of safety data.  
9.3. Data Handling Conventions  
For all variables, only the observed data from the patients will be used in the statistical analyses, that is, there is no plan to estimate (impute) missing data, unless otherwise specified in the analysis plan.  
9.3.1. Handling Withdrawals and Missing Data  
Missing data will not be imputed, unless otherwise specified  in the statistical analysis plan . 
9.4. Study Population  
The cohort will consist of patients 40 years of age or older with moderate or severe CE -COPD 
(see Section  6.1.1) in the past 12 months.  
9.4.1. Patient Disposition  
Data from patients screened; patients screened but not enrolled and reason for non- enrollment; 
patients who are enrolled; patients enrolled but not treated; patients in the ITT, safety, and mITT 
analysis sets; patients who complete the study; and patients who withdraw from the study will be 
summarized using descriptive summary statistics (n, %). Data from patients who withdraw from 
the study will also be summarized by reason for withdrawal using descriptive statistics.  
9.4.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history and prior 
medications and therapies, will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous 
variables, descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be 
provided. Categories for missing data w ill be presented if necessary.  This will be based on the 
ITT analysis population.

54 9.5. Endpoint Analysis 
9.5.1. Endpoints  
The endpoints of the trial are the primary outcome measure ( ie, CE -COPD) and the primary 
outcome predictor (ie, albuterol use) alone or in combination with secondary predictors (ie, other 
study data, including inspiratory flow, SDI, TDS, disease state at baseline, and demographics at baseline) of CE -COPD. These predictors of CE -COPD will be modeled to determine which 
patterns best predict the subsequent development of CE -COPD. For albuterol use, examples of 
correlates of CE -COPD of interest include (1) the total number of inhalations in the days 
preceding the peak of a CE-COPD, (2) the number of days prior to the peak of a CE -COPD 
when albuter ol use increased, and (3) the number of albuterol uses in the 24 hours preceding a 
CE-COPD.  
Albuterol use and inspiratory flow values are obtained from the eMDPI, SDI is obtained for a 
subset of patients (n=100) from an accelerometer worn on the wrist, and TDS is obtained for a 
subset of patients (n=100) from an accelerometer worn on the ankle. Baseline disease state and demographic information will be obtained at screening.  
The following 8 surrogate measures of sleep disruption are available from the accelerometer 
worn on the wrist: (i) sleeptime average total time in bed, (ii) sleeptime average total sleep time, (iii) sleeptime average sleep latency time, (iv) sleeptime average wakening after sleep onset, 
(v) total time awake at night, (vi) longest sleeptime wake episode, (vii) daytime average minutes asleep, and (viii) longest daytime sleep episode.  
The SDI for analysis in this study is the composite endpoint derived from the summation of 
sleeptime average sl eep latency time, longest sleeptime wake episode, and total time awake at 
night. These 3 surrogate measures were correlated significantly with SABA rescue use 
(sleeptime average sleep latency time (r=0.78), longest sleeptime wake episode (r=0.73), and total time awake at night (r=0.65) ( Krouse et al 2008).  
9.5.2. Planned Method of Analysis  
The mITT analysis set (Section  9.2.2) will be used for all endpoint analyses. Individual listings 
will be presented by patient.  
9.5.2.1. Endpoint Analysis 
The relationship between albuterol usage and CE-COPD will be analyzed as follows, without controlling for multiplicity.  
The multiple device -use- measures will be used as predictors of CE -COPD in the following 
stepwise selection logistic regression models to select significant predictors in a forward manner: 
1. albuterol usage  
2. albuterol usage + inspiratory flow values 
3. albuterol usage + SDI  
4. albuterol usage + TDS  
5. albuterol usage + inspiratory flow values + SDI 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
55 6. albuterol usage + inspiratory flow values + TDS 
The sele ction of covariates will be performed at the 0.2 level. 
Demographic variables and disease state information collected at study enrollment will also be 
considered as predictors. Because the device -use-measures will be collected continuously over 
time, these measures could be used to derive many potential predictors of risk. For example, with 
respect to  albuterol use, a subject using the inhaler 3 times in the span of a 2-day or 3-day period 
could be a strong predictor of a CE -COPD, but a better marker for risk might be 10 times in the 
span of a week. There are no prior robust data to inform these decisions; 1 possible benefit of this work will b e to examine the relationship between multiple functional forms for the 
device-use- measures to determine which forms have predictive power. 
Furthermore, the effect of including interaction terms in the model (ie, testing the assumption of additivity of predictors on the log odds scale) will also be studied. Pair -wise interactions will be 
assessed at the 0.01 significance level to avoid weak interaction signals that would potentially 
not translate when applying the risk score to new cohorts. Goodness-of- fit tests may be applied 
to make sure that the finally selected model fits the data closely. The C -statistic ( Hosmer et al 
2013) will be used to compare the goodness of fit of various logistic regression models in terms 
of how well the predictor(s) discriminate between patients with and without CE -COPD.  
9.5.2.2. Sensitivity Analysis  
There will be no sensitivity analysis performed in this st udy. 
9.6. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
Because a goal of all of the analyses  in this study is to explore a risk -prediction model, no 
adjustment for multiplicity will be applied.  
9.7. Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis s et (Section  9.2.3). 
Safety assessments and time points are provided in Table 1. 
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Each 
patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or S ystem Organ C lass category for the 
analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall and by severity), 
adverse events determined by the investigator to be related to test IMP (ie, reasonable possibility 
[Section  7.1.4],  defined as related or with missing relationship; overall and by severity), serious 
adverse events, and adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study. Patient listings of serious adver se events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.  
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number , mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum) will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline to each time point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and

56 potentially clinically significant abnormal values ( physical  examination ) based on predefined 
criteria will be provided as well.  
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided, and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the CSR. 
9.8. Tolerability Analysis 
Tolerability was not specifically defined.  
9.9. Planned Interim Analysis  
There will be no formal interim analysis performed in this study.  
9.10. Reporting Deviations from the Statistical Analysis Plan

65 16. SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO PROTOCOL 
16.1. Amendment  03 Dated 26 June  2017 
The primary reason for this amendment is to clarify the population and endpoint events regarding 
moderate and severe clinical exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulminary disease ( CE-COPD). 
Additionally, safety reporting processes were streamlined to facilitate single source reporting  
through the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system . This amendment is considered to be 
substantial (ie, it requires approval by Competent Authority, Independent Ethics Committ ee 
[IEC], and/or Institutional Review Board [ IRB]) by the s ponsor. All text that was removed is 
denoted by a strikethrough, and all added text is underlined. Table 1 (Study Procedures and Assessments) has been revised to reflect changes described below. Other nonsubstantial changes 
have been made to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as appropriate). Th ese changes are 
unlikely to affect the safety or rights (physical or mental integrity) of the patients in this clinical 
study or the scientific value of the clinical study.

Objectives and  Endpoints:  
The endpoints of the trial are the primary outcome 
measure (ie, CE -COPD /severe CE COPD ) and the 
primary outcome predictor (ie, albuterol use) alone or in 
combination with secondary predictors (ie, other study data). These predictors of CE- COPD /severe CE COPD  
will be modeled to determine which patterns best predict the subsequent development of CE -COPD/severe CE
COPD . 
For albuterol use, parameters of interest will include (1) the total number of inhalations in the days preceding the peak of a se vere CE-COPD, (2) the number of days prior 
to the peak of a severe CE-COPD when albuterol use 
increased, and (3) the number of albuterol uses in the 24 
hours preceding a severe CE-COPD. Therefore, 
endpoints are not designated as either primary or 
secondary . 
In addition to albuterol use, inspiratory flow values (maximal inhalational flow [MIF], inhalational volume, 
inhalation duration, and time to MIF), SDI, TDS, and 
baseline information regarding disease state and demographics will be studied. These data wi ll be 
analyzed using both a univariate and multivariate approach, to determine which patterns best predict the subsequent development of a CE -COPD or severe CE

70 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (Other sections affected by these ch anges: Section 9 .1) 
Statistical Considerations:   
Sample Size Rationale : 
Based on previous studies of an exacerbation -prone 
COPD cohort (Dransfield et al 2013, Vogelmeier et al 
2011, Wedzicha et al 2013, Wedzicha et al 2016), it is expected that 9199 (range, 7395 to 110103 ) CE-COPD 
events  will occur over the 12 -week evaluation period in 
this study based on reported CE -COPD exacerbation 
rates of 1.05 and 1.14 events per year. Furthermore, it is 
expected that 14% (14) of total exacerbations will be 
severe.  
This sample size (ie, n=400 patient s, 7395 to 110103  CE-
COPD events) is considered adequate for the fulfillment of the study objectives using univariate and multivariate 
analyses  to evaluate the relationship of the pattern of  
albuterol use, inspiratory flow, SDI, and TDS data associated wit h athe subsequent development of a  CE-
COPD event. Per a previous study (Jenkins et al 2013), a statistically significant relationship was established between daily SABA usage and subsequent CE -COPD.  
In the present study, approximately 7395 to 110103  
CE-COP D events are desired because the model’s fitting 
of the current study involves the analysis of multiple predictors as described in more detail below. Because the 
largest model considered has 7 covariates, it is desirable 
to have at least 70  events. The pro bability to observe at 
least 70 CE -COPD events is higher than 0.99.  Statistical Considerations:

Furthermore, the effect of including interaction terms in 
the model (ie, testing the assumption of additivity of

primary hypothesis under consideration is that >12 
inhalations of SABA dosing will have higher odds of 
CECOPD risk relative to 0 to 12 inhalations per day. 
This dosing scheme is consistent with the approved 
labeling for albuterol inhalation products.  Pair-wise

SECTION 9.1 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CONSIDERATIONS  
Based on previous studies of an exacerbation -prone 
COPD cohort (Dransfield et al 2013, Vogelmeier et al 2011, Wedzicha et al 2013, Wedzicha et al 2016), it is expected that 9399 (range, 78 95 to 107103 ) CE-COPD 
events will occur over the 12- week evaluation  period in 
this study based on reported CE -COPD exacerbation 
rates of 1.05 and 1.14 events per year . Furthermore, it is  
the expected that 14% ( 14) of total exacerbations will be 
severenumber of CE COPD events requiring systemic 
corticosteroids is 62 (range , 43 to 82) and the expected 
number of severe CE COPD events is 11 (range 10 to 
13). 
This sample size (ie, n= 450400  patients, 7895 to 107103  
CE-COPD events) is considered adequate for the 
fulfillment of the study objectives using univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate the relationship of the pattern of albuterol use, inspiratory flow, SDI, and TDS data associated with the subsequent development of a 
moderate CE -COPD or severe CE -COPD event. Per a Based on previous studies of an exacerbation -prone 
COPD cohort (Dransfield et al 2013, Vogelmeier et al 2011, Wedzicha et al 2013, Wedzicha et al 2016), it is expected that 99 (range, 95 to 103) CE -COPD events 
will occur over the 1 2-week evaluation period in this 
study based on reported CE -COPD exacerbation rates of 
1.05 and 1.14 events per year. Furthermore, it is expected that 14% ( 14) of total exacerbations will be severe.  
This sample size (ie, n=400 patients, 95 to 103 CE -
COPD events) is considered adequate for the fulfillment of the study objectives using univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate the relationship of the pattern of 
albuterol use, inspiratory flow, SDI, and TDS data 
associated with the subsequent development of a moderate CE -COPD or severe CE -COPD event. Per a 
previous study (Jenkins et al 2013), a statistically significant relationship was established between daily SABA usage and subsequent CE -COPD.  The sample size justification and power 
considerations have been revised in light 
of the new sam ple size. The duration of 
the evaluation period has been corrected.

SECTION 9.5.1 ENDPOINTS  
The following 8 surrogate measures of sleep disruption 
are available from the accelerometer worn on the wrist; 
(i) sleeptime average total time in bed, (ii) sleeptime 
average total sleep time, (iii) sleeptime average sleep 
latency time, (iv) sleeptime aver age wakening after sleep 
onset, (v) total time awake at night, (vi) longest sleeptime 
wake episode, (vii) daytime average minutes asleep, and 
(viii) longest daytime sleep episode.  
The SDI for analysis in this study is the composite 
endpoint derived from t he summation of sleeptime 
average sleep latency time, longest sleeptime wake 
episode, and total time awake at night. These 3 surrogate 
measures were correlated significantly with SABA 
rescue use (sleeptime average sleep latency time 
(r=0.78), longest sleeptime wake episode (r=0.73), and 
total time awake at night (r=0.65) (Krouse et al 2008).

maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Patients will return all inhalers at the end of the study to the site for reconciliation.  These changes were made to further instruct the investigational centers on the need for patients to return all devices at the end of the study.  
Section 6.1.1 Clinical Asthma Exacerbation  
In this study, “CE -COPD” is an occurrence of either 
“severe CE -COPD” or “moderate CE -COPD.” 
• Severe CE -COPD is defined as a CE -COPD that 
involves worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent 
above baseline)  and/or systemic  antibiotics, and an 
unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization.  
• Moderate CE -COPD is defined as a CE -COPD that 
involves worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 
consecutive days requiring treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent 
above baseline)  and/or systemic antibiotics, but NOT an 
unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization.  In this study, “CE -COPD” is an occurrence of either 
“severe CE -COPD” or “moderate CE -COPD.”  
• Severe CE -COPD is defined as a CE -COPD that 
involves worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (at least 10 mg p rednisone equivalent 
above baseline) and/or systemic antibiotics, and an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization.  
• Moderate CE -COPD is defined as a CE -COPD 
that involves worsening re spiratory symptoms for at 
least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline) and/or systemic antibiotics, but NOT an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization.  This text was added to further define severe CE -COPD and moderate CE -
COPD for clearer diagnosis of CE- COPD 
by the investigator.

Section 6.1.1 Clinical Asthma Exacerbation (Other sections affected by these changes: Section 7.1.1)  
All CE COPD events require a visit to the 
investigational center and will be documented by the 
investigator in the CE COPD Exacerbation Page in the 
CRF. Investigational centers must obtain source 
documentation of all COPD exacerbations to confirm 
the accuracy of the information obtained from the 
patient.  All CE -COPD events require documentation by the 
Investigator in the CE -COPD Exacerbation Page in 
the CRF. All evaluations entered into the CE -COPD 
exacerbation page require an in- person visit (Vz 
“Exacerbation Visit”, see Table 1). This visit can 
coincide with an unscheduled provider visit (Section 6.1.1) or can be scheduled separately if an unscheduled provider visit has not occurred. Investigational centers must obtain sou rce 
documentation of all exacerbations of COPD that occur during the treatment period to confirm the accuracy of the information obtained from the patient.  The text was moved from Section 6.1 to Section 7.1.1 because it is the more appropriate section for discussing adverse 
events. The text was updated to provide 
clearer instructions on the collecting and reporting requirements for CE -COPD.  
Section 6.1.2 Albuterol Use (Other sections affected by this change: Section 6.1.3)  
Albuterol usage data will be dow nloaded using 
extraction software directly from eMDPI devices collected from the patients at their first study visit after 
return of the device to the depot . Albuterol usage data will be downloaded using extraction software directly from eMDPI devices collected from the patients at their first study visit after return of the device to the depot.  Language was added for clarification.

96 APPENDIX C. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations 
Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the  Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/Institutional Review Board ( IRB) and nationa l and local competent authorities, as 
applicable, except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the patients or when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal investigator at 
each investigational cen ter, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will 
sign the protocol amendment. 
Protocol Violations 
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or 
mental integrity of the patients in the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be considered a protocol violation. Protocol violations may include non- adherence on the part of the 
patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol-specific inclusion and exclusion criter ia, 
objective variable criteria, or Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guidelines; noncompliance to 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration; or use of prohibited medications. 
Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by investigational center personnel. All 
protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. 
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the 
patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented approval 
from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study. 
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are not  prospectively grant ed by 
the sponsor. If the investigational center personnel learns that a patient who did not meet 
protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria entered the study, they must immediately inform the 
sponsor of the protocol violation. If such patient has already completed the study or has 
withdrawn early, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. 
Information to Study Personnel  
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all personnel members 
involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must 
ensure that all study personnel are qualified by education, experience, and training to perform 
their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study, as ne cessary.  
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel, including the investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol. 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
97 Study Monitoring  
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form (ICF) and the study is 
conducted according to applicable Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ), the protocol, and 
other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. 
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are c orrectly and completely recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they 
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with IEC/IRB approvals. 
The study moni tor will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center according to 
the monitoring plan. The study monitor will be permitted to review and verify the various 
records ( electronic case report forms and other pertinent source data records, including specific 
electronic source document relating to the study) to verify adherence to the protocol and to 
ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded.  
As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, accompany the study monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the course of these 
monitoring visits or provided in follow- up written communication.  
Audit and Inspection  
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study conduct and compliance with protocols, SOPs, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical Quality Assurance, independent of Global Specialty Development, is responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit. 
The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor representatives may conduct 
inspections and audits to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.

98 APPENDIX D. ETHICS 
Informed Consent  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by the Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board ( IEC/IRB ). All written and oral 
information about the study will be provided in a language as nontechnical as practical to be understood by the patient. The patient should be given ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The above should be detailed in the source documents. 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before any study- specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained. The patient’s willingness to participate in the study will be 
documented in the informed consent form (ICF ), which will be signed and personally dated by 
the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. The investigator 
will keep the original ICFs, and copies will be given t o the patients. It will also be explained to 
the patients that the patient is free to refuse participation in the study and free to withdraw from 
the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the patient and parent/legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by the IEC/IRB. All written and oral information 
about the study will be provided in a language as nontechnical as practical to be understood by 
the parent/legally acceptable representative and the patient. The patient and parent/legally acceptable representative should be given ample time and opportunity to inquire about detail s of 
the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The above should be detailed in the source documents. 
A personally signed and dated ICF will be obtained from the parent/legally acceptable 
representative, and a signed and dated assent form will be obtained from each patient (if the 
patient is able) before any study -specific procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are explained; according to IEC/IRB 
requirements. The forms will be signed and dated also by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion. The investigator will keep the original informed consent and assent forms, and copies will be given to the patients (and parent/legally acceptable representati ve). It 
will also be explained to the patients (and parent/legally acceptable representative) that they are free to refuse participation in the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
Adult patients with  a legally acceptable representative should provide informed consent 
according to national and local requirements.  
Competent Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards  
Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national competent authority and to the respective IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start at a given investigational center before the IEC/IRB and competent authority (as applicable) for the investigational center give written app roval or a favorable opinion. 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
99 Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients  
The investigator must ensure that the privacy of the patients, including their identity and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In electronic case report forms (eCRFs ) and other documents or image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be 
identified not by their names, but by an identification number. 
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of patient safety or for verifying 
data in the source and the eCRF. This review may be conducted by the study monitor, properly 
authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, Global Quality Assurance, or competent authorities. 
Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential. 
Registration of the Clinical Study  
In compliance with national and local regulations and in accordance with Teva standard 
procedures, this clinical study will be registered on trials registry websites.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
100 APPENDIX E.  WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL AND BIRTH 
CONTROL ME THODS 
Contraception recommendations and pregnancy testing should encompass all investigational 
medicinal products ( IMPs ) as well as non -investigational medicinal products, eg, background 
therapy, and the measures to be followed should be based on the medicinal product with highest risk. 
Assessment of likelihood of possible interaction between IMP or concomitant medications and 
hormonal contraception should be conducted. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to 
interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method, eg, cytochrome P450 4A inducers. In case of suspected interaction, hormonal contraceptive alone 
may not be sufficient. In the absence of clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study data in IMPs 
with demonstrated or suspected human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity, recommendation for use of hormonal contraceptives should be thoroughly justified by the sponsor. Additional contraceptive methods, including supplementary barrier methods, may be considered. 
Women of childbearing potential are defined as:  
• not surgically (documented hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral 
salpingectomy) or congenitally sterile  
• 1 year postmenopausal (no menses for 12 months without alternative medical cause plus an increased concentration of follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] of more than 
35 U/L) in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal repla cement 
therapy ) 
Recommendations for application of birth control methods:  
• IMPs with Marketing Authorisation (MA)  
− SmPC: In case of no contraception recommendations, the principles of IMPs 
without MA should be applied 
• IMPs without MA 
− All female reproduction toxicity studies and standard battery of genotoxicity tests 
should be completed prior to the inclusion, in any clinical trial, of women of 
childbearing potential not using highly effective birth control or whose pregnancy 
status is unknown (in compliance w ith International Council for Harmonisation 
M2) 
− Unavailable or insufficient nonclinical data should be considered as “effects detected” and the highest risk category assumed.  
• IMP with demonstrated or suspected human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity  
− Highly effec tive contraception using methods with low user dependency 
− Contraception during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure. This period should be extended by 30 days in case of genotoxicity. 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
101 − Monthly pregnancy testing to be maintained until end of relevant systemic 
exposure – should be extended by 30 days in case of genotoxicity. Shorter testing intervals are to be considered depending on drug dosing schedule. 
• IMP with possible human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity  
− Highly effective method of contra ception  
− Contraception during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure 
− Additional pregnancy testing to be considered; as a minimum, at the end of relevant systemic exposure  
− In each case of delayed menstrual period (over 1  month between menstruations) 
confirmation of absence of pregnancy is strongly recommended. This 
recommendation also applies to women of childbearing potential with infrequent 
or irregular menstrual cycles.  
• IMP with unlikely risk of human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity, for which assessment of the completed necessary nonclinical studies does not indicate teratogenicity/fetotoxicity, in early pregnancy and human data are not available or do 
not contradict these findings or there is already sufficient evidence for lack of risk  
based on human data 
− An acceptable effective method of contraception unless an absence of risk of 
human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy can be justified  
− As a minimum, contraception until treatment discontinuation  
Highly effective birth control methods:  
Highly effective birth control methods are methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered. Such methods include: 
• Combined estrogen and progestogen hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least 
7 days (for IMPs without suspected teratogenicity/genotoxicity) and 1 month (for 
IMPs potentially teratogenic/genotoxic) before the first  dose of IMP 
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated 
with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least 7 days (for IMPs without suspected teratogenicity/genotoxicity) and 1 month (for IMPs potentially teratogenic/genotoxic) before the first  dose of IMP 
• Intrauterine device and intrauterine hormone- releasing system need to be in place at 
least 2  months before screening 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion and vasectomized partner provided he is the sole sexual partner an d has received medical assessment of the surgical process  
• Sexual abstinence is only  considered a highly effective method if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the defined period. The reliability of 
sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
102 • Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), 
declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception (according to  the Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency). 
Acceptable birth control methods:  
Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include: 
progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, for which the inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mode of action; male or female condom with or without spermicide; and cap, 
diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide. The combination of male condom with either cap, 
diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, 
but not highly effective, methods of birth control. 
Unacceptable birth control methods:  
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.  
Male contraception:  
Male patients must always use a condom, except in cases of no genotoxicity or demonstrated or suspected human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity.  
Vasectomy:  
Use of contraceptive methods applies also to vasectomized men, because of the risk associated with transfer of a drug via seminal fluid.

103 APPENDIX F. LOST TO F OLLOW-UP 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the investigational center. 
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the investiga tional center for a 
required study visit: 
• The investigational center must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the 
missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of 
maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient 
wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
• In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “lost to follow-up.”

104 APPENDIX G.  PRODUCT  COMPLAINTS  
Clinical Product Complaints  
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical 
quality or characteristics of clinical investigational medicinal product ( IMP) supplies or clinical 
device supplies used in a clinical research study sponsored by T eva. Examples of a product 
complaint include but are not limited to:  
• suspected contamination 
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) 
• defective components  
• missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center with more or less than the designated number of units inside) 
• incorrect packaging, or incorrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both 
• device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner 
Each  investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by completing the product complaint form provided by Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the i ssue.  
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s IMP supply) should be 
sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 
1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center  
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide the following information, as available: 
• investigational center number and principal investigator name  
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint 
• clinical protocol number 
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if applicable  
• product name and strength for open- label studies  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double-blind or open- label 
studies 
• product available for return Yes/No 
• product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No 
• description or nature of complaint 

 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
105 • associated serious adverse event Yes/No  
• clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No 
• date and name of person receiving the complaint 
Note: Reporting a product complaint must not be delayed even if not all the required information 
can be obtained immediately. Known information must be reported immediately. The sponsor will collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information.  
2. Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) at the Investigational Center(s)  
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP. 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all IMP, the sponsor will provide the 
informatio n needed to handle the return. 
3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol should be followed for recording and reporting ( Section  7.1.2 and Section  7.1.5.3, respectively) . 
4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, 
and any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the 
complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary, an event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all investigational centers using the product. 
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documented, and reported by the investigator throughout the study.

106 APPENDIX H.  DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORD KEEPING  
Direct Access to Source Data and Documents  
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed to the electronic case report form  (eCRF ). Data may not 
be recorded directly on the eCRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions spe cifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly to the eCRF.  
If data are processed from other institutions or by other means, the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to the eCRF, unle ss 
otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management). 
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) , and inspectors from competent authority (or their agents) will be given 
direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical charts/records, laboratory test results, 
printouts, and videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with national and local requirements. 
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s dat a 
at all times.  The investigator must maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows 
the unambiguous identification of each patient. Data Collection 
Data will be collected using e CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data 
collected on the e CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that 
meets the technical requirements described in 21CFR Part  11 (United States ) and documents of 
other concerned competent authorities. Before using the CDMS, it will be fully validated and all 
users will receive training on the system and study -specific t raining. After they are trained, users 
will be provided with individual system access rights. 
Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriately designated and trained 
personnel, and eCRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. 
Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the e CRF.  
If data are processed from other sources, these data will be sent to the investigational center, 
where they will be retained but not transcribed to the e CRF, u nless otherwise noted in the 
protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing 
data management).  
For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screening failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be entered in the eCRF.  
Data Quality Control 
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency of the data from this study. Oversight will be carried out as described in the 
sponsor’s Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) for clinical studies. Day to day data 
management tasks for this study are delegated to a contract organization, and these functions 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
107 may be carried out as described in the SOPs  for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs 
will be reviewed by the sponsor before the start of data ma nagement activities.  
Data will be verified by the study monitor using the data source, and reviewed by Data 
Management using both automated logical checks and manual review. Data identified as 
erroneous or data that are missing will be referred to the inve stigational center for resolution 
through data queries. Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data 
review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared with the information avai lable in the CDMS and any discrepancies will be queried.  
Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study. 
At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections . Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confirmed as accurate. All data collected will be approved by the 
investigator at the investigational center. This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate.  
Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
Sponsor Responsibilities  
The original eCRFs will be archived by the sponsor. Investigational center- specific eCRFs will 
be provided to the respective investigational centers for archiving.  
Investigator Responsibilities  
The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, notes, reports, and data related to the study and any additional records required to be maintained under country, state/province, or national and local laws, including, but not limited to: 
• full case histories  
• signed informed consent forms (ICFs)  
• patient identification lists  
• eCRFs  for each patient on a per -visit basis  
• data from other sources (eg, central  laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, and central 
image center)  
• safety reports  
• financial disclosure reports/forms 
• reports of receipt, use, and disposition of the IMPs 
• copies of all correspondence with sponsor, the IEC/IRB, and any competent authority 
The investigator will retain all records related to the study and any additional records required, as 
indicated by the protocol and according to applicable laws and regulations, until the CRO or 
sponsor notifies the institution in writing that records may be destroyed. If, after 25 years from 
study completion, or earlier in the case of the investigational center closing or going out of 
business, the investigator reasonably determines that study record retention has become unduly 
burdensome, and sponsor has not provided written notification of destruction, then the 
 Uncontrolled Study–COPD  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study ABS -COPD-30065 
108 investigator may submit a written request to sponsor at least 60  days before any planned 
disposition of study records. After receipt of such request, the sponsor may make arrangements 
for appropria te archival or disposition, including requiring that the investigator deliver such 
records to the sponsor. The investigator shall notify the sponsor of any accidental loss or destruction of study records.

109 APPENDIX I. PUBLICATION POLICY 
All unpublished information given to the investigator by the sponsor shall not be published or 
disclosed to a third party without the prior written consent of the sponsor. 
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, 
the investigato r agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission. 
This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments. 
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results: 
“Recommend ations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in 
Medical Journals”. Publication of the results will occur in a timely manner according to applicable regulations. In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, th e sponsor 
will generally support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as 
individual investigational center data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated 
by mutual agreement.  
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements: 
• substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, 
analysis, or interpretation of data for the work 
• drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content  
• final approval of the version to be published 
• agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions 
related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the w ork are appropriately

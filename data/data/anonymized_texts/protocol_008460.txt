 3 BACKGROUND and SIGNIFICANCE:  38 
The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with and without 39 
diabetes is well established (2-6). Extensive data from observational and prospective randomized 40 
controlled trials in hospitalized patients have reported a strong association between 41 
hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcome, such as mo rtality, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), 42 
infections and overall complications (2, 5, 7 -9).  Most clinical trials in critically ill and general 43 
medicine  and surgery patients have reported that improvement of glycemic control reduces LOS, 44 
risk of multiorgan failure and systemic infections (10-12), as well as short - and long -term 45 
mortality (7, 12)  in patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes.   46 
Clinical guidelines from professional organizations (13-15) recommend the use of subcutaneous 47 
(SQ) insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and surgical 48 
patients with T2D.  The t wo most common SQ insulin regimens for inpatient glycemic 49 
management are sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI) and basal bolus insulin therapy in 50 
combination with correction insulin scale (16, 17) .  The use of basal bolus regimen results in 51 
better glycemic control and lower rate of hospital complications compared to sliding scale 52 
regular insulin (SSRI) (17-20).  The basal bolus regimen, however, requires multiple insulin 53 
daily injections and is associated with a significant risk of hypoglycemia , which has been 54 
reporte d in up to 32% of non -ICU patients with T2D (17, 19, 20) .   55 
 56 
Increasing evidence indicates that incretin -based agents are safe and effective for the hospital 57 
management of patients with T2D.   We recently completed a  randomized open label trial 58 
comparing differences in glycemic control between treatment with sitagliptin (Januvia ) alone 59 
or in combination with glargine compared to a standard basal bolus regimen in general medicine 60 
and surgery patients with T2D (see pre liminary result section).  We found no differences in mean 61 
daily BG, frequency of hypoglycemia, length of hospital stay and complications.  Similarly, the 62 
use of GLP -1 and its analogues have also been shown to improve glycemic control and to have a 63 
benefici al cardiovascular profile improving functional status and endothelial function (21), 64 
increasing left ventricular function in patients with heart failure (22) and in surgery patients 65 
undergoing CABG (22, 23) , and to reducing infarct size and preserving  left ventricular 66 
myocardial performance in ischemic models (24).   67 
 68 
Liraglutide is a once -daily human GLP -1 analogue approved for the treatment of T2D.  69 
Liraglutide has been shown to lower blood glucose, stimulate endogenous insulin secretion, 70 
decrease plasma glucagon levels, inhibit gastric emptying, reduce food intake and body weight 71 
and improve ß -cell function when administered subcutaneously (25). Liraglutide increases  72 
insulin secretion in a glucose -dependent manner (i.e., only when plasma glucose levels are 73 
elevated), resulting in low -risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. When compared to 74 
insulin glargine therapy, the use of GLP1 has resulted in comparable red uction in HbA1c level, 75 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4 lower rates of hypoglycemia and less weight gain (26).  No  prospective studies; however, have 76 
compared the efficacy and safety of liraglutide in the hospital setting or after hospital discharge.  77 
 78 
 79 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:  80 
Primary objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of liraglutide (Victoza®) versus glargin e 81 
insulin on glycemic control after 26 weeks of treatment in medicine and surgical patients with 82 
T2D after hospital discharge.  83 
 84 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  85 
Study Hypothesis (hypotheses):  86 
We hypothesize that treatment with liraglutide  (Victoza®) will result in a similar improvement in 87 
HbA1c levels and in lower rate of hypoglycemic events compared to treatment with glargine 88 
(Lantus) in patients with T2D after hospital discharge.  89 
 90 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine whether treatment with liraglutide  (Victoza®) will result in 91 
similar glycemic control (HbA1c at 26 weeks) and a lower rate of hypoglycemic events 92 
compared to treatment with glargine (Lantus ) in patients with T2D after hospital 93 
discharge. Patients with poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥7%-10%) T2D treated with diet or oral 94 
antidiabetic agents , or on low -dose insulin therapy (TDD ≤0. 4 unit/kg/day ) will be randomized 95 
to liraglutide or glargine with or without oral agents at hospital discharge .  96 
 97 
Endpoin ts: 98 
Study Outcomes:  99 
The primary outcome  of the study is to determine differences in HbA1c concentration at 26 100 
weeks from discharge between liraglutide and glargine insulin therapy .    101 
 102 
The secondary outcome  is to compare differences between treatment groups in any of the 103 
following measures during the 26 weeks following hospital discharge in patients with T2D:  104 
• Self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) 7 -point profiles  105 
• Fasting and postprandial BG concentration  106 
• Incide nce rate and number of h ypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dl) and severe h ypoglycemic 107 
events (<40 mg/dl).  108 
• Percent of patients with 26 week HbA1c <7.0% and no hypoglycemia  109 
• Percent of patients with 26 week HbA1c <7.0% and no weight gain  110 
• Percent of patients with 12  week HbA1c <7.0% and no hypoglycemia  111 
• Change in body weight and BMI  112

 5 • Cardiovascular risk factors including changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and lipid 113 
profile.  114 
• Total daily dose of insulin  115 
• Number of emergency room visits and hospital readmissions  116 
• Acute renal failure during the 26 -week follow -up defined as a clinical diagnosis of acute 117 
renal failure with documented new -onset abnormal renal function (increment  in 118 
creatinine  ≥ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline)  119 
 120 
 121 
Study type : 122 
The trial is a 26 -week, randomized, open label -controlled two -armed, multi -center , multi - 123 
national trial investigating the efficacy and safety of liraglutide versus glargine insulin in 124 
medicine  and surgical  patients with T2D after hospital discharge.   125 
 126 
We will recruit a total of 330 poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥7%-10%) patients with T2D treated 127 
with diet or oral antidiabetic agents (OAD) or on low -dose insulin therapy (TDD ≤0. 4 128 
unit/kg/day)  prior to admission. Patients will be treated with a standard basal bolus insulin 129 
regimen during the hospital stay.  Prior to hospital discharge, patients will be randomized to 130 
liraglutide  or glargine  with or without oral antidiabetic drugs . After discharge, a member of the 131 
diabetes research team will contact patients via telephone call every 2 weeks to assess response 132 
to therapy. In addition, patients will be asked to attend an outpatient clinic visit at  2 (optional),  4, 133 
12 and 26 weeks after hospital discharge.  Recommendatio n on insulin dose adjustment will be 134 
provided to patients at each telephone contact and clinic visits.  135 
 136 
Recommendation for liraglutide dose escalation will be done every one or two weeks  until the 137 
maintenance dose of 1.8 mg is reached. Dose escalation can  be extended over 2 weeks at the 138 
discretion of the investigator in case of gastrointestinal adverse events.  Liraglutide and insulin 139 
will be add -on to the subject’s pre -admission OAD regimen.  Dose of OAD should remain 140 
unchanged throughout the trial, howeve r dose reduction of insulin and sulfonylurea is allowed 141 
due to hypoglycemia.  142 
 143 
Study Groups:  144 
We plan to analyze  a total of 280 patients  (who receive study medication)  with T2D at the time 145 
of hospital discharge.  146 
 147 
• Group 1.  Liraglutide once daily in combination to OADs (n=140).  148 
 149 
▪ Group 2.  Glargine once daily in combination to OADs (n=140).  150

 236 
GROUP 1.  Liraglutide Treatment Group.  237 
 238 
▪ Patients receiving no Therapy prior to admission:  239 
• Discharge on liraglutide once daily.  240 
• Start metformin if A1C ≥8% and no contraindications.  241 
 242 
▪ Patients receiving OAD prior to admission:  243

Algorithm for outpatient glargine insulin dose adjustment : 282 
 283 
Insulin Glargine  
If mean FBG > 180 mg/dL  for the last 
2 consecutive days and no episodes of 
hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL)  Increase daily dose by 4 IU  
If mean FBG > 140 mg/dL  for the last 
2 consecutive days and no episodes of 
hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL)  Increase daily dose by 2 IU  
If mean FBG bet ween 100 to 140 mg/dL  for 
the last 2  consecutive days and no episodes of 
hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL)  No Change  
If any FBG between 70 – 99 mg/dl  Decrease by 4 IU or 10% of total daily dose  
If any FBG or RBG < 70 mg/dl  Decrease by 8 IU or 20% of total daily dose  
If any FBG or RBG < 40 mg/dl  Decrease total daily dose by 30%  
 284 
In hospital  Diabetes Education.  Prior to discharge, participants will be trained on:  285 
1. Diabetes education if not received within 1 year of admission.   286 
2. ADA targets for fasting and p remeal BG between 70 to 130 mg/dL.  287 
3. Use of glucose meters for home glucose self -monitoring (meters may vary at different 288 
institutions).   289 
4. Keeping BG records, and will receive a log -book to record glucose tests results.  290 
5. Hypoglycemia recognition and managemen t (see VI.B.)  291 
6. Insulin administration (if needed).  292 
 293 
Follow -up Care:  294 
• If baseline visit was not fully completed a t the time of discharge, patients will be 295 
scheduled to return for a short in-person visit  to complete  (body measurements)  study 296 
procedures  within 7 days of discharge.  Research team will call to verify  correct 297 
administration of study medication and availability of medications and glycemic control 298 
monitoring supplies.  299

 10 • After discharge, a member of the diabetes research team will cont act patients via 300 
telephone call every 2 weeks for a total of 26 weeks.   301 
• Patients will be asked to attend the next outpatient clinic visit at 4 weeks of hospital 302 
discharge.  During this visit, patients will receive 8 weeks drug supply of liraglutide and 303 
will be asked to return to clinic at 12 weeks for the next outpatient visit.  During this visit, 304 
patients will receiv e 12 weeks (3 months) drug supply of liraglutide and will be asked to 305 
return to a fourth and final visit at 26 weeks of hospital discharge.  306 
• Recommendations on insulin adjustment will be provided to patients at each telephone 307 
and clinic visit s by a license d physician (fellow or study physician) (see section Vf).     308 
During follow up we will collect the following information:   309 
1. Glycemic control:  310 
a. Mean daily fasting and premeal blood glucose levels.  311 
b. HbA1c at 3 and 6 months of discharge  312 
c. Number of hypoglycemic events  313 
- Symptomatic hypoglycemia  is defined as an event with typical symptoms (i.e., 314 
sweating, palpitation, and feeling of hunger) with or wi thout confirmation by 315 
plasma glucose <70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L).   316 
- Severe hypoglycemia  is defined as episodes necessitating assistance and 317 
associated with measured plasma glucose < 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/L) or with 318 
prompt recovery after administration of carbohydr ates, glucagon, or other 319 
resuscitative actions. These episodes may be associated with sufficient 320 
neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Blood glucose measurements may 321 
not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to 322 
the restoration of BG to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event 323 
was induced by low plasma glucose . 324 
 325 
2. Diabetes treatment:  326 
a. Number of patients receiving insulin therapy, dosage and compliance.  327 
b. Use of liraglutide and other oral agents, dosage and c ompliance.  328 
c. Protocol adherence by PCP (diabetes clinic versus PCP)  329 
 330 
3. Clinical Outcome:  331 
a. Hospital readmissions  332 
b. Emergency room visits  333

Body measurements  356 
Body measurements consist of the parameters: Body weight, height, waist circumference, hip 357 
circumference and BMI  358 
Body weight: Body weight should be measured in kilogram or pound, without shoes and only 359 
wearing light clo thing.  360 
Height: Height (without shoes) should be measured in centimeters or inches and recorded 361 
without decimals.  362 
Waist and hip circumference: The waist circumference is defined as the minimal abdominal 363 
circumference located midway between the lower rib mar gin and the iliac crest. The hip 364 
circumference is defined as the widest circumference around the buttocks.  Three  consecutive 365 
measurements of waist and hip circumference should be taken and recorded.  Mean values will 366 
be used for result analysis. The waist  and hip circumferences will be measured to the nearest 0.5 367 
cm (0.2 inches) using a non -stretchable measuring tape.  368 
The subject should be measured in a standing position with an empty bladder and wearing light 369 
clothing with accessible waist and hip. The ta pe should touch skin, but not compress soft tissue 370 
and twist in tape should be avoided. The subject should be asked to breathe normally and the 371 
measurement should be taken when the subject is breathing out gently.  372 
Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI will be calcul ated by the formula Body weight (Kg)/m2. 373

Potential Risks to the Subjects:  380 
 381 
Hypoglycemia.     It is possible that following the proposed protocol, patients receiving basal 382 
insulin or liraglutide may develop hypoglycemia. For the purpose of this analysis we 383 
symptomatic hypoglycemia  is defined as an event with typical symptoms (i.e., sweating, 384 
palpit ation, and feeling of hunger) with or without confirmation by plasma glucose <70 mg/dl 385 
(3.9 mmol/L).  We expect that approximately 20% to 40% of subjects treated with basal insulin 386 
alone or in combination to OADs will experience one or more episodes of hyp oglycemia during 387 
follow -up. We anticipate that less than 10% of patients taking liraglutide alone or in combination 388 
to OADs will experience hypoglycemic events.   389 
Severe hypoglycemia  is defined as episodes necessitating assistance and associated with 390 
measu red plasma glucose < 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/L) or with prompt recovery after administration 391 
of carbohydrates, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These episodes may be associated with 392 
sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Blood glucose me asurements may not be 393 
available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of BG to 394 
normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by low plasma glucose .  We 395 
anticipate that less than 5% of patients  on insulin or liraglutide alone or in combination to OADs 396 
will experience severe hypoglycemic events.   397 
 398 
Gastrointestinal side effects  including nausea and vomiting are more common in patients 399 
treated with liraglutide compared to placebo.  The frequency o f nausea and vomiting is reported 400 
in up to 14% of patients receiving higher doses of liraglutide 1.8 mg in combination to 401 
metformin and sulfonylurea therapy compared to 3.5% in patients receiving placebo plus OADs 402 
(Victoza package insert).  T he number of a dverse events will be collected at each telephone 403 
contact or clinic visit.  There have been few reported events of acute pancreatitis. Subjects 404 
should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe 405 
abdominal pain. If p ancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide and other potentially suspect medicinal 406 
products should be discontinued. If the investigator suspects acute pancreatitis, all suspected 407 
drugs should be discontinued until confirmatory test have been conducted and appro priate 408 
treatment should be initiated. Subjects diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (as a minimum 2 of 3: 409 
characteristic abdominal pain, amylase and/or lipase >3xUNR or characteristic findings on CT 410 
scan/ MRI should be withdrawn from the study.  411 
 412 
Protection against Risks:   413 
We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor 414 
response to medical treatment every 2 weeks by telephone contact and every 3 months during 415 
clinic visits, b) women of reproductive age who are sexu ally active will undergo a urine 416 
pregnancy tests prior to participation in the study, c) female subjects whom are pregnant, 417 
breast -feeding, or not willing to use appropriate contraception at time of enrollment will not be 418 
included in the study, d) patients  with significant comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease 419 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13 greater than stage III, liver cirrhosis, gastroparesis, and pancreatic disorders will be excluded 420 
from the study.  421 
 422 
Hypoglycemia: Patients will receive diabetes education prior to discharge and  will be instructed 423 
on hypoglycemia sign/symptoms and treatment.  Patients will be asked to call the diabetes center 424 
and/or PCP in the event of hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the dose of OAD 425 
will be reduced or discontinued and the daily dose of basal insulin will be reduced by 10% to 426 
30% (see treatment algorithm) .     427 
Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting may be expected, more commonly in 428 
patients treated with liraglutide.  In subjects with suspected acute pancreatiti s liraglutide and 429 
other potentially suspect medicinal products should be discontinued until confirmatory tests have 430 
been conducted and appropriate treatment initiated.  431 
 432 
 433 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  434 
This study is randomized multicenter, open -label controll ed trial. The overall hypothesis is that 435 
patients with T2D discharged on liraglutide and glargine will experience similar improvement in 436 
glycemic control (HbA1c level at 26 weeks post -discharge).  In addition, we anticipate that 437 
compared to patients treate d with insulin glargine, patients on liraglutide will experience lower 438 
number of hypoglycemic events and less weight gain during follow -up.  439 
 440 
Sample Size and Power Calculations: The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control 441 
measured by HbA1c at 26 weeks after discharge between treatment groups. To show the non - 442 
inferiority of liraglutide to basal glargine insulin in terms of glycemic control, we set the 443 
equivalence margin as 0.5%, from a view that an HbA1c difference < 0.5% is usually not 444 
considered as clinically significant.  445 
Based on preliminary discharge data, we assume the standard deviation of 26 week A1c is 446 
bounded about 1.5%.  We set the margin of equivalence as 0.5%  and assume the true difference 447 
between mean A1c is 0. A sample size of 124 for each treatment group would achieve 80% 448 
power to reject the hypothesis that the mean HbA1c in patients treated with liraglutide is < 0.5%  449 
more than that in patients  treated with  glargine based on  a two -sample one -sided t test, with 450 
alpha=0.05 . Accounting for 10% attrition rate, we would need 140 patients  per treatment group. 451 
This leads to a final total sample size estimate of 280 patients  that receive study medication . 452 
 453 
The secondary outcome of major interest in this study is the difference in hypoglycemia (BG <70 454 
mg/dl). Based on our preliminary discharg e data, 30 -40% of patients treated with basal insulin 455 
will have at least one hypoglycemia episode. Assuming a hypoglycemia rate of 20 -35% in the 456 
insulin group in this study, given the sample size of 140 subjects per treatment group, based on a 457 
two sided Fi sher’s exact test with alpha=0.05, we would have 80% power to detect an odds rati o 458 
in hypoglycemia rate of 0.42 in liraglutide group (versus glargine group). In the following table, 459 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14 we give the estimated power under different assumed group differences in h ypoglycemia rate, 460 
represented by four hypothesized odds ratios.  461 
Table: Estimated power with 140  subjects per group (before 10% attrition) and the antic ipated 462 
hypoglycemia rate of 35%  in the insulin group based on two -sided Fisher’s exact test with 463 
alpha=0. 05. 464 
 465 
Odds Ratio  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  
Power  >0.99  0.97  0.85 0.64  
   466 
The above calculations show that we will have a good chance to achieve over 80% power for the 467 
secondary outcome of hypoglycemia rate.  468 
 469 
 470 
 471 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  472 
The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control measured by HbA1c concentration at 26 473 
weeks post -discharge . We will first compare the primary outcome using two -sample t -tests (or 474 
Wilcoxon tests) or one -way ANOVA, followed by multivariate linear regr ession to estimate and 475 
test the difference between the two treatment groups while simultaneously accounting for other 476 
potential confounders . Particularly, we will investigate center effect for the HbA1c outcome by 477 
stratified univariate analysis or multiva riate linear regression. Transformations will be applied if 478 
normality violation is detected. Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection strategy will be 479 
adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and 480 
model  checking procedures will be applied to examine the fit of the developed models.  481 
 482 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  483 
Secondary endpoints in this study include rate of hypoglycemia, number of hypoglycemia 484 
events, change in body weight in kilograms, number of episodes of severe hyperglycemia, 485 
complications and Emergency Room or hospital readmissions. For hypoglycemia outco mes, we 486 
will first conduct nonparametric comparisons of the rate of hypoglycemia based on a two -sided 487 
Chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test in the presence of low incidence rates), followed by the 488 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test which adjusts for the potent ial center effect. Univariate Poisson 489 
regression (or Negative Binomial regression) will be performed to assess whether there is any 490 
difference in the number of hypoglycemia events between the two treatment groups. We will 491 
further conduct multivariate Logis tic regression, Poisson regression (or negative binomial 492 
regression) to estimate the difference in the rate and frequency of hypoglycemia while adjusting 493 
for relevant covariates.  Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection strategy will be adopted 494 
to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and model 495 
checking procedures, such as deviance residual plot and Hosmer -Lemeshow test, will be applied 496 
to examine the fit of the developed models. Similar analyses will be condu cted for severe 497 
hyperglycemia outcomes. For single measurement continuous outcomes, such as length of 498 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15 hospital stay, we will use two -sample t -tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests to compare them 499 
between  groups.  Transformations will be applied if normality  violation is detected.  Multivariate 500 
linear regression will be further conducted to assess the difference in continuous secondary 501 
outcomes between the two groups with other relevant covariates. We will use standard model 502 
selection and model checking proce dures for linear regression to decide the final models and 503 
assess their fits to the data. For repeated measurement continuous outcomes, such as fasting BG 504 
values, we will first conduct cross -section analysis following the same strategy for the single 505 
measu rement continuous outcome. Then we plan to fit repeated measures ANOVA or linear 506 
models which can simultaneously account for multiple time points during the discharge follow - 507 
up. Model selection and model checking will follow the standard procedures.  508 
 509

 19 STUDY  DRUGS AND MATERIALS:  554 
Clinical trial materials will be labeled and should be handled and stored according to the 555 
respective hospital’s re gulatory requirements.   After discharge, patients will be re -started on their 556 
pre-admission OADs (except for DPP4 -inhibitors and selected drugs in the presence of 557 
contraindication, i.e., metformin and renal failure).  Liraglutide or glargine will be provided 558 
during the study.   559 
 560 
Study  medication (s) / devices(s)  561 
Liraglutide 6.0 mg/mL solution for s.c. injection , provided in 3 mL prefilled pen.   562 
 563 
Stora ge and Drug Accountability of Study  Medication(s)  564 
Liraglutide will be stored and dispensed by the research pharmacy at each institution. The 565 
liraglutide prefilled pen and glargine will be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature between 566 
+2°C and +8°C (+36 °F and +46°F).  567 
Once dispensed and in use (after first opening), the liraglutide prefilled pen can be stored for one 568 
month at room temperature (+15°C to +30°C)/(59°F to 86°F) or in a refrigerator (+2°C to 569 
+8°C)/(+36°F to +46°F).  The liraglutide prefilled p en must be protected from all sources of light 570 
and the pen cap should be kept on when the pen is not in use.  571 
 572 
 573 
Drug accountability:  The trial product will be dispensed to each subject as required according 574 
to treatment group. The research/clinical staff will perform drug accountability by asking 575 
patients to return all unused, partly used  and unused cartridges  and vials of liraglutide and 576 
glargine insulin at each visit.   577 
 578 
Randomization and Blinding  579 
This is an open label randomized controlled trial.  Patients will be randomized consecutivel y 580 
using a computer generated randomization table provided by Dr. Limin Peng at the Emory 581 
School of Public Health. Patient will be randomized (block randomization) based on glucose 582 
levels ( BG>200 or  BG<200 ). The randomization table will be mailed to each institution wh ere a 583 
member  of the research team will be in charge of the randomization  process  and group 584 
assignment .  585 
 586 
CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS:  587 
Background medications:  588 
 589 
Metformin.   Metformin is considered background medication (non -investigational medicinal 590 
product) and will not be provided during the trial.  The total daily dose of metformin prior to 591 
admission will be restarted at hospital discharge (unless contraindica ted = i.e., renal failure or 592 
eGFR < 45 ml/min) with no dose adjustments occurring during the trial.  593 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 20  594 
Sulfonylurea and Insulin secretagogues.  Sulfonylurea treatment is considered background 595 
medication (non -investigational medicinal product) and will not be  provided during the trial.  596 
The total daily dose of sulfonylurea prior to admission will be decreased  at hospital discharge.   597 
During the study, no up -titration of sulfonylurea dosage will be allowed.  Dose reduction of SU 598 
due to hypoglycemia may be allowe d at the investigators discretion.  In the event of 599 
hypoglycemia, the dose of sulfonylurea can be reduced or the drug can be stopped at the 600 
investigator’s discretion.    601 
 602 
Pioglitazone.  Pioglitazone is considered background medication (non -investigational medicinal 603 
product) and will not be provided during the trial. The total daily dose of pioglitazone prior to 604 
admission will be restarted at hospital discharge.  No dose adjustment or up -titration will occur 605 
during the trial; however, in the event of periphe ral edema or signs of volume overload, the dose 606 
of pioglitazone can be reduced or stopped at the investigator’s discretion.    607 
 608 
ADVERSE EVENTS:  609 
Definition:   An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a product, and 610 
which does not ne cessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE is an 611 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom or disease 612 
temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the pro duct.  613 
This includes events from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed 614 
consent and until post treatment follow -up period as defined in the protocol.  615 
AEs include a clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness  and clinical laboratory 616 
adverse event (CLAE).  An AE is either a serious AE (SAE) or a non -serious AE.  617 
 618 
In this trial, an SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:  619 
-Death  620 
-A life -threatening experience  621 
-Inpatient hospitalization  622 
-Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  623 
-Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening or require 624 
hospitalization  625 
-Episodes of severe hypoglycemia will be captured as serious AEs.  626 
 627 
Severi ty Assessment Definitions:  628 
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  629 
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  630 
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  631 
 632 
Relationship to Trial Product Assessment Definitions:  633 
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  634 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 21 • Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  635 
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the trial product  636 
 637 
Adverse events will be actively collected from the signing of the informed consent and in all 638 
following contacts throughout  the project. This includes events from all  trial related activity after 639 
the subject has signed the informed consent, and until the post treatment follow -up period, as 640 
defined in the protocol.  641 
 642 
Outcome Categories and Definitions:  643 
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to 644 
the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed consent  645 
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. 646 
This term should on ly be used when the subject has completed the trial  647 
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and significant 648 
disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered with sequelae 649 
should be rated  as an SAE  650 
• Not recovered  651 
• Fatal  652 
• Unknown  653 
 654 
Reporting of adverse events:  All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and 655 
reported. The events must be recorded in the AE form in a timely manner.  During each contact 656 
with the trial site s taff (site visits and telephone contacts), the subject will be asked about AEs. 657 
After  the ICF is signed , all adverse events related to protocol procedures are to be reported.   658 
 659 
The presence of SAE will be reported to the Emory IRB and Novo Nordisk within 2 4 hours  by 660 
fax or e -mail. A SAE is any adverse event from this study that results in one of the following 661 
outcomes: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, a life -threatening experience (that 662 
is, immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and events considered 663 
significant by the investigator for any other reason.  664 
  665 
Reporting of pregnancies:  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast -feeding will not be 666 
recruited in the study.  Female subject s will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately 667 
if they become pregnant during the trial. The investigator must report any pregnancy in subjects 668 
who received liraglutide to the Emory IRB and Novo Nordisk. The pregnant subject will be 669 
asked to p rovide information about her pregnancy, delivery and the health of her infant until age 670 
one month. If the infant has a congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed 671 
up as a serious adverse event.  672

 Medical Events of Special Interest are those events thought to be [potentially] associated with 677 
the investigational compound or disease under study. The investigators will collect information 678 
on medical events of special interest including  acute pancreatitis , cardiovascular events (heart 679 
failure, acute myocardial infarction, and atrial  fibrillation), malignancies, and medication errors 680 
(e.g., incorrect dose of liraglutide or insulin).  681 
 682 
LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE:  683 
Financial Obligation.   684 
No additional cost to patients or to the institution will be incurred for research purposes. Patients 685 
will not be billed for the laboratory work or any test that is being done only for study purposes.  686 
Novo Nordisk will provide liraglutide at no cost to  participants.  Patients will be responsible for 687 
the cost of their usual ongoing medical care, including procedures and/or non -study medications 688 
that your doctor requires as part of your usual medical care.  689 
Research Injuries.   690 
If a patient is inju red because of taking part in this study, Dr. Umpierrez and investigators at each 691 
institution, along with the medical facilities will make medical care available to the patient at the 692 
patient’s own cost. The only exception is if it is proved that the injur y or illness is directly caused 693 
by the negligence of an Emory or sponsor employee.  “Negligence” is the failure to follow a 694 
standard duty of care. Financial compensation for such things as lost wages, disability or 695 
discomfort due to an injury related to th e study is not available.   696 
 697 
Publication Plan: 698 
We anticipate completion of the study in October or November 2020.  Data will be analysed  in 699 
December 20 20.  One abstract will be submitted to the 2021 American Diabetes Association 700 
meeting and manuscript(s) will be submitted during the first six months of 20 21. 701

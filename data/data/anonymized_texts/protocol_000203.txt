Study Design  
This is a single -center, Phase 2, single -blind, 4 -period sequential study will obtain a preliminary as sessment of the 
effects of ergoloid mesylates (EM) 1 mg TID and 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP ) 100 mg TID and the combination 
compared to a placebo period in participants with Fragile X Syndrome. The study will consist of a Screening period 
of up to 28 days p rior to initial study drug administration, followed by four 4 week single -blind treatment periods.  
The screening and baseline visits may occur at the same time, provided the results of safety labs can be obtained. A 
final follow -up visit or phone contact for safety is planned one week after the conclusion of Period 4.  
 
Eligible participants will be started on EM for 4 weeks in Period 1, then will take EM and 5-HTP for 4 weeks in 
Period 2, then, 5 -HTP for 4 weeks in Period 3, then placebo for 4 weeks in Per iod 4. Study visits will occur at baseline 
and every 4 weeks at transition times between periods, then at the end of the study.  
 
Brief cognitive and behavioral assessments will be performed during each clinic visit.  Safety and tolerability 
assessments wi ll include adverse event monitoring, vital signs, blood chemistry and hematology, and urinalysis.

EM=ergoloid mesylates 1 mg TID, 5 -HTP = 5-hydroxytryptophan 100 mg TID  
 
Planned Numbers of Participants  
 
Enrollment of a total of 15  eligible participants is planned.  
 
Study Duration  
The total duration of the study for each participant will be up to 21 weeks, including a maximum of 4 -week screening 
period, four 4 -week Single -Blind treatment Periods, and a follow -up telephone call approximately 1 week after the 
last treat ment visit.  
 
 
Study Procedures:  
The Screening Visit will occur up to 28 days prior to the first study drug administration on Day 1.  During screening, 
participants and their parent/legal authorized guardian, if indicated, will review and sign an Informed Consent/Assent 
form prior to any study procedures being performed.  Following confirmation of a prior diagnosis for Fragile X, 
participants will have information collected regarding their neurological and medical/surgical history, race/ethnicity, 
social history (tobacco, alcohol, and/or d rug use), and use of prescription and over -the-counter medications.  
Participants will undergo a full physical exam, and have vital signs measured.  Height, weight, and BMI will also be 
collected.  Fasting blood samples will be collected for chemistry and hematology. Urine will be collected for 
urinalysis.  The Stanford -Binet version 5 will also be administered at screening, as will an assessment of suicidality 
risk.   
 
At the Baseline visit (Period 1/Day 1), participants will receive an abbreviated physica l examination including vital 
signs.  However, these will not be repeated if the Screening and Baseline visits occur on the same day.  Cognitive, 
behavioral, ERP and eye tracking assessments will be performed, and these measurements will be used as a commo n 
set of baseline measurements to which post -treatment assessments will be compared for all treatment Periods.  
 
During all four single -blind periods, participants will receive three times a day treatment with single -blinded study 
medication, two caps three  times a day, each dose at least 4 hours apart. In the first period they will take an EM 
capsules and a placebo capsule at each dose, the second period an EM and 5 -HTP caps at each dose, the third period 
a 5-HTP and placebo capsule each dose, and the fourt h period 2 placebo capsules each dose. EM and 5-HTP will be 
over-encapsulated to maintain the single -blind.  
 
Participants will return to the clinic at the end of each Period at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16.  Cognitive and behavioral 
evaluations will be repeated at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 (end of Period 1, 2, 3, 4). Additionally, participants will be 
monitored for adverse events via a telephone call at the end of Week 1 of each Period, and one week following 
completion of Period 4 or following early discontinuation .  During clinic visits, adverse effects will be assessed, and 
laboratory measures and vital signs will be repeated according to the Schedule of Assessments. Suicidality risk will 
also be evaluated during the treatment periods per the Schedule of Assessmen ts; if a concern is detected, the 
participant will be referred for further evaluation and treatment.

 Statistica l Considerations  
 
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy population will be the intent to treat (ITT) efficacy population, which will include all 
participants who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at least one follow -up visit. The co mpleters 
population (CP), defined as all randomized participants who complete all 4 treatment periods with no significant 
protocol violations, will be used to evaluate the robustness of the ITT results.  
 
All efficacy parameters will be summarized at each time point collected and standard descriptive statistics provided. 
Baseline measurements are defined as those obtained on Day 1/Period 1 prior to receipt of any study medication.  For 
cognitive parameters measured at baseline, change from baseline will also be calculated and standard descriptive 
statistics provided for each time point.   
 
Safety Analyses  
The Safety population will include all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. A dverse Events 
(AEs), including clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities and significant behavioral changes will be tabulated. 
AE severity and relatedness to treatment will be assessed. AEs will be tabulated for placebo, EM, EM  + 5-HTP  and 
5-HTP treatments. Summaries will also be provided by severity and relationship to treatment. Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) will be summarized separately, in a manner similar to that used for Adverse Events.

3.1 Background  
Mutational inactivation of the FMR1  gene encoding the Fragile X Mental Retardation protein 
(FMRP) causes a spectrum of symptoms including seizures, sleep disorders, anxiety, irritability, 
autism, mild to severe cognitive impairment and intellectual disability. The constellation of 
symptoms i s known as Fragile -X syndrome (FXS).  
 
FXS in humans is caused by a CGG triplet expansion mutation (> 200 repeats) in the 5′ untranslated 
region of the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome, which leads to gene methylation, 
inactivation, and resultant loss  of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. FMRP 
functions as a translational regulator, affecting synthesis of many proteins including those involved 
in synaptic pruning during development .1 Meta -analysis estimates the frequencies of indiv iduals 
with the full mutation FXS allele to be approximately 1 in 7000 males and 1 in 11,000 females .2 
FXS is severely debilitating in males. Females generally are less affected than males due to 
mosaicism resulting from X -chromosome inactivation which occ urs randomly early in 
embryogenesis .3 
 
FXS presents with a variable clinical phenotype. In affected individuals , the disease presents during 
childhood with delayed developmental milestones. Intellectual deficit can be of variable severity and 
may include p roblems with working and short -term memory, executive function, language, 
mathematics and visuospatial abilities. Behavioral anomalies can be mild (e.g. anxiety, mood 
instability) to severe (e.g. aggressive behavior, autism). Autistic -like behavior can inc lude hand 
flapping, poor eye contact, hand biting, gaze avoidance, social phobia, social and communication 
deficits and tactile defensiveness. In females, intellectual and behavioral disorders are typically 
milder than in males  and usually consist of shyne ss, social and other forms of anxiety, and variable  
learning problems, with IQ ranging from normal to intellectually impaired. About  25% of girls have 
an IQ less than 70. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is present in over 89% of males 
and 3 0% of females and behavioral disinhibition is very common. Recurrent otitis media (50%) and 
seizures (1 2%) can also be observed. Individuals with FXS display a range of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms including intellectual disability, delayed language acquisiti on, poor social interaction, 
features of autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, hyperarousal, hypersensitivity, repetitive behaviors, 
disrupted sleep, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and irritability/aggression .3 These behavioral 
changes are modelled in adult male Fmr1  knockout (KO) mice which display a spectrum of 
behavioral phenotypes due to the Fmr1 gene deletion. The mutant mice show hyperarousal in the 
open field test, have impaired social interaction, are less likely to build nests when provided cotton 
batting and are less likely to bury marbles in the cage bedding. Adult male mice have been  used for 
most  studies with animal models, as male FXS patients typically suffer more severe symptoms than 
do female patients due to the single X chromosome. In both humans with FXS `and the Fmr1 KO 
mice, there are alterations in the density, size, shape and mat urity of dendritic spines, the principle 
recipients of excitatory inputs from other neurons .1 
 
Efforts to treat FXS have included numerous investigations have not been widely successful, which 
has led to revision of trial designs and exploration for additi onal and new therapies.3 Management 
of FXS is currently symptom -based and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Speech, physical and 
sensory integration therapy as well as individualized educational plans and behavioral interventions 
may be combined with medication, such as stimulants for attention deficit -hyperactivity disorder; 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety, depression, obsessive -compulsive

 disorder; and atypical antipsychotic agents for self -injury and aggressive behaviors.  New targeted 
treatments for FXS are being studied. Despite this slow progress, treatment of FXS remains still an 
unmet medical need.  
 
3.2 Rationale  
FXS is a disorder in which affected individuals display intellectual disability as well as symptoms 
typical of autism spectrum disorder, due to silencing of the X -linked, FMR1  gene.  
 
Two previously untested products in FXS were predicted in silico  to have beneficial activity in FXS 
and proposed for in vivo  follow -up in Fmr1 KO mice, namely ergoloid  mesylates (E M) and 5-
hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ). Both agents showed an interesting polypharmacological predicted 
bioactivity spectrum, which is a necessity for complex disorders, such as FXS. The most strongly 
associated targets after the statistical enric hment were HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2 and OPRM1 for 
EM, and ESR1, HTR1A, GRIA1, and GRIK1 for 5-HTP . Both products worked in the majority of 
tests in vivo  in the Fmr1  KO mouse model (see below Section 3.3.1 Preclinical Pharmacology), 
which led to the hypothesis th at their serotonergic action would be additive, whilst the diversity in 
target and pathway modulation could indeed produce some synergistic effect, which was also 
confirmed in vivo , leading to the alleviation of all FXS phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse.  
 
3.3 Risk/Benefit  
3.3.1 Preclinical Pharmacology  
Preclinical in vivo  data are available for the suggested formulations and their combination. Blinded 
experiments were conducted to assess the effect of the two treatments and their combination in Fmr1  
KO mice ( Fmr1 gene deletion). Adult male mice were used for all experiment s. Fmr1 knockout mice 
recapitulate the human phenotype and represent a valuable preclinical model for assessment of 
putative drug treatments. The Fmr1  KO carries an insertion in exon 5.4 It is a protein null, although 
Fmr1  mRNA is still present.5 These mice have been backcrossed to the C57/Bl6 or the FVB strains. 
The Fmr1  KO2 is a null allele at  Fmr1  generated by deletion of the promoter and first exon of  Fmr1 .6 
It is both protein and mRNA null. This mutation is the same as  is produced by Cre -mediated excision 
of the loxP sites present in the Fmr1  cKO described below (we house these and other mice models 
of FXS).  According to literature, Fmr1  KO mice show alterations in the density, size, shape and 
maturity of dendritic spin es, the principle recipients of excitatory inputs from other neurons.1 
Toxicological information on the acute toxicity of 5 -HTP in animals are available7, as is the  
corresponding information for EM8. The treatment of the mice with 5 -HTP, EM was conducted 
according to the matrix shown below in Table 1.

 The behavioural  tests performed were for hyperactivity (open field), stereotypy (self -grooming), 
sociability (three chamber partition test), memory and learning (novel object recognition), anxiety 
(hyponeophagia), daily living (nest building) . Concise definitions follow below.  
One-way Analysis of Variance and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons against the KO group were 
performed suggesting that both treatments as well as their combination were significantly different 
from the KO group (adjusted p -value <0.0001) whilst the ac tual scoring across tests for both the 
treatments and their combination was similar to the WT group. Specifically , for all six tests, the 
treatment combination scoring measurements were found to be very similar to those provided for 
the WT group. Additiona l in vivo  experiments were conducted to assess the effect of SSRIs on 5-
HTP + EM treatment, specifically the standard of care SSRI Fluvoxamine was administered 
(40mg/kg) in another 10 diseased mice. Results confirmed that Fluvoxamine did not alter the 
effectiveness of 5-HTP + EM treatment (adjusted p -value<0.0001).

3.3.2 Clinical Experience  
Ergoloid Mesylates , trade name Hydergine , is a mixture of the methanesulfonate salts of three 
dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids , dihydroergocristine, dihydroergocornine, and alpha - and beta -
dihydroergocryptine.  Ergot alkaloids are dopamine agonists which activate dopamine rece ptors (in 
the basal ganglia and other parts of the brain involved in motor function) and a prolactin inhibitor. 
Ergot is a strong vasoconstrictor and thus helps to reduce bleeding by narrowing of the blood vessels.

 Ergot was perhaps first used in medicine as an oxytocic drug, to promote uterine contraction during 
childbirth . They have been used for treating migraine headaches since 1883 and also in treating 
Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, hyperprolactinemia and 
other purposes.9 
 
There have been 26 clinical drug trials which investigated the effectiveness of EM in geriatric 
psychopharmacology, with significant improvement in at least 50% of the studies in the areas of 
cognitive dysfunctions, mood depression, and the composite scores as measured by subjective 
clinical behavioral rating scales .10 Assessments of studies on the effect of EM in dementia have 
shown strong effects in Vascular Dementia but only a modest efficacy in Alzheimer’s Dementia, 
with a stronger potent ial on higher dosage ,11 as well as a statistically significant improvement on all 
ten components of the Sandoz Clinical Assessment -Geriatric scale .12 Olin et al.13 assessed its overall 
effects on patients with possible dementia, and showed significant trea tment effects. EM was found 
to be well tolerated in controlled studies of eld erly patients with age -related cognitive decline .14  
 
5-hydroxytryptophan, also known as 5-HTP  has a nutraceutical status and has never been approved 
as a drug for any indication,   but as a dietary supplement has been used extensively for several 
disorders for many years such as in the therapy of depression, fibromyalgia, obesity, insomnia and 
chronic headache. The starting dose is generally 50 mg, three times a day, which can be d oubled 
after a couple of weeks, if necessary.15 
 
Despite its relevance to L -tryptophan for which there are safety concerns, 5 -HTP has demonstrated 
a very good safety profile. In humans, 5 -HTP has been administered in combination with  SSRIs  
and  tricyclic  antidepressants,16,17 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)18,19,20 and tryptophan .21 
According to Turner and Blackwell,22 serotonin syndrome has not been reported in humans in 
association with 5 -HTP, either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications. In 
clinicaltrials.gov  (accessed on 5 Feb 2021 ) there are 8 registered clinical studies in phases 2 and 3 
involving 5 -HTP in one of the arms as a treatment for various indications such as major depressive 
disorder [ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] , spinal cord injuries [ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]  Crohn’s syndrome [ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ] 
and others.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a single center, Phase 2, single -blind, 4 period study to obtain preliminary assessment of the 
effects of ergoloid mesylates (EM), 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP ), and the combination in 
participants with Fragile X Syndrome. As schematic display of the study design is shown in Figure 
7.  
 
The study will consist of a Screening period of up to 28 days prior to initial study drug 
administration, followed by four 4 -week single -blind treatment periods.  The screening and baseline 
visits may occur at the same time, provided the results of safety labs can be obtained.  No washout 
period will be utilized between treatment periods. A final follow -up phone contact for safety  is 
planned one week after the conclusion of Period 4.  
 
Eligible participants will be started on over -encapsulated EM 1 mg TID during Period 1, the n will 
take EM 1 mg TID and 5 -HTP 100 mg TID in Period 2, then 5 -HTP 100 mg TID in Period 3, and 
placebo in Period 4. Throughout all 4 periods, participants will take two identical capsules three 
times a day. If only taking one over -encapsulated drug, they will take one over -encapsulated placebo 
pill with the drug at each dose, and wh en in period 4 they will take two over -encapsulated placebo 
pills at each dose.  
 
Cognitive and behavioral assessments will be performed during each clinic visit.  Safety and 
tolerability assessments throughout the study will include adverse event monitori ng, vital signs, 
blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis.

 EM label for elderly demented patients suggests 1 mg tablets , 3 times a day , according to the product 
label23. 5-HTP  label s commonly suggest 1 -4 tablets totaling 2 00mg per day, however for depression, 
most commonly, 150 -800 mg daily is taken for 2 -6 weeks .24 Given this range, as well as the duration 
of the study, 100mg TID is suggested for 5 -HTP.  
 
Furthermore, when compared to the mouse doses tested in vivo (2 mg/kg for EM and 40 mg/kg for 
5-HTP), if these are extrapolated to humans by allometric sca ling, i.e. assuming that metabolic rate 
scales proportionally to body weight raised to the ¾ power, the proposed doses of 1 and  100 mg 
TID for EM and 5 -HTP, respectively, are safely lower. Namely the 2 mg/kg mouse dose scales to 
about 20 mg daily dose for  a typical 70 kg male, while for 5 -HTP. a 40 mg/kg mouse dose scales to 
about 400 mg daily dose .25  
 
4.2 Study Duration  
The total duration of the study for each participant will be up to 21 weeks, including a maximum of 
a 4-week screening period, four 4 -week s ingle -blind Treatment Periods, and a follow -up call 
approximately 1 week after last treatment.

 5.4 Participant Withdrawal  
All participants have the right to withdraw from this study at any time.  In addition, it is the right of 
the Investigator to remove participants from the study as a result of adverse reactions, a protocol 
violation, or non -complian ce, or any other reason.  Participants must be discontinued for the 
following reasons:  
● Participant withdraws consent or requests discontinuation from the study for any reason;  
● Occurrence of a medical condition or circumstance that exposes the participant t o substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the participant to adhere to the requirements of the protocol as 
determined by the Investigator;  
● Any serious adverse event (SAE), clinical ly significant adverse event, severe laboratory 
abnormality, concomitant illn ess, or other medical condition which indicates to the Investigator 
that continued participation is not in the best interest of the participant;  
● Requirement for prohibited concomitant medication;  
● Termination of the study by the Sponsor or the regulatory au thority.  
 
Should a participant withdraw after administration of EM in Period 1, or should the Investigator 
decide to withdraw the participant, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol -
stipulated observations up to the time of withdrawal.  Week 16  procedures (see Section 10.3.5  and 
Section 1 4.1 Schedule of Study Assessments ) will be completed at the time of the participant’s 
withdrawal and an explanation provided as to why the participant is withdrawing or being withdrawn 
from the study.  
 
In a case of participants lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the participant must be made and 
documented in the participant’s medical records.  
 
The Investigator must document the primary re ason for discontinuation of a study participant on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF).  If the reason for withdrawal is a clinical AE, monitoring will 
continue until the AE resolves or the Investigator assesses the AE as chronic and stabilized.  
 
5.5 Replac ement of Participants  
Participants who do not meet eligibility criteria at Baseline will not receive any study drug and will 
be considered screen failures.  Participants who withdraw from the study for any reason will not be 
replaced.

available to the RUMC pharmacy are manufactured by Basic Vitamins .  All study medications and 
their matching placebos will be compounded and over-encapsulated at the Rush Oak Park 
Compounding Pharmacy.  
 
6.3 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designated study personnel will be responsible for keeping accurate records of  
the study drugs (and other components) used in this study.  These records will include documentation 
of receipt, inventory, and disposition to participant.  The records should include dates, quantities, 
batch/serial numbers, expiration dates (if applicabl e), and any unique code numbers assigned (if 
applicable).

In accordance with Good Pharmacy Practices, gloves will always be worn by study personnel when 
handling study drug.  
 
6.4 Blinding  
This is a single -blind study, meaning the participant and his family/caregivers will not know what 
drug or combination the participant is receiving. The investigator and study coordinator will know 
what drug the participant is taking. The remainder of the study team performing assessments such 
as the Vineland, eye tracking, ERP, Toolbox, and the KiTAP will not know the type of treatment the 
patient is on when testing is done.  
 
The PI or designee will be responsible for maintaining the single blind, consiste nt with protocol 
design, throughout the study, except in the case of an emergency need to unblind the participant for 
medical reasons. Blinding is not to be broken during the study unless considered necessary by the 
Investigator for emergency situations fo r reasons of participant safety. When the blind is broken, the 
reason must be fully documented.  
 
6.5 Study Drug Administration  
Two capsules will be taken orally in the morning, afternoon and evening. Doses should be taken at 
least 4 hours apart.

 6.6 Prior and Co ncomitant Medications  
A prior medication is defined as any psychotropic or anti -epileptic medication taken by the 
participant for more than 28 days during the 6 months prior to first dose of study drug (Day 1), which 
was subsequently discontinued within th at same 6 month period.  
 
A concomitant medication is defined as any medication taken 14 days prior to the first dose of study 
drug (Day 1) and during the study through the Week 14 Follow -up Visit. Concomitant medications 
should be recorded with indication,  daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration.  
 
Current treatment with no more than 3 prescribed psychotropic medications is allowed. Anti -
epileptic medications are permitted and are not counted as psychotropic medications if they are used 
for tr eatment of seizures. Anti -epileptics for other indications, such as the treatment of mood 
disorders, count towards the limit of three permitted medications. Permitted concomitant 
psychotropic medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for at l east 2 weeks prior to 
the commencement of study medication.  
 
Anti-epileptic medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for 12 weeks prior to 
Screening and must remain stable during the period between Screening and the commencement of 
study med ication.  
 
6.7 Other Therapeutic Treatments  
Behavioral and therapy treatments/interventions must be stable for 4 weeks prior to Screening and 
must remain stable during the period between Screening and the commencement of study 
medication, and throughout the stu dy. 
 
6.8 Dietary Guidelines  
There are no dietary restrictions. Participants should follow their usual eating behaviors.  
 
6.9 Lifestyle Guidelines  
There no lifestyle restrictions or guidelines associated with this study.  
 
7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the CFRs (21 CFR § 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312 Subpart 
D), which originate from the ethical principles l aid down in the current revision of the Declaration 
of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP),26,27 and the policies and procedures as outlined by the 
ethical requirements for IRB review and informed consent form.   
 
7.1 Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained prior to the participant entering into the study and before any 
protocol -directed procedures are performed.  
 
7.2 Medical /Surgical History  
Medical/Surgical history will be recorded at the Screening Visit as specified in Section 10.2 . 
Participant eligibility will be evaluated to determine all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria 
are met. The Investigator will inquire with the participant on Period 1/Day 1 (Baseline, prior to 
ORA: 21051102-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 9/1/2021   Amendment Date: 6/13/2022

 randomization)  to determine if there have been any changes in the participants’ s  health affecting 
eligibility or requiring an update to their medical and surgical history.  
 
7.3 Demographics and Social History  
Demographics (sex, ethnicity, race) and social history (tobacco,  alcohol, and/or drug use) will be 
recorded at the Screening Visit as specified in the Schedule of Assessments . 
 
7.4 Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale  
The Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale – Version 5 will be administered at Scree ning in order to 
support characterization of the study cohort and to determine whether cognitive and behavioral 
responses are dependent on baseline level of cognitive functioning. The scale will be scored 
according to the Hessl z -deviation method to preven t floor effects .28  
 
7.5 Physical Examination (Full and Abbreviated)  
The full physical examination will be conducted at the Screening as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments  and will include:  
● General appearance  
● Skin 
● Eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT)  
● Head/neck  
● Extremities  
● Musculoskeletal e xamination  
● Respiratory examination  
● Cardiovascular assessment including rhythm and presence of cardiac abnormalities  
● Abdominal examination  
● Basic neurologic examination  
● Any additional assessments necessary to establish baseline status or evaluate symptoms o r 
adverse experiences  
 
An abbreviated physical examination will be conducted at Period 1/Day 1 (if not the same day as 
Screening) and at the visit at the end of each Period and will include:  
● Any changes noted since the initial physical examination  
● General appearance  
● Skin 
● Extremities  
● Respiratory examination  
● Cardiovascular assessment including rhythm and presence of cardiac abnormalities  
● Abdominal examination  
 
Significant findings prior to the start of dosing will be recorded on the Medica l History page of the 
CRF.  Only changes from baseline physical examination findings that meet the definition of a 
treatment -emergent AE will be recorded as an AE.  
 
7.6 Height, Weight, Body Mass Index  
Body weight and height are to be measured at Screening.  B ody weight will be repeated at the visit 
at the end of each Period as specified in the Schedule of Assessments .  Participants will wear indoor 
ORA: 21051102-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 9/1/2021   Amendment Date: 6/13/2022

Page 23 of 42 
 clothing and remove their shoes prior to the measurements.  Body Mass Index (BMI) w ill be 
calculated and recorded.   
 
7.7 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature) will be measured at 
Screening, during the Treatment Visits, and Follow -Up as specified in the Schedule of Assessments . 
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured using a calibrated, fully automated machine with a 
cuff that is appropriate to the size of the upper arm.  If a fully automated machine is not available, 
blood pressure may be measured manually .  For each participant, measurement on the same arm 
(right or left) using the same method (either automated or manual) should occur throughout the 
study.   All blood pressure measurements should be obtained with the participant in the sitting 
position, af ter the participant is at rest for 5 minutes.  
 
Additional vital signs measurements may be performed as deemed medically necessary by the 
Investigator.  
 
7.8 Laboratory Assessments  
Appendix 1 4.2 Clinical Laboratory Analytes  provides a list of the clinical laboratory tests that will 
be performed according to the collection schedule provided in the Schedule of Assessments .   
Blood samples for chemistry and hematology and urine samples will be coll ected in accordance with 
acceptable laboratory procedures.   
 
Since this is a single -site study, an accredited local laboratory will be used to analyze the clinical 
laboratory samples.  
 
7.9 Management of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Tests  
It is the Investigato r’s responsibility to review the results of all lab tests as they become available 
and to document their review by signing and dating the lab report.  For each lab test outside of the 
laboratory normal range, the Investigator must ascertain if this is a cl inically significant change from 
baseline for the individual participant.  This determination does not necessarily need to be made the 
first time an abnormal lab is observed.  The Investigator may repeat the lab test or request additional 
tests to verify t he results of the original lab test.  
 
All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the study that were not present 
at baseline should be followed and evaluated with additional tests if necessary, until determination 
of the underlyin g cause or adverse event resolution.  
 
7.10 Additional Safety Measures  
Participants and caregivers will be instructed to inform the study physician and/or research personnel 
of any AEs, including significant behavioral changes not within the typical variation for the 
participant, that occur at any time during the study.  
 
Procedures will be completed as specified in this protocol unless contraindicated due to a reported 
AE. 
 
ORA: 21051102-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 9/1/2021   Amendment Date: 6/13/2022

Date:  23 May 2022  v4.0    
Page 24 of 42 
 If, in the judgement of the Investigator, additional testing is required to assess an adverse event or 
otherwise clinically significant event, this testing should be discussed first with the sponsor unless 
needed urgently.   
 
7.11 Exploratory Efficacy Assessmen ts 
7.11.1  Descriptions of Efficacy Assessment Instruments  
Several assessment tools for cognitive and behavioral measures will be utilized in this exploratory 
study.  Raw scores (not standardized) will be collected for all assessments, except for the Vineland 
-3 composites where age -equivalent scores will also be collected.  
 
7.11.1.1  NIH -TCB  
The NIH -TCB, a component of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral 
Function, was developed by a  team of more than 300 scientists  from nearly 100 academic institutions 
as part of the  NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research  to standardize evaluations in specific clinical 
populations for investigations of neurological development and change, disease recovery, and 
therapeutic interventions.29,30,31 The NIH -TCB is a battery of extensively validated computer -
administered cognitive tests with utility across childhood and adolescence, early adu lthood, and old 
age. The NIH -TCB assessments were designed to minimize floor and ceiling effects which often are 
present in testing batteries designed for the general population. Downward extensions of many of 
the NIH -TCB tests have been created to allow f easibility down to a mental age of 3. Therefore, there 
is good reason to believe that the assessments are appropriate for individuals with intellectual 
disabilities. In fact, a pilot study has been published showing good feasibility and test -retest 
reliabi lity in FXS and Down syndrome, and the instructions and testing protocol has been adjusted 
(without changing construct validity) for individuals with intellectual disabilities based on issues 
identified in the pilot study.32 Further validation of the adjusted measure was published 
subsequently.33 
 
The NIH -TCB includes 7 evaluations: Dimensional change card sort test (DCCS, measure of 
cognitive flexibility), Flanker inhibitory control and attention test (measure of inhibition and visual 
attention), Picture sequence memory test (measures episodic memory), List sorting working memory 
test (measures immediate recall and sequencing of different visually and orally presented stimuli), 
Pattern comparison t est (measures processing speed), Oral reading recognition test (measures 
recognition of letters and words), Picture vocabulary test (measures receptive vocabulary).  
 
7.11.1.2  Test of Attentional Performance (KiTAP)  
The KiTAP is a computerized executive function bat tery that consists of eight nonverbal subtests 
measuring different basal as well as higher -order components of attention and executive 
functioning.34  Each subtest can be assessed separately. Four subtests will be utilized in this study: 
alertness, distractibility, go -nogo, and flexibility. To ensure optimal motivation and compliance, all 
subtests are designed in the form of short games with an enchanted castle theme.  The four subtests 
chosen for use in this study have been uti lized in FXS populations and shown to be feasible, 
reproducible with evidence of clinical validity when scores are compared with standardized 
behavioral questionnaires addressing relevant functions. The KiTAP has shown evidence of 
response to pharmacologic al intervention in clinical trials of AFQ056 and metadoxine in FXS.35,36

Date:  23 May 2022  v4.0    
Page 25 of 42 
 7.11.1.3  Clinical Global Impression  
The CGI -I (and CGI -S) are gold standard global measures of severity and change with treatment in 
placebo -controlled pharmaco therapy trials in developmental disabilities and have been used 
extensively in prior clinical trials in FXS .37,38  
 
7.11.1.3.1   Clinical Global Impression Severity: Investigator Rated (CGI -S) 
The Clinical Global Impression−Severity (CGI -S) is a global measure to provide a clinical judgment 
of a participant’s overall condition based on a trained clinician’s assessment of cognition, behavior 
and activities of daily living .39 The assessm ent of severity will be made with a 7 -point scale: 1, not 
ill; 2, very mild;  3, mild; 4, moderate; 5, marked; 6, severe;  7, extremely severe. The comparison 
will be made with respect to the overall experience of the clinician with individuals of the same  age 
and sex.  
 
7.11.1.3.2   Clinical Global Impression Improvement: Investigator –Rated (CGI -I) 
The Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI -I) assessment is a 7 -point scale that requires 
the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or  worsened relative to a 
baseline state at the beginning of the intervention, and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much 
improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very 
much worse .39 
 
Completion of this scale requires the clinician to rate how much the participant’s illness (including 
behavioral and adaptive functioning) has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state.  The 
CGI-I must be administered by the same rater for a gi ven participant at all applicable visits 
throughout the trial.  
   
7.11.1.4   VAS Rating Scale  
In an attempt to measure the level of behavioral difficulty experienced by the parent/caregiver with 
respect to the child with FXS, the VAS will allow parents to mark on a  visual line measuring 10 cm 
with one side marked “worst behavior” and the other side marked “best behavior.”  The caregiver 
will rate the participant’s behavior with respect to three domains: daily functioning, 
anxiety/irritability and language; with guid ance form the investigator, the caregiver will select a 
behavior that is a problem affecting function within each domain that will be assessed throughout 
the study. The horizontal marks are measured in centimeter distance where they call from the “good 
behavior” side so that improvements or worsening of behavior over the treatment period can be 
evaluated. The VAS has been successfully used in multiple clinical trials conducted in the FXS 
population .40 The caregiver completing the assessment should remain the same at all applicable visits 
throughout the trial.  
 
7.11.1.5  Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)  
The Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community Edition (ABC) is a 58 -item parent/caregiver rating 
scale used to assess behaviors across five dimensions or subscal es: irritability, hyperactivity, 
lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypy, and inappropriate speech.41 Items are evaluated on a four -point 
Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all a problem) to 3 (the problem is severe in degree).  This scale 
has been used extensively in FXS in clinical trials and other projects. The ABC will be scored using 
the FXS -specific factoring system (ABC -FX). The caregiver completing the assessment should 
remain the same at all applicable visits throughout the tr ial.

Date:  23 May 2022  v4.0    
Page 26 of 42 
 7.11.1.6  Anxiety Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS)  
The ADAMS (Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale) is a 28 -item behavior -based informant 
instrument rated by the parent/caregiver and designed to assess anxiety, depression and mood 
disorders in individuals with intellectual disability .42 Items are rated on a scale of 0 (“behavior has 
not occurred, or is not a problem”) to 3 (“behavior occurs a lot, or is a severe problem”). The scale 
is composed of 5 factors which address: Manic/Hype ractive Behavior, Depressed Mood, Social 
Avoidance, General Anxiety and Obsessive/Compulsive Behavior. A caregiver identified upon 
enrollment of participant should have intimate knowledge of the participant’s situation and level of 
impairment to be able to  provide accurate information as required to complete the ADAMS. The 
caregiver completing the assessment should remain the same at all applicable visits throughout the 
trial. 
 
7.11.1.7  Vineland -3 Rating Scale  
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vi neland -3)43 assesses adaptive behavior in 
five domains, each with subdomains:  
1. Communication  
o Subdomains: Receptive, Expressive, Written  
2. Daily Living Skills  
o Subdomains: Personal, Domestic, Community  
3. Socialization  
o Subdomains: Interpersonal Relationships, Play and Leisure, Coping Skills  
4. Motor Skills  
o Subdomains: Fine Motor, Gross Motor  
5. Maladaptive Behavior  
o Internalizing, Externalizing, Critical Items  
 
The Vineland -3 will be administered as a standardized interview to a parent/caregiver by trained 
study staff trained and authorized to perform the interview. The Vineland -3 must be administered 
by the same rater for a given participant at all applicable visits throughout the trial. The caregiver 
completing the assessment wi th the study staff member should also remain the same at all applicable 
visits throughout the trial.  
 
7.11.1.8  Event -Related Potentials (ERP)  
Event -Related Potentials (ERPs) enable extraction of neural responses associated with specific 
sensory, cognitive, or motor events from an overall EEG.44,45 Auditory stimuli are presented and 
EEG events assessed in relation to timing of the stimuli. For this study, an ERP protocol developed 
to measure resting state delta and alp ha power, alpha responses to eye closure, CHIRP responses ,46 
and processing of oddball stimuli relative to standards47 will be used. This protocol has shown 
feasibility in prior studies . The EEGs will be read by Dr. Lauren Ethridge who has developed 
multip le ERP protocol s and has extensive experience in ERP evaluation.  
 
7.11.1.9  Eye Tracking   
Eye tracking has been successfully used to assess social gaze in FXS .48 Testing will be conducted in 
a quiet room with the lights turned off. The  eye tracker (Tobii) will be calibrated for each participant 
at the beginning of each session. Following calibration, participants will view pictures shown on the 
screen. Each assessment begins with presentation of a scrambled face image for 1  s followed 
immediately by its matched face image for 3  s. An inter -trial interval (ITI) containing a uniform grey

Page 27 of 42 
 screen is shown for 0.5, 1, or 2  s, randomly determined. The order of face presentation is 
pseudorandomized and each eye tracking session lasts approximat ely 6  min. Measurements include 
looking time to the eye region of interest (ROI), and number of fixations to the eye ROI, as well as 
pupil dilatation by pupilometry. These measurements have been shown to have good test -retest 
reproducibility. All measureme nts are analyzed offline by a trained specialist.  
 
7.11.2  Timing of Efficacy Assessments

8 EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatm ent. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the 
investig ational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, 
complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
 
Adverse events, which include abnormal and clinically significant clinical laboratory test varia bles, 
will be monitored and documented from the time Informed Consent until study participation is 
ORA: 21051102-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 9/1/2021   Amendment Date: 6/13/2022

Date:  23 May 2022  v4.0    
Page 28 of 42 
 complete (the Follow -up Visit). Participants should be instructed to report any adverse event that 
they experience to the Investigator. Beginning with the si gning of the informed consent until the 
time of the first dose of study drug, investigators should make updates to medical history and record 
any pre -existing medical condition or signs or symptoms that changes in severity, frequency, or 
seriousness in the  medical history. Serious adverse events that occur prior to the first dose of study 
drug should be reported as an update to medical history as well as be reported on the appropriate 
adverse event CRF.  
 
Beginning with the first dose of study drug, investi gators should make an assessment for adverse 
events at each visit and record all adverse events, non -serious and serious, on the appropriate adverse 
event CRF.  
 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the CRF. However, if an observed 
or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the 
Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate adverse e vent on the CRF. Additionally, the 
condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure. Concomitant procedures 
should be recorded as su ch on the appropriate CRF.  
 
Any medical condition already present prior to the participant taking the first dose of study drug 
should be reported in the medical history. Any SAEs occurring prior to the first dose of study drug 
should be reported as an upd ate to medical history as well as an adverse event. Any pre -existing 
medical condition or signs or symptoms that changes in severity, frequency, or seriousness after the 
participant takes the first dose of study drug and through the Follow -up Visit should be reported as 
an adverse event.  
 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or other examinations (e.g., ECG) that are detected 
after the first dose of study drug and worsen during the study should be reported as adverse events. 
An abnormal laborat ory result that is not verified by repeat testing does not necessitate reporting as 
an adverse event. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical, scientific, and clinical judgment 
in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will 
be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any 
abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event.  
Treatment of any adverse reactions will be evaluated and managed by a physician.  
 
8.2 Definitions  
8.2.1 Adverse Drug Reaction  
For adverse events with a causal relationship to study drug, follow -up by the Investigator will be 
required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize to a level acceptable to the Investigator.  
 
8.2.2 Unexpected Adverse Event/ Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reactio n is an AE or suspected adverse reaction 
that is not listed in the Investigator Brochure  or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed; or, if an Investigator Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
ORA: 21051102-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 9/1/2021   Amendment Date: 6/13/2022

Date:  23 May 2022  v4.0    
Page 29 of 42 
 risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, 
as amended.  
 
8.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it res ults in any of the following outcomes:  
● Death;  
● A life -threatening adverse event;  
● NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediat e risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
● Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations;  
NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least one overnight stay will be  considered an 
inparticipant hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not 
be recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or 
prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as 
adverse events and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or 
situational reasons (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will 
not be considered inparticipant hospitalizations.  
● A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
● A congenital anomaly/birth defect ; or 
● An important medical event.  
NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant and ma y require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsion s that do not result in in  participant hospitalizations, or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
8.3.1 Causality/Relatedness  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed by the 
Investigator according to the following definitions:  
 
Not Related  (unlikely related, unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal 
relationship and/or another cause (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapies, and 
complications) is suspected.  
 
Related  (possibly related, related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and 
the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other 
cause (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapies, and complications) can be identified.  
 
ORA: 21051102-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 9/1/2021   Amendment Date: 6/13/2022
Protocol:  ERG/5 -HTP in FXS        
Date:  23 May 2022  v4.0    
Page 30 of 42 
 The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a cau sal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.   
 
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - The event should occur after the 
study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant diseases (medical history) -  Each report should be evaluated in 
the co ntext of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other 
disease the participant may have.  
• Concomitant drug - The other drugs the participant is taking or the treatment the 
participant receives should be examined to determine whet her any of them might be 
recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - Clinical and/or preclinical data may 
indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - The known pharmacologic properties 
(absorption, d istribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be 
considered.  
 
8.3.2 Severity  
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, 
moderate, or severe according to the following definitions:  
 
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate  – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe  – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
It should be noted that a severe AE need not be serious and that a serious adverse event (SAE) need 
not, by definition, be severe.  
8.3.3 Adverse Event Monitoring and Fo llow-up 
Participants who experience AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory 
tests, as determined by the Investigator.  In accordance with good medical practice, all AEs must be 
followed to satisfactory resolution or stabiliz ation of the event(s), or, if a chronic condition, until 
fully characterized.  Any actions taken and follow -up results must be recorded either on the 
appropriate page of the CRF, as well as in the participant’s source documentation.  Follow -up 
laboratory r esults should be filed with the participant’s source documentation.   
 
For all AEs that require the participant to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final reso lution or 
stabilization of the event(s).

 10 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 Sample Size  
Given th e exploratory nature of this study, a definitive sample size calculation is not possible.  
 
10.2 Demographics  
Summary statistics [number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum] 
will be tabulated for the observed values for all continuous demographic parameters.  Frequencies 
and percentages will be tabulated for categorical data.  
 
10.3 Analysis Populations  
The primary efficacy population will be the intent to treat (ITT) efficacy population, which will 
include all randomized participa nts who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at 
least one follow -up visit. The completers population (CP), defined as all randomized participants 
who completed all treatment periods with no significant protocol violations, will be used to evaluate 
the robustness of the ITT results.  
 
The Safety population will include all randomized participants who received at least one dose of 
study treatment.  
 
10.4 Efficacy: Cognitive, Behavioral and Pharmocodynamic Measures Analysis  
All cognitive and beha vioral parameters will be summarized at each time point collected and 
standard descriptive statistics provided. Baseline measurements are defined as those obtained on 
Day 1/Period 1 prior to receipt of any study medication.  For cognitive parameters measur ed at 
baseline, change from baseline will also be calculated and standard descriptive statistics provided 
for each time point.  
 
10.5 Safety Analysis  
Safety analysis will be based on all participants receiving at least one dose of study medication.  
Treatment em ergent AEs will be summarized based on the frequency of AEs and their severity for 
all dosed participants.  Adverse Events (AEs), including clinically meaningful laboratory 
abnormalities and significant behavioral changes, will collected. AE severity and r elatedness to 
treatment will be assessed. AEs will be tabulated for placebo and BPN14770 treatments using 
preferred terms and system organ classes. Summaries will also be provided by severity and 
relationship to treatment. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) wil l be summarized separately, in a 
manner similar to that used for Adverse Events.  
 
Overall safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical and/or statistical review of all safety 
parameters including adverse experiences, laboratory values, vital signs,  physical exams, and ECG 
data.  General clinical and laboratory adverse events will be presented in frequency tables.  Summary 
statistics (n, mean, SD, median, and range (minimum, maximum) will be tabulated for the observed 
values and the change (or percen t change) from baseline for all continuous parameters for vital signs 
and laboratory tests.

 informed consent, participant recruitmen t materials (if applicable), and other documentation as 
required by the IRB to their IRB for review and approval.   
 
The study site will adhere to all requirements stipulated by their respective IRB.  This includes 
notification to the IRB regarding: protoc ol amendments, updates to the participant informed consent, 
recruitment materials intended for viewing by participants, serious and unexpected AEs, reports and 
updates regarding the ongoing review of the trial at intervals specified by the respective IRB, and 
submission of final summaries to IRB.  
 
The Investigator will promptly inform his/her IRB of all unexpected SAEs considered possibly 
related to the treatment or other critical safety information reported by the clinical site.  
 
12.3 Informed Consent  
The infor med consent form (ICF) and any changes to the ICF made during the course of the study 
must be agreed to by the IRB prior to its use and must be in compliance with all ICH GCP, provisions 
specified in 21 CFR §50, and applicable pertinent state and federal r equirements.  
 
The Investigator, or a person delegated the responsibility by the Investigator, will ensure that each 
study participant (or legally acceptable representative) is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation and must ensure that the 
participant has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The Investigator or delegate will allow 
the participant adequate opportunity to read the written informed consent and ask any questions. The 
Investigator will obtain written informed consent from each participant before any study -specific 
activity is performed and should document in the source documentation that consent was obtained 
prior to any study -specific activity. The original signed copy  of the ICF must be maintained by the 
Investigator and is participant to inspection by the IRB/EC and/or regulatory agencies. A copy of 
the signed ICF will be given to the participant.  
 
12.4 Record Storage and Retention

regulatory documents, and other Sponsor correspondence pertaining to the study must be kept in the 
appropriate study files at the site. Source data is defined as all information in origina l records and 
certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical 
study necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study. Source data are contained 
in source documents (original re cords or certified copies). These records will be retained in a secure 
file for 10 years, prior to transfer or destruction of the records.  
 
The Investigator will keep records, including the identity of all participating participants (sufficient 
information  to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed ICFs, copies of all 
CRFs, SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records 
should be retained by the Investigator according to specifications in the ICH guidelines or local 
regulations. If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the 
study records will be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another Investigator.  
 
12.5 Protocol Amendments and Deviations

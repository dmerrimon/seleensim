 Title: Treatment of unfavorable bleeding patterns in contraceptive implant users: a randomized 1 clinical trial of curcumin 2  3 PI: Alison Edelman, MD, MPH 4 Oregon Health & Science University 5 3181 SW Sam Jackson, UHN 50 6 Portland, OR 97239 7 503-418-2585 8 edelmana@ohsu.edu 9  10 Co-I: Jeffrey Jensen, MD, MPH 11 Marci Messerle Forbes, FNP 12 Andrea O’Donnell, FNP 13  14 Funder: Investigator initiated 15  16 Background: 17 The etonogestrel (ENG) subdermal contraceptive implant (ENG implant) is a highly effective 18 method of preventing pregnancy, but it has bleeding side effects that make it unappealing for 19 many women. Given that the ENG implant is 20 times more effective at pregnancy prevention 20 than oral contraceptive pills, strategies to increase its acceptability will translate into improved 21 prevention of unplanned pregnancies [1].  Many medications have been studied with progestin-22 only contraceptives such as the ENG implant to manage irregular bleeding.  Concurrent use of 23 oral contraceptives (OCs) with the implant does stop bleeding but bleeding returns when OCs 24 are stopped [2, 3]. The only study to demonstrate a sustained reduction in bleeding lasting for 25 two months was the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen in users of the 26 levonogestrel (LNG) contraceptive implant [4].  We conducted a small clinical trial to evaluate 27 the effects of a 7-day course of tamoxifen in users of Nexplanon© with bothersome 28 breakthrough bleeding, and demonstrated that tamoxifen treatment reduces bleeding/spotting 29 days during the first 30 days after use as compared to placebo [5]. Recently, we successfully 30 completed a study that expanded on our original tamoxifen work and found similar results over a 31 90-day time period (Merck IIS, paper under development).  32  33 We have proven that tamoxifen is a successful strategy to stop breakthrough bleeding in implant 34 users but providers and patients do have concerns about this particular drug since it is used for 35 cancer.  Tamoxifen also has a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with 36 continuous use in a menopausal population. Healthly reproductive-age woman with short-term 37 exposure to tamoxifen have not been shown to have a risk of VTE but the concern is still 38 present as well as the stigma that it is a ‘cancer’ drug. If another agent without these concerns 39 could be found to improve bleeding in implant users then this drug might be more widely 40 adopted. 41  42 The exact mechanism of progestin-induced bleeding is unknown but it is likely multi-factorial 43 with the end result of angiogenesis, ‘leaky’ fragile vasculature, and inflammation. Curcumin, the 44 active ingredient in turmeric, has been demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, 45 and anti-angiogenic which may make it an ideal agent for the management of break-through 46 bleeding. The FDA has determined curcumin is safe and categorizes it as ‘generally regarded 47 as safe’ (GRAS).  Studies have demonstrated that curcumin is extremely well-tolerated. 48 Curcumin has a significant body of evidence as an adjunct treatment in patients with cancer, 49 cardiovascular disease and auto-immune/inflammatory conditions. In terms of women’s health, 50 curcumin was better than placebo in a randomized control trial in attenuating the severity of 51

  103 The intervention will consist of study drug exposure (curcumin or placebo) daily for 30 days. The 104 first dose will be taken at the start of enrollment if the subject is on the 3rd day of active bleeding 105 or if not bleeding, on day 3 of the next bleeding episode.  The study will be conducted at Oregon 106 Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon  107  108 Each subject’s involvement will be up to approximately 60 days as study drug will not be 109 initiated at the time of enrollment unless they are experiencing bleeding/spotting that day and 110 the two prior days to enrollment.  Study drug will be started on the 3rd day of an active bleeding 111 episode. If no active bleeding episodes happen in the first 30 days from enrollment then the 112 participant will be withdrawn from the study. The study will require up to 3 in-person study visits 113 [screening (V1), enrollment (V2), and a close out visit or study exit (V3)], as well as a daily 114 response to a text or email message about bleeding and use of study medication. Additional 115 phone and email contact may occur with the participant to ensure clarity of diary entry or 116 completion or to ensure drug initiation and compliance.  The electronic diary only takes a few 117 seconds to complete..  118  119 Eligibility: 120 Inclusion:  121 • English speaking women 15-45 years of age currently using the ENG implant who have 122 experienced frequent or prolonged bleeding while using the device:  123 o To be eligible, women will need to have >7 days of continuous bleeding/spotting 124 in the last 30 days, OR 2 or more episodes of bleeding/spotting in the last 30 125 days.  126 • Implant use for at least 30 days prior to screening visit.   127 • Willing to continue using the implant for at least 30 days from study enrollment.  128 • Access to a reliable cell phone and must be willing to receive and respond to a daily text 129 or email message to assess bleeding and use of study drug   130 • Implant must be palpable to prove that an ENG implant is in place at time of screening 131 and enrollment. 132 • Negative gonorrhea/chlamydia screening performed at screening visit 133  134 Exclusion criteria:  135 • Postpartum within six months 136 • Post-abortion within six weeks 137 • Currently pregnant 138 • Currently breast-feeding (to be eligible, must be 4-6 weeks from cessation of 139 breastfeeding) 140 • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding pre-dating placement of contraceptive implant 141 • Bleeding dyscrasia 142 • Anticoagulation use 143 • Active cervicitis 144 • Allergy to curcumin or turmeric  145 • History of venous thromboembolism 146 • Current or past breast or uterine malignancy 147 • Use of P450 pathway inducing drug 148 • Implant is due to be switched out in 2 months or less from enrollment  149 • Currently using oral contraceptives in addition to implant (to be eligible, needs to have a 150 4-6 week washout period) 151

 • Prior pregnancy occurred while Nexplanon/Implanon was in place 152    153 Study procedures 154  155 Screening (Visit 1, V1). Estimated 1 hour 156 Eligibility and study consent will be signed at this visit. Baseline demographic information will be 157 collected by interview, including menstrual history, contraception history including timing of 158 implant placement, sexual and pregnancy history, BMI/weight, ethnicity, age, and baseline use 159 of panty liners (as advised by Mishell et al 2007 to avoid confounding data on bleeding/spotting 160 days).  A series of questions will be asked to quantify number of bleeding and spotting days and 161 frequency and duration of bleeding episodes over the preceding three months of implant use (or 162 since placement, if less than three months).  Current implant use will be confirmed via palpation.  163  164 Physical exam including blood pressure check, pelvic examination, urine pregnancy test, 165 cervical cytology evaluation (if not completed within the ASCCP recommended screening 166 interval), and testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia.  A baseline assessment of satisfaction with 167 baseline bleeding pattern will also be performed.  168  169 Once negative results from the subject’s gonorrhea and chlamydia testing are demonstrated, 170 visit 2 can be scheduled (enrollment). 171  172 Enrollment (V2), estimated 30 minutes 173 This visit could be combined with the screening visit. Randomization for part 1 of the study will 174 occur at this visit. Pregnancy test and blood pressure will be performed. The Subject Study Drug 175 Information Handout will be provided and explained. Study drug will be provided.  Subject will 176 only start study drug at this visit if they are experiencing an active bleeding episode and this is 177 the 3rd day of bleeding/spotting. Study coordinator will instruct how to start tracking bleeding via 178 text message. Subjects will receive training on the use of the electronic bleeding diary 179 procedures.  This includes instruction on use of the text or email message bleeding diary.  180  181 End of study (V3), estimated 30 minutes 182 The final visit will take place approximately 90 days after enrollment or at the time of study 183 withdrawal/exit.  Repeat STI testing only if indicated by a change in partners during the study.  184 Vital signs will be performed and a review of bleeding diary, medications, AEs, and health 185 changes.  A short satisfaction questionnaire will be performed. Participation is complete after 186 this visit.  Unused study drug will be retuned at these visits.   187  188 Visit Details Visit 1-Screening • Informed consent • Review medications • Confirm implant use • Physical exam with vitals (blood pressure, pulse, weight, height)  • Urine pregnancy test • Review eligibility criteria • Gonorrhea and chlamydia test • Pap (if indicated) • Baseline questionnaire

 Visit 2– enrollment   • Review bleeding diary with staff • Review medications • Vitals (blood pressure, pulse, weight, height) • Confirm implant use • Receive placebo or study drug and instructions • Review any health changes Visit 3- end of study • Urine pregnancy test if indicated • Repeat Gonorrhea and chlamydia test if change in partner occurs during study. • Review medications • Return any unused medication • Vitals (blood pressure, pulse, weight, height) • Confirm implant use • Review bleeding diary with staff • Review health changes • Exit questionnaire  189 Description of intervention/study drug 190 Participants will be instructed to begin use of the study medication daily. A study coordinator 191 (SC) will prospectively follow electronic bleeding diaries at a minimum of three times weekly for 192 each individual study subject to ensure data integrity and correct day of drug initiation. Any 193 unused study drug will be counted and returned at the conclusion of the study.  194  195 Failure to complete the texting diary will prompt a phone call or email from the SC. If we are 196 unable to reach a subject by phone, email, letter  over a 2-week time period, their participation 197 will be terminated. Any data obtained up to this point will be analyzed in accordance to with 198 intention to treat. 199  200 Study procedures and data collection other than side effects and AEs will last 30-days from 201 enrollment.  202  203 Compensation 204 Participants will be compensated up to $250 for their participation in this study. Study visit 205 compensation breakdown is as follows: 206 • Visit 1- Screening:                           $50 207 • Visit 2- Enrollment:                          $50 208 • Visit 3- Study end                            $50 209 • Diary Completion:                            $100 210  211 Subjects will only be compensated for the visits they complete. For example, if a subject 212 withdraws after visit 2, they will only be compensated for those two visits ($50 + $50).  213 Diary compensation 214 Diary completion is defined as responding to 1 daily text message per day. A subject can miss 215 up to 2 days of responses in the up to 60-day study period and still receive diary compensation. 216 If a subject misses 3 or more days of diary entry in a given 30 days, they will not receive this 217

 compensation. Study coordinators will be tracking diary responses, and response rates. If a 218 subject withdraws early from the study, they will only receive compensation for visits that they 219 have completed and not the compensation for diary completion. 220  221  222 Sample size 223 Our primary outcome is the total number of amenorrhea days in a 30-day reference between 224 curcumin and placebo groups.  Our prior tamoxifen study demonstrated a 6-day difference in 225 overall amenorrhea days in the first 30-day reference period.  226  227 Based on our recent tamoxifen study, a sample size of 44 women allows us to demonstrate a 6-228 day difference between groups; 80% power at an alpha 0.05 = 22 women per each group. To 229 account for drop out, we have increased the sample size by approximately 30% for a total 230 sample size of 58.  231  232 Study drug 233 Curcumin an active ingredient in the spice Tumeric is a natural polyphenol. It is purported to 234 have multiple health benefits mostly based in its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. 235 Curcumin dosing has been demonstrated to be well tolerated in humans up to 12,000mg/day 236 but dosing as a cancer treatment adjunct or as an autoimmune therapy are in the 400-237 600mg/day range [1,2]. In general, subjects seem to experience no side effects from curcumin 238 but in a dose escalation study to determine safety and tolerability, 7 of 34 subjects experienced 239 headache, rash, and yellow stool.  At higher doses, some nausea and diarrhea have also been 240 reported. Curcumin may have a beneficial effect on cholesterol and triglycerides. Curcumin has 241 poor bioavailability and combining it with piperine, a known bioenhancer derived from black 242 pepper, has been shown to improve curcumin bioavailability by 2000% [3]. However, curcumin 243 without a bioenhancer has also demonstrated therapeutic impact in randomized controlled trials.  244 We plan to use Theracurcumin by Immunovites, 600 mg curcumin, as they report quality testing 245 and have combined curcumin with a bioenhancer for improved bioavailability. This product also 246 contains ginger root powder and bioperine (derived from black pepper). 247 (https://immunovites.com/products/theracurmin-hp-max). 248 Curcumin is considered a supplement by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has 249 determined curcumin is safe and categorizes it as ‘generally regarded as safe’ (GRAS).  Our 250 IRB chair has recommended that we seek the FDA’s opinion regarding the need for an IND for 251 this study as curcumin is a supplement.  However, this study is not intended to support a 252 significant change in advertising for curcumin. It is also debatable whether its use is for 253 “treatment” of a disorder or a study of the impact of curcumin on biological function.   254  255 [1] Esmaily, H.; Sahebkar, A.; Iranshahi, M.; Ganjali, S.; Mohammadi, A.; Ferns, G.; Ghayour-256 Mobarhan, M.

 Risks to Subjects  265 Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics 266 Reproductive-aged (15-45 year old), healthy women currently using a contraceptive implant with 267 no contraindications to the study medication and not at risk for or seeking pregnancy will 268 constitute the target population for this study.  269  270 All enrollment and clinical evaluations will be performed at OHSU in Portland, Oregon.  271 Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing and pap testing (if indicated) will be sent to the OHSU core 272 lab for routine processing.  273  274 Sources of Materials 275 The sources of research material for the clinical portion of this proposal will be new specimens 276 obtained purely for this research protocol.  The study investigators and/or research 277 assistants/nurses will perform all study procedures.   278  279 Potential Risks 280 One risk to taking part in this study is that the study drug may not be effective in helping to treat 281 bleeding.  282  283 The study drug is extremely well tolerated even up to extremely high doses and is considered 284 safe by the FDA. At the highest doses, which we are not utilizing here, a few subjects reported 285 nausea and diarrhea.  286  287 Some parts of the study may be inconvenient including the text messaging to collect data.  288 These are regular text or email messages and will count towards text messages or data on a 289 subject’s cell phone plan.  The subject will be asked detailed questions about her bleeding and 290 gynecologic history.  Some of these questions may seem very personal or embarrassing.  291 Women may refuse to answer any of the questions that they do not wish to answer.  292  293 Adequacy of Protection Against Risk 294 Recruitment and Informed Consent 295 Attempts to enroll a diverse study population will be made through placement of IRB approved 296 flyers in the community, community outreach (radio and print ads) and through the availability of 297 foreign language interpreters and research staff.  Women may also learn of the study through 298 their routine visits in clinics or by working at OHSU. We also intend to utilize an EPIC Cohort 299 search to identify and contact potential participants via phone, email, letter, and/or MyChart 300 messages. We intend to use REDCap for batch emailing. We also intend to use Trialspark and 301 Google AdWords as well as Facebook and Instagram for community outreach. 302  303 Women will be screened for eligibility and if they meet the basic criteria and agree to participate, 304 they will undergo informed written consent. The protocols and consent will be reviewed and 305 approved by the OHSU IRB prior to initiation of the study. 306  307 Protection Against Risk 308 The drug utilized in this study will be used in accordance with dose and routes that the FDA has 309 determined to be safe.  Women will be informed that they will be using a supplement and this is 310 not an FDA approved drug but that we have specifically chosen a dose and length of exposure 311 time to the drug or compound with extremely low potential for significant side effects or serious 312 risks. Women will undergo screening for any known contraindications to the study drugs. 313  314

 Confidentiality of personal health information will be maintained according to HIPAA 315 requirements for research.  All subjects will receive a study number to which all subsequent 316 data will refer.  Personal identifiers will not be on questionnaires, data, abstract sheets, or in the 317 main database.  All data will be kept in locked files or a password protected computer in the 318 Principal Investigator’s (PI) office.  319  320 Data and safety monitoring of plans for clinical trials 321 The PI and study staffs are responsible for recording the data, and they will be verifying its 322 accuracy throughout the process. The PI will be reviewing the data in-depth upon completion of 323 the study.  The PI will also be overseeing that the study procedures are being carried out as per 324 the approved protocol via close supervision of study visits and procedures and through frequent 325 communication with the study staff. The PI will also be conducting an initial assessment and 326 periodic assessments of the study and its procedures. If any safety concerns arise, a data 327 safety monitoring board will be convened to review the study.  As this study will be performed in 328 conjunction with the Women’s Health Research Unit’s (WHRU), an independent chart audit to 329 ensure data integrity and completeness will be performed after the first 5 subjects have been 330 enrolled and then at regular 6 months intervals.     331  332 The PI will adhere to OHSU’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies regarding protection of 333 human subjects and the reporting of study deviations and adverse events. In the rare case of an 334 adverse event, she will utilize the WHRU data safety monitoring board (DSMB) to review the 335 event and rule on a course of action. The WHRU DSMB is made up of individuals 336 knowledgeable about women’s reproductive health and therapies and will have no conflict of 337 interest with the study or its outcomes.  338  339 Data Storage 340 Data for this project will be stored in OCTRI's installation of REDCap, a highly secure and robust 341 web-based research data collection and management system. 342 Features of REDCap that protect participants' privacy and data security include: 343 o Physical Security: OCTRI's REDCap software is housed on servers located in ITG's 344 Advanced Computing Center providing locked physical security 345 o Electronic Security: The REDCap servers are housed behind both the OHSU firewall 346 and a second ACC firewall.  All web-based data transmissions are encrypted with 347 industry-standard SSL methods.   348 o Controlled User Access: REDCap is employs a robust multi-level security system that 349 enables researchers to easily implement "minimum necessary" data access for their 350 research staff, including specification of data fields that are identifiers. This feature 351 includes “single click” ability to provide completely deidentified (removing all identified 352 data fields and shifting dates) for analysis or other purposes.  User activities are 353 logged to enable auditing of all data access.   Access is integrated with OHSU's 354 network such that users who are also OHSU employees are authenticated against 355 their OHSU network credentials.   356 o Data Integrity: REDCap is jointly managed in accordance with OHSU Information 357 Security Directives by ACC staff and members of OCTRI's Biomedical Informatics 358

 Program, ensuring fidelity of database configuration and back-ups.  User activities are 359 logged to enable auditing of all data changes. 360 Data Sharing 361  362 We intend to use “Box” to share study documents and spreadsheets.  363  364 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others 365 There are no direct benefits to study participants. 366  367 Importance of Knowledge to be Gained 368 This study will increase the knowledge regarding breakthrough bleeding and contraceptive 369 implants.  It may help to prolong continuation of contraceptive implant use which in turn could 370 help women avoid unplanned pregnancies.  371  372

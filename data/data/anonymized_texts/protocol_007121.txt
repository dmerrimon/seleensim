of the Knee 
Clinical Phase Phase I/IIa 
Study Overview 
 
 
     
 
    
 
 
 CARTISTEM® will be administered at doses ranging from 0.5×107 to 
2.25×107 hUCB-MSC (0.25×107 cells/cm2; 0.5 mL/cm2 with 0.5u107 
MSC/m L) to patients with focal, full-thickness, Grade 3-4 articular cartilage 
defects of ആ 2cm2 in size. 
 Safety:
 
Patient safety will be assessed step -wise with increasing levels of total 
hUCB -MSC and HA exposure : a total of 12 patients will be enrolled and 
treated with CARTISTEM® to evaluate whether dose limiting toxicity (DLT) 
is detected. DLT is defined as toxicity or adverse event of Grade 3 or higher 
[80 points or higher for pain] in two or more events at the surgery site among 
swelling, tenderness, range of motion, and pain in any one visit. DLT is also 
defined as adverse drug reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the Common 
Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, with the exception 
of the following events and that they are unresolved  for 7 consecutive days, 
despite medical interventions:  
 
9 Abnormal results in lab test (Acidosis, Hyponatremia, 
Hyperbilirubinemia, etc.) 
9 Fatigue, defined as not relieved by rest; limiting self-care ADL 
9 Pain, defined as severe pain; limiting self-care ADL 
9 Headache, defined as severe pain in  various parts of the head, limiting 
self-care ADL 
9 Fever, defined as > 40.0 degrees C (> 104.0 degrees F) for > 24 hours 
 
Initially, 6 patients with lesion sizes of 2-5 cm2 will be enrolled and treated 
(Dosage  A); if dose limiting toxicity is not detected during a 12 week period 
after administration, an additional 6 patien ts, with lesion sizes of greater than 
CARTISTEM®                                                                                                    page  3 of 137G

Study Design 
 
 
  
 
A total of 12 -18 patients will be enrolled and treated with CARTISTEM® to 
evaluate for dose limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Initially, 6 patients with defect sizes of 2 – 5 cm2 will be enrolled in Dosage 
A and  treated with 0.5 – 1.25 x 107 hUCB-MSC. If DLT is not detected in 
any patients by 3 months post -administration (time point for first clinical 
efficacy evaluation) , then additional 6 patients with defect sizes of above 5 
cm2 will be enrolled in Dosage  B and treated with > 1.25 x 107 hUCB- MSC 
to further evaluate safety.  
If DLT is detected in 1 or 2 patients during Dosage A, additional 3 patients 
will be enrolled and assessed at Dosage A. If DLT is detected in 3 or more 
patients during Dosage A period, the s tudy will be stopped. 
In the absence of DLT, a total of 12 patients will , therefore, be evaluated for 
safety and exploratory efficacy.

GClinical Trial 
Material (CTM)  CARTISTEM® (human allogeneic-unrelated umbilical cord blood-derived 
mesenchymal stem cel ls, hUCB-MSC, and sodium hyaluronate) 
CARTISTEM® consists of approximately 7.5 x 106 hUCB- MSC suspended 
in 1.5 m L medium in one vial, and 60 mg sodium hyaluronate provided as a 
lyophilized sponge form in a separate vial. The two vials are mixed at the 
surgical site. Upon admixture of the two vials, the combination forms a 
viscous gel, which is implanted into the articular cartilage defect. 
 
Clinical Trial 
Material Dosage and 
Administration 
 CARTISTEM® will be administered into the articular cartilage defect by 
open surgery at a dose of 0.5  mL/cm2 based upon size of the defect. The 
CARTISTEM® dosage has been selected based on the results derived from 
nonclinical studies and prior human experience (see Investigator’s Brochure 
for further information)  
Surgical  
Technique  Before application of CARTISTEM®, unstable chondral fragments are 
debrided using a curet and stable shoulders of healthy surrounding cartilage are created. After adequate removal of the debris, multiple holes are created across the entire arti
cular cartilage defect with a 2~3 mm drill bit spacing the 
holes approximately 3~5 mm apart. CARTISTEM® is applied onto the 
drilled holes first, and then throughout the entire cartilage defect. 
Post-operative 
rehabilitation Patients will be started on a cont inuous passive motion (CPM) device on 
post-operative day 1 with a range of motion of 0-30 degrees initially. This 
will be increased by 10 degrees per day as tolerated to a maximum of 0 -90 
degrees. Patients will undergo CPM treatment for 6 hours per day over 6 
weeks. The patient will remain touch-down weight- bearing (TDWB) for 6 
weeks, and then advance to full -weight bearing during the next 6 weeks (up 
to week 12) . The patient will refrain from high-impact activities, such as 
running, during the subsequent 8 to 12 weeks (week 20 – 24).  
Reference 
Therapy The study does not include a reference compound.   
Approximate 
Duration of Patient 
Participation  Each patient will undergo a 6-week screening period for eligibility and a 12-
month  follow-up observation period for both the primary (safety) and 
secondary (efficacy) evaluations following administration  of CARTISTEM®. 
Also each patient will undergo a 24 -month follow-up visit for a long term 
patient assessment.  
CARTISTEM®                                                                                                    page  7 of 137G

GApproximate 
Duration of Study The estimated duration of the study for the primary evaluation is 
approximately 12 months, with an additional 12 month extension for the 
long-term patient assessment phase. 
Safety 
Evaluation  
 
 General  
General safety will be evaluated via the following assessments: AEs, routine 
clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), 
thrombin generation  (PT and aPTT), immunogenicity tests (T cell subset ), 
vital signs, physical exams , ECGs, and MRI for tumorigenicity. 
 
Adverse Events  
To assess t he safety of CARTISTEM®, the course and degree of swelling, 
tenderness, range of motion and pain will be determined.  DLT is defined as 
toxicity or adverse event of Grade 3 or higher [80 points or higher for pain] 
in two or more events at the surgery site among swelling, tenderness, range of motion, and pain, in any one visit. DLT is also defined as adverse drug 
reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the Common Toxicity Criteria  Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, with the exception of the following events and that they are unresolved
 for 7 consecutive days, despite medical 
interventions:  
9 Abnormal results in lab test (Acidosis, Hyponatremia, 
Hyperbilirubinemia, etc.) 
9 Fatigue, defined as not relieved by rest; limiting self-care ADL 
9 Pain, defined as severe pain; limiting self-care ADL 
9 Headache, defined as severe pain in  various parts of the head, limiting 
self-care ADL 
9 Fever, defined as >40.0 degrees C (> 104.0 degrees F) for > 24 hours  
Efficacy 
Evaluation  
 
 Primary efficacy outcome parameters w ill be the postoperative changes in 
subjective knee function as assessed by IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) score at 
12 months. For secondary efficacy 
outcome parameters, p atients will answer questionnaires for pain (visual 
analogue scale, VAS) , knee specific outcome instruments ( Lysholm knee 
scoring, and KOOS [Knee injury a nd Osteoarthritis Outcome Score] ). 
Structural information will be gathered using high-resolution (1.5 or 3 Tesla) 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

GStatistical 
Methods  General: all safety and efficacy endpoi nts will be presented for each dose 
cohort as well as for all patients combined. For safety evaluation, statistical 
homogeneity between dose groups will be performed. For efficacy 
evaluation, statistical comparison (diff erence) between dose groups will be 
performed.  
 
1) Safety  
Safety will be demonstrated with 95% confidence intervals. Advers e events, 
adverse drug reactions, serious adverse events, and drop -out patients due to 
AE will be presented with freque ncy and percentage.  Homogeneity 
between dose groups will be analyzed using person’s chi -square test or 
Fisher’s exact test. Descriptive statistics including means, medians, SD 
(standard deviation), minimum and maximum will be used to demonstrate 
the other safety endpoints.  
 
2) Efficacy  
Symptom improvement from the outcome instruments will be demonstrated 
with means and standard deviations.  Efficacy results will also be analyzed 
for statistical significance using chan ge from baseline at each efficacy 
endpoint.  Statistical difference of continuous variables and categorical 
variables between dose groups will be compared using t-test and Fisher ’s 
exact test, respectively.  
Rationale for 
Study Population and Number of 
Patients 
 CARTISTEM® is administered to the defective joint cartilage region by open 
surgery. Due to ethical considerations, it is not possible to conduct this type of procedure in
 a healthy subject. Therefore, no studies in healthy subjects 
will be performed.  
 
Factors such as number of subjects to acquire statistical data of the 
effectiveness are not considered as critical in this phase I/IIa study. A small number of subjects gener
ally participate in this stage of clinical study. 
Accordingly, Dosage A is set based on dose limit of toxicity from non -
clinical study and then Dosage B will be administered.

G(device) intended for cartilage regeneration in pati ents with cartilage defects or injuries. Unlike 
other conventional investigationa l products, the innate biological  properties of the living cells 
in this product limit the shelf-life of the su spension (mixture of hUCB-MSC and HA) to less 
than 72 hours after preparation. Therefore, the inve stigational product needs to be delivered to 
the test site on the day of the actual surgery so that the on-site preparation and administration to 
the patient can take place shortly afte r receipt of the two vialed CARTISTEM® components 
(hUCB-MSC and lyophilized HA). Designation of a clinical trial pharmacist is deemed 
unnecessary as the unused portion of the inve stigational product which is ordered and 
administered on an individual subject basis is to  be returned to MEDIPOST after the surgery. 
Therefore, a clinical nurse is given the rol e of managing the investigational product under 
supervision of the principal investigator and the subinvestigators. 
Moreover, CARTISTEM® does not require a separate co mpounding or preparation process of 
a clinical trial pharmacist as the product can be mixed and used by the principal investigator in 
the surgery room. Hence, it was decided that it  would be acceptable to have an appropriate 
individual designated by the (principal) investigator order, receive the shipment of, and return 
the investigational product to the sponsor. Therefore, a clinical nurse is assigned the role of 
managing the investigational product under the supervision of the investigator.

4 Background of the Study 
4.1 Cartilage defects 
Chondral defects or damage to articular cartila ge due to accidents, repetitive trauma or 
arthritis are common disorders. They are major causes of disability, as they can lead to 
osteoarthritis and they rarely heal spontane ously (e.g., Dragoo et al. 2003, Moore et al. 2005). 
As the population ages and as more young people pa rticipate in active sports, the size of the 
target patient group is also growing. However,  despite ongoing research efforts, clinical 
products directed at cartilage repair remain limited. 
Articular cartilage consists of hyaline cartilage and is a highly differentiated connective 
tissue covering joint surfaces. It is avascular and alymphatic, and it is sheltered from the 
immune system. It also has no nerve supply and is therefore not sensitive to early injuries. 
Articular cartilage also has poor repair properties because there are relatively few cells in the 
tissue, the metabolic rate is low, and the capaci ty of chondrocytes to divide and migrate within 
articular cartilage is restricted by the dense matri x. As a consequence, it is generally agreed that 
articular cartilage does not repair significantly after damage to the collagen matrix (e.g., Chang 
et al. 2006, Gelse et al. 2003, Hedrick and Daniels 2003, Katayama et al. 2004, Risbud et al. 
2001, Wakitani et al. 2002). Therefore, damage to  the tissue as a result of trauma generally 
progresses to osteoarthritis. 
In most cases, the critical limiting step for  the induction of spontaneous cartilaginous repair 
is incomplete and leads to the formation of fi brous, or at best fibrocartilage, tissue – a tissue 
intermediate of fibrous mesenchy me and cartilage, depending on th e location and size of injury. 
Compared with the native hyaline articular ca rtilage, fibrous repair tissue has poor mechanical 
qualities and is prone to fail in the long te rm (Athanasiou et al. 2001, Chuma et al. 2004, Gelse 
et al. 2003, Guo et al. 2004, Mizuta et al. 2004, Moore et al. 2005, Otsuka et al. 1997). It is,

Gtherefore, desirable to develop procedures that al low for improved repair of cartilage defects, as 
discussed below.  
4.2 Investigational cellular-surgical combined interventions 
Various different types of treatments are in us e, such as drug therapy, arthroscopy, joint 
replacement surgery, marrow stimulation tec hniques (drilling, abrasion arthroplasty and 
microfracture for stimulation of local MSC), periosteal grafts, and autologous chondrocyte 
transplantation (Athanasiou et al. 2001, Risbud et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2005). However, 
conventional treatment modalit ies have not been able to provide complete and sustained 
resolution of symptoms following damage to th e articular cartilage. Despite the numerous 
techniques available today, complete healing of damaged or defective cartilage or consistent 
reproduction of normal hyaline cartilage does not occur, and continuous drug administration or 
secondary surgeries are common. Thus, functional restoration of diseased and damaged human 
articular cartilage continues to remain one of the most challenging orthopedic problems and the 
clinical need for cartilage repair/regeneration technologies is undisputed (Athanasiou et al. 
2001, Elisseeff 2004, Gelse et al. 2003, Lee et al. 2010, Smith et al. 2005, Yanai et al. 2005). 
The latest attempts to develop clinically useful  procedures for repairing damaged articular 
cartilage include the use of cells with the potentia l for cartilage repair. There are three potential 
cell types that may be utilized: chondrocytes (a lready used in the autologous chondrocyte 
transplantation technique), adult (somatic) stem ce lls and embryonic stem cells (Barry 2003, 
Browne et al. 2005, Giannoni et al. 2005, Guo et al. 2004, Otsuka et al. 1997, Yanai et al. 2005).  
Chondrocyte implantation has long been consid ered as a potential treatment and several 
approaches of chondrocyte implantation are in curr ent clinical use. Implantations of previously 
isolated and in vitro  amplified autologous chondrocytes are being performed in current clinical 
practice. The disadvantages of this procedure are the limited proliferative capacity of adult 
chondrocytes, the issue of dedifferentiation in  culture and required re-differentiation upon 
implantation, as well as the need for a 2-stage procedure for harvest and implantation. 
The use of stem cells is the most recently developed and investigated method. The most 
promising approaches involve the introduction of  MSC /cartilage precursor cells. Bone marrow

Gcontains non-hematopoietic progenitor cells ca pable of differentiating into osteoblasts, 
chondrocytes and adipocytes; because those diff erentiated cells have mesodermal origin, their 
bone marrow progenitors have been designated MSC.  
The umbilical cord blood is a source of hematopoietic stem cells and is used for 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with diseases such as leukemia, aplastic 
anemia, and congenital immune deficiency that  require allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplants.  Over 5,000 cases of umbilical cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantations have been conducted globally as of 2004, and transplant treatments using 
umbilical cord blood are expected to increase even further in th e future.  Umbilical cord blood 
is blood from the placenta and umbilical cord, which  can be easily collected from the umbilical 
cord after childbirth, and therefore the collection poses no risk of harm to either the mother or 
the infant. Considering the present US birth rate of about 4,000,000 infants per year, umbilical 
cord blood is one of the most readily available and non-invasive sources of mesenchymal stem 
cells. The mesenchymal stem cell found in umbilica l cord blood is characterized by its ability 
to self-replicate as well as its multipotency, or the capability to differentiate into cell lineages 
that compose bone, cartilage, bone marrow stro ma, adipocytes, tendon, neurons, and various 
other tissues and organs.  
Research in MSC has had a rapid acceleration over the past decade and MSC-based therapy 
has become one of the objects of investigat ion for a new branch of medicine termed 
regenerative medicine. This emerging technology shows great promise for producing 
transplantable cartilage constructs to restore  the function of degenerated joints. However, 
current treatment options using MSC for articular  cartilage repair/regeneration are still at an 
experimental stage of development. Studies wi th MSC were conducted in various animal 
models while currently only one clinical invest igation and two case reports with MSC are 
available (e.g., Wakitani et al. 2002, Wakitani et al. 2010).  
4.3 CARTISTEM® (MEDIPOST Cell Therapy Product) 
CARTISTEM® is intended to be used as a single-dos e cellular therapeutic agent for cartilage 
regeneration in human subjects w ith cartilage defects of the knee as a result of ageing, trauma or

Gdegenerative diseases.  
The CARTISTEM® drug product consists of a combinat ion of human umbilical cord blood-
derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSC; suppl ied as a liquid suspension) and lyophilized 
sodium hyaluronate, provided in separate vials f or mixing prior to administration. The packaged 
drug product will be shipped and stored as tw o vials, one vial containing approximately 7.5x106 
hUCB-MSCs suspended in 1.5 mL medium (alpha-MEM) to be mixed with one vial containing 60 
mg sodium hyaluronate (lyophilized). Upon admixture  of the two vials, i.e. after distribution of 
the cells in the hyaluronate polymer, the reconstituted product (5x106 cells/mL; 40 mg/mL sodium 
hyaluronate) is formed as a viscous gel which is implanted into the cartilage lesion during open 
surgery. The initial proposed clinical dose is to be 0.5 mL/cm2 (approximately 2.5x106 cells and 
20 mg HA/cm2). Immune phenotype tests using flow cy tometer demonstrated that the hUCB-
MSCs are CD45 negative, CD14 negative, HLA- DR negative, CD29 positive, CD73 positive, 
CD105 positive, and CD166 positive. 
hUCB-MSCs, the active ingredient in CARTISTEM®, are expected to induce the regeneration 
of damaged cartilage tissues by repair of the microenvironment with paracrine effects or by 
differentiation towards tissue-specific pathways. Sodium hyaluronate is beli eved to function as a 
medical device to provide mechanical stability to the hUCB-MSC suspension, enabling the cells 
to remain at the site of the implantation and not disseminate into adjacent areas. 
4.4 Sodium Hyaluronate 
Hyaluronic acid is a natural component of th e extracellular matrix in cartilage. The 
glycosaminoglycan is highly conserved and is widely distributed in the body. hUCB-MSCs 
express cell surface receptors (CD44) that bind to hyaluronic acid. Interaction between cells and 
the extracellular matrix regulates many biolog ical processes that are important to cartilage 
homeostasis and repair, including cell attachment,  growth, differentiation, and survival (Marcacci 
et al. 2005, Risbud et al. 2001).  
Since the 1970’s, hyaluronic acid has been clinically used as a chondroprotective agent 
(Caplan and Dennis 2006, Watterson and Esdaile 2000). In addition, sodium hyaluronate has been

GFDA approved for the treatment of osteoarthriti s of the knee since 1997 (as an orthopedic device – 
e.g. ORTHOVISC® High Mol, SUPARTZ® Dispo, SYNVISC® (Hylan G-F 20) and HYALGAN®). 
In 2003, HA was approved for injection into the mid to deep dermis for correction of moderate to 
severe facial wrinkles and folds (such as nasolab ial folds).  In all cases, the FDA has regulated 
the products as medical devices. 
The sodium hyaluronate in the CARTISTEM® product is believed to provide a stabilizing 
function to the MSC enabling them to remain at th e site of the implant and not spill over into 
adjacent areas. In fact, sodium hyaluronate (and it s derivatives) has proven to be an ideal molecule 
for use in the delivery of cellular therapies such  as autologous chondrocytes or MSC in cartilage 
repair helping to keep the implanted cells in place (e.g., Elisseeff 2004, Marcacci et al. 2005, 
Risbud et al. 2001). In addition, hyaluronic acid  has been shown to be both non-toxic and 
biocompatible (Kasahara et al. 2008). Thus, sodium hyaluronate was considered highly desirable 
for use as a scaffold in CARTISTEM®. There is currently no evidence that the presence of sodium 
hyaluronate contributes in any way to the inherent  activity of the implanted MSC. Therefore, 
MEDIPOST considers the sodium hyaluronate to  be a device in the final administered 
CARTISTEM®. 
 
5 Purpose of the Study 
The primary objective of the proposed single-center phase I/IIa study is to evaluate the safety 
of CARTISTEM®, an allogeneic-unrelated mesenchy mal stem cell (hUCB-MSC) suspension 
mixed with sodium hyaluronate, at doses ranging from 0.5×107 to 2.25×107 hUCB-MSC in 
patients with articular cartilage defects that are equal or greater than 2cm2. 
The secondary objective of the study is to eval uate the efficacy (regeneration of defective 
cartilage and decrease of pain) of CARTISTEM®. 
CARTISTEM® will be administered, as a function of th e defect size, at a cell density of 
0.25×107 cells/cm2 (0.5 mL/cm2 with 0.5u107 hUCB-MSC/mL) directly into the articular cartilage 
defect by open surgery.

GA total of 12 patients, initially 6 patien ts with defect sizes of 2 to 5 cm2 (Dosage A) followed 
by an additional 6 patients w ith defect sizes of above 5 cm2 (Dosage B), will be enrolled 
sequentially in 2 groups in order to evaluate wh ether dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is detected.  
Each patient will undergo a 6-week screening period for eligibility and a 12-month follow-up 
observation period for both the primary (safety) and secondary (efficacy)  endpoints of the study. 
There is an additional long term follow-up obse rvation visit at 24 months. The estimated total 
duration of the study is approximately 24 months. 
Prior to administration of CARTISTEM®, the defect will undergo debridement, and following 
appropriate preparation, perforat ion of the subchondral plate. 
CARTISTEM® is applied directly onto the entire defect site.  
For use at the clinical site, CARTISTEM® will be provided as a cell suspension a nd lyoph ilized 
sodium hyaluronate in separate glass vials. 
In terms of post-operative rehabilitation, patien ts will be started on a continuous passive 
motion (CPM) device on post-operative day 1 and refrain from high-impact activities such as 
running for 20 to 24 weeks.

6.3 Number of Subjects  
1) Estimated Number of Patients 
This study requires 12-18 patients (6-9 patien ts per arm depending on rate of DLT) for two 
different dose ranges (Dosage A: defect sizes of 2-5 cm2 and Dosage B: defect sizes of 
above 5 cm2).  
2) Target Number of Subjects and Rationale 
This is a phase I/IIa clinical trial to evalua te safety and exploratory efficacy of the 
investigational drug product. Therefore, it is not considered critical to  base the number of 
subjects on formal statistical power calculations. Six patients at each dose cohort enrolled 
sequentially are considered sufficient for this st udy. This study will be performed with two 
dose ranges, on the basis of existing pre-clinical te st results. Initially, 6 patients with defect 
sizes of 2-5 cm2 will be enrolled in Dosage A. If no DLT is seen during Dosage A, another 6 
patients with larger defect sizes (above 5 cm2) will be recruited for Dosage B of the study. 
There could be a need for an intermediate dos e or up to 6 additional patients, based on the 
rate of DLT seen.

G6.4 Administration Dosage 
1) Initial Administration Dosage and Rationale  
It is somewhat well understood by developers and regulators of living cell therapies that 
for products like CARTISTEM® administered locally into an anatomical defect there is no 
simple extrapolation of a safe starting dose in humans based primarily upon body surface 
area calculations derived from animal studies. 
In addition, dose determinations in this cl inical setting should take into account the 
surface area of the cartilage defect such that all NOAEL values should be converted into a 
unit quantity (cells/cm2) at the application site. This approa ch applies to most therapeutics 
administered into anatomical co mpartments that have little s ubsequent distribution outside 
of the compartment; it is recommended that doses are normalized between species according 
to the compartmental volumes and amount of the therapeutic product. 
Support for the range of CARTISTEM® doses (0.5 × 107 cells to 2.25 × 107 cells) to be 
evaluated for safety and efficacy in this phase I/IIa study comes from both preclinical 
studies and clinical results in humans (comprise d of a completed Phase I/II study in Korean 
patients with articular cartilage defects (N=7) and an ongoing Phase III study in Korean 
patients (N=50), as follows:  
NOAELs for CARTISTEM® have been determined in the rat (Study No. B04001; 
NOAEL = 3x107 cells per mL; > 1x107 cells per cm2) and the rabbit (Study No. B04004; 
NOAEL = 1.5x107 cells per mL; > 0.3x107 cells per cm2); however, it is possible that the 
design of these studies did not allow for  a proper assessment of the NOAEL due to 
limitations on the density of cells administered , and an overall very low toxicity of the 
hUCB-MSC in the species examined.  
No treatment-related SAEs have been reported  in seven patients who participated in a 
phase I/II Korean study and 50 patients curren tly enrolled in an ongoing phase III Korean 
study; all of these patients have received single administrations of 0.25×107 cells/cm2 (0.5 
ml/cm2 with 0.5x107 MSC/mL) up to a maximum of 2.25x107 total MSC; this number of 
cells represents a much higher dose than the NOAEL (10x107 MSC per mL) derived from 
CARTISTEM®                                                                                                    page  23 of 137 G

GStudy B04001 (GLP repeat-dose toxicology study in rats). 
Based on these findings (for further discussion, please see the Investigator’s Brochure), 
MEDIPOST has selected a single administration of CARTISTEM® at 0.25×107 cells/cm2 
(0.5 mL/cm2 with 0.5x107 hUCB-MSC/mL), with both the volume and total number of 
hUCB-MSC administered to patients b eing a function of the defect size.  
Similar products available on the market include CARTICEL® manufactured by 
Genzyme Biosurgery, an autologous cultured chondrocyte product approved by the US-FDA. 
Clinical studies of CARTICEL® were conducted at dose levels ranging from 0.64×106 
cells/cm2 up to 3.3×106 cells/cm2 for the 1.2×107 cells/0.4mL product. Meanwhile, 
Chondron, the autologous chondrocyte regenera tion therapy of Cellontech, Korea, is a 
1.2×107 cells/0.4mL product which is applied at a ratio of 0.1 mL for every 1 cm2 of 
cartilage defect. For cartilage defects greater than 4 cm2 in size, the entire vial is 
administered. 
Both CARTICEL® and Chondron are autologous chondrocyte therapies, with limits in 
cell proliferation and maximum number of cells th at can be achieved in the defect. In other 
words, the limited cell number is a challenge an d it is difficult to de termine a constant cell 
concentration per unit area in larger defect size s. Also, there are potentially large differences 
in cell potency since the starting materials/livi ng cells are derived in a patient-specific 
manner and, therefore, typically vary greatly from patient to patient. 
 CARTISTEM® can be differentiated from these tw o products because it is an off-the-
shelf allogeneic-unrelated cellular therapy that  allows a consistent application of the most 
effective cell concentration per area of defect throughout the entire lesion with a constant 
cell concentration. 
Against this background, the most scientific and logical approach for the study would 
be to perform the clinical trial using tw o different cell concentrations of 0.5×107 cells/mL 
and 1.0×107 cells/mL. However, it was deemed ethica lly inappropriate to subject a treatment 
group to a relatively-less effective dose.  Theref ore, a single cell concentration expected to 
be the more effective of the two was first chosen through a preclinical study and adopted for 
CARTISTEM®                                                                                                    page  24 of 137 G

Gthis clinical trial.  The total volume of administration was determined by size of the lesion. 
CARTISTEM®, consisting of mesenchymal stem cells and sodium hyaluronate, will be 
applied at a dose of 0.5 mL/cm2. The administered dose is, therefore, a function of the defect 
size. It will be administered into the cartilage defect by open surgery. 
The following chart provides determination of CARTISTEM® dosage relative to the 
defect size (derived from nonclinical studies and prior human experience):

6.5 Dose Escalation 
This clinical trial will employ the following dose escalation scheme: 
A total of 12-18 patients will be enrolled and treated with CARTISTEM® for dose 
limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation. Init ially, 6 patients with lesion sizes of 2 – 5 cm2 will be 
assigned to Dosage A and treated with 0.5 – 1.25x107 MSCs; if dose limiting toxicity is not 
observed at the 3 month time point for the firs t clinical efficacy evaluation, then another 6 
patients with lesion sizes of above 5 cm2 will be assigned to Dosage B and treated with 
more than 1.25 x 107 MSCs for further safety evaluation. If a DLT occurs to one or two 
patients of the group treated with the dosage A, 3 more patients will be assigned to dosage A. 
If DLT happens to 3 of the patients who were treated with the dosage A or above, this study 
will be halted and the FDA and IRB will be  notified. The Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee will perform a comprehensive review of safety (see Section 9.1).  
CARTISTEM®                                                                                                    page  25 of 137 G

GIf no DLT occurs to any of the dosage A patien ts, another 6 patients with larger defect 
sizes will be enrolled and assigned to dosag e B. In case of no DLT observed, a total of 12 
patients will be enrolled for safety and effica cy evaluation. However, 18 patients could be 
enrolled if DLT occurs to two patients. If DLT occur 3 or more patients treated with Dosage 
B, this study will be halted and the FDA a nd IRB will be notified. The Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee will perform a comprehe nsive review of safety (see Section 9.1).

G6.6  Definition of Maximum Permissible Dose and Method of Dose Escalation 
 
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT):  DLT is defined as toxicity or events of Grade 3 or higher (80 
points or higher against pain) in two or more events  at the surgery site among swelling, tenderness, 
range of motion, and pain in any one visit. DLT is  also defined as adverse drug reaction of Grade 
3 or higher in the Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, with the 
exception of the following events and that they are unresolved for 7 consecutive days, despite 
medical interventions: 
9 Abnormal results in lab test (Acidosis, Hyponatremia, Hyperbilirubinemia, etc.) 
9 Fatigue, defined as not relieved by rest; limiting self-care ADL 
9 Pain, defined as severe pain; limiting self-care ADL 
9 Headache, defined as severe pain in various  parts of the head, limiting self-care ADL 
Fever, defined as > 40.0 degrees C ( > 104.0 degrees F) for > 24 hours 
 
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD):  If DLT occurs in 2 or fewer patients at the Dosage B level, 
the MTD will be Dosage B. If DLT occurs in 3 or  more patients treated with Dosage B then the 
MTD will be Dosage A. If DLT occurs in 3 patien ts treated with Dosage A then the MTD will not 
have been determined in this study design.

8.4.2 Concomitant Medications 
Each participating subject must be inquired at baseline and throughout the treatment 
period and at each follow up visit whether he  or she is on any concomitant medications. 
And detailed information of the medication such as the name of the drug’s active 
ingredients (name of the product for a combination drug), dosage, start and end dates of 
the administration, and a reason for the ad ministration should be documented on case 
report form. 
8.4.3 Evaluation of Adverse Events & Toxicity 
Any adverse events (AE) or toxic reactions  of each participating subject will be 
evaluated throughout the course of the study and at each follow up visit (from Day -2 to 
the end-of-study visit). Any adverse events or serious adverse events will be managed, 
investigated, and reported according to the procedures described in the following 
sections: 
9 Adverse Events 
When an adverse event is either observed by the investigator or reported by a subject, 
the investigator, regardless of the relationshi p of the AE to the investigational product, 
will record name and type of the adverse event, the severity, dates of onset and 
resolution of the event, the investigator’s opinion on the relationship between the 
investigational product and the adverse event,  and whether or not the event was an SAE 
(serious adverse event) on the case report form (CRF). 
The principal investigator or the trial coordinator will carry out follow-up 
observations for all subjects with adverse events until the symptoms subside and the 
abnormal clinical test results are returned to normal, or until a satisfactory explanation 
can be given for the observed changes. If a nd when there is such a request from the 
sponsor, a progress report on the adverse event will  be submitted to the trial coordinator.  
9 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence at any dose 
that causes death, life-threatening condition, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation

MEDIPOST Co., Lt Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not 
require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient 
hospitalization, or development of drug dependenc y or drug abuse. If a serious adverse 
event occurs, the investigator must, regardl ess of the relationship of the SAE to the

MEDIPOST Co., Lt Should a patient voluntarily decide to wit hdraw, the decision will be respected and 
accepted without any questions.  
Purpose of this study is to evaluate the safe ty and the efficacy of the investigational 
product. Therefore, any subjects who want to withdraw from the study on a voluntary 
basis or due to the adverse events will be rep laced with new subjects as long as the drug 
administration in the dosage group that the wit hdrawn subject was in is not complete. The 
study data obtained from such a subject until the point of drop out will be, where possible, 
included in the data pool for analysis at the final evaluation stage.  
 
9 Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesired clinical responses or complication 
experienced by a subject. All operative and postoperative adverse events, whether related 
or not, will be documented on the AE case report form (CRF). 
9.1 Criteria for Safety Assessment 
 Vital sign monitoring, physical examination (swelling, tenderness, range of motion, and 
pain), and laboratory evaluations will be car ried out to determine the safety of the 
investigational product. When an adverse event occurs, the type, the severity, dates of the 
onset and resolution of the adverse event, and the relationship between the investigational 
product and the adverse event will be investigated and documented on the case report form. 
Causality of the adverse events will be de termined according to the following criteria: 
9 Not related: the adverse experience is defi nitely not related to the investigational 
product 
9 Unlikely: there are other, more likely ca uses and the investigational product is not 
suspected as a cause 
9 Suspected, reasonable possibility: the direct  cause and effect relationship between 
the drug and the adverse event has not been  demonstrated but there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event was caused by the drug. 
9 Probable: there probably is a direct ca use and effect relationship between the 
adverse event and the investigational product

MEDIPOST Co., Lt  Certainty of causal relationship between th e adverse event and the investigational 
product (or any other reasons – progression of an underlying disease, concomitant therapy, 
etc.) will be determined on the basis of how well the adverse event could be explained in 
light of the following factors: 
9 Known pharmacological effect and mechanism of the investigational product 
9 Similar events previously reported for the investigational product or other 
substances of the same class  
9 Drug reactions frequently reported with similar medications 
9 Events that are temporally associated with the investigational product (events that 
are resolved once the drug is discontinued but  reappear with the next administration) 
The study will be under ongoing periodic reviews by an assigned Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC). An IDMC will independently review data on a periodic 
basis as detailed in the IDMC charter. Serious AEs will be reported to the IDMC as outlined 
in the IDMC charter. The IDMC will make re commendations to the Sponsor as to whether 
the trial should be revised or closed.

1. Composition of Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) 
In the present clinical trial study for Evaluation of Safety and Exploratory Efficacy of 
CARTISTEM®, Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) consists of 3 members who are 
experts in the area of orthopedics, cell therap ies or biostatistics. The members will be 
independent from the sponsor, IRB, regulatory agencies, principal investigator, co-principal 
or sub-principal investigator, site investigator , site sub-investigator, steering committee 
membership, advisory board membership, CEC membership, clinical care of the study 
subjects, or any other capacity related to the present clinical trial operations. 
 
2. Frequency of DSMB meetings 
DSMB meets periodically to review aggregate and individual subject data related to 
safety, data integrity and overall conduct of th e trial. DSMB meetings will be organizational 
face-to-face and quarterly telec onferences. However, given the small sample size for the 
present clinical study, the DSMB meetings will  be flexible and based on enrollment of 
patients.    
According to the schedule, the DSMB mee tings will be required 1) for protocol 
revision, 2) before the dosage B started and 3) to  review a draft final report after 12 month 
follow-up period.  
 
3. Information to be reviewed at each meeting  
In order for the DSMB members to review all the information at each meeting, 
guidance for the conduct of safety and effect iveness analyses, protocol modification if 
applicable, and guidelines/stopping rules will be established prior to the DSMB’s first 
evaluation of data. The DSMB will review data unblinded fashion.   
The DSMB will also consider data from ot her studies or external sources during its 
deliberations, if available, as these results may have a profound impact on the status of the 
patients and design of the present study.

1 SYNOPSIS 
Title of Study:  Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of givinostat in ambulant patients 
with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy   
Acronym  EPIDYS – Epigenetic Rescue of Dystrophi n Dysfunction  
Protocol Number : DSC/14/2357/48  
Study Design:  Randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled study.  
Subjects will be randomised 2:1 to givinostat  or placebo.  
Investigators/Study 
Sites: Approximately 50 sites worldwide   
Phase of 
Development:  3 
Objectives:  Primary objective:  
 To establish the effects of givinostat versus placebo 
administered chronically over 18 months to slow disease 
progression in ambulant DMD subjects . 
Secondary objectives:  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of givinostat versus 
placebo administered chronically in DMD subjects.  
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of givinostat 
administered chronically in DMD subjects ;  
 To evaluate the impact on quality of life an d activities of daily 
living of givinostat versus placebo administered chronically.  
Secondary exploratory objectives:  
 To evaluate the correlation between PK profile of givinostat 
and pharmacodynamics (PD) data;  
 To explore whether the effects of givinostat  versus placebo 
administered chronically may be related to the type of DMD 
mutation or to the biomarkers.

 Page 8 of 120 Planned Sample 
Size: The primary, target population for formal statistical analysis and 
inference is those children with a baseline vastus lateralis muscle fat 
fraction (VL MFF) assessed by MR S  in the range >5% and ≤30% 
(Group A) . A total of 110 male ambulant subjects in this target 
population will be randomised . Up to 50 subjects (about 35% of the 
overall population ) outside of the target may also  be recruited into 
the study  (Group B) .  The overall subject population ( Group A + 
Group B)   will provide supportive data.   
Stratification:  Subjects will be stratified for their concomitant use of steroids in 
4 strata: 
1. Deflazacort Daily regimen  
2. Deflazacort  Intermittent regimen  
3. Other steroids Daily regimen  
4. Other steroids Intermittent regimen  
Randomisation 
ratio:  2:1  
Study duration for 
participants:  The study duration is planned for 19 months.  
The study comprises 2 phases:

continue the current dose.  
If subjects (i.e. those already in treatment or those who will be 
randomized under protocol version 6.0, or 7.0 or 8.0 ) gain weight 
during the study the drug dose must be kept unchanged . If  subjects 
(i.e. those already in treatment or those who will be randomized 
under protocol version 6.0, or 7.0 or 8.0 ) lose weight during the 
study, the drug dose should be adjusted accordingly.

Pharmacokinetic : 
The concentration of givinostat and its metabolites will be 
determined from the plasma samples using a validated analytical 
method. 
Safety: 
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by monitoring hematology 
and blood chemistry , coagulation, urinalysis; by measurement of 
vital signs, physical exa minations, weight, height, echocardiogram  
(ECHO) and electrocardiogram  (ECG) recording ; and by respiratory 
function evaluation, cognitive function evaluation, and by adverse 
events (AEs) recording  to be performed at protocol -specified visits . 
In addition, the evaluation of acceptability/palatability of the oral

If the repeated test is accep table, the subject can resume 
treatment.);   
 hemoglobin  ≤8.0 g/dL ( to avoid laboratory errors and 
anomalous values, hemoglobin  ≤8.0 g/dL must be confirmed 
with a repeated test performed on the nex t working day.  The 
treatment should be stopped until the retest result becomes 
available.  If the repeated hemoglobin is still ≤8.0 g/dL , study 
drug must be permanently discontinued.  If the repeated test 
is acceptable, the subject can resume treatment.).   
Study drug should be temporarily  stopped if any of the following 
occur: 
 moderate or severe diarrhoea (i.e., increase more than 4 stools 
per day); 
 platelets count <75 x 109/L but >50 x 109/L (the treatment 
should be temporarily stopped and a platelets count has to be

normalized);  
 white blood cell  <3.0 x 109/L but >2.0 x 109/L (the treatment 
should be temporarily stopped and white blood cells have to 
be measured by 1 week and re -tested until whit e blood cells  
will be normalized);

(the treatment should be temporarily stopped and  
triglycerides has to be measured every 2 weeks until 
triglycerides return to levels below 300mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L) ; 
Dose adjustment:  In case the study drug is temporarily stopped, the study drug can be 
resumed at a level 20% smaller (see table below) than the one at 
which the AE leading to temporary stop occurred, once platelets 
and/or white blood cell and/or hemoglobin  are normalized  and/or 
triglycerides return to levels  below 300 mg/dL  (3.42 mmol/L ) or 
diarrhoea is mild.

In addition, in case a subject will have a consistent (e.g., at least 2 
consecutive evaluations) platelets count ≤150 x 109/L and not 
meeting the stopping criteria for platelets, the Investigator will have 
to reduce the dose by 20% of the current dose.  
Only one dose reduction is allowed during the treatment period.  
Subjects who were randomized under protocol version 4.0, will 
continue to follow the instructions of protocol version 4.0 , related to 
starting dose and dose modifications :   
In case the study drug was temporarily stopped, the study drug can 
be resumed at a level 1/3 smaller (see table below) than the one at 
which the  AE leading to temporary stop occurred, once platelets 
and/or white blood cell and/or hemoglobin  are normalized  and/or 
triglycerides return to levels  below 300 mg/dL  (3.42 mmol/L ) or

In addition, in case a subject will have a consistent (e.g., at least 2 
consecutive evaluations) platelets count ≤150 x 109/L and not 
meeting the stopping criteria for platelets, the Investigator will have 
to reduce the dose of 1/3 of the current dose . 
Moreover, for subjects who have already  reduced the dose of 1/3 an 
additional reduction by  20%  is allowed for safety reasons .  
For all subjects , during the first month of treatment, platelets count 
assessment will be performed weekly, while during the second 
month it will be performed every 2 weeks, in order to strictly 
monitor this parameter for safety reasons.  
If the dose is reduced due to platelet count ≤150 x 109/L, and/or 
white blood cell  <3.0 x 109/L and/or hemoglobin <10.0 mg/dL, a

 Page 14 of 120 Any decision relevant to the dose adjustment and/or modification of 
schedule of assessments can be discussed with the Medical Monitor , 
but the final decision remains with the Investigator only or its 
authorized designee  
Other: As the subjects to be randomised are on stable steroids, the 
recommended national immunisation schedule, including varicella 
immunity, should be completed (i.e., as recommended in the 
“Diagnosis and Management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy” 
DMD gui deline4), before the Screening Visit. However, in case of 
live or live attenuated vaccines to be administered during the study, 
the Investigator can discuss, but it is not mandatory, the case with the 
Medical Monitor of the study and must carefully monitor the subject.  
Independent Data 
Monitoring 
Committee:  An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review, 
evaluate and categorise safety f indings every 3 months during the 
study and will be responsible for  oversight of the formal interim 
analysis (see below).  The IDMC will have access to unblinded data, 
if necessary, and will operate according to the rules defined in the 
IDMC charter.  
Sample size 
calculation:  The sample size (utilizing a 2:1 randomisation scheme) is calculated 
to provide 90% power and a 1 -sided alpha of 2.5% to detect a true 
difference between givinostat and placebo  in the target population , in 
4SC 18 month change from baseline, of 3 seconds, assuming a 
common standard deviation (SD) of 6 seconds. The estimated SD is 
based on publicly available Phase 3 study data on ataluren and 
drisapersen in subjects with DMD in addition to i nternal Italfarmaco 
S.p.A data . 
 
Vastus late ralis muscles fat fraction (VL MFF) assessed via MR S is 
the first key endpoint in the MR cohort  and will be formally assessed 
in the target population at 12 months .  Based on internal  Italfarmaco 
S.p.A. data, a total of N=99 subjects will be sufficient to provide 
80% power to detect a 55% reduction in the annual mean increase in 
MFF (of 6.6%) with givinostat as compared to placebo with a 1 -
sided alpha of 2.5% and assuming an SD for the change from 
baseline in MFF of 6%.  
 
The pre-planned interim analysis was performed in January 2020, 
concluding that futility was not met and the trial should continue, and 
thus a pre -planned blinded sample size re -calculation was performed .  
The within treatment SD  for the change in 4SC from baseline to 18 
month was estimat ed to be 3.094 seconds, approximately half of the 
SD that as assumed in the original power calculation .  With this 
revised SD estimate, N= 102 (on  2:1 basis) subjects is sufficient to 
provide 90% power to detect a true difference in 4SC of 2 seconds 
between givinostat and placebo  in the target population at a 1-sided 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 15 of 120 alpha of 2.5% .  With an estimated drop -out rate of 8%, a total of 110 
subjects in the target population (Group A) will be randomized.  
 
For the MR cohort, the blinded SD estimate  was 5.941%, being in 
line with SD assumed in the original power calculation for VLFF, 
hence all the subjects in the target population will be included in the 
analysis of the MR cohort.  
 
Interim analysis:  One formal interim analys is is planned and will be overseen by the 
IDMC in order to ensure study integrity ; this is to assess futility on 
VLFF and, if not futile, esecute a blinded sample size reestimation.  
Statistical Methods 
and Planned 
Analyses:  An IDMC charter will be prepared to describe the role, function and 
operations of the IDMC and the rules to be used when reviewing 
interim data.  
 
The planned interim analysis will be performed when the first N=50 
subjects randomised in the target populati on have reached the 12 
month time point.  In this interim analysis, the IDMC will evaluate 
the effects of givinostat versus placebo on the VL MFF in terms of 
futility. Futility will be considered if VLMFF in the givinostat group 
is equal to or worse than t hat seen in the placebo group since the 
biologic plausibility of a subsequent treatment effect on 4SC tim e 
would be greatly diminished. The IDMC will only communicate to 
the Sponsor whether the study should proceed or it should be stopped 
having met the fu tility criteria.  
If the IDMC indicates that the study should proceed, a blinded 
sample size re -estimation will be conducted for MFF and 4SC in the 
target population as follows:  
 To maintain the blind on the primary endpoint, the within treatment 
SD for the change from baseline will be estimated as   𝝈̂𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏 =
√𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍𝟐−(𝜟
𝟐)𝟐
 where 𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍   is the overall SD for the change 
from baseline in 4SC based on the n=50 subjects in the interim and 
𝛥 is the hypothesized treatment effect, i.e . 𝛥=3 seconds .   
Dependent upon the blinded SD estimate, the sample size may be 
decreased or increased to maintain 90% power. Any increase in 
sample size for 4SC will be limited to 1.5 times maximum of the 
initial target population sample size, i.e., to a  maximum of  
1.5×192 =288 subjects.  For a 20% increase in the SD, this 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 16 of 120 degree of increase in sample size will maintain 90% power, and for 
a 40% increase in SD power will be maintained at 80%.    
 With respect to VL MFF, a similar approach will be applied; 
the within treatment SD for the change from baseline will be 
estimated  as 𝝈̂𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏 =√  𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍𝟐−(𝜟
𝟐)𝟐
 where 𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍   is the 
overall SD for the change from baseline in MFF and 𝛥 is the 
hypothesized treatment effect, i.e.  𝛥=3.63% (i.e. 55% of 
6.6%).   Dependent upon the blinded SD estimate, the sample 
size may be decreased or increased to maintain 90% power. 
Any increase in sample size require to assess VL MFF will 
also be limited to 1.5 times the required target population 
sample size stated in the preceding power calculation, to a 
maximum of 1.5×99=150 subjects.  
At the interim futility analysis, there will be no efficacy assessment , 
no unblinded analysis of the primary endpoint and, hence, no alpha 
spend nor early stopping  of the  study for efficacy.  
The interim took place as planned on 14th January 2020 and included 
50 patients with 12 month data and 37 with 18 month data. The 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) meeting to review 
the VL MFF data for futility took place on 23rd January 2020 and 
concluded that futility was not met and the trial should continue.  
The sample size reassessment therefore took place, with estimated 
overall SDs of 3.094 seconds and 5.941% for the change from 
baseline in 4SC at 18  months and the change from baseline in VL 
MFF at 12 months respectively.   
 
The revised sample size (utilizi ng a 2:1 randomisation scheme) N= 
102 was calculated to provide 90% power and a 1 -sided alpha of 
2.5% to detect a true difference between givinostat and placebo  in 
the target population, in 4SC 18 month change from baseline , of 2 
seconds, with the blinded SD estimates during the interim analysis of 
3.094 seconds.  With an estimated drop -out rate of 8%, a total of 110 
subjects in the target population (Group A) will be randomized.  
For the MR cohort, since the blinded SD estimate  was 5.941%, all 
the subjects in the target population will be part of the MR cohort.  
Since the interim only assessed futility on VLFF and executed  a 
blinded sample size reestimation, no alpha was spent and, hence the 
analysis of the primary endpoint conducted at the end of the trial will 
continue to be assessed at the 0.025 1 -sided level.

  08 April 2020 
 Page 17 of 120 All efficacy analyses will be performed on Intent -To-Treat (ITT) 
population.  Formal efficacy analyses will be performed in the target 
population; overall population analyses will be supportive and 
informal.  Randomised subjects who have taken at least 1 dose of 
randomised  therapy will be included in the relevant analyses.  
Descriptive statistics for qualitative data will include frequency 
tabulation and presentation of percentages.  Descriptive statistics for 
quantitative data will include mean and SD or geometric mean, 
coefficient of variation, median and interquartile range.  
A comprehensive SAP will be prepared prior to the planned interim 
analysis to provide full details of all planned analyses and 
methodology.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The change in 4 -stairs climb (4SC ) from baseline to 18 months will 
be evaluated  in the target population . The data will be analyzed using 
an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with the change in 
4SC from baseline to 18 months as the dependent variable and with 
terms for baseline 4SC va lue as a covariate and randomised 
treatment , concomitant steroid use and age at baseline as independent 
class variables.  Least squares means (Lsmeans) will be estimated for 
givinostat and placebo.  The treatment effect, being difference in 
Lsmeans, will b e presented along with the associated 95% 
confidence interval and the p -value.   Significance will be achi eved if 
the 1-sided p-value is ≤0.0 25.   
Analysis of   Key Secondary Endpoints  
Formal analyses of functional secondary endpoints  (i.e.,cumulative 
loss of function in the NSAA,  change  in 6MWT, NSAA, time to rise 
from floor and muscle strength by knee extension and elbow flexion) 
and Vastus lateralis MFF will be performed in the target population 
at 18 months using the same approach  as described for the  primary 
endpoint.  Possible need for log transformation of these variables 
will be assessed prior to unblinding by assessment of ANCOVA 
model residuals without a treatment effect term.   
Safety Data  
Safety data will be evaluated descriptively.  All subjec ts (target and 
off-target population combined)  who took at least 1 dose of study 
drug will be included in the summary of safety.  The following 
parameters will be summarized: rates of discontinuation, AEs, and 
laboratory abnormalities.  Adverse event data will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Competent Activities (MedDRA).  Summary 
statistics will be presented for changes in vital signs.  Laboratory test 
values will be summarised similarly, but will also include tabulation 
of the number of subjects  shifting from within the reference range at

4.1 B ackground on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare degenerative, X-linked recessive genetic 
disorder with estimated incidence of 1 in 5000 live births (Mendell, J. R., et al.1), caused by 
mutations in the dystrophin gene.  In DMD, mutations in the dystrophin gene disrupt the 
open-reading frame, resulting in an absence of functional dystrophin, a critically important 
pa
rt of the protein complex that connects the cytoskeletal actin of a muscle fiber to the 
extracellular matrix.   
L
ack of dystrophin causes repetitive muscle damage.  In a normal muscle, the physiological 
re
pair process removes the damaged muscle fibers and reconstitutes normal muscle fibers.  In 
DMD
, on the other hand, the repair process leads to a combination of new muscle fibers, fatty 
replacement and fibrosis, with the two latter components progressively prevailing as a process 
called fibroadipose degeneration.  This detrimental outcome typically compromises muscle 
function, alters the tissue environment, and probably limits the potential effectiveness of 
re
generative approaches.   As described by Peverelli et al.2, fibrosis is already significant at 
one
 year of age in DMD patients constituting approximately 16% of a muscle biopsy (3% in 
age matched controls) and remains relatively constant until 7 years of age.  At this age, there 
is 
an important increase in the proportion of fibrosis that reaches approximately 30% of 
muscle biopsy between 7 and 10 years of age.  Similarly MRI studies have shown that fat 
infiltration is already present at 5 years of age and constantly increases (Forbes, et al.3). 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive symmetrical muscular 
weakness that affects proximal muscles more than distal muscles, often accompanied by calf 
muscle pseudo hypertrophy.   
Significant motor deficits may be present during the first year of life, but diagnosis is usually 
made between the ages of 3 to 5 years when the affected patients begin to show waddling gait, 
toe walking, and difficulty climbing stairs.  Over time, ambulation becomes increasingly 
abnormal, and by 8 years of age, most patients lose the ability to rise from the floor and climb 
stairs, and often fall while walking.  By 12 to 14 years of age, most lose the ability to walk 
and the heart and respiratory muscles also are affected.  Upper limb, cardiac, and

 Page 28 of 120 diaphragmatic muscles progressively weaken during adolescence.  After 18 years all patients 
are affected by cardiomyopathy.  Only few survive beyond the third decade; most patients die 
because of respiratory complications and heart failure due to cardiomyopathy.  There are still 
no 
curative treatments for such a debilitating disease and the current management of the 
disease is based on prevention and management of complications (Bushby, et al.4) . 
Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone or deflazacort) have been demonstrated to slow the rate of 
muscle weakness when initiated in ambulatory boys,  however, the use of corticosteroids is 
limited by all the potential side effects, including weight gain, cataracts, osteopenia, and 
avascular necrosis (Manzur, A, et al.5).  Recently, the European Medicines Agency has 
granted a conditional approval to Ataluren, which targets nonsense mutations as the cause of 
DMD
, which is relevant for only 13% of DMD population, or approximately 2,000 patients in 
the United States (US) and 2,500 patients in the European Union (EU).   
In addition, FDA has granted an accelerated approval to Eteplirsen and Golodirsen, which 
targets DMD gene mutations skippable with exon 51 skipping and exon 53 skipping, 
re
spectively, which are relevant for only 21 % of DMD population, or approximately 3,200 
pa
tients in the United States (US).   
Ataluren, Eteplirsen and Golodirsen are  the first of a number of treatments that are aimed at 
cor
recting the original genetic defect in the dystrophin gene.   
Genetic Duchenne therapy via AAV Micro-dystrophin  may be promising.  
I
n light of the above considerations, it becomes evident that an unmet therapeutic need exists 
for
 the treatment of this disabling and fatal condition. 
4.2 B ackground on Givinostat 
Zinc dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a class of 11 isoenzymes associated with 
numerous nuclear repressor complexes that, once recruited to specific sites of euchromatin, 
maintain nucleosome histones in a state of deacetylation so that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
remains tightly bound and inaccessible to transcription factors for gene expression.  In 
contrast, inhibition of HDAC results in hyperacetylation of these histones and allows the 
unraveling of DNA sufficient for the binding of transcription factors and the synthesis of 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).  
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 29 of 120 Some HDACs may shuttle between nucleus and cytosol in a stimulus-dependent way or may 
have a predominantly cytosolic localization, where they affect the post-translational 
modification of cytosolic proteins (Choudhary C et al. 20096). 
Givinos
tat is an orally active hydroxamic acid derivative possessing a potent HDAC (Class I 
and II) inhibitory activity.  As potent and specific inhibitor of the HDAC enzymes, givinostat 
shares the anti-tumor properties of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)- class, i.e., 
cell-cycle inhibition, induction of apoptosis and stimulation of cell-differentiation. 
In the clinic, the HDACi doses required to achieve efficacy in cancer patients are generally 
poorly tolerated and dose-limiting toxicities include thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract adverse events (AEs), and fatigue (Guha 20157).  While reactivation of epigenetically 
silenced tumor suppressors apparently requires high concentrations of HDACi, some gene 
promoters may be affected at much lower and better tolerated doses.  It has been suggested 
that regulators of cell fate decisions in stem or progenitor cells are under the control of 
promoters that are in a poised, “bivalent” state, characterized by the simultaneous presence of 
both chromatin activation and silencing marks, within the same regulatory region (Azuara, 
Perry et al. 20068; Bernstein, Mikkelsen et al. 20 069).  Exposure to low doses of HDACi may, 
in these cases, tip the balance and redirect differentiation programs.  Dystrophin interacts with 
a group of peripheral membrane and transmembrane proteins through the C-terminal domain 
to form the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which provides the molecular 
link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix of skeletal myofibers that i s 
disrupted in dystrophic muscle (Ervasti 200710).  As such, DAPC supports sarcolemmal 
integrity during muscle contraction.  Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is an important 
component of the DAPC.  Nitric oxide (NO) produced by nNOS was shown to specifically 
inactivate HDAC2 via S-nitrosylation of a cysteine residue (Colussi, Mozzetta et al. 200811).  
This mechanism is dysfunctional in dystrophic muscle, leading to aberrantly upregulated 
HDAC activity.  There are at least two distinct mechanisms by which this upregulation 
impinges pathologically on cell fate decisions during muscle regeneration (Consalvi, Saccone 
et al. 201112):  
1. Resident muscle interstitial cells fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) retain the ability 
to turn into fibroadipocytes in response to signals released by degenerating muscles.

 Page 30 of 120 These cells affect differentiation of muscle satellite cells into muscle fibers through 
secretion of follistatin, the endogenous antagonist of the most potent inhibitor of 
skeletal myogenesis, myostatin.  Direct inhibition of myostatin or delivery of 
follistatin exerted similar beneficial effects in mdx mice, the mouse model of DMD.  
The follistatin gene promoter is controlled by HDAC2 in muscle cells (Minetti, 
Colussi et al. 200613) and direct inhibition of HDAC2 by HDACi, or inactivation by 
either NO donors or by reconstitution of the dystrophin-NO signaling leads to 
derepression of follistatin, which mediates the ability of HDACi and NO signaling to 
stimulate myogenesis in vitro and counters muscle degeneration in mdx mice. 
2. Hist one deacetylase inhibitors may directly stimulate the myogenic differentiation of 
FAPs.  The HDAC inhibition induces two core components of the myogenic 
transcriptional machinery, MyoD and BAF60C, and up-regulates the myogenic miRs 
(myomiRs) (miR-1.2, miR-133, and miR-206), which target the alternative BAF60 
variants BAF60A and BAF60B, ultimately promoting promyogenic differentiation 
while suppressing the fibro-adipogenic phenotype (Saccone, Consalvi et al. 201414).  
Histone deacetylase inhibitors, therefore, seem to derepress a ‘‘latent’’ myogenic 
pr
ogram in FAPs from dystrophic muscles, at least at early stages of disease. 
By inhibiting several pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], 
interleukin-1 beta [ IL-1β], interferon gamma [IFN-γ], Interleukin-6 [ IL-6], and Interleukin 12 
[IL-12]), givinostat also reduces the production and activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(L
eoni, F et al. 200515 and Joosten, L. A., F. Leoni, et al 201116).  Pro-inflammatory cytokines 
have been shown to inhibit muscle satellite cells differentiation into muscle fibers in DMD, 
thus contributing to the impaired muscle regeneration in this disease (Boldrin et al, 201517, 
Tierney et al. 201418, Dol es, Olwin, 201419)  
Experimentally, the preclinical effectiveness of givinostat was demonstrated in mouse models 
with muscular dystrophy, such as the mdx mice .  Givinostat produced beneficial functional 
and morphological effects, such as increased cross-sectional area of myofibers, decreased 
inflammatory infiltrate,  and prevention of fibrotic scars, which contribute to counter the 
muscle loss and the functional decline that are typically observed in mdx mice (see Section 
4.2.1).

 Page 31 of 120 4.2.1 Nonclin ical Studies  
A standard nonclinical program composed of safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, single 
and repeat dose toxicity, mutagenicity/genotoxicity, reprotoxicity and juvenile toxicity studies 
has already been carried out to support the oral administration of givinostat to adult and 
paediatric subjects.  Details of each study are available in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). 
I
n summary, in rats the predominant toxicities at the highest doses were hematologic, with 
larger decreases in white blood cells (WBC) (-84% males, -78% females) and smaller effects 
on red blood cells (RBC) (-10% males, -5% females) and platelets (-16% males, -11% 
females).  It has to be pointed out, that this toxicity pattern is different from what is observed 
clinically in humans, where thrombocytopenia and not leukopenia is dose-limiting, suggesting 
a different sensitivity of the hematopoietic lineage in rats versus humans. 
Non-hematologic toxicity in rats included changes in blood chemistry: decrease in total 
proteins, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and increase in 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, urea, creatinine and triglycerides.  All of thes e 
changes were modest (equal to or less than 50%), their extent overlapped with control animals 
and they were not considered of toxicological significance.  Lower weight of liver, spleen and 
adrenals was also observed.  In all cases the underlying histopathological changes were 
minimal.  All pathologic effects trended toward reversibility or completely reversed following 
the recovery period.   
In contrast to rats, in the 39-week study in monkeys, hematologic toxicities were of minor 
significance, with a minimal decrease in RBC counts seen during and at the end of the 
treatment period at the high dose only.  A dose-related decrease in weight of the thymus was 
observed in both sexes at all doses.  Histologically, an increased incidence of minimal 
involution/atrophy was observed in high-dose animals.  In animals at recovery, the decrease 
of thymus weight was minimal, whilst no histological changes were noted.  The dose of 
12 mg/kg/day was therefore defined as the No-Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) under the 
c
onditions used in the present study, even if the compound was well tolerated also at the 
highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day.  Similar effects on thymus weight were reported also for other

 Page 32 of 120 HDACi and are likely reflective of the known and well-characterized cytostatic mechanism of 
action of high doses of these compounds (Kerr, Galloway et al. 201020).   
Additional findings of possible toxicological relevance included minimal effects on hepatic 
enzymes (ALT, AST), triglycerides, and bilirubin.  Some of these effects were observed at 
int
ermediate examination (Week 20) and partially recovered at the end of the treatment 
period.  Treatment-related effects were observed at the high dose also in the bone marrow and 
liver.  The bone marrow showed slightly reduced cellularity in two animals given 
30 mg/kg/day.  Also this effect can be ascribed to the well-characterized cytostatic 
mec
hanism of action of high doses of the HDACi (Kerr, Galloway et al. 201020). The liver 
showed minimal bile duct hyperplasia in two male animals out of four, receiving 
30mg/kg/day, whilst males from the others dose-groups and females at all doses were 
unaffected.  After recovery, a similar finding was still noted in a single animal. 
Givinostat is eliminated for approximately 50% in faeces after IV administration of 
14C-ITF2357 to rats, highlighting the quantitative importance of the biliary excretion route.  
In addition, a more intensive biotransformation occurs in animal species with respect to 
humans as shown in in vitro metabolic stability tests with hepatocytes of different species 
(Intrinsic Clearance (µL/min*106 cells: humans=4.0; monkey=25.4; dog=32.4; rat=33.8; 
mouse=42.0). 
Thus, the bile duct hyperplasia is likely to be the result of a pronounced metabolism and 
excretion of givinostat in the preclinical species, which is also associated with increased 
plasma bilirubin levels.  Therefore, this finding can be easily monitored in humans.  Of note, 
no increase of hepatic enzyme or bilirubin was recorded in approximately 450 subjects treated 
so far; bilirubin levels are also monitored clinically in DMD subjects with, so far, no evidence 
for significant alterations, providing no confirmation for the occurrence of analogous 
toxicities in humans. 
The maximum observed concentration (C max) and area under the curve ( AUC) safety margins 
were calculated using the NOAEL of 10 mg/kg /day obtained in rats after 6 months of 
administration, the NOAEL of 12 mg/kg /day obtained after exposing monkeys for 39 
consecutive weeks , a nd the actual human data obtained in the clinical study in DMD subjects  
(Study DSC/11/2357/43) after 12 month the administration of 37.5 mg twice daily (bid ) (i.e.,

 Page 33 of 120 Cmax approximately 104 ng/mL and AUC approximately 1144 ng*h/mL).  The human 
exposure achieved at this dose level is the exposure to be used in this study 
(DSC/14/2357/48).  Only data from male animals were considered since DMD occurs in male 
subjects. 
Safety ratios calculated using data from both the animal species used in toxicology studies 
differed quite markedly one from the other.  The rat to human exposure margins ( Table 1) 
were 0.16 (C max) and 0.04 (AUC) at the human exposure considered (i.e., C max approximately 
100 ng/mL and AUC approximately 1150 ng*h/mL), while the exposure margins C max and 
AUC were larger for monkeys than those seen in rats.  The C max ratio was about 2.4 fold and 
the mean AUC ratio was 0.34.  A more intensive biotransformation is observed in rats and 
monkeys as evidenced by the larger intrinsic clearance and the shorter half-life of givinostat 
in rats and monkeys compared to humans.

NOAEL=  no-observed-adverse-effect-level; DMD = Duchenne muscular dystrophy; C max= maximum observed 
concentration; AUC 0-4 = area under the curve (over the first 4 hours)  
Even though the safety margin between NOAEL in non-clinical studies/paediatric DMD 
exposure, are <1 (except for C max monkey), the main findings observed in non-clinical 
toxicology studies (e.g., reduction in white blood cells, cellularity reduction in bone marrow, 
reduced thymus weight, and bile duct hyperplasia) were observed at high doses of givinostat 
(e.g., rats, 90-160-250 mg/kg/day depending on the treatment duration; dogs, 50 mg/kg/day; 
and 
monkeys, 30-90 mg/kg/day); all of them, as described above, can and will be carefully 
monitored during this clinical study. 
A post-weaning study in young rats treated with givinostat 20 to 180 mg/kg/day for 4 we eks 
was also performed and showed a toxicological profil e similar to that seen in adult animals.  
Givinostat did not affect the behavioral and physical development and reproductive 
performance of pups .  The NOAEL in this study was 60 mg/kg/day.  
C
oncerning the safety pharmacology, givinostat has a favorable profile.  The IC50 of 
givinostat in the in vitro hERG assay was 1.4 µM.  At 3 and 10 µM, givinostat increased the

 Page 34 of 120 action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization during bradycardia, although not in a 
statis
tically significant manner.  Givinostat did not induce any marked changes in heart rate, 
electrocardiogram ( ECG) int ervals , or  waveform at any dose in in vivo, in a cardiovascular 
study in dogs .  The combined evidence from these in vitro and in vivo studies plus the lack of 
accumulation of drug in the heart as seen in tissue distribution studies, suggest that the drug is 
unlikely to exert any cardiovascular side effect at therapeutic doses.  The maximal circulating 
concentrations seen in subjects both adults and paediatric  subjects receiving the highest doses 
of givinostat were generally below 100 -150 ng/mL (200- 300  nM) of total givinostat, 
corresponding to 5 -7.5 ng/mL (10 -15 nM) of free givinostat, approximately 90 -140 fold less 
than the IC50 on hERG.  
Finally, givinostat was positive for frameshift mutations in the bacterial mutagenesis assay (2 
out of 5 strains), but givinostat did not display any genotoxicity/mutagenic potential in 
mammalian s in both i n vitro and in vivo studies.  
Nonclinical evidence supports a potential therapeutic role of givinostat in DMD.   
A
 dose-finding study using doses of givinostat ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg/day orally 
delivered daily for 3 months to mdx (i.e., murine model of DMD) mice (2 month old at the 
be
ginning of the treatment) was performed (Consalvi, et. Al 201212).  The  effect of these 
doses was compared to that of vehicle alone (oral delivered) or the HDACi TSA (0.6 mg/kg, 
i.p.) and assessed by monitoring total body weight during the time of exposure, the weight of 
single muscles at the end of the treatment, and by measuring muscle function (with treadmill 
test at specific time points during the treatment) CSA at the end of the treatment.  The results 
showed an increase of the weight of a single muscle analysed, a dose-dependent reduction of 
intramuscular fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrate ( by myeloperoxidase activity) and a dose -
related in crease of muscle mass and fibers CSA.  All these histological effects translated into 
an improvement in function as assessed by monitoring the performance of mdx mice on a 
treadmill test at defined time points during the treatment.  To further elucidate the relationship 
between givinostat exposure and effects on muscle tissue and on performance, a 
pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis was conducted.  The PK/PD analysis 
showed that at least a blood AUC 0-24 of 600 nmol*h/L ( i.e., corresponding to  300 ng*h/mL)

4.2.2 Clinical Experience with Givinostat Including Risks and Benefits 
C
ompleted and updated data that describe the clinical experience with givinostat are reported 
in Section 6 “Effects in Humans” of the current Investigator Brochure Dossier related 
to ITF2357. 
Givinostat has been tested in a number of clinical studies in adults and paediatric populations.  
Three major indications have been explored with Givinostat, chronic inflammatory diseases, 
neuromuscular disorder and oncology.  The maximum administered dose was a single dose of 
600 mg in healthy volunteers and up to 400 mg once per week in subjects with multiple 
myeloma.  Doses up to approximately 100 mg bid were generally well tolerated in adults.  In 
paediatric subjects, doses up to 0.75 mg/kg bid have been administered for up to 6 months 
(w
ith 1 additional subject having been treated for 2 years and 7 months) in patients with 
J
uvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.  In subjects with DMD enrolled in study DSC/11/2357/43 (i.e., 
subjects between 7 and 10 years of age at study start), the maximum dose administered in the 
dose escalation phase was 50 mg bid for up to 2 weeks i.e., while the maximum dose 
administered for up to 1 year in the second part of the study was 37.5 mg bid.  Since, 
clearance increases with increased weight (see Section 8.2.1) doses have been increased in the 
e
xtension phase of study DSC/11/2357/43 due to the increase in weight of the enrolled 
children; as a result the maximum dose administered in this extension phase is  60 mg  bid.  
The most common AEs observed were thrombocytopenia, as well as gastrointestinal 
toxicities.  Adverse events were generally mild to moderate and reversible upon 
discontinuation of study drug.  Moreover, dose-dependent asymptomatic and reversible 
platelets count reductions were observed both in healthy volunteers and subjects treated with 
givinostat.  These decreases typically occurred within the first week after treatment initiation, 
reached a nadir after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment, and then remained at a plateau (see the IB, 
Section 7).  The majority of thrombocytopenic events were mild in severity with fewer than 
10% of subjects developing platelets count below 75 x 109/L.  All occurrences resolved 
completely within 2 to 3 weeks of discontinuation of treatment, suggesting a rapidly 
reversible effect. Overall, sixteen haemorrhagic drug-related AEs were reported by 14 patients 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 36 of 120 in the completed clinical trials with Givinostat. However, only in seven of these cases the 
haemorrhagic drug-related AE occurred in patients with concomitant thrombocytopenia; these 
were all oncology patients and in some of these patients thrombocytopenia up to grade 4 was 
already present before givinostat treatment start. In all the remaining cases (nine 
haemorrhagic drug-related AEs occurred in seven subjects) platelet counts at the time of the 
haemorrhagic AE were either within the normal range or above the upper limit of normal 
range. None of the above summarized drug-related hemorrhagic episodes were observed in 
DMD subjects.  
Therefore, g iven these known effects of HDAC inhibitors including Givinostat a thorough 
monitoring of haematologic parameters  will be implemented in order to avoid the occurrence 
of severe thrombocyt openia (see Section  12.8). 
I
n addition, during the study particular attention will be paid in monitoring possible effects on 
QTc (see Table 6:    Schedule of Assessments  for details), since some episodes (21 episodes in 
15 subjects) of Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation have been recorded during the 
clinical studies performed so far.  It is worth noting that 90% of the recorded events were 
reported in oncological studies in subjects treated at highest doses (e.g., ≥100 mg/daily) and 
no events were recorded during the previous study in DMD subjects. 
C
oncerning the clinical experience in DMD, the aforementioned histological results observed 
in the mdx mouse model were replicated in a Phase 2 study of givinostat (Study 
DSC/11/2357/43, EudraCT n. 2012-002566-12) in 20 ambulant DMD subjects (from 7 to 
10 years of age at study start, on stable steroid treatment) where, after one year of treatment, 
the 
muscle biopsy analysis showed a significant increase in muscle fibers area fraction 
(MFAF) and a significant reduction of muscle necrosis, fatty replacement and fibrosis.  
Analysis of the effect on CSA of the muscle fibers showed that givinostat significantly 
incr
eases CSA of all type of fibers (small, medium, large) in a similar manner and that such 
effect on CSA predicts the increase in MFAF and the reduction of fibrosis.  In addition, an 
increase in the number of regenerating fibers and satellite cells was observed.  Moreover, 
descriptive analysis conducted on the secondary efficacy endpoints on muscle function (i.e., 
six-minute walking test [6MWT ], North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA], time function 
tests and pulmonary function tests) showed an overall stability after 1 year of treatment in this 
population.

the clinical safety and pre-clinical toxicology studies and for the efficacy results in the 
previous Phase 2 DMD study. 
4.2.3 R ationale of the study 
Nonc
linical studies have shown that givinostat has a potent anti-inflammatory effect (see 
(current IB) and that HDACi regulate the transcription of a number of factors that are key in 
muscle regeneration, e.g., follistatin.  The combination of these effects is expected to re-
balance the repair process in DMD muscle towards increased muscle regeneration and 
reduced fatty infiltration and fibrosis.  Indeed, in a study in mdx mice and in a phase 2 study 
in DMD children, givinostat was shown to reduce muscle inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis 
a
nd to increase muscle regeneration. 
The
se results indicate that the induction of an active regeneration program, the reduction of 
adipose replacement and the enlargement of pre-existing muscle fibers are all key elements of 
givinostat ’s putative mechanism of action (MoA), supporting the potential therapeutic role of 
givinostat in counteracting muscle tissue degeneration, which occurs downstream of the 
g
enetic defect in DMD. 
On the basis of its putative MoA as described above, givinostat is expected to act at all stages 
of the disease and to counter the disease pathogenetic events in all muscular districts.  
However, as the fibers CSA enlarging effect appears key in givinostat ’s pharmacological 
effect, the functional benefit obtained will likely depend on the amount of muscle that is still 
pr
esent when therapy is started.   
In Study DSC/11/2357/43, in ambulant DMD subjects  ≥7 years of age on steroid for more 
than 6 months, only 50% of the muscle biopsy was occupied by muscle fibers at baseline with 
the remainder being represented mainly by fibrotic tissue.  Although after one year of 
treatment with givinostat, the histological results showed a significant increase in muscle 
fibers CSA and a significant improvement in all the histological parameters analyzed, the fact 
that already 50% of muscle was lost in these children suggests that givinostat should be 
started at an earlier age if the objective is to achieve a clinical benefit in terms of ambulation 
within a reasonable timeframe.  Several studies, however, have shown that ambulatory 
function naturally improves in children with DMD up to the age of 7 years (Goemans, 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 38 of 120 Klingels et al. 201322; McDonald, Henricson et al. 201323) suggesting that studies in DMD 
children <7 years of age may require larger numbers and a longer treatment duration to show 
a significant differen ce from placebo.  As a result all the pivotal studies in DMD ambulant 
children reported so far (e.g., Ataluren, Drisapersen, Tadalafil phase III trial ) have selected 
c
hildren who were expected to have a sufficient decline in ambulatory function after 1 year on 
plac
ebo based on age and 6 Minute Walk Test at baseline.  However, all these studies were 
not able
 to show a functional benefit of the tested drug versus placebo.   
Although a lack of efficacy cannot be ruled out, the poor therapeutic response observed in 
these studies could be the result of selecting a patient population characterized by a degree of 
functional impairment that may be less likely to benefit from treatment. This is also suggested 
by the fact that while ambulatory function improves up to the age of 7 years and then 
declines, the underlying muscle morphology constantly declines from the age of 5 years 
(Forbes, et al.3). A post-hoc analysis on study DSC/11/2357/43 suggests that children with a 
more
 preserved Vastus Lateralis (VL) muscle at baseline MRI (score 0 to 2 on a 0 to 5 semi-
quantitative MRI score, modified Mercuri’s score24) have  a lesser degree of functional decline 
2 years after start of givinostat treatment.  This is in line with data from the Imaging DMD 
group suggesting that changes from baselite at 1 year in VL Fat Fraction (FF) assessed by 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are correlated with Timed Function Tests  (TFTs) 
and 6MWT (Data on file).   These analyses, however, have also shown that children with a 
ba
seline MVL MFF <10% show very little change in any parameter (MRI/MRS or function) 
within 1 year. A more recent (i.e. July 2018) and detailed analysis of Imaging DMD data 
showe
d that patients with a baseline MRS VL FF up to 5% have little change in clinically 
relevant functional parameters such as 4 stairs climb after 1 and 2 years. Based on these data, 
the current protocol will select a population of subjects with a VL M FF >5% but ≤30% 
(corresponding approximately to a score >2 in the aforementioned 0 to 5 semi-quantitative 
MRI score Mercuri, et al. 200224) as this population is expected to still have enough muscle to 
build on and to have enough function decline in 18 months if on placebo.  Since the analyses 
of the Imaging DMD data (Data on file) also suggested that TFTs predict VL MFF, an 
algorhythm has been developed to identify at screening those children with a VL MFF within 
the required range.  However, the screening data colleted up to 18th June 2018  showed that the 
a
ccuracy of the algorithm was less predictive since it did not allow the selection of a  
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 39 of 120 population with the predefined range of VL FF that identified a population most likely to 
benefit from treatment. As a result, the algorhythm is removed and the selection of eligible 
subjects will be based on age and the functional tests at screening (see below). The 
assessment of VL FF at screening (range >5% to ≤30%), on the other end, will be used to 
identify the target population on which to perform the primary and key secondary analyses. 
The
 inclusion of an additional off -target population (up to 50 subjects) outside of the VL FF 
range of  >5% to ≤30% will provide supportive data . Considering the recent recommendations 
outl
ined in the EMA “Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the 
treatment of Duchenne and Becker muscular d ystrophy” (December 2015) and in the Federal 
Drug Administration ( FDA) draft guidance for industry “Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and 
related dystrophinopathies: developing drugs for treatment” (June 2015), the time to climb 4 
standard-sized stairs has been chosen to evaluate the efficacy of givinostat in slow down 
disease progression .  Timed function tests, such as time to climb 4 -stairs (4SC), to walk 10 m, 
and to stand up, are reliable and feasible in the majority of the DMD population from age 4 
and older  (McDonald, C. M., et al. 201325) and have a documented response to therapeutic 
intervention with steroids (Manzur AY, K. T., 200926).  In particular, time to climb 4 
standard-sized stairs is a TFT that represents stair climbing ability, a clinically meaningful 
function in and of itself.  It has been used as an endpoint in DMD studies for decades and the 
test is reproducible and simple to administer.  It is predictive of loss of stair climbing ability, 
loss of ambulation and time to 10% decline in ambulatory capacity (Bushby, K. 201127).  
F
urthermore, climbing stairs requires a greater range of motion (ROM) from the joints of the 
lower limb and greater muscle strength than 6MWT, which is a functional test more related to 
e
ndurance.  Therefore, in light of givinostat MoA (e.g., increase fibers CSA) the time to 4SC 
test is expected to be more appropriate to evaluate the efficacy of givinostat in DMD subjects . 
The
 key secondary endpoints (cumulative loss of function in the NSAA, change inTime to 
Rise from Floor, in NSAA, in 6MWT and in strength) include those parameters which are 
considered relevant in this population to corroborate the results obtained on the primary 
endpoint.  
Changes in MRS parameters will be also key endpoints.  Previous studies have shown that 
MRI can visualize structural alterations of muscle in muscular dystrophies (Willcocks, 201428, 
201629, Wren 200830, Bonati 201531) and have shown that fat fraction measured by MRI or

 Page 40 of 120 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) highly correlates with lower limb function.  
Although longitudinal data on MRI/MRS particularly from randomised clinical trials are still 
limited, a number of randomized clinical trials currently ongoing include magnetic resonance 
evaluations and both the FDA and EMA guidelines identify MRI/MRS as a potential 
biomarker. 
Finally safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics will be also assessed in the study for a 
proper risk-benefit evaluation of givinostat.

6 INV ESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
6.1 De scription of Overall Study Design and Plan 
This 
is a Phase 3, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study to evaluate 
the 
efficacy and safety of givinostat in ambulant subjects with DMD.  This study will include 
ambulant male paediatric subjects aged ≥6 years at baseline affected by DMD.  
A 
total of  110 subject s in the target population (Group A: subjects with a baseline vastus 
lateralis muscle fat fraction (VL MFF) assessed by MRS  in the range >5% and ≤30%) will be 
randomised.  Up to 50 subjects (about 35% of the overall population) outside of the target 
may also be recruited into the study (Group B: subjects with a baseline vastus lateralis muscle 
fat fraction (VL MFF) assessed by MRS  in the range ≤5% or >30%). Subjects who assent to 
participate in this study (if capable of doing so) and whose parent/legal guardian sign the 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) to participate will undergo pre-study screening assessments up 
to 4 weeks before the first scheduled dose of study drug.

regimen, DMD subjects will be randomised (2:1 ratio) to receive givinostat oral suspension 
10 mg/mL or placebo oral suspension bid (in a fed state) as described in Section 8.3. 
At randomisation, subjects will be stratified for their concomitant use of steroids in 4 strata: 
1. De flazacort Daily regimen 
2. De flazacort Intermittent regimen 
3. Othe r steroids Daily regimen 
4. Othe r steroids Intermittent regimen 
 The study duration is planned for 19 months and comprises 2 phases: 
1. S creening period: starting 4 weeks (± 2 weeks) before randomisation 
2. Tr eatment period: 18 months of treatment

 Page 44 of 120 Withdrawal Visit within 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  Subjects who have 
ongoing AEs at discontinuation will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
In order to guarantee the continuation of treatment with givinostat, the Sponsor has planned a 
long-term study which will start when the first subject enrolled in this study has attend ed his 
last visit.  As a consequence, at the end of the treatment, parent/ legal guardian will be asked 
to consent and subject will be asked to assent/consent to his participation to the long-term 
study.  In case the subject will not assent/consent and/or the parent/ legal guardian will not 
consent it, a final follow up visit will be performed 4 weeks after last dose administration. 
6.2 Discuss ion of Study Design 
This study is designed as a conventional parallel group design.  Since the study will be 
conducted in a paediatric population with a serious and life-threatening disease, the unequal 
randomisation ratio (i.e., 2:1 to givinostat and placebo) will be applied to reduce the exposure 
to 
placebo to only one third of subjects.    A 2:1 randomisation also provides for an increased 
number of subject s who are exposed to givinostat. 
The
 sample size was originally calculated to provide 90% power and a 1-sided alpha of 2.5% 
to detect a true difference between givinostat and placebo in the target population in the 4SC 
18 month change from baseline of 3 seconds, assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 
6 seconds (being based on publicly available phase 3 study data on ataluren and drisapersen in 
DMD
 subjects in addition to internal Italfarmaco S.p.A data.), giving rise to an estimated 
sample size of N=192 subjects.  However, the planned  interim analysis took place in January 
2020 
based upon the first 50 randomised patients reaching 12 months of treatment.  This 
interim provided a revised, blinded within treatment SD estimate of 3.094 seconds, 
approximately half of that assumed in the original power calculation. Based on this revised 
S
D estimate, the revised sample size is N=102 which provides 90% power for a 2 second 
difference between givinostat and placebo for the change in 4SC at 18 months.    
In a recent analyses performed by C-Tap (Wong B, et al. Action Duchenne International 
Conference, November 9–11, 2018, Birmingham, UK), the minimally clinically important 
diff
erence (MCID) for timed function tests (TFTs) in DMD was estimated at ~1.0 to 
1.6 seconds. These results were confirmed by additional analyses performed on the CINRG 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 45 of 120 natural history database (Data on File), which showed that a change of 1 to 1.5 seconds in 
TFTs has clinical meaningfulness based on health-related QoL and participation measures in 
DMD and that a 1.6 to 1.7 second change over 12-months in TFTs translates to a 3-year 
pr
olongation of ambulation in DMD. Together, these new data suggest that 2 seconds is an 
appropriate conservative estimate of a clinically meaningful effect size for TFTs in DMD, 
which is less than the 3 seconds originally hypothesized in the study protocol(MCID; 
McDonald CM et al. 201322) ; however, with the blinded SD estimate made at the planned 
interim, the revised total number of subjects, N=102 has 90% power to detect this smaller, yet 
clinically relevant treatment effect.   The treatment duration of 18 months has been chosen 
because DMD children with more preserved muscle mass will be enrolled in this study,  and 
despite the underlying progression of muscle tissue deterioration, a decline of function is 
expected to be slower in the selected patient population compared to DMD subjects in 
“decline phase” (e.g., DMD subjects >7 years with 6MWT < 350 meter, McDonald, 
Henricson et al. 201323);  thus, a long er observation period is needed to demonstrate 
functional benefits compared givinostat to placebo controls. 
At randomisation, the population will be stratified according to steroid type and regimens 
(i.e., daily regimen or intermittent regimen) because some evidence suggests Deflazacort use 
was associated with later loss of ambulation and increased frequency of side effects (Bello et 
al. 201536) and daily administration of steroids to be more e ﬀe ctive than treatment on alternate 
days (Bushby, Finkel et al. 201034; Ricotti, Baranello et al. 201335).   Thus, to help to ensure 
balance between the randomised treatment arms stratification by steroid type and regimens 
will be implemented.  
Daily regimen means every daily intake of steroids, while intermittent regimens comprise 
ster
oids used every other day, high dose weekend and 10 days on alternate to  10 or 20 days 
off.  Different schedule can be discussed with the Medical Monitor before the subject 
randomisation, however the decision remains with the Investigator only or its authorized 
designee. 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review, evaluate, and categorise 
sa
fety findings every three months during the study and will be responsible for oversight of 
the interim analys is (see below) at which futility will be assessed and a blinded sample size 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.      DSC/14/2357/48 
Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 46 of 120 reestimation will be made.  The IDMC will have access to unblinded data, if necessary, and 
will operate according to the rules defined in the IDMC charter. 
A single interim analysis has been planned in this study which will be overseen by the IDMC 
in order to ensure the study integrity: 
 The first interim analysis will be performed when the first N=50 subjects randomised 
in the target population have reached the 12 month time point and the effects of 
givinostat versus placebo on the mean vastus lateralis muscles fat fraction (VL MFF ) 
assessed by MRS will be evaluated.   The purpose of this interim is to assess futility.  
There will be no formal assessment of efficacy and no unblinded evaluation of the 
primary endpoint, even by the IDMC .    
Based on prior data, a 5% annual mean increase in VL MFF in the placebo group is 
expected and a corresponding 3.5% annual mean increase in the givinostat group is 
desired.  Futility will be considered if the mean change in VL MFF in the givinostat 
group is equal to or worse than that seen in the placebo group since the biologic 
plausibility of a subsequent treatment effect on 4SC time would be greatly diminished.  
The
 IDMC will only communicate to the Sponsor, whether the study should proceed 
or
 be stopped, based on whether the study has met the futility criteria.  If the IDMC 
indi
cates that the study should proceed, a blinded sample size re-estimation will also 
be conducted for VL MFF and 4SC in the target population.   
More details about the interim analys is are described in Section 13.10 .

 Page 49 of 120 7.3 With drawal, Removal, and Replacement of Subjects   
Withdrawal from study participation and study medication may occur under the following 
circumstances: 
 W ithdrawal of consent.  The subject or his parent/guardian desire to withdraw from 
further participation in the study in the absence of the Investigator determining a 
medica
l need to withdraw.  If the subject or parent/guardian give a reason for 
withdrawing, it should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
 P rotocol Violation.  The subject’s findings or conduct failed to meet the protocol entry 
criteria or failed to adhere to the protocol requirements (e.g.,   failure to return for 
defined number of visits). Before withdrawing a subject each case will be discussed 
with the study medical monitor and if the safety of the subject can be reasonably 
assured, the subject will not be discontinued.  
 L ost to Follow- Up.  The subject stopped coming for visits, and study personnel were 
unable to contact the subject. 
 Othe r reason.  The subject was terminated for a reason other than those listed above, 
such as at the discretion of the Investigator (i.e., any other condition that, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the study conduct according to the 
protocol, or when the Investigator feels that it is in the best interest of the subject to 
discontinue) or termination of study by the Sponsor. 
W
ithdrawal from study medication may occur under the following circumstance: 
 Adve rse event.  Clinical or laboratory events occur that, in the medical judgment of 
the Investigator for the best interest of the subject, are grounds for discontinuation.  
Moreover, if the subject meets one of the safety stopping criteria described in Section 
7.3.1, he will be withdrawn from the study medication.  In case of withdrawal due to 
AEs/S
AEs, the Investigator will follow up with the subject until resolution or 
acceptable stabilization of the event and document all the relevant information, as 
applicable. 
In case of withdrawal from study participation and /or study medication, the following general 
rule
s apply: 
 If a subject is discontinued from study medication and is withdrawn from the study 
for any reason, the study site must immediately notify the medical monitor. 
 When a subject withdraws from the study, the date and reasons for withdrawal shall 
be recorded by the Investigator on the Subject’s Medical File and on the relevant 
pa
ge of the eCRF.

Givinostat                 Protocol Version 8 .0  
  08 April 2020 
 Page 50 of 120 In case of multiple reasons, AEs should be indicated as the primary reason whenever 
applicable.  All relevant information related to the reason for treatment 
discontinuation including contributory factors must be included on the eCRF. 
 All subjects prematurely discontinuing the study must be seen for a final evaluation 
performed within 2 weeks after the last drug intake .  Final evaluation is defined as 
completion of the assessments scheduled for the Early Termination Visit (as detailed 
in Section 9.1.8).  Data collected during the final evaluation are crucial to the 
integrity of the final study analysis because early withdrawal could be related to the 
safety profile of the study drug.  The Investigator will make every effort to see 
subjects who fail to return for a final visit.   

 In the event that a subject is discontinued prematurely from the study due to a 
treatment -related TEAE or serious TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be 
followed until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline value s) or stabilizes, or until 
it is judged by the Investigator to be no longer clinically significant.  
 Once a subject is withdrawn from the study, he may not re-enter the study. 
7.3.1 S afety Stopping Rules    
Study drug should be permanently interrupted if any of the following occurs: 
 severe drug-related diarrhoea (i.e., increase of  ≥7 stools per day);  
 a ny drug-related SAE; 
 QTc F >500 msec* ; 
 plate lets count ≤50 x 109/L (to avoid laboratory errors and anomalous values, platelets 
count ≤50 x 109/L must be confirmed with a repeated test performed on the next 
working day.  The treatment should be stopped until the retest result becomes 
available.  If the repeated platelets count is still ≤50 x 109/L, study drug must be 
permanently discontinued.  If the repeated test is acceptable, the subject can resume 
treatment.);   
 white blood cells  ≤2. 0 x 109/L (to avoid laboratory errors and anomalous values, 
white blood cells  ≤2.0 x 109/L  must be confirmed with a repeated test performed on 
the next working day.  The treatment should be stopped until the retest result becomes 
available.  If the repeated white blood cells is still ≤2.0 x 109/L , study drug must be 
permanently discontinued.  If the repeated test is acceptable, the subject can resume 
treatment.);   
 he moglobin  ≤8. 0 g/dL (to avoid laboratory errors and anomalous values, hemoglobin  
≤8.0 g/dL must  be confirmed with a repeated test performed on the next working day.  
The treatment should be stopped until the retest result becomes available.  If the 
repeated hemoglobin is still ≤8. 0 g/dL, study drug must be permanently discontinued.  
If the repeated test is acceptable, the subject can resume treatment.).

occurs and document all the relevant information, as applicable.  After the 
resolution/stabilization of the event, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and the 
EOS Visit (see Section 9.1.8) will be performed. 
* based on average QTc value of triplicate ECGs.  For example, if an ECG demonstrates a prolonged QTcF 
interval >450msec, 2 more ECGs should be obtained over a brief period, and then the averaged QTcF values of 
the 3 ECGs should be used to determine whether the subjects should be discontinued from the study .  If the mean 
QT
cF value of the 3 replicates still meets the stopping criteria the subject has to interrupt the study drug, the 
medical monitor has to be informed and the value must be confirmed by the central reading before withdraw the 
subject from the study .  The QTc has to be calculated with the Fridericia formula QTc = QT/RR1/3. 
Study drug should be temporarily stopped if any of the following occur: 
 moderate or severe diarrhoea (i.e., increase more than 4 stools per day).   
 platelets count <75 x 109/L but >50 x 109/L (the treatment should be temporarily 
stopped and platelets count has to be performed by 1 week and re-tested until platelets 
will be normalized); 
 white blood cell  <3.0  x 109/L but >2.0 x 109/L (the treatment should be temporarily 
stopp
ed and white blood cells have to be measured by 1 week and re-tested until white 
blood cells  will be normalized); 
 he moglobin  <10.0 g/dL but > 8.0 g/dL (the treatment should be temporarily stopped 
and hemoglobin has to be measured by 1 week and re-tested until hemoglobin will be 
norma
lized); 
 Tr iglycerides >300 mg/ dL (3.42 mmol/L) in fasting condition (the treatment should be 
temporarily stopped and  triglycerides has to be measured every 2 weeks until  
t
riglycerides return to levels below 300 mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L); 
For subjects randomized under protocol version 6.0, or 7.0 or 8.0: 
Study drug can be reduced by 20% of the current dose at which the AE leading to temporary 
stop occurred, once platelets and/or white blood cell and/or hemoglobin are normalized, 
and/or 
triglycerides return to levels below 300 mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L), or diarrhoea is mild.  
The
 subject may have more than the usual number of scheduled visits if needed, until the AE 
resolves, and then will continue the study as per scheduled visits. 
In 
addition, in case a subject will have a consistent (e. g., at least two consecutive evaluation) 
platelets count ≤150 x 109/L and not meeting the stopping criteria for platelets, the 
Investigator will have to reduce the dose by 20% of the current dose (see Section 8.2.2 for 
more details).

platelets count ≤150 x 109/L and not meeting the stopping criteria for platelets, the 
Investigator will have to reduce the dose  by 1/3 vs the starting dose (see Section 8.2.2 for 
more details).  
If a subject has a medical event not necessarily drug related that requires interruption of study 
drug dosing for >4 weeks, the Investigator can discuss the case with the medical monitor if 
the subject may resume study drug treatment, however the final decision remains with the 
Investigator only or its authorized designee.  
Moreover, for subjects who have already reduced the dose of 1/3 an additional reduction of 
20%  is allowed for safety reasons following the inscruction in section “ For subjects 
randomized under protocol version 6.0, or 7.0 or 8.0”.

8.2 Dosage  
8.2.1 R ational for Dose Selection 
The dose for this study has been selected based on: the dose ranging evaluation done in the 
mdx model; the results of the Phase 2 study in DMD paediatric subjects (DSC/11/2357/43) , 
and the evaluation of PK and efficacy results obtained in other inflammatory disease s.   
The
 PK/PD analysis done with the data collected during the non-clinical studies in mdx 
model, showed that a blood AUC 0-24 of at least 300 ng*h/mL was estimated to be needed to

 Page 54 of 120 exert the beneficial histological and functional effects in mouse and thus was considered the 
target exposure for the exploratory Phase 2 study in the DMD population (DSC/11/2357/43 
study).  
The study DSC/11/2357/43 was designed to first verify that doses of givinostat leading to an 
AUC0-24 of at least 300 ng*h/mL in the majority of DMD subjects were tolerated and then to 
verify that such exposures would translate into a significant histological benefit.  Results have 
confirmed that doses of 25/37.5 mg bid are tolerated, do result in an AUC 0-24 of at least 300 
ng*h/mL in the majority of treated DMD subjects , and result in a significant histological 
be
nefit. 
On the other hand, previous clinical experience in chronic inflammatory diseases in adult and 
paediatric populations (i.e., Crohn’s Disease, Psoriasis, Systemic Onset Juvenile Idiopathic 
Ar
thritis and Polyarticular Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ) have shown that givinostat 
was overall not efficacious in controlling symptoms and biological features of these diseases 
at exposures (AUC 0-24) lower or comparable to those obtained in study DSC/11/2357/43.  
L
ack of efficacy of doses lower than those tested in study DSC/11/2357/43 were also 
suggested by the post-hoc  analysis of study DSC/11/2357/43 results which showed that a 37.5 
mg bid dose was associated with a larger increase in CSA of fibers compared to 25 mg bid. 
B
ased on these considerations, the Sponsor believes that doses leading to daily exposures 
lower than those obtained in study DSC/11/2357/43 are very unlikely to be efficacious and 
therefore chose an initial study dose to ensure a mean AUC 0-24 similar to that achieved with 
37.5 mg/bid (i.e., approximately 1150 ng*h/mL). As of 18th of  June 2018, b ased on blinded 
safety haematologic data , the Sponsor has evaluated that , a vast majority  of randomized 
subjects who had completed at least 8 weeks of treatment (approximately 50 to 60%) had to 
reduce the starting dose due to a decrease in platelet levels. It is, therefore, expected that a 
relevant amount of subjects that will be enrolled into  the study will need to require the same 
dose adjustment.  Therefore, a new starting dose corresponding to the reduced dose (i.e. 1/3 
lower than the starting dose) of protocol version 4.0 (i.e. 13.3-46.7 mg/bid according to body 
weight) is proposed by the Sponsor in protocol version 6.0. This new starting dose ensures a 
mean AUC 0-24 similar to that achieved with 25 mg/bid during the DSC/11/2357/43 study in

histological benefit.  
As weight was shown to significantly affect givinostat clearance, and the study will enroll 
paediatric DMD subjects with a broad range of weight, the initial dose will be adjusted to the 
current body weight of the subject (see Table 2). A strict monitoring of platelets count has 
be
en planned, and it will be followed with dose adjustment instruction as described in the 
safety rules as described in Section 7.3.1 in order to avoid the risk of platelet reduction <75 x 
109/L
. 
8.2.2 Dosage  Schedule 
The following is a description of the dosage, treatment regimen, and route of administration.  
Givinostat oral suspension (10 mg/ mL) and placebo oral suspension have to be administered 
orally as 2 oral doses daily while the subject is in a fed state.  Before its use, the suspension 
must
 be shaken for at least 30 seconds by rotating the bottle by 180° and the homogeneity of 
the obtained suspension verified.  The suspension will be administered by means of a 
graduated dosing syringe.  The dosage to be administered is based on subject weight and the

Study drug dose adjustment including safety rules for permanently or temporarily stopping 
stud
y drug are described in Section 7.3.1. 
As 
mentioned in Section 7.3.1, in case a subject has a consistent (e.g., at least 2 consecutive 
e
valuations) platelets count ≤150 x 109/L and does not meet the stopping criteria due to 
platelet reduction, the Investigator will have to reduce the dose by 1/3 of the starting dose (see 
Table 5). 
S
tudy drug can be resumed at a level 1/3 smaller than the dose at which the AE leading to 
temporary stop occurred, once platelets and/or white blood cell and/or hemoglobin are 
normalized  and/or triglycerides return to levels below 300 mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L) or when 
diarrhoea is mild. 
If a subject was randomized with baseline triglycerides above 300 mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L), the 
Investigator can discuss how to manage the case with the medical monitor, however the final 
decision remain with the Investigator or its authorized designee only.  
More
over, for subjects who have already reduced the dose of 1/3 an additional reduction by 
20%  is allowed for safety reasons following the instruction reported in  Table 4.  
Dose Modification (all subjects): 
If subjects (i.e. those already in treatment or those who will be randomized under protocol 
version 6.0 or 7.0 or 8.0) gain weight during the study the drug dose must be kept unchanged.  
If 
subjects (i.e. those already in treatment or those who will be randomized under protocol 
version 6.0 or 7.0 or 8.0) lose weight during the study, the drug dose should be adjusted

  08 April 2020 
 Page 58 of 120 according to Table 2 or Table 3 if the subject is still on treatment at starting dose, or according 
to Table 4 or Table 5 if the subject has already reduced the starting dose. 
A
ll subjects will be asked to have platelets count assessments weekly during the first month of 
treatment and performed every two weeks during the second month of treatment, in order to 
strictly monitor this parameter for safety reasons. 
If the dose is reduced due to platelet count ≤150 x 109/L, and/or white blood cell  <3.0 x 109/L 
and/or hemoglobin <10.0 mg/dL a complete blood count (i.e.CBC) test must be performed 
weekly for 8 consecutive weeks. 
If a dose adjustment and/or modification of schedule of assessments is decided by the 
Investigator or authorized designee, it is advised to discuss this decision with the Medical 
Monitor, however this is not mandatory as the Investigator is the only responsible for the 
medical care of the subject and the Investigator’s decision should not be influenced, deleted 
nor approved by the Medical Monitor. 
8.3 S tudy Treatment Assignment 
The Investigator will be responsible for the delivery of study drug to the subject’s parent/legal 
guardian according to the protocol.   Subjects will be administered the study drug on an 
outpatient basis.   All study drug supplies are to be used only for this protocol and for no other 
purpose. 
At Visit 3, subjects fulfilling all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
ra
ndomise d via interactive response technology (IRT). During the randomization procedure, 
the 
Investigator will be asked to record the type of steroid used by the subject (i.e. Deflazacort 
or other type of steroids) and to record the regimen of intake (i.e. daily regimen or intermittent 
regimen) following the instruction provided in the IRT manual. The IRT will assign the 
subject to one stratum according to the collected information (i.e. Deflazacort Daily regimen, 
Deflazacort Intermittent regimen, Other steroids Daily regimen, Other steroids  Intermittent 
regimen) and them to a treatment arm in a 2:1 ratio to receive givinostat or placebo. 
Dur
ing the first 3 months, the Investigator will supply the child’s parent/legal guardian with 
the appropriate number of suspension bottles sufficient to cover one month of treatment at 
scheduled visits (i.e. , at Visit 3, 7 and 9).  Then,  for the remaining part of the study (i.e., at

  08 April 2020 
 Page 59 of 120 Visit 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, the Investigator will supply the child’s parent/legal guardian with 
the appropriate number of suspension bottles sufficient to cover the period between two visits 
(i.e., 3 months of treatment).   
The
 Investigator is to call using IRT at each dispensing visit in order to obtain the packaging 
number of the study treatment to be dispensed to the subject by the subject’s parent/legal 
guardian.   
Study treatment should be dispensed to each subject’s parent/legal guardian by authorized 
personnel only. 
The Investigator will provide to the subject parent/legal guardian written instruction on the 
dosage and corresponding volume in milliliters of suspension to be taken at each 
administration.  Refer to the relevant Clinical Study Operations Manual (CSOM) for more 
detailed information. 
8.4 B linding 
This is a double-blind, placebo controlled study, so subjects receiving givinostat or placebo 
will receive medication indistinguishable in appearance. Personnel involved in the study 
(Investigators, nurses, all other site personnel, clinical research associate ( CRA), Medical 
Monitors, Project Managers, and personnel involved in data management) will remain blind at 
all times, unless under exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the study drug is 
essential for treating the subject, such as in case of an AE. If the Investigator or authorized 
designee decides to break the code of a subject, it is suggested that the Monitoring Team 
(Medical Monitor or CRA) would be consulted if possible before breaking the code, however 
this is not mandatory because the decision of the Investigator cannot be influenced, deleted 
nor approved by the Monitoring Team.  
C
ode breaking can be performed by the Investigator or authorized designee at any time by 
using the proper module of the IRT system. 
If the code is broken, treatment with the study drug must be stopped.  
I
n any case, after breaking the code, the Investigator must record the date, time, and reason 
for breaking the code in the CRF, and must notify the Monitoring Team as soon as possible.

  08 April 2020 
 Page 62 of 120 The investigational site will store the study drug under the conditions specified here below, 
ensuring that it is not accessible to unauthorized persons until it is dispensed to the subject’s 
parent/legal guardian. 
Givinostat/Placebo suspension has to be stored in a refrigerated condition at 5°C±3°C.  Once 
the container is firstly opened, the suspension can be administered for a maximum of 30 days. 
8.6 T reatment Accountability and Compliance 
The study drug packaging will be provided with tear off labels; before treatment dispensation 
the tear-off label should be removed from the subject’s pack by the Investigator and stuck on 
the appropriate drug accountability form. 
At each dispensing visit, the subject’s parent/legal guardian will bring back to the study site 
all bottles previously received (used, partially used and unused) and receive a new supply of 
the study drug.  
Subject compliance will be evaluated through a subject diary indicating how many doses were 
e
ffectively administered by the subject. .  
Compliance will be checked by Italfarmaco S.p.A. or its designee based on the drug 
accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by Italfarmaco S.p.A. or its 
designee.  
The used, partially used, and unused bottles will be collected and sent back to Italfarmaco 
S.p.A. or their designee periodically or at the end of the study.   
Accountability and compliance is detailed in the relevant CSOM. 
8.7 P rior and Concomitant Illnesses and Medications 
8.7.1 Prior and Concomitant Illnesses 
Investigators should document all prior significant illnesses that the subject has experienced 
within 6 months of screening.  The starting date of corticosteroids use will be also collected. 
Additional illnesses present at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of 
first dosing (Visit 3) are to be regarded as concomitant illnesses.

  08 April 2020 
 Page 63 of 120 Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF. 
8.7.2 Prior  and Concomitant Medications 
All medications and other treatments taken by the subject during the study, including those 
treatments initiated within 6 months prior to the start of the study, must be recorded on 
the eCRF. 
S
ubjects should be on systemic corticosteroid therapy for at least 6 months prior to initiation 
of study drug.  That is, there have been no changes in systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., 
change in type of drug, dose modification not related to body weight change, schedule 
modification, interruption, discontinuation, or re-initiation) during the previous 6 months. 
As the subjects to be randomised are on stable steroids, the recommended national 
immunisation schedule, including varicella immunity, should be completed (i.e., as 
recommended in the “Diagnosis and Management of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy” 
guideline4), before the Screening Visit.   
C
oncomitant treatments are defined as treatments taken after study drug administration.  
Any medication or therapy that is taken by or administered to the subject during the course of 
the study must be recorded in the eCRF.  The entry must include the dose, regimen, route, 
indication, and dates of use. 
After the Screening visit, medication to treat minor treatment-emergent illnesses are generally 
permitted; supportive treatments, such as anti-emetics, anti- diarrhoeals, anti-pyretics, anti-
allergics, analgesics, and antibiotics are allowed. 
Use of Vitamin D, calcium and any other supplements if clinically indicated before 
enrollment and for duration of the study are allowed. 
The following therapies are expressly prohibited  throughout the study:  
 Any other investigational drug while on this study ,  
 a ny dystrophin restoration product  
 use of any pharmacologic treatment, other than corticosteroids, that might have an 
effect on muscle strength or function (e.g., growth hormone) 
The following are concomitant therapy requiring caution  throughout the study:

 Dr ugs known to be P -glycoprotein inhibitors (see Appendix 16.3 for a list of such 
c
ompounds). 
 L ive or live attenuated vaccines: t he subject must be carefully monitored. While the 
decision of the Investigator cannot be influenced, deleted nor approved by the Medical 
Monitor, it is advised but not mandatory that the Investigator discuss the case with the 
Medical Monitor before using these vaccines.  
 Dr ugs knows to be a substrate of Organic Cation Transporter 2 transporter (see 
Appendix 16.2 for a list of such compounds).

maximum of 2 weeks (+3 days). 
The cognitive function evaluation by Raven coloured progressive matrices could be performed during this visit if not done during the previous one (i.e. 
V1). Test should be performed at the same time at the beginning and at the end of the study 
MRI/MRS could be performed in a different day (i.e. not necessarily during the same day of Time to 4-stair climb test, due to the fact that the MRI site 
can be performed in a different site ).

Practitioner’s practice.  See conditions in Section 9.1.4) 
3. If the subject is discontinued from the study treatment, the subject will be asked to return for the early withdrawal visit to be performed within 2 weeks 
of the last dose of study drug.  In this case, the cognitive function evaluation and MRI/MRS may not be performed. 
4. The subjects who complete the study (i.e. 18 months of treatment) will be asked to return to the centre for the Follow up visit to be performed after 4 
weeks from the last dose of study drug (i.e. 4 weeks ± 7 days ). 
5. During the screening visit V1 and at the end of study (i.e. V15) assessment for ankle range of motion (ROM) should be performed.  
6. 12-lead ECG has to be done in triplicate at the screening visit and during the other visits if an ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT cF interval ˃ 450 msec , 
obtain 2 more ECGs over a brief period, and then use the averaged QTcF values of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the subjects should be discontinued 
from the study (see Section 7.3.1). 12-lead ECG should be performed  at 2,5 hours (i.e 150 minutes) ±30 minutes after drug intake.  
7. P
ulmonary function tests FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC and PEF. In case the test does not achieve ATS criteria and the evaluator does not feel a valid attempt 
has been made, the subject should repeat the test at randomization if the test is failed at screening visit. I f the test is failed at 12 months and/or  at 18 
months the subject has to be asked to come back to perform the test. 
8. Serology: immunoassay methodology for CMV IgM; in-house methodology of chemiluminescence for HBsAg/HCV/HIV; and ECLIA for EBV IgG. 
9. Hematology test: CBC:RBC, WBC (including differential count), hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV, hematocrit, and platelets.  Test will be done 
according to the schedule (i.e., weekly for the first month of treatment, every 2 weeks for the second month of treatment) and are to be performed more 
frequently if clinically indicated.  Note: Repeat visits for the platelets count will be assumed at the request of the Investigator. If the dose is reduced due 
to platelet count ≤150 x 109/L, and/or white blood cell  <3.0 x 109/L and/or hemoglobin <10.0 mg/dL, a complete blood count (i.e.CBC) test must be 
performed weekly for 8 consecutive weeks. 
10. The following blood tests will be assessed: total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, ALT, AST, LDH, cystatin C, CRP, GGT, 
creatine kinase, total protein, albumin, uric acid, tri glycerides, phosphorus, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, glucose, 
creatinine, BUN, TSH, fT3, fT4, bicarbonate). Note that TSH, fT3, and fT4 will be taken  at Visits 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. 
11. Urinalysis: appearance, pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketone bodies, blood and WBCs, and urobilinogen. 
12. During the screening period (i.e., 4 weeks ±2), time to 4-stair climb test (4SC) should be  performed at V1 and V2 . The 4SC at V2 can be performed one 
d
ay after V1 up to a maximum of 2 weeks (+3 days). For this reason the subjects should go to the centre 2 times (i.e., Visit 1 and Visit 2).  The test 
should be video recorded during Visit 1, Visit 3, Visit 13 and Visit 15. 
13. Muscle strength tests: at screening: knee extension, elbow flexion by HHM and knee extension by MMT. During the study and at the end:  knee 
extension, elbow flexion by HHM. 
14. Pharmacokinetic sample collection: sampling (2 pre-dose during the treatment and 4 post-dose) will be collected as described in the protocol during the 
following visits: 7 (4 weeks), 10 (12 weeks), 11 (24 weeks), 13 (Week 48) and 15 (Week 72).  At these visits, the subject will be asked to take the 
morning dose at site. 
15. The baseline MRI/MRS test has to be performed when all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been already evaluated and the subject is eligible.  At 
screening all subjects will perform the MRI of thigh and MRS of vastus lateralis; then the MRI of thigh and MRS of vastus lateralis will be performed 
also at 12 and 18 months in a subgroup of subjects: the first 99 - 150 randomised subjects in the target population (i.e. with MRS VL MFF between> 5% 
and ≤30%).  The MRI evaluation using Dixon technique and the MRS will be performed at specialized sites.    
16. Genetic test should be performed only in case it is not already available.

There will be at least 15 study visits, including the Screening and Randomisation Visits. 
Asse
ssments will be performed as outlined in the following by-visit subsections.  As platelets 
count reductions are observed after treatment with givinostat, study site personnel who will 
perform functional tests and MRI/MRS must be different from the personnel who will review 
subjects’ safety results and safety results must not be shared with the personnel responsible 
for the functional tests and MRI/MRS. 
At the discretion of the Investigator, subjects not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria may be 
re-screened twice with an interval of at least 3 months between assessments. 
If 
needed, safety assessments (e.g. blood test, unscheduled visits) may be performed at the 
subject’s home by a local qualified nurse trained in the study protocol. 
9.1.1
 Visit 1 and Visit 2 - Screening (Week -4 ± 2 weeks) 
The
 Screening visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) will occur within 4 weeks (± 2 weeks) prior to the

At Visit 1 , functional tests will be video recorded. 
Subjects will be instructed to avoid physical activity that would exceed their normal activity 
for 3 days before each visit. 
NB:  As the subjects to be randomised are on stable steroids, the recommended national 
immunisation schedule, including varicella immunity, should be completed (i.e., as 
recommended in the “Diagnosis and Management of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy” 
guideline4), before the Screening Visit.  However, in the case of live or live attenuated 
va
ccines to be administered during the study, the Investigator must carefully monitor the 
subject, and while the decision of the Investigator cannot be influenced, deleted nor approved 
by the Medical Monitor, it is advised but not mandatory that the Investigator discuss the case 
with the Medical Monitor before using these vaccines.

trial. 
10 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
10.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment 
The primary efficacy assessment for this study is the time to climb 4 standard stairs (at 
18 months). 
The 
time to climb 4 standard-sized stairs is a TFT that represents stair climbing ability.  The 
test will be evaluated by qualified functional evaluators (i.e., physiotherapists) who will be 
diff
erent from the site personnel who will review subjects’ safety results ; safety results must 
not be shared with site personnel.  The test will be performed in a standardized manner 
described in a specific site manual. 
In addition to the time to climb 4 standard-sized stairs recorded in seconds, functional 
adaptation employed by the subject during the test will be evaluated and graded by functional 
evaluators according to standardized scales as follows:

5. C limbs 4 standard stairs alternating feet, needs handrail for support; 
6. C limbs 4 standard stairs alternating feet, not needing handrail support. 
10.2 Secondary Efficacy Assessments (A ll Subjects) 
The secondary key efficacy assessments (all subjects ) in the target population are: 
 Time to rise  from floor; 
 Distance done in 6 walking minutes by 6MWT; 
 Physical function assessed by NSAA; 
 Muscle strength evaluated by knee extension, elbow flexion as measured by HHM. 
 F at fraction of vastus lateralis muscles evaluated by MRS technique (MR cohort) 
The
 exploratory efficacy assessments are: 
 Time to wa lk/run 10 meters; 
 Quality of life (assessed by PODCI);  
 %-predicted  6MWT; 
 MRI parameters (e.g., fat fraction of thigh muscles, CSA of vastus lateralis and other 
thigh muscles, etc) only in the MR cohort ; 
 Time to 10% persistent worsening in 6MWT (Baseline through end of study); 
 P roportion of subjects with ≥10% worsening in 6MWT at end of study; 
 Time to l oss of standing (Baseline through end of study); 
 P roportion of subjects who loose ambulation during the study; 
 Evaluation of any correlation between the effect of Givinostat on disease progression and 
the type of DMD mutation, LTBP4 and Osteopontin genotype; 
 Eva luation of any possible DMD serum biomarker.  
As for the primary efficacy assessment, all the functional and strength assessments will be 
e
valuated by qualified functional evaluators (i. e., physiotherapists) who will be different

G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 77 of 120 from the site personnel who will review subjects’ safety results. The safety results must not 
be
 shared with physiotherapists.  
To 
limit variability associated with functional evaluators ‘drift’ in performing trial 
assessment across the course of the study, to ensure compliance with functional evaluator 
manual procedures, and valid conduct of assessments, some screening, baseline, 12 month 
and final study visits will be videoed and reviewed for quality assurance across all subjects. 
The videos: will be uploaded to a central secure repository and reviewed only by an expert 
and independent team engaged to train and qualify the site functional evaluators.  
Time taken to stand from a supine position and time to walk/run 10 meters are TFTs.  Timed 
function tests provide a measure of functional capability in ambulatory subjects, which is 
c
omplementary to the 6MWT. The TFTs will be performed in a standardized manner 
described in a specific site manual. 
Six-minute walking test: a modified version of the 6MWT recommended by American 
Thoracic Society (2002) for use in adults will be performed.  
North Star Ambulatory Assessment :  the 17 items of the NSAA, ranging from standing to 
running 10 meters,  will be graded using the standard score card with each assessment rated as 
0 – unable to achieve independently, 1 – modified method but achieves goal independent of 
phy
sical assistance from another, or 2 – normal with no obvious modification of activity. 
Muscle strength: using HHM, the muscle strength of knee extensor and elbow flexor will be 
measured following standardized procedures; bilateral assessments will be done, and 
3 measurements will be recorded from each muscle group on each side.   
Quality of Life (QoL): the QoL will be measured via the American Academy of Orthopaedic 
Surgeons Pediatric Musculoskeletal Function Instrument, also referred to as PODCI.  The 
PODCI will be administered to the parent/legal guardian of subjects.  The PODCI is 
comprised of several dimensions that assess upper extremity function, transfers and mobility, 
physical function and sports, comfort/pain (pain-free), and happiness.  There is also a scale 
for global functioning, which is a combination of the 3 function subscales and comfort.

08 April 2020 Page 78 of 120 MR Cohort 
The MRI and MRS will be centralized in a referred qualified site.  Therefore, some subjects 
will be asked to perform the examination at  a site that is different from the study site. 
The
 MRI/MRS personnel involved will be different from the site personnel.  They will not 
review subjects’ safety results; safety results must not be shared with them.  Moreover, the 
MRI/MRS images will be centrally read by an Independent Central Review team.  A 
qualification process will be implemented in order to improve data quality and decrease 
inter-site variability and the test will be performed in a standardized manner described in a 
specific site manual. 
All 
subjects will perform the baseline MRI/MRS tests. –All 110 randomised subjects in the 
tar
get population (i.e. Group A: subjects with a baseline vastus lateralis muscle fat fraction 
assessed by MRS  in the range >5 and ≤30%),  will be included in the MR cohort. 
The subjects will perform the Dixon MRI and MRS on the thigh muscles without receiving 
general anesthesia.  The MRI/MRS images will be read to evaluate the fat fraction of each 
muscle.  A cross section al area of muscles will be evaluated as well. 
11 PHARMACOKINETICS  
11.1
 Pharmacokinetic Sampling 
11.1.1 Blood Samples 
Blood samples for PK analysis of givinostat and its metabolites will be collected.    All of the 
PK sampling visits are  indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 4).  There are 5 
visits where the PK samples can be taken: Visits 7 (Week 4), 10 (Week 12), 11 (Week 24), 
13 (Week 48), and 15 (Week 72).  
All subjects will have a total of 6 PK blood specimens drawn during the study: 
 Two samples drawn pre-dose, these 2 specimens must be drawn at 2 different visits; 
 One  sample drawn between 0 and 2 hours post-dose; 
 One  sample drawn between 2 and 4 hours post-dose; 
 One  sample drawn between 4 and 6 hours post-dose; 
 One sample drawn between 6 and 10 hours post-dose.

least one PK sample is collected for each subject. After the randomization, the site personnel 
will be informed at which time the PK samples will be drawn during these visits.  
On the day when the pre-dose PK blood is drawn, subjects should be instructed to take the 
morning
 dose at the site. 
For the PK draws, the parent/legal guardian must be reminded to provide the date and time of 
the last evening dose from the day before the visit, which will be recorded in the source 
documents and eCRF together with the date and time of the blood draws prior to the morning 
intake of the compound.  
For the post-dose blood draws, the date and time of the dose prior to the blood draws and the 
date and time of blood draws will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF.  
The date and time of the first dose will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF for 
each subject. 
In case the subject is withdrawn from the study prematurely, if not all PK samples were 
obtained prior to early withdrawal, the remaining PK samples may be drawn during the Early 
Withdrawal Visit  in order to obtain all required PK samples. 
S
pecific details regarding collection, handling, processing, storage, and shipment of PK 
samples can be found in a separate laboratory manual (found in the relevant section of the 
Investigator File). 
11.2 Pharmacokinetic An alytic al Methodology 
The concentration of givinostat and its main metabolites will be determined from the plasma 
samples using a validated analytical method.  Details of the method validation and sample 
analysis will be included with the final Clinical Study Report (CSR).

 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by monitoring hematology and blood chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis;  by measurement of vit al signs, physical examinations,  weight, height,  
ECHO and ECG recording ; and by respiratory function evaluation,  cognitive function and

08 April 2020 Page 80 of 120 acceptability/palatability evaluation and by AEs recording  to be performed at protocol -
specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 6. 
12.1
 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements) 
will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 6.  All  vital 
signs will be measured after the subject has been resting in a sitting position for at least 
5 minutes.  Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of 
the 
study.  Body weight (without shoes) and height (without shoes) will be recorded at the 
visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 6. 
Vital 
sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment 
errors occur.  Out-of-range blood pressure or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the 
I
nvestigator’s discretion.  Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements must 
be recorded as an AE. 
12.2 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), heart, lungs, 
abdomen, skin, lymph nodes, extremities and nervous system) will be performed at 
Screening (Visit 1).  Physical examinations will be performed by a physician.  In addition, 
medic
al history will be recorded at screening. 
A limited physical examination to verify continued subject eligibility and to follow up on any 
change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments, Table 6.  All changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical 
hist
ory and identified as clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.3 Electrocardiogram 
A 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments, Table 6. 
At the 
Screening Visit,  the Investigator will examine the 3 ECG traces for signs of cardiac 
disease that could exclude the subject from the study.  An assessment of normal or abnormal 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.    DSC/14/2357/48 
G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 81 of 120 will be recorded.  If the ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on 
the CRF.  If an ECG demonstrates a prolonged QTcF interval (i.e.>450 ms ec) at the defined 
timepoints (see Schedule of Assessments, Table 6), the Investigator will obtain 2 more ECGs 
ove
r a brief period (5 minutes between recordings), and then use the averaged QTcF value of 
the 3 ECGs.  If the averaged QTcF value meets the stopping criteria, the subject has to 
interrupt the study drug, the Medical Monitor   must be informed and the mean QTcF value 
must be confirmed by central reading.   
During the study, ECG should be performed at 2,5 hours ± 30 minutes after drug intake. 
T
he QTc has to be calculated with the Fridericia formula QTc = QT/RR1/3. 
Electrocardiograms will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or 
artifacts are present. 
12.4 Echocardiogram 
Standard ECHOs will be conducted at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments,  
Table 6, and more often if clinically indicated.  
12.5 Respiratory Function Test 
Forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV 1), FVC, FEV 1/FVC, and PEF, will be collected 
as per the site’s standard process at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 
6 and more often if clinically indicated.  
At 
each assessment, three studies with maximal effort will be attempted by each subject, and 
the experienced technician performing the testing will make the determination if the effort 
will be acceptable.  All the study results will be recorded in the eCRF. 
12.6
 Cognitive Function Test  
A general cognitive function test will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments, Table 6 using the Raven c oloured progressive matrices test .

At Visit 7 (i.e. at the end of the first month of treatment) and 15 (i.e. at the end of the study), 
the palatability of the oral suspension will be evaluated using the Five-Point Hedonic Scale 
palatability. 
The investigator will explain to the child that he would be asked "how much did you like the 
taste of this medicine?" and encourage to indicate his preference by pointing to the 
appropriate face that depicts five degrees of pleasure: 
5= like very much 
4= like a little 
3= not sure 
2= dislike a little 
1= dislike very much. 
The explanation will be repeated if the child did not understand. 
 
Figure 12-2:  Five Point Hedonic Scale - Face Descriptions 
 
In addition, the acceptability/ palatability will be also indirectly assessed in parents with two 
questions: 
1. "On the basis of reaction / facial expression of your child, do you think that the medication 
is: pleasant= 3; not sure= 2; or unpleasant= 1?" 
2. "Do you sometimes have problems in giving the medication to your child because he 
refuses to take it or throws it up? (Yes / No)"

with 
the medical record (source document) for that visit.  Any laboratory test result 
considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant should be considered an AE.  
Clinically significant abnormal values occurring during the study will be followed until 
repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  
12.9 Adverse Events 
12.9.1
 Definitions 
Adverse Events:  
An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] E2A).”  
Study drug includes both the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator drug 
or placebo.  Medical conditions that were present before starting study drug are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after the subject has started the study drug.  Abnormal 
laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or 
symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require treatment.  All medical and 
psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) present at 
screening will be documented in the medical history CRF.  Changes in these conditions and 
new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE CRF page 
during the rest of the study.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should also be 
recorded as AEs.  Surgical procedures that were planned before the subject enrolled in the 
study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the 
medical condition should be reported in the subject ’s medical history. 
Adverse Drug Reaction: 
In the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product: “all noxious and 
unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered an 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR). ”  The phrase “responses to a medical product” means that a 
causal relationship between a medical product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., the relations cannot be ruled out. 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.    DSC/14/2357/48 
G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 86 of 120 Regarding marketed medicinal products, a well-accepted definition of an adverse drug 
reaction in the post-marketing setting is found in WHO Technical Report 498 [1972] and 
reads as follows:  “A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs 
at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for 
modification of physiological function.”  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction - An unexpected ADR is an ADR, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (i.e., Sections 7 and 8 of 
the current IB for ITF2357 Givinostat Hydrochloride Monohydrate). 
Serious Adverse Event: 
An SAE (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 is fa tal (results in the outcome death) 
 is l ife-threatening* 
 re quires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 
 re sults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a c ongenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes 
listed above 
*The term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically may cause death if it is more severe. 
In addition, any suspect of transmission of infective agents through study drug must be 
reported to the Sponsor as a SAE as medically significant event. 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalisation, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if 
they are thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes defining a SAE.   
A pre-planned hospitalisation should not be considered an SAE. 
A 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is referred to an ADR that 
c
omplies with both the definitions of “serious” and “unexpected.” 
12.9.2
 Adverse Event Reporting 
The Investigators or their designees are requested to collect and assess any spontaneous AE 
reported by the subject or their parent/legal guardian and to question the subject or their 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.    DSC/14/2357/48 
G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 87 of 120 parent/legal guardian about AEs and under current illnesses at each visit during the treatment 
period and any follow-up visit performed to monitor any drug-related AE that is still ongoing 
beyond the last scheduled visit until recovery. The questioning of subject or their parent/legal 
guardian regarding AEs is generalized such as: “ How have you been feeling since your last 
visit?”  
Any AE occurring from the Informed Consent signature up to the first study drug intake will 
be recorded on the medical history section of the CRF as baseline condition, while any AE 
occurring after a subject has intake the first study treatment up to the follow-up study visit, 
whether volunteered by the subject/parent/legal guardian, discovered during general 
questioning by the Investigators or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or 
other means will be recorded on the specific section of the CRF.  
Each AE will be described by:  
 se riousness; 
 dura tion (start and end dates); 
 severity; 
 re lationship with the study drug; 
 a ction taken.  
The severity of AE should be assessed and graded according to the most recently published 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE v. 4.03, 
14th June 2010).  
The
 relationship with the study drug should be assessed as: 
 re lated to study drug; 
 not related to study drug; 
 unknown.  
The assessment of the relationship of an adverse event with the administration of study drug 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the 
CRF. 
An assessment of “ Related” indicates that there is a reasonable suspicion that the AE is 
associated with the use of the study drug. 
An assessment of “ Not related ” would include the existence of a clear alternative 
explanation, or non-plausibility.

G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 88 of 120 An assessment “Unknown ” indicates there is not a reasonable suspicion that the AE is 
associated with the use of the study drug and at the same time there is not the existence of a 
clear alternative explanation or non-plausibility.  In this case, Investigator has to collect all 
possible information in order to assess the relationship with the study drug, particularly in 
case of SAE s. 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study drug include: 
 The  temporal sequence from study drug administration; 
 The  recovery on discontinuation and recurrence on reintroduction; 
 The  concomitant diseases; 
 The  evolution of the treated disease; 
 The  concomitant medication; 
 The  pharmacology and PK of the study drug; 
 The  presence of an alternative explanation. 
Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Objective Measurements: 
Abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements should not be routinely 
captured and reported as AEs as they will be collected and analysed separately in the eCRF.  
How
ever, abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements that meet the 
criteria for an SAE, result in discontinuation of the study drug or require medical 
intervention, or are judged by the Investigator to be clinically significant changes from 
baselines values should be captured and reported on the AE pages of the eCRF. 
When reporting an abnormal laboratory finding on the AE pages of the eCRF, a clinical 
diagnosis should be recorded in addition to the abnormal value itself, if this is available (for 
example “anaemia” in addition to “haemoglobin = 10.5 g/dl”). 
Baseline Medical Condition: 
Medical conditions present at the screening visit, that do not worsen in severity or frequency 
during the study are defined as baseline medical conditions and are not AEs.  These medical 
conditions should be adequately documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF, i.e., the 
medical history page.  However, medical conditions present at the initial study visits that 
worsen in severity or frequency during the study should be recorded and reported as AEs.

Any SAE, including death from any cause that occurs after subject/parent/legal guardian 
have signed the Informed Consent and up to the follow-up visit (regardless of relationship to 
study drug/comparator) must be reported by the Investigators to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of learning of its occurrence. 
Serious adverse event reports must be made whether or not the Investigator considers the 
event to be related to the investigational drug. 
Related SAEs must be collected and reported regardless of the time elapsed from the last 
study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  
As soon as an AE becomes serious,  it will be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF and in 
the SAE form that will be automatically opened if the answer to the question “Was adverse 
event serious?” in the AE section is “yes.” A paper SAE Form will be also available as 
ba
ckup. 
Initial completion and follow-up reporting updates of the SAE eCRF page within the 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will automatically send the SAE report directly to the  
S
yneos Health Global Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GSPV) via secure email.  
This 
automated e-mail alert process supports the Investigator in the notification of SAEs to 
the Syneos Health GSPV.  Sufficient details must be provided to allow for a complete 
medica
l assessment of the AE and independent determination of possible causality.   The 
Investigators are obliged to pursue and provide additional information as requested by 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.  Corporate Drug Safety, or its designee or the Medical Monitor of the 
stud
y or Clinical Research and Development Director, or his designee.   
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and his designee of the SAE by completing the 
SAE reporting form available within the eCRF or, as a backup ONLY in case of technical 
issues, by faxing the SAE reporting form at the number specified below, within 24 hours of a 
SAE; then, only in case of SAE notification by fax (backup system) the Investigator must 
confirm any SAE notifications by mailing to the mail address or phoning to the phone 
number specified below:

The
 same procedure must be applied to the SAE follow-up information.  Preliminary reports 
of SAEs must be followed by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized 
photocopies of hospital case reports, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents 
when requested and applicable.   
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE and the response should be 
recorded.  Clinical, laboratory and diagnostic measures should be employed as needed in 
order to determine the etiology of the problem.  All SAEs will be followed until the 
Investigator and Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved. 
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the subject’s 
participation in the study is to be followed until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the 
study drug or procedures. 
All serious and unexpected AEs that are associated with the use of the study drug (SUSARs) 
will be notified by the Drug Safety Manager to the Ethic Committees or Institutional Review 
Board and competent authority within the required time and following procedures required 
by applicable laws.  It is imperative that the Sponsor be informed as soon as possible, so that 
reporting can be done within the required time frame.  
12.9.4
 Overdose 
In general, a drug overdose in a clinical study is defined as the accidental or intentional use 
of a drug or medicine in an amount exceeding the protocol defined dose.  The Investigator 
must immediately notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study drug.   In this 
study, if an AE is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of givinostat/placebo, the AE 
is re
ported as a SAE, even if no other criteria for seriousness are met.

ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 91 of 120 If a dose of givinostat/placebo meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without 
a
ny associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as 
a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest, using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed, with and without an AE) must be reported 
to the Sponsor within 24 hours and, only in case of AEs, it must be fully documented as a 
SAE.  Details of any signs or symptoms and their management should be recorded in the 
SAE Form including details of any antidote or systematic treatment administered.  Any signs 
or symptoms of over-dosage will be treated symptomatically.  
Any other situations putting the subject at risk of an adverse reaction, such as misuse and 
abuse, medication errors, suspect of transmission of infective agents must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours and be fully documented as a SAE. 
12.9.5 Pregnancy reporting 
Since it is possible to randomize adolescent fertile trial male subjects in this trial, the subject 
must be informed by the investigator that if it is suspected that his partner becomes pregnant 
during the study treatment or within 3 months days after the study treatment, he should 
inform the site personnel immediately of this pregnancy. 
If the Investigator is made aware that the partner of a subject who is participating to the study 
become pregnant, he/she is required to report within 24 hours the pregnancy, using the 
P

13 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared prior to the first planned interim analysis 
to provide full details on the methods described here and provide a complete description of 
the data presentations required for this study.  Changes to the statistical analysis planned in 
this protocol will be described in the SAP along with the rationale for the changes.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using the latest available version of the Statistical 
Analysis Software (SAS®) (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).   
All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  Summary statistics will be 
presented by dose group.  For continuous variables, data will be summarized with the number 
of
 subjects (N), mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum by treatment group.  For 
c
ategorical variables, data will be tabulated with the number and proportion of subjects for 
each category by treatment group. 
13.1 Overall Statistical Strategy 
This trial design a single planned interim analysis.  The interim will be governed by an 
IDMC. The interim analysis will be performed when the first N=50 subjects randomised in 
the target population have reached the 12 month time point.  The purpose of this interim is to 
solely assess futility on VL MFF and execute a blinded sample size re-estimation procedure, 
ther
e will be no formal analyses for efficacy and no early stopping for efficacy and 
hence no alpha spend . 
13.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size was originally calculated to provide 90% power and a 1-sided alpha of 2.5% 
to detect a true difference between givinostat and placebo in the target population in 4SC 18 
month change from baseline of 3 seconds, assuming a common SD of 6 seconds.  The 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.    DSC/14/2357/48 
G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 93 of 120 estimated SD is based on publicly available Phase 3 study data on ataluren and drisapersen in 
subj
ects with DMD in addition to internal Italfarmaco data.    
The
 pre-planned interim analysis was performed in January 2020; it was concluded by the 
IDMC that futility on VLFF was not met and the trial should continue; hence the pre-planned 
blinded sample size re-assessment was performed.  The blinded within treatment SD for the 
change in 4CS from baseline to 18 months was estimated to be 3.094 seconds, approximately 
half of that assumed in the original power calculation. Based on this SD estimate, the revised 
sample size (utilizing a 2:1 randomisation scheme) N= 102 was calculated to provide 90% 
power and a 1-sided alpha of 2.5% to detect a true difference between givinostat and placebo 
in the target population, in 4SC 18 month change from baseline, of 2 seconds. With an 
estimated drop-out rate of 8%, a total of 110 subjects in the target population (Group A) will 
be randomized. 
For the MR cohort, the blinded SD estimate was 5.941%, being in line with the 6% SD 
assumed in the original power calculation, hence all the subjects in the target population will 
be included in the MR cohort.  
A total of 110 male ambulant subjects will be randomis ed in the target population (Group A). 
Up to 50 subjects (about 35% of the overall population) outside of the target may also be 
re
cruited into the study (Group B). The overall subjects population (Group A + Gr oup B) will 
provide supportive data. 
13.3 Analysis Population 
13.3.1 Intent-To-Treat Population 
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) target population will include all subjects in the target population 
who 
are randomised, irrespective of any deviation from the protocol or premature 
discontinuation.  The treatment group assignment will be designated according to initial 
randomisation.  The ITT target population will serve as the basis for the formal analysis of 
e
fficacy.  The overall ITT population will include all subjects in both the target and off-traget 
populations (Group A + Group B) who are randomised, irrespective of any deviation from 
the protocol or premature discontinuation.   The overall ITT population will be used for 
supportive efficacy analyses.

G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 94 of 120 13.3.2 Safety Population 
The target Safety Population will include all randomised subjects in the target population 
who receive at least one dose of study drug.  The treatment group assignment in this 
population will be defined by the treatment actually received.  Th is population will be used 
for the evaluation of safety in the target population.   The overall Safety Population will 
include
 all randomised subjects in both the target and off-target population who receive at 
least one dose of study drug. The overall Safety Population will be used for supportive 
evaluations of safety.  
13.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data and other baseline characteristics including medical history will be 
analysed based on the target safety population.  Summary statistics will be provided for all 
collected variables.  Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics, 
including mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum.  Details of endpoint analyses will be 
described in the SAP. 
13.5 Investigational  Medicinal Products 
The duration (days) of exposure of givinostat/placebo will be calculated for each subject in 
the 
target and overall populations, and will be summarized descriptively including the mean, 
SD, median, minimum, and maximum by treatment group and overall. 
I
n addition, the daily dosage (mg) of givinostat will be summarized for each subject in the 
target and overall populations, and will be summarized descriptively including the mean, SD, 
median, minimum and maximum. 
R
eason for treatment discontinuation and number of subjects treated beyond 
protocol-specified discontinuation criteria will also be summarized in the target and overall 
populations.  Summaries will be based on the respective safety population. 
13.6
 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Prior treatments, defined as those taken within 6 months prior to screening, should be 
recorded in the source documents as prior medications.

G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 95 of 120 Concomitant treatments are defined as treatments taken after study drug administration.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be classified using the WHO-DRL drug dictionary 
(using the most recent version) and summarised in the target and overall populations .  
Summaries will be based on the respective safety population. 
13.7
 Efficacy Analysis 
All formal efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT target population ; efficacy 
analyses in the overall population will be supportive and informal.  Descriptive statistics for 
qualitative data will include frequency tabulation and presentation of percentages.  
Descriptive statistics for quantitative data will include mean and SD or geometric mean, 
coefficient of variation, median and interquartile range.  
13.7.1 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The change in 4SC from baseline to 18 months will be evaluated in the target population.  
The data will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with the 
change in 4SC from baseline to 18 months as the dependent variable and with terms for 
baseline 4SC value as a covariate and randomised treatment, concomitant steroid use and age 
a
t baseline as independent class variables. Least squares means will be estimated for 
givinostat and placebo . The treatment effect, being the difference in Lsmeans, will be 
presented along with the associated 95% confidence interval and the p-value. Significance 
will be achieved if the 1-sided p-value is ≤0.025.   
13.7.2 A
nalysis of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoints  
Formal analyses of functional key secondary endpoints (i.e., cumulative loss of function in 
the NSAA, change in 6MWT, NSAA, time to rise from floor and muscle strength by knee 
extension and elbow flexion) and Vastus lateralis MFF will take place in the target 
population at 18 months and will be achieved using the same approach as described for the 
primary /endpoint. Possible need for log transformation of these variables will be assessed 
prior to unblinding by assessment of ANCOVA model residuals without a treatment effect 
term.

G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 96 of 120 13.7.3 Analysis of Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be supportive only and not subject to alpha control; 
therefore nominal p-values will be presented. 
The mean change from baseline to 18 months will be compared between givinostat and 
plac
ebo in the target population for: 
 Time to wa lk/run 10 meters; 
 Qua lity of life assessed by Paediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI);  
 % -predicted 6MWT; 
These endpoints will be analyzed using methods in line with those described for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints.   
The fraction of subjects achieving the following endpoints at 18 months will be compared 
be
tween givinostat and placebo in the target population: 
 P roportion of subjects with ≥10% worsening in 6MWT at end of study; 
 P roportion of subjects who loose ambulation during the study. 
These endpoints will be analysed using a logistic regression model with terms for 
randomised treatment, concomitant steroid use and age at baseline.  The odds for each 
tre
atment group will be extracted along with the odds ratio, associated 95% confidence 
interval and p-value.  
The
 following endpoints will be compared between givinostat and placebo in the target 
population using Cox proportional hazards modelling: 
 Time to 10% pe rsistent worsening in 6MWT (Baseline through end of study); 
 Time to loss of standing (Baseline through end of study); 
The model will include terms for randomised treatment,  concomitant steroid use and age at 
baseline.The hazard ratio will be extracted, along with the associated 95% confidence 
interval and p-value.  
Moreover, exploratory analyses will be done in the target population to explore whether the 
effects of givinostat versus placebo administered chronically may be related to the type of 
DMD mutation, LTBP4 and Osteopontin genotype  or to the biomarker s.

ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 97 of 120 13.8 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Nonlinear mixed effect models will be used for the evaluation of the population PK profile.  
The population PK analysis will be performed using NONMEM software (Version VI 
or
 later).   
The evaluation will be performed for describing the PK of givinostat and its major 
metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) in the subject population and for identifying the relevant 
demographic and pathophysiological covariates. Separate PK models for givinostat and its 
metabolite will be developed.  
Additionally, the relationship of givinostat PK exposure t o efficacy and safety endpoints in 
the target population will be explored  as exploratory analyses .  
The
 Population PK approach will be based on the development of the following 3 models:  
1. I dentification of the structural model that best describes the PK data in absence of 
covariates;  
2. R andom Effect Models: defining the inter-individual variability and the residual 
error.  Different forms of residual error (additive, multiplicative or both) will be 
explored; 
3. C ovariate Model: identifying the relevant demographic and pathophysiological 
covariates affecting the PK profile of the compound.  The selection of the covariates 
will be performed using an appropriate statistical methodology.  
Population PK procedures and analyses will be detailed in a separate “Population PK data 
analysis plan.” 
13.9 Safety Analysis 
Safety data will be evaluated descriptively in both the target and overall patient populations.  
The following parameters will be summarized: rates of discontinuation, AEs, and laboratory 
a
bnormalities. Adverse event data will be coded using the most updated version of Medical 
Dictionary for Competent Activities (MedDRA ) dictionary. Adverse events will be 
summarized by treatment group for the number of subjects reporting the AE and the number 
of AEs reported.  Summaries will be performed for treatment-related AEs (TEAEs), SAEs, 
AEs that lead to withdrawal, severity of TEAEs, and relationship of TEAEs to study drug.

and treatment group.  
Serious adverse events and AEs leading to discontinuation will be listed separately. 
A by-subject AE data listing including verbatim term, coded term, treatment group, severity, 
and relationship to treatment will be provided. 
Summary statistics will be presented for changes in vital signs, weight, height and BMI, in 
ECG parameters, in ECHO parameters, in respiratory function parameters, and cognitive 
function parameters.  Laboratory test values will be summarised similarly but will also 
include tabulation of the number of subjects shifting from within the reference range at 
baseline to outside of the reference range on randomised treatment. 
13.10  Interim Analysi s  
A 
single interim analysi s is planned and will be performed by the IDMC in the target 
population.  An IDMC charter will be prepared to describe the role, function and operations 
of the IDMC and the rules to be used when reviewing interim data.  
13.10.1 Interim Analysis 
The interim analysis will be performed when the first N=50 subject s randomised in the target 
population have reached the 12 month time point.  In this interim analysis, the IDMC will 
e
valuate the effects of givinostat versus placebo on the vastus lateralis M FF (VL MFF) in 
terms of futility.  Futility will be considered if the mean change from baseline to 12 months 
in VLMFF in the givinostat group is equal to or worse than that seen in the placebo group 
since the biologic plausibility of a subsequent treatment effect on 4SC time would be greatly 
diminished.  The IDMC will only communicate to the Sponsor whether the study should 
proceed or it should be stopped having met the futility criteria.  
If the IDMC indicates that the study should proceed, a blinded sample size re-estimation will 
be conducted for MFF and 4SC in the target population as follows:    
 To maintain the blind on the primary endpoint, the within treatment SD for the 
change from baseline will be estimated as   𝝈̂𝒘 𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏 =√𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍𝟐−(𝜟

 where 𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍  
is 
the overall SD for the change from baseline in 4SC based on the n=50 subjects in

08 April 2020 Page 99 of 120 the interim and 𝛥 is the originally hypothesized treatment effect,  i.e., 𝛥=3 seconds.  
Dependent upon the blinded SD estimate, the sample size may be decreased or 
increased to maintain 90% power. Any increase in sample size for 4SC will be 
limited to 1.5 times maximum of the initial target population sample size, i.e., to a 
maximum of  1.5×192 =288 subjects.  For a 20%  increase in the SD, this degree of 
increase in sample size will maintain 90% power, and for a 40% increase in SD 
power will be maintained at 80%.  
 
 W ith respect to VL MFF, a similar approach will be applied; the within treatment SD 
for the change from baseline will be estimated as   𝝈̂𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏 =√𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂 𝒍𝒍𝟐−(𝜟
𝟐)𝟐
 where 
𝝈̂𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍  is the overall SD for the change from baseline in VL MFF and 𝛥 is the 
originally hypothesized treatment effect, i.e. 𝛥=3.63% (i .e., 55% of 6.6%) .  Dependent 
upon 
the blinded SD estimate, the sample size may be decreased or increased to 
maintain 90% power. Any increase in sample size require d to assess MFF will also be 
limited to 1.5 times the required target population sample size stated in the prece ding 
power calculation, to a maximum of  1.5×99=150 subjects.  
 
At 
the interim futility analysis, there will be no efficacy assessment, no unblinded analysis of 
the primary endpoint and, hence, no alpha spend nor early stopping of the  study for efficacy.  
As noted above in Section 13.2, the interim analysis took place in January 2020; futility was 
pa
ssed and the blinded sample size reassessment followed.  The estimated SD for 4SC was 
approximately half of that assumed in the original power calculation.  Consequently, it was 
determined that a total of N=102 patients would be sufficient to test the hypothesis that 4SC 
was improved by at least 2 seconds with givinostat compared placebo. With allowance for a 
small
 dropout rate, a total of 110 male ambulant subjects will be randomised in the target 
population (Group A). Up to 50 subjects (about 35% of the overall population) outside of the 
target may also be recruited into the study (Group B). The overall subjects population (Group 
A + Group B) will provide supportive data. 
For the MR cohort, the blinded SD estimate was 5.941%, being in line with SD assumed in 
the original power calculation for VL MFF, hence all the subjects in the target population 
will be included in the analysis of the MR cohort.

14.1.6 Data Handling   
Data 
on subjects collected on eCRFs during the trial will be documented in an anonymous 
fashion and the subject will only be identified by the subject number. All the information 
Italfarmaco S.p.A.    DSC/14/2357/48 
G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 104 of 120 required by the protocol should be provided and any omissions require explanation.  All 
eCRFs must be completed expeditiously after the subject’s visit. 
Any data to be recorded directly on the eCRFs (to be considered as source data) will be 
identified at the start of the study.  The Investigator must maintain source documents for each 
subject in the study.  Data reported on the eCRF that are derived from source documents 
should be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepancies must be explained. 
Clinical data will be entered on e CRFs, a 21 CRF Part 11 compliant, for transmission to the 
S
ponsor.  Data on eCRFs transmitted via the web-based data system must correspond to and 
be supported by source documentation maintained at the study site, unless the study site 
makes direct data entry to the databases for which no other original or source documentation 
is maintained.  In such cases, the study site should document which eCRFs are subject to 
direct data entry and should have in place procedures to obtain and retain copies of the 
information submitted by direct data entry.  All study forms and records transmitted to the 
Sponsor must carry only coded identifiers such that personally identifying information is not 
transmitted.  The primary method of data transmittal is via the secure, internet-based EDC 
system.  Access to the EDC system is available to authorized users via the study’s Internet 
web site, where an assigned username and password are required for access.  
Any changes made to data after collection will be made through the use of Data Clarification 
Forms.  Case Report Forms will be considered complete when all missing and/or incorrect 
data have been resolved.  
14.2 Source Documents 
Source documents contain all information in original records and certified copies of original 
records of clinical findings, observations, data or other activities in a clinical study necessary 
for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. All source documents should be completed 
in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.

G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 105 of 120 14.3 Record Retention 
The Investigator must arrange for retention of study records at the site. The nature of the 
records and the duration of the retention period must meet the requirements of the relevant 
regulatory authority.   
In addition, because this is an international study, the retention period must meet the 
requirements of the most stringent authority.   
 The Sponsor and the Investigator shall archive the content of the clinical trial master file for 
a
t least 25 years after the end of the clinical study.  However, the medical files of subjects 
shall be archived in accordance with national law. 
The content of the clinical trial master file shall be archived in a way that ensures that it is 
readily available and accessible, upon request, to the competent authorities. 
Any transfer of ownership of the content of the clinical trial master file shall be documented. 
Any alteration to the content of the Investigator file shall be traceable and the Investigator 
should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.  
14.4
 Monitoring 
The study will be monitored to ensure that it is conducted and documented properly 
according to the protocol, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
A site visit will be held prior to initiation of subject enrolment.  The protocol, eCRFs, study 
drug supplies and relevant procedures will be explained to the Investigators and his/her staff 
in detail at the site visit.  On-site monitoring visits will be made at appropriate times during 
the study. 
Clinical monitors must have direct access to source documentation in order to check the 
completeness, clarity, consistency of the data recorded in the eCRFs/ CRFs  for each subject 
a
nd the adherence to the protocol and to GCP.  The clinical monitors will also check the 
progress of enrolment and the handling of study medication to ensure that study medication 
is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.

G
ivinostat     Protocol Version8 .0  
08 April 2020 Page 106 of 120 The Investigator will make available to the clinical monitor source documents and medical 
records necessary to complete eCRFs/ CRFs.  No information in these records about the 
identity of the subjects will leave the study centre.  In addition, the Investigator and key trial 
pe
rsonnel will work closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them 
appropriate evidence that the conduct of the study is being done in accordance with 
applicable regulations and GCP guidelines.  
Monitoring standard procedures require full verification for the presence of informed 
consent/assent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs and the 
recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.  The Investigator is responsible for 
completing the CRFs expeditiously to capture all the relevant information, while the monitor 
is responsible for reviewing them and clarifying any data queries. 
14.5 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities 
of this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the 
study data presented to the Sponsor lies with the Investigator generating the data. 
The Sponsor will arrange audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure 
that the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, Standard Operating 
Procedures, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  Audits will be independent of 
and separate from the routine monitoring and quality control functions.  Quality assurance 
procedures will be performed at study sites and during data management to assure that safety 
and efficacy data are adequate and well documented.  
A Regulatory Authority may also wish to conduct an inspection  (during the study or even 
after its completion) .  If an inspection is requested by a Regulatory Authority, the 
Investigator must inform Italfarmaco S.p.A. immediately that this reque st has been made.  
14.6 Protocol Amendment and Protocol Deviation

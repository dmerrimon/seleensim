 Abstract  
Background: While studies have reported risk factors for clinically -important  upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding among critically ill patients , the risk factors for patient -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 
as defined by ICU survivors and family members, are unknown.  Further, although trials show that  stress 
ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole decreases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, some research 
suggest s that mortality may be increased among patients with high illness severity who are exposed to 
pantoprazole. The risk of death during critical illness  is greater  than the risk of upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding.  
Objective:  To identify risk factors for patient -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding among invasively 
ventilated critically ill adults, taking into account illness severity and the competing risk of death.  
Materials and Methods:   This pre- planned secondary analysis of the REVISE trial database will be  
guided by this protocol . We will use Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to assess the effect of 
candidate risk factors on the hazard rate of the primary outcome of time to patient -important upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding, considering the competing risk of death. We propose 2 sensitivity analyses .  
Secondary analys es will eval uate risk factors for clinically -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
another model will  evaluate whether enteral nutritio n attenuates the effect of pantoprazole on bleeding 
prevention compared to placebo by includ ing an interaction term between pantoprazole v s. placebo and 
amount of enteral  nutrition received.  
Results:  This study will identify conditions of critical illness which confer an increased risk of patient -
important upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients , and factors that decrease the risk . 
Conclusions: The findings may inform bedside care, practice guidelines, and the design of future 
studies.

 Intro duction  
 
Patients and other members of the public infrequently have  input  into research priorities, protocol  design 
and study conduct [1]. It has been suggest ed that patient input  is inadequate for  outcome selection in  
many  trials conducted in general [2,3] and critical care medicine [ 4]. Historically, large multicenter trials 
evaluating upper gastrointestinal bleeding as a complication of critical illness  have been  focused on the 
outcome of clinically -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding - an endpoint defined by clinician -
researchers  [5-9]. In collaboration with survivors of critical illness and family members of patients who 
were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), an outcome of  patient -important upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding was recently developed [ 10]. 
 
This outcome of patient -important bleeding was a secondary endpoint for a recent stress ulcer 
prophylaxis trial [ 11]. REVISE (Re-Evaluating the Inhibition of Stress Erosions) was an international, parallel 
group randomized clinical trial that included 4, 821 patients to test the ef fect of pantoprazole versus placebo on 
the primary efficacy outcome of clinically -important  upper GI bleeding and the primary safety outcome of 90 -
day mortality  [12,13]. Pantoprazole reduced b oth patient -important and clinically -important upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding ( hazard ratio [ HR] 0.36; 95% CI  0.25 to 0.53; p<0.001 , and HR 0.30; 95% 
CI 0.19 to 0.47; p<0.001 , respectively ), without affect ing other endpoints  [11]. 
 
In REVISE, patient -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred more frequently  than clinically -
important upper gastrointestinal bleeding. While studies have reported risk factors for clinically -important 
upper gastrointestinal bleeding [ 14], the risk factors for patient -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding , 
as defined by ICU survivors and family members , remain unknown.  While some bleeding events confer 
an increased risk of death [15], most bleeding ICU patients do not die with or from gastrointestinal 
bleeding [11]. Dying is nonetheless a competing risk for bleeding, and dying is more common than 
bleeding. Thus, the primary objective of the current study is to identify risk factors for patient -important 
upper gastrointestinal bleeding among invasively ventilated critically ill adults, taking into account illness 
severity and the competing risk of death.  
 
Materials and Methods  
 
Risk Factor Analysis  
This pre- planned secondary analysis of the REVISE trial data will be  guided by th is protocol . The 
inception cohort will comprise the 4,821 participants in the REVISE trial. These were critically ill patients 
who were receiving in vasive  mechanical  ventilat ion patients in the ICU , who were expected to remain 
ventilated beyond the calendar day after randomization, and were without a clear indication or 
contraindication to pantoprazole [12,13] .  
   
We will use Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to assess the effect of candidate risk factors on 
the hazard rate of the primary outcome of time to patient -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 
considering the competing risk of death [16,17 ]. In REVISE, approximately 10 times as many patients 
died at 90- days than experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding. T he main analysis will then be a 
competing risk analysis for the competing risk of death  [18]. The proportional hazards assumption (which 
states that  the effects of the  time- dependent v ariables remain stable  over time) will be assessed and 
handled appropriately using time- varying  effects  [19]; alternative methods w ill be used if this is not 
satisfactory [20]. We will also assess collinearity of the independent variables  (e.g., therapeutic 
anticoagulation and coagulopathy) .   
 
We will include both baseline variables and time- dependent variables , described further below . All time -
dependent risk factors will be defined as existing any time in the preceding 3 days , but not includ ing the 
day of bleed.  For bleeds that occur on day  1 of the study , we will use day  1 data to define the time-
dependent covariates.  We will consider ICU discharge  and consent withdrawal as censoring events.

 Dependent Variables:  
Primary Outcome  
The primary dependent variable will be patient -important upper  gastrointestinal  bleeding. This w as 
defined in a mixed- methods study of  ICU survivors and families [ 21], with gastrointestinal  bleeding judged 
as important if bleeding resulted in a blood transfusion, vasopressor treatment, diagnostic endoscopy, CT -
angiography, surgery, or if it resulted in death, disability, or prolonged hospitalization [10]. These criteria 
were applied to the REVISE database up to 90 days after randomization [11]. Our main analysis will 
include all patient -important upper gastrointestinal bleeds that occurred in the ICU.  
 
Among 4,821 patients , 136 (2.8%) had patient -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 5 of whom bled 
on the ward prompting ICU readmission. These 5 patients will be censored at ICU discharge, as daily 
data for the time- dependent risk factors were not collected beyond the index ICU admission.  
 
Secondary Outcome  
A secondary analysis will be  to determine risk factors for the secondary outcome of clinically -important 
upper gastrointestinal bleeding.  We defined c linically -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding as the 
presence of overt bleeding (hematemesis, overt nasogastric bleeding, melena, or hematochezia) and at 
least one of the following within 24 hours in the absence of another cause: spontaneous decrease in 
invasively monitored mean arterial pressure or non- invasive systolic or diastolic blood pressure of 20 
mmHg or more or an orthostatic increase in pulse rate of 20 beats/minute and a decrease in systolic 
blood pressure of 10 mmHg, with or without vasopressor initiation or increase; vasopressor initiation; a 
decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 20 g/L in a 24- hour period or less; transfusion of  ≥2 units of packed red 
blood cells within 24 hours of bleeding, or therapeutic intervention (e.g., angio- embolization, surgery or 
endoscopic treatment of bleeding) [12]. Each bleed was reviewed in duplicate by an adjudication 
committee, b linded  to study drug, to determine whether the clinically -important upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding criteria were fulfilled [22].  
 
Among 4,821 patients , 109 (2.2%) had an event which were adjudicated as clinically -important upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding, 5  of whom bled on the ward prompting ICU  readmission.  These 5 patients will 
be censored at ICU discharge, as daily data for the time- dependent risk factors were not collected beyond 
the index ICU admission.  
 Independent Variables:  
Bleeding r isk factors will include both baseline and time -dependent variables.  Factors will draw on 
pathophysiologic rationale and prior literature.  Given the number of patient -important upper 
gastrointestinal  bleeds, we have taken into account the suitable number of independent variables to avoid 
an over -fitted model  [23]. The same r isk factors will be analyzed for the secondary outcome of clinically -
important upper  gastrointestinal  bleeding as for the primary outcome of  patient -important upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding.   
 Baseline Variables  
1) APACHE II score (considered as a continuous  variable ) 
2) Medical vs . surgical /trauma  (considered as 2 categories ) 
3) Pantoprazole versus p lacebo as randomized ( considered as 2 categories ) 
 
Time -dependent Variables  
1) Respiratory failure,  defined as  receiving  invasive  mechanical ventilation (considered as 2 
categories)  
2) Circulatory failure , defined as receiving  inotropes  or vasopressors  (any dose of any of 
norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, vasopressin,  dopamine, dobutamine  or milrinone)  
(considered as 2 categories)  
3) Renal  failure including acute kidney injury or end- stage renal disease,  defined as receiving renal 
replacement therapy  (any of intermittent hemodialysis  [IHD], continuous renal replacement 
therapy  [CRRT ], sustained low efficiency  dialysis  [SLED ] or peritoneal  dialysis ) (considered as 2 
categories)  
4) Enteral nutrition in mL/day  (considered as a continuous variable)  
6 
 5) Therapeutic anticoagulation,  defined as therapeutic unfractionated heparin or low molecular 
weight hepari n, fondaparinux , warfarin,  non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants  including 
anti-Xa inhibitors  and direct  thrombin  inhibitor s, and thrombolytic  therapy  (considered as 2 
categories)  
6) Coagulopathy , defined as international normalized ratio ( INR) > 3.0 or prothrombin time ( PTT) 
>70 seconds  (considered as 2 categories)  
7) Severe thrombocytopenia,  defined as p latelet count <50 × 109/L (considered as 2 categories)  
8) Platelet aggregation inhibitor s, defined as receipt of any of acetyl salicylic acid , clopidogrel , 
dipyridamole , ticlo pidin e, tirofiban , P2Y12 inhibitors , or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  
(considered as 2 categories)  
9) Corticosteroids , defined as any corticosteroid drug or dose, either enteral or intravenous 
administration  (considered as 2 categories)  
 
Sensitivity Analyses  
1) To evaluate the effect of the competing risk of death, we will conduct an analysis that does not 
consider  the competing risk of death.  
2) To evaluate the influence of risk factors more proximate to the bleed, we will evaluate a ll time -
dependent risk factors defined as any time in the preceding 2 days, instead of the preceding 3 
days . 
 
Secondary Analyses  
1) To evaluate risk factors for clinically -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, we will repeat the 
same analysis  [11].  
2) To evaluate whether enteral nutrition attenuates  the effect of pantoprazole on bleeding prevention 
compared to placebo, we will includ e an interaction term between pantoprazole v s. placebo and 
amount of enteral  nutrition received [24,25]. 
3) To evaluate whether certain baseline conditions are associated with patient -important upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding , we will include  these variables in the main model  one at a time:  acute 
hepatic failure [ 26], traumatic brain injury  [27] and fem ale sex [28]. 
 
Missing Data  
We anticipate little missing data except for  2 risk factor s in patients w ith length of ICU stay  greater than 2  
weeks. Platelet aggregation inhibitors and c orticosteroids were not collected from day 15 onwards  14 on 
the abbreviated trial case report form. For the primary analysis , if there are any patients remaining in the 
ICU after 2 weeks who received a platelet aggregation inhibitor on day  14, we will impute that it was 
contin ued until ICU discharge, except in the event of bleeding, assuming that the indication persisted over 
time (e.g., coronary artery disease). For the primary analysis , we will impute that if  there are any  patient s 
receiv ing corticosteroid treatment  on day  14, it was continued  only to day 21,  assuming the indication 
resolved (e.g., septic shock) . 
 
Results  
 
We will report independent variables and other characteristics of participants with and without patient -
important upper gastrointestinal bleeding using descriptive statistics, including means and standard 
deviations (or medians with interquartile ranges , if appropriate)  for continuous data,  and numbers with 
percentages for categorical data.  
 Figures we will  present include the day of each bleed in the ICU , the concordance between patient -
important gastrointestinal bleeding and clinically -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding , and the daily 
use of invasive ventilation and any enteral nutrition.   
 
Regression res ults will be presented as adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals  and 
corresponding two- tailed p- values for the associations of each independent variable with the primary and 
secondary outcomes. The criterion for  statistical significan ce will be set at alpha = 0.05. N o corrections for 
multiple testing will be perfor med because of the exploratory nature of the analyses , but findings will be 
interpreted in light of confidence intervals and cautiously interpreted.

 Discussion  
 
In this study , we will examine baseline and time- dependent risk factors for patient -important upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding, including the effect of  pantoprazole versus placebo.  Use of the REVISE trial  
database will build on risk factor analyses of clinically -important upper gastrointestinal bleeding from prior 
large trials [25,29]. 
 
Strengths of this study include the focus on an outcome developed by ICU survivors and relatives of ICU 
survivors or decedents. We will minimize the risk of over -fitted regression models caused by evaluation of 
many admitting diagnoses. Beyond assessing baseline characteristics, we will use  Cox models to assess 
interventions and key laboratory values reflecting events and exposures over the ICU stay .  Although 
proton -pump inhibitors for bleeding prophylaxis do not affect 90- day mortality  overall  as shown in a recent 
meta- analysis (RR 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05])  [30], within -trial subgroup analysis suggest s a possible 
heterogeneity of treatment effect based on disease severity . Accordingly, t he main analysis will address 
the competing risk of death  and a sensitivity analysis will evaluate whether this impacts the results. In this 
contemporary  database,  half of the patients were randomized to no stress ulcer prophylaxis, enabling the 
evaluation of risk factors  with and without  stress ulcer  prophylaxis. This study  will address  some issues 
proposed for future research on this topic  [31], including evaluating  the volume of enteral nutrition ( e.g., 
trophic  versus  full feeding)  and special populations (e.g., acute hepatic failure). Heterogeneous patients 
from 68 international centers  will increas e the generalizability of the results.  
 
Limitations of this study include no information on some uncommon exposures in the REVISE trial (e.g., 
non-invasive ventilation) and on some rare conditions  (e.g.,  admitting diagnosis of organ transplant ation) . 
To focus on events that consume healthcare resources, w e will not address  overt bleeding,  which often 
resolves; if it  evolves  into patient -important or  clinically -important  upper gastrointestinal  bleeding , these 
events will be included in this analysis.  This study is not designed to construct or both construct and 
validate a prediction model, which requires a different design. A ll analys es such as these are subject to 
confounding, yielding information on association rather than causation, needing cautious interpretation.  
 
Conclusions  
 
This study will identify conditions of critical illness which confer an increased  risk of patient -important 
upper gastrointestinal  bleeding.  The findings may  inform bedside care,  practice guidelines, and the 
design of future studies .

Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 9 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 1 BACKGROUND
Secukinumab is the first FDA-approved  therapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in 
the class of recombinant high-affinity, fully human monoclonal antibody of the 
IgG1/kappa isotype that selectively targets Interleukin-17A (IL-17A). In the psoriatic 
skin, IL-17A is thought to be produced by infiltrating Th17 cells, neutrophils and mast 
cells. Upon activation of keratinocytes by IL-17A along with other synergistic 
inflammatory cytokines, further recruitment and activation of neutrophils, lymphocytes 
and myeloid cells eventually lead to a sustained local cutaneous inflammation that drives 
the psoriatic epidermal changes mediated by keratinocytes. This includes increase in 
epidermal thickness (acanthosis), increase in outer stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis) and 
retention of nuclei in the cornified layer (parakeratosis) (Martin 2013).
Secukinumab interferes in this pathologic process by selectively  binding to IL-17A, 
thereby preventing IL-17A interaction with the IL-17 receptor expressed on keratinocytes. 
By its mechanism of action, secukinumab prevents and reverses key pathologic processes 
in psoriasis leading to normalization of skin histology.
Non-clinical studies have not  shown any impediment to using secukinumab administered 
subcutaneously in man. 
The approval of secukinumab (Cosentyx™) is  based on the safety and efficacy outcomes 
from 10 Phase II and Phase III studies, which included over 3,990 patients with moderate-
to-severe plaque psoriasis. This included the four pivotal Phase III trials – ERASURE, 
FIXTURE, FEATURE and JUNCTURE.
For more detail refer to  the Prescribing Information.
2 STUDY RATIONALE
The University
 of California San  Francisco Psoriasis Center has dual expertise in both 
immunologic and genetic analyses of psoriasis. Therefore, this unique proposal will 
examine the effect of secukinumab on the immunologic and genetic environment within 
psoriatic lesions.
2.1 Rationale for Flow Cytometry and RNA-Seq
Regarding understanding
 the impact of biologics on the  molecular profile of psoriatic 
skin, a fundamental question that has not yet been adequately answered is: What is the 
response of specific cell populations in lesional skin to biologic treatment? A number of 
recent studies have used techniques such as RT-PCR, gene microarrays, and 
immunohistochemistry to evaluate changes in lesional skin in response to treatment with 
biologic agents (Zaba, Krueger, Hendriks, Johnston, Russell). These studies are limited by 
the use of bulk skin tissue, which does not permit precise quantitative analysis of 
individual cell types, and by the reliance on limited gene probe libraries used in RT-PCR 
or microarray analysis. Ideally, in order to understand the fundamental biology of how a 
biologic medication improves psoriasis, one would like to be able to isolate the different 
cell populations and study their individual characteristics.  Until now, this has not been 
possible.

Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 10 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 At UCSF, we have developed innovative technologies to  characterize individual skin cell 
populations at the protein and RNA level.  Using a novel flow cytometry protocol, we are 
able to separately analyze distinct skin populations such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, 
regulatory T cells, and myeloid dendritic cells and measure the production of proteins 
such as IL-17, TNF- , IFN- , and IL-2 in parallel (Figure 1).  Because this technique is 
based on protein expression, it offers a truly functional view of the activity of cell 
populations in psoriasis, as methods using microarrays can measure only mRNA 
production, which does
 not necessarily accurately reflect protein expression (Villarino).
Moreover, we are able to perform RNA-sequencing on distinct cell populations. RNA-seq 
is a novel
 technique of quantifying gene expression in which RNA species are sequenced 
rather than hybridized as in microarrays. RNA-seq provides greater sensitivity than 
microarrays, particularly for low-expressed transcripts (Li et al). RNA-seq can also 
identify the expression of coding and noncoding transcripts that are absent on microarray 
platforms. Utilizing our innovative skin biopsy digestion protocol and cell sorting protocol 
described above, we are now able to perform RNA-seq on individual cell populations 
(Figure 2), permitting an understanding of the genetic and immunologic profile of 
individual cell types within psoriatic lesions.  Importantly, this cell type-level RNA-seq 
analysis has never previously been utilized to evaluate changes in patients undergoing 
biologic therapy.

Figure 1. Multi-parameter flow cytometry of punch biopsies obtained from patients with psoriasis.  
We
 have recently developed and optimized a new flow cytometric-based protocol for comprehensively 
studying leukocyte populations isolated from human skin (Sanchez Rodriguez et al). Traditional approaches 
have relied on culturing skin biopsy specimens for 10-20 days in the presence of growth factors, to allow 
infiltrating leukocytes to expand in response to these factors. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that 
lymphocytes cultured for this length of time can alter their functional capabilities and may not accurately 
reflect in vivo  differentiation and function. Using a single 4mm punch biopsy of freshly isolated human skin, 
we are now able to isolate lymphocytes and monocytes and immediately assess their functional activities in 
the absence of growth factors. We perform 15-color flow cytometry on these specimens, allowing for the 
quantification of multiple cytokine, chemokine, and cell surface and intracellular differentiation/activation 
markers at the protein level. Using this technique on 5mm skin punch biopsy specimens, we have analyzed 
the intracellular cytokine expression patterns  from T cells infiltrating lesional and non-lesional skin of a 
patient with psoriasis (shown above). This data shows increased Tregs (denoted by Foxp3 expression) and 
increased TNF- , IL-17 and IFN- production from T cells infiltrating lesional psoriatic plaques when 
compared to non-lesional (normal appearing) skin from the same patient. All graphs are pre-gated on live 
CD3+CD4+ T cells. Numbers indicate percentage of cells per quadrant.

CD25 and CD27. RNA was isolated from these purified cell fractions and subjected to whole transcriptome 
RNA-sequencing. Scatter plot shows grouped Treg vs. Teff comparisons.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 2.2 Risk / Benefit Assessment
Details of the
 risk and  benefits of secukinumab are outlined in the Prescribing 
Information. Side effects of secukinumab include nasopharyngitis (11.4%), diarrhea 
(4.1%), and upper respiratory infections (2.5%). Serious side effects include anaphylaxis 
and exacerbation of Crohn’s disease. The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by 
compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria, proper study design, and close clinical 
monitoring.
In regards to skin biopsy procedures, as in any surgical procedure, there are certain 
inherent risks including bleeding, post-operative  pain, infection, reactions to sutures, 
anesthetics or topical antibiotics, and scarring. All reasonable efforts will be made to  
minimize the possibility of these potential complications .
The benefit to subjects is that they will be receiving an  approved therapy for moderate-to-
severe psoriasis. Although it  cannot be guaranteed, secukinumab has shown to be safe and 
effective in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. An additional benefit to patients  is that they are 
contributing to society by helping  the enhancement of science.

subject (Periodic
 abstinence [e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception)
Female sterilization: have had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) or tubal
 ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In 
case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has 
been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.
Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female 
subjects on the
 study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for 
that subject.
Use of established oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, 
intrauterine device
 (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

11ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
11.1
Adverse Events
Definition of an AE: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational medicinal product.
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) includes the drug under evaluation and the 
comparator drug(s) if specified as part of the research objective, given at any time during 
the study. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the drug of interest are only 
considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the drug of interest.
The occurrence of adverse events will be sought by non-directive questioning of the 
patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are 
volunteered by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination, 
laboratory test, or other assessments. All adverse events will be recorded in the study 
database including the following information:
1. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)
2. its
 relationship to the drug(s) of interest (suspected/not suspected)
3. its
 duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)
4. whether
 it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)
AE Severity
The 
National Cancer Institute’s  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be 
found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Error! Reference source not found. below should be used to grade 
severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that 
a severe AE is not necessarily serious.
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 22 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 Table 1.  AE Severity Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort;  no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospitalizations possible.
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This
 does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug
Relationship
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an  event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of 
the drug; and that is not explained by any other reasonable hypothesis.
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or by other 
interventions.
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.
Unrelated An event that can be  determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug.
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 23 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
A SAE is
 any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
results in death,
is life-threatening,
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
is otherwise a significant medical event.
This 
includes any SAEs likely to arise from the trial indication or progression of 
underlying/concomitant illness(es) (e.g. progression of cancer in oncology trials), unless 
specified in the protocol as study specific exemptions.
Any SAE, irrespective of causality, occurring after the subject has provided informed 
consent 
and until four weeks after the subject has stopped study participation must be 
reported unless otherwise stated in the protocol. SAEs occurring after four weeks from 
ending study participation should only be reported if considered by the Investigator 
attributable to the exposure to the investigational drug(s) during the trial period. This 
includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical 
treatment given to a subject, even if study treatment has not yet started (e.g. withdrawal of 
previous treatment during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of 
concomitant medication).
11.3 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
Study sites
 will document all  SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per 
UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection  period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.
SAEs 
occurring after  four weeks from ending study participation should only be reported 
if considered by the Investigator attributable to the exposure to the investigational drug(s) 
during the trial period. This includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with 
the standard medical treatment given to a subject, even if study treatment has not yet 
started (e.g. withdrawal of previous treatment during washout period, change in treatment 
to a fixed dose of concomitant medication).
In accordance with the standard operating  procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report 
SAEs to the IRB/IEC.  
Timelines: All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported by the sites to Sponsor 
within 24 hours of occurrence of the SAE. The timelines for investigator initiated trials 
reporting to Novartis will be done as per Third Party Study/Investigator Initiated Trial 
Agreement.  
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 24 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 Follow-up reports: SAEs will be followed until resolution or until it is judged to be 
permanent, and an assessment will be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) 
of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the drug of interest, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
The Sponsor shall support  Novartis in the following-up of all SAEs so that complete 
information is available to maintain patient safety and also as part of any commitments by 
Novartis to any Health authority OR specific Health authority follow-up requests for the 
product under investigation.
Pregnancies: Any occurrences of a pregnancy  in a patient (or a patients partner) during 
study participation will be collected. All pregnancies will be followed up to determine 
outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications.
12 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS
12.1 Early
 Discontinuation of Study Drug 
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the subject, the 
investigator, or the
 Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  
The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation: 
Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent)
Subject is not compliant with study procedures
Adverse event that in the opinion of the investigator would be in the best interest 
of the subject
 to discontinue study treatment
Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment
Lost to follow-up
Sponsor request for early termination of study
Positive pregnancy test (females)
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be 
followed and
 treated by the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has 
resolved or stabilized.  
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should  come in for an early discontinuation 
visit as soon as possible and then should be encouraged to complete all remaining 
scheduled visits and procedures.
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified 
or unspecified,
 and without prejudice.
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator  to provide a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in 
the subject’s source documents Refer to Section 10.13 for early termination procedures.
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 25 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 12.2 Withdrawal of Subjects from the  Study
A subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the subject, the investigator, or 
the Sponsor feels
 that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified 
or unspecified,
 and without prejudice.
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator  to provide a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in 
the subject’s source documents. As noted above, subjects who discontinue study treatment 
early (i.e., they withdraw prior to Visit 11) should have an early discontinuation visit. 
Refer to Section 10.13 for early termination procedures. Subjects who withdraw after 
Visit 1 but prior to Visit 52 should be encouraged to come in for a final visit (and the 
procedures to be followed would include those for their next scheduled visit). Subjects 
who sign the informed consent form (ICF) and who are discontinued or withdraw from the 
study before study product administration will be defined as screen failures. No data will 
be collected in the CRFs for screen failure subjects.
13 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS
A protocol violation occurs when the subject, investigator, or Sponsor fails to adhere to 
significant protocol
 requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, subject safety and 
primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, 
the following:
Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Use of a prohibited concomitant medication.
Non-compliance with study  drug regimen.
Non-compliance with study  visit procedures.
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in 
a protocol
 violation. The PI will determine if a protocol violation will result in 
withdrawal of a subject.
When a protocol violation occurs, it  will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a 
Sponsor representative and the Investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s 
regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files.
14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to
 the analysis of the final study data, a detailed  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan described below.  
14.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Flow Cytometry:
 One sample paired t-test  comparing mean change in lesional IL-17A 
positive, CD4+ T lymphocytes at weeks 2, 4, 12 compared to baseline.
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 26 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 14.2 Analysis Secondary Endpoint
RNA-seq:
 Identification of differentially expressed  genes at weeks 2, 4, 12 compared to 
baseline within each immune population studied using the statistical program EdgeR 
(paired analysis).
14.3  Safety Data
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by treatment group. 
Adverse event rates will be coded by body system and MedDra classification term.  
 Adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group and will include the number of 
patients for whom the event occurred, the rate of occurrence, and the severity and 
relationship to study drug.  
14.4 Sample Size
15 subjects will
 receive secukinumab for a treatment  period of 52 weeks (i.e. last injection 
on week 48). All subjects will undergo skin biopsies for molecular profiling.
Sample size justification
Flow cytometry:
 Since these measurements  using real-time flow cytometry have never 
been previously reported, we will have to estimate the minimum  effect size that would be 
clinically relevant. Given the results of pilot testing of our methods using ustekinumab in 
plaque psoriasis, we believe a reduction in lesional IL-17A positive, CD4+ T lymphocytes 
of 10% is clinically meaningful (i.e., results in clinical improvement). The standard 
deviation of the change in lesional IL-17A positive, CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the patient 
population is estimated at 10% (also extrapolated from data generated with ustekinumab). 
Therefore, our standardized effect size is 1.00. For the statistical analysis, we will set 
alpha at 0.05, beta at 0.20 (power = 0.8). The resulting sample size estimate for a one 
sample paired.
RNA-seq: To determine statistical power  to identify differentially expressed genes as 
measured by RNA-seq, we used the Scotty (Busby et al.) power calculator which  uses a t-
statistic and incorporates the variance attributable to read depth. Performing RNA-seq on 
15 samples before and after treatment to a read depth of 50 million per sample as 
proposed here, we can detect >97% of transcripts displaying 2X fold change and >80% of 
transcripts displaying 1.5X fold change with p<0.01 (Figure 3).

15 DATA
 COLLECTION, RETENTION AND MONITORING
15.1 Data Collection Instruments
The Investigator
 will prepare and maintain adequate and  accurate source documents 
designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject. Study 
personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a subject’s 
visit into the protocol-specific electronic or paper Case Report Form (eCRF) when the 
information corresponding to that visit is available. Subjects will not be identified by 
name in the study database or on any study documents, but will be identified by a site 
number, subject number and initials.
If a correction is required for an eCRF, the time and date stamps track the person entering 
or updating eCRF
 data and creates an electronic audit trail. If a correction is made on a 
paper CRF, the study staff member will line through the incorrect data, write in the correct 
data and initial and date the change.
The Investigator is responsible for all information  collected on subjects enrolled in this 
study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for 
completeness and accuracy by the Investigator. A copy of the CRF will remain at the 
Investigator’s site at the completion of the study.
15.2 Data Management Procedures
The data
 will be entered  into a validated database.  The Data Management group will be 
responsible for data processing, in accordance with procedural documentation.  Database 
lock will occur once quality assurance procedures have been completed.
All procedures for the handling  and analysis of data will be conducted using good 
computing practices meeting FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for 
clinical trials.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 15.3 Data Quality Control and Reporting
After
 data have been entered into the  study database, a system of computerized data 
validation checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. On 
eCRFs, queries are entered, tracked, and resolved through the EDC system directly. On 
paper, query reports (Data Clarification Requests) pertaining to data omissions and 
discrepancies will be forwarded to the Investigators and study monitors for resolution.  
The study database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries.  All changes 
to the study database will be documented.
15.4 Archival of Data
The
 database is safeguarded against  unauthorized access by established security 
procedures; appropriate backup copies of the database and related software files will be 
maintained.  Databases are backed up by the database administrator in conjunction with 
any updates or changes to the database.  
At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production  of interim reports and final reports), 
data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.
15.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records
The Investigator
 must make study data accessible  to the monitor, other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., 
FDA) inspectors upon request.  A file for each subject must be maintained that includes 
the signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authorization and Assent Form and copies of all 
source documentation related to that subject.  The Investigator must ensure the reliability 
and availability of source documents from which the information on the CRF was derived.
All study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copies of CRFs, Study 
File Notebook,
 etc.) must be kept secured for a period of two years following marketing of 
the investigational product or for two years after centers have been notified that the IND 
has been discontinued. There may be other circumstances for which the Sponsor is 
required to maintain study records and, therefore, the Sponsor should be contacted prior to 
removing study records for any reason.
15.6 Subject Confidentiality
In order to maintain subject confidentiality, only a site number, subject number and 
subject initials
 will identify all study subjects on CRFs and other documentation submitted 
to the Sponsor.  Additional subject confidentiality issues (if applicable) are covered in the 
Clinical Study Agreement.
16 ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHICAL, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
The study
 will be conducted according  to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of 
Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and 
Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312).
To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other 
records will
 be identified by a coded number and initials only. All study records will be 
kept in a locked file cabinet and code sheets linking a patient’s name to a patient 
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 29 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 identification number will be stored separately in another locked file cabinet.  Clinical 
information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as 
necessary for monitoring by the FDA.  The Investigator must also comply with all 
applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC).
16.1 Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to the  protocol will be written by the PI or a sub-investigator with the 
PI’s approval. Protocol amendments cannot be implemented without prior written 
IRB/IEC approval except as necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  
A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients 
may be implemented immediately, provided the IRBs are notified within five working 
days.
16.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees
The
 protocol and consent form  will be reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC of each 
participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of 
causality will be reported to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC 
informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of 
IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.
Any documents that the  IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) 
will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IECs written unconditional approval of the 
study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator 
before the study is initiated.  The IRB/IECs unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by the Investigator to the designee prior to the shipment of study supplies to 
the site.  This approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title and number and 
should identify the documents reviewed and the date of review.
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may  not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to 
the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC and written verification that 
the modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.  
The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions  to other documents originally submitted for 
review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new 
information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; 
an annual update and/or request for re-approval; and when the study has been completed.
16.3 Informed Consent Form 
Informed consent
 will be obtained in  accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH 
GCP, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 30 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance Portability  and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local regulations.
The Investigator will prepare the informed consent form,  assent and HIPAA authorization 
and provide the documents to the Sponsor or designee for approval prior to submission to 
the IRB/IEC.  The consent form generated by the Investigator must be acceptable to the 
Sponsor and be approved by the IRB/IEC.  The written consent document will embody the 
elements of informed consent as described in the International Conference on 
Harmonization and will also comply with local regulations. The Investigator will send an 
IRB/IEC-approved copy of the Informed Consent Form to the Sponsor (or designee) for 
the study file.
A properly executed, written, informed consent will be  obtained from each subject prior to 
entering the subject into the trial.  Information should be given in both oral and written 
form and subjects (or their legal representatives) must be given ample opportunity to 
inquire about details of the study.  If appropriate and required by the local IRB/IEC, assent 
from the subject will also be obtained.  If a subject is unable to sign the informed consent 
form (ICF) and the HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for the subject.   
A copy of the signed consent form (and assent) will be given to the subject or legal 
representative of the subject and the original will be maintained with the subject’s records.
16.4 Publications 
The preparation
 and submittal for publication of manuscripts containing the study results 
shall
 be in accordance with a process determined by mutual written agreement among the 
study Sponsor and participating institutions.  The publication or presentation of any study 
results shall comply with all applicable privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. 
16.5 Investigator Responsibilities

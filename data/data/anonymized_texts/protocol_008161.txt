ABSTRACT 
 
Given the poor outcome of patients with recurrent or  refractory gliomas and the limited activity of most 
cytotoxic agents, new agents with nove l mechanisms of action are needed. Inhibition of angiogenesis offers 
a new approach based upon the dependence of tumor grow th on angiogenesis. Lenalidomide is an oral agent 
with both antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activity that is well-tol erated in adults and children, and 
appears to have some activity in childhood CNS tumors. 
 
This study is a randomized comparis on of response rate am ong patients with recurrent, refractory or 
progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with lenalidomide. 
Lenalidomide will be given either as a low dose (20 mg/m2/dose) or high dose (115 mg/m2/dose) regimen 
PO for 21 days of each 28 day cycle. Treatment will co ntinue for a maximum of 26 cycles in the absence 
of disease progression or unacceptable side effects. Re sponse will be evaluated prior to every other cycle 
for the first 13 cycles and prior to every third cy cle for cycles 14-26. Correlation of steady state 
pharmacokinetic levels with patient  outcome will be performed.

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS) 
1.1 Primary Objective 
To determine the objective response rate of child ren with recurrent, refractory or progressive 
juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pa thway gliomas who are treated with Regimen A 
low-dose (20 mg/m
2/dose)  or Regimen B high-dose (115 mg/m2/dose) lenalidomide. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
 
1.2.1 
To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) (b ased on standard two-dimensional tumor 
measurements, determined by each institution)  of children with recurrent, refractory or 
progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas a nd optic pathway gliomas who are treated with 
lenalidomide.  
1.2.2 
To compare response categories and EFS across the 3 MR sequences (T2-weighted, 
FLAIR, T1-weighted post-contrast).   1.2.3 
To correlate steady state pharmacokinetics of  lenalidomide (1 sample obtained between 
Days 5-21) with objective response and EFS.  1.2.4 To evaluate toxicities of long term
 lenalidomide use. 
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development 
Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors  of childhood, with an annual incidence of 
33 per 1,000,000 children. Low-grade gliomas are the most common, representing 1/3 of 
all childhood primary CNS tumors. While tr eatment of these lesions is somewhat 
controversial, the general consensus is that these lesions are best treated with surgical 
resection if this can be performed without significant sequelae. Frequently, complete 
resection is not feasible without significant  morbidity. Five- and ten-year progression-free 
survival rates for children with incomplete  resections are 50% and 38%, respectively.1, 2  
Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are utilized in the setting of incomplete resection, but 
radiation may be associated with significant side  effects. In addition, in a recent analysis, 
adults with low-grade gliomas who receive d postoperative radia tion therapy had an 
improved 5 year progression-free survival (PFS), but overall survival (OS) was not significantly different.
3 In pediatric patients, particularly those younger than 10 years and 
those with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), chem otherapy is frequently utilized in an effort 
to postpone radiation therapy and its accompanying neurotoxic effects. 
 
Low-grade gliomas are a histologically he terogeneous group of tumors. Significant 
interobserver variability has been documen ted for pathologic diagnosis and grading.4,5 This 
is further complicated by the fact that some tumors are diagnosed by biopsy alone, which 
may not be representative of the entire tumor. The course of the disease in patients with 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 10 
 
 
low-grade gliomas can be unpredictable. Wh ile some patients are symptomatic, some 
lesions, particularly those associated with NF1, represent incidental findings and the 
disease may be indolent.  
 The major goals for treating unresectable lesions are therefore prevention of tumor 
progression and ablation of associated symp toms, while minimizing side effects of 
treatment. Radiation therapy has been shown to have efficacy, but is associated with cognitive deficits, cerebrovascular sequel ae, endocrinologic dysfunction and second 
malignancies. Many low-grade gliomas are ch emosensitive tumors and chemotherapeutic 
regimens have been used to delay or avoid radiation therapy. Chem otherapeutic regimens 
that have resulted in objective responses an d increased PFS for patients with low-grade 
gliomas include vincristine and carboplatin, a nd the combination procarbazine, lomustine, 
vincristine dibromodulci tol and 6-thioguanine.
6,7 In a study of children with newly 
diagnosed low-grade gliomas with evidence of progression, 56% had an objective response 
to vincristine/carboplatin and PFS was 68 ± 7% at 3 yrs.8 In children with recurrent low-
grade gliomas, 52 ± 10% of assessable patie nts had an objective response to this 
chemotherapy regimen.6 However, these chemotherapeutic  regimens are associated with 
significant toxicities, including allergic reactions to carboplatin. 
  
Temozolomide and weekly vinblastine are alte rnative chemotherapeutic regimens. In the 
COG Phase II study of temozolomide given on a 5-day every 28 day schedule to children 
with recurrent CNS tumors (A09701), 1/21 patients with low-grade glioma had an 
objective response.9 Despite this low objective response  rate, 41% of patients remained on 
study for 12 courses with no evidence of progress ion. In a second study of children with 
progressive or recurrent low-grade gliomas treat ed with temozolomide on a 5/28 day cycle, 
11% of patients with optic pathway/pilocytic astrocytomas had a partial response and 38% 
had stable disease.10 Although it appears to have modest activity, temozolomide is 
associated with hematologic toxicity and a pot ential risk of second malignancy. In A09701, 
25% of patients had Grade 3 or 4 thrombocyt openia and 19% had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
during cycle 1. 
 
Weekly vinblastine has also been studied in the recurrent setting. In a Phase II study of 
weekly vinblastine in children with recurr ent or refractory low-grade gliomas, 57% 
completed 52 weeks of chemotherapy.11 Objective responses occu rred in 40% of patients. 
Patients in this study were eligible at the tim e of first recurrence, and disease progression 
was defined radiographically by either GLPHQVLRQDO  25% increase) or 3-dimensional 
 40% increase) criteria, confirmed at 8 week s. More than 50% of these patients required 
a dose reduction for toxicity. It is importan t to note that these Phase II studies were 
performed in a heterogeneous group of patients with sma ll numbers, different eligibility 
requirements and different definitions of pr ogression. Toxicity was fairly significant. 
 
Juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas are the most  common low-grade glioma in the pediatric 
age group12,28, but, historically, low-grade gliomas have been consolidated into one 
diagnostic category for the purposes of clin ical trials.  Biological data on low-grade 
astroctytomas has recently emerged,  challenging this concept.   
 
2.2 Angiogenesis in Childhood CNS Tumors 
Angiogenesis plays a role in tumor growth, in cluding tumors of the CNS. Brain tumors 
have demonstrated intense neovascular ization and produce potent angiogenic 
mediators.13,14 Several types of childhood CNS tumors, including low-grade astrocytic, 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 11 
 
 
high-grade astrocytic, and embryonal tumors exhibit significant angiogenic activity.15 Over 
the last decade, several of the mechanisms involved in tumor-induced angiogenesis have 
been elucidated. The most direct of these me chanisms is the secretion of cytokines with 
angiogenic properties by the tumor cells. Examples of such cytokines include acidic and 
basic fibroblastic growth factor ( D,E-FGF), angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- D).16-17 Alternately, tumor cells can release 
angiogenic peptides through the production of  proteases and the subsequent breakdown of 
the extracellular matrix where so me cytokines are stored (i.e. EFGF). Angiogenesis can 
also be induced indirectly through the recr uitment of inflammatory cells (particularly 
macrophages) and their subsequent releas e of angiogenic cytokines (i.e. TNF- D, EFGF).18 
 
2.3 Thalidomide 
Thalidomide is a drug with a broad spectr um of activity, including anti-angiogenic 
properties. It inhibits growth factor-mediate d neovascularization, is a known inhibitor of 
TNF-D, and has demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth in solid tumor models. 
Thalidomide costimulates T cells in vitro , inducing cytokine production (including IL-2 
and IFN-J) and cytotoxic responses.19 In clinical trials of this agent in adults with recurrent 
high-grade gliomas, some anti-tumor activity  was observed (4/36 objective radiographic 
responses in one study, with 12/36 stable disease  (SD) for minimum of 2 months), although 
the overall response rate was low.20,21 
 
2.4 Lenalidomide (CC-5013) 
Lenalidomide is a potent analog of thalidomid e and is classified as  an immunomodulatory 
agent. Like thalidomide, it exerts a broad spectrum of pharmacologic and immunologic 
effects. Lenalidomide has been shown to be mo re potent than thalidomide in stimulating 
proliferation of T cells following primary induction by T-cell receptor (TCR) activation, 
and more potent than thalidomide in augmenting production of IL-2 and IFN- J following 
TCR activation of PBMC (IL-2) or T-cells (IFN- J). Lenalidomide also exhibits dose-
dependent inhibition of LPS-stimulated pr oduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines 
TNF-D, IL-1E, and IL-6 by PBMC, and increased production of the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine IL-10 by LPS-stimulated PBMC. Lena lidomide up-regulates caspase 8 and down-
modulates leukocyte adhesion molecules. In contrast to thalidomide, lenalidomide 
stimulates activity of NK cells and induces G1  growth arrest of tumor cells. Lenalidomide 
exhibits significant antiangiogenic properties.  It inhibits vascularization by inhibiting 
endothelial cell migration, rather than endothelia l cell proliferation, and is an inhibitor of 
EFGF, VEGF, and TNF- D. (Investigator Brochure) 
  
Lenalidomide has been studied for use in pa tients with multiple myeloma, MDS, solid 
tumors and congestive heart failure. In Phase I clinical trials of lenalidomide in patients 
with multiple myeloma treated for 28 days at doses of 5 mg-50 mg per day, neutropenia 
and thrombocytopenia were the most common toxicities.22 Grade 4 neutropenia was 
observed in 1 patient at dose level 5 mg, 1 pa tient at dose level 25 mg; grade 3 neutropenia 
was observed in 2 patients at dose level 10 mg, 2 patients at dose level 25 mg and 4 patients 
at dose level 50 mg. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was observed in 1 patient at each of the 
dose levels (5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg). In an  adult study of patients with solid tumors, 
16 patients with various solid tumors were en rolled at doses ranging  from 5 mg/day –150 
mg/day for six weeks. 24,30 The majority of patients trea ted above 25 mg/day developed 
dose-limiting neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.  Additional adverse events considered 
possibly, probably or definitely related to le nalidomide were mild to moderate in severity

and included rash, paresthesias, peripheral  neuropathy, leg or hand cramps, taste 
disturbance, dry mouth, fever, nausea, vom iting, achiness, myalgias, generalized pains, 
bone pain, headache, itchy eye, constipation,  bloating, cough, aphasia, tinnitus, 
pharyngitis, epistaxis, lightheadedness, shortn ess of breath, depression, night sweats, 
insomnia, dry skin, sinus congestion, urinar y frequency, elevated SGOT, hyperuricemia, 
hyperglycemia, and elevated creatinine.   In a Phase I study of lenalidomide administered  daily to adults with refractory metastatic 
cancer (median age 66 yrs), an episode of thrombosis (dose-limiting) and Grade III 
hypotension was observed at a dose of 20 mg/day.
23 Other toxicities (nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, rash, dizziness, peripheral neuropat hy, fatigue, bone marrow suppression) were 
mild. In a second study of lenalidomide in adul ts with solid tumors (primarily melanoma 
and renal cell carcinoma), daily doses of 5- 150 mg/day were well tolerated. Grade 4 
neutropenia was observed in 2 patients receiving > 50 mg/day.24 In a Phase I study in adults 
with recurrent high-grade gliomas, lenalidomid e at doses of 40 mg/day x 21 days was well 
tolerated and no MTD was define d. This dose of 40 mg daily was predetermined to be the 
maximum dose to be tested in the adult glioma  population based on some, but not all, prior

A Phase I study of lenalidomide was recently  performed within the COG in pediatric 
patients with relapsed or refractory so lid tumors or myelodysplastic syndrome. 
(ADVL0319) The primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose and 
recommended Phase II dose for children with  refractory solid tumors and describe the 
toxicities in this population. Doses up to 70 mg/m2/day x 21 days followed by a 7-day rest 
were evaluated. Although 6 episodes of dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) were observed, they 
were sporadic and not clearly associated  with dose. These DLTs included Grade 3 
hypercalcemia, Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, Gr ade 3 hypokalemia, Grade 4 neutropenia, 
Grade 3 somnolence, and Grade 3 urticaria and occurred at doses ranging from 15 mg/m2 
to 55 mg/m2. 29 No MTD was reached. The majority of pa tients on this study did not receive 
more than one course of therapy. 
  A Phase I trial of lenalidomide in pediatric patient s with recurrent, refractory or progressive 
CNS tumors performed within  the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC-018) has 
recently closed to accrual.
25 Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 44 patients are evaluable for 
toxicity and response. Patients were  treated at doses of 15-116 mg/m2/day for 21 days 
followed by a 7 day rest period (one course is 21 days of therapy + 7 day break). A 
maximum tolerated dose has not been reached . The agent has been well tolerated. Two 
DLTs were reported with an unclear associa tion with lenalidomide. One patient treated at 
the 20 mg/m2/day dose level had cardiac dose limiting toxicity with a presumed myocardial 
infarct and elevated troponin. This patient ha d multiple risk factors for thromboembolism. 
One patient at dose level 68 mg/m2/day had dose-limiting fati gue but had concurrent 
disease progression. Twenty-three patients, repr esenting all dose levels, received 6 or more 
courses of treatment and 9 patients have received 12 or more courses to date. 
 On this study (PBTC-018), myelosuppression wa s the primary toxicity and occurred 
sporadically. No patient had Grad e 4 myelosuppression during Course 1.

nausea (10%), emesis (4%), diarrhea (16%), an d constipation (8%), as well as rash (14%) 
and muscle cramping (10%). It is also uncl ear if responses were dose-related. Objective

gliomas enrolled on study have received 8, 12+, 24, 24, 12, 13, 11 and 11+ cycles of therapy to date. Dose levels for these patients ranged from 15-116 mg/m
2/day. Of 12 patients with

patients with low-grade gliomas, including thir d ventricular astrocytomas (2 patients) and 
ganglioglioma (1 patient) have received 22, 24 and 12 courses, respectively. No patient 
with glioblastoma (n=4) received more than one course of therapy. Results from pharmacokinetic analysis show a linear re lationship between lenalidomide dose and C
max 
and AUC 24 hrs.  
 
Early phase clinical trials of noncytotoxic (eg,  antiangiogenic) agents in patients with brain 
tumors are complicated by several issues. Co nventional endpoints in phase I trials are 
defined by predetermined toxicity criteria in  order to define a maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD), or, more recently, by biologic endpoints in order to define a biologically effective 
dose. Standard phase I studies are designed to  best identify acute, rather than long-term 
toxicities. Antiangiogenic agents frequently have  little acute toxicity and may need to be 
administered chronically. They may be e ffective at doses well below the MTD and 
therefore dose escalations to the MTD may be unnecessary. However, defining a biologically effective dose is difficult as ther e is a lack of validated biological surrogate 
markers. Although objective responses were ob served in the Pediatric Phase I trial at the 
higher dose levels and preliminary PK data s uggests increasing exposure with increasing 
dose, it is unclear if response to this agen t is dose related. We will therefore estimate 
activity in two cohorts, with patients receiving Regimen A low-dose (20 mg/m
2/day) or 
Regimen B high-dose (115 mg/m2/day) lenalidomide. 
 Efficacy of an agent in patients with brain tumo rs is historically defined in phase II trials 
by measuring response of the tumor based upon two-dimensional measurements using 
post-contrast MRI scans. These endpoints are neither ideal, nor applicable, when 
evaluating cytostatic agents, such as antiangi ogenic agents, in patients with CNS tumors, 
especially with tumors such as low grade gliomas, that have variable and sometimes 
heterogeneous enhancing patterns and frequen tly contain cystic areas. Time-dependent 
endpoints, such as time to tumor progression, may be more appropriate for this group of 
agents in this patient population. However, th is can be complicated by the erratic growth 
patterns of low-grade gliomas. The majority of  clinical studies estimating activity report 
objective response rate as the primary objectiv e. We will therefore evaluate both objective 
response rate and event-free survival in this study.  
In summary, lenalidomide is a well-tolerated , novel agent that appears to have some 
activity in childhood CNS tumors. Although it has immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory 
and antiangiogenic activity, its exact antitumor mechanism is unclear. It is unclear if a 
dose-response relationship exists or if the pr imary toxicity (myelosuppression) is dose-
related. Long-term toxicities have not been fully evaluated. Given its apparent activity 
profile in children with low-grade gliomas enrolled on the pediatric Phase I study (PBTC-
018), we are proposing a Phase II trial of lenali domide in a subset of this population. Initial 
dosing will be 20 mg/m
2/day on Regimen A and 115 mg/m2/day on Regimen B, which is 
the maximum dose evaluated in the PBTC- 018 Phase I study. Two dose reductions will be 
allowed as long as the patient is deriving clin ical benefit. Response as defined in this trial 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 14 
 
 
will include the objective response rate and long term stable disease; EFS will also be 
determined and compared to the objective response rate. It is  expected that a number of 
these patients will remain on therapy for an extended period of time and therefore the long-
term hematologic tolerability of  this agent will be evaluated. 
 
2.5 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Studies 
In order to obtain more information regard ing a potential dose-response relationship and 
to further determine if myelosuppression is dos e-related, pharmacokinetic studies will be 
performed in all patients in this study. Stead y state PK levels of lenalidomide will be 
performed prior to administering the daily dose any day between Days 5-21 on Cycle 1 and 
again between Days 5-21 on any cycle followi ng a dose reduction. Correlation of steady 
state levels and best response at the patient dose will be performed. A single blood sample 
(2 ml in a heparinized tube) will be collected at up to three time-points and pharmacokinetic 
analyses will be performed using HPLC.   
 
2.6 Rationale for Imaging Studies 
To date, there are no reliable biologic surr ogate markers established in humans for the 
effect of lenalidomide in children with CNS tumo rs. It is unclear if objective response in 
patients with low grade gliomas correlates w ith progression-free survival. In this study, 
standard COG MRI sequences, including T2-weighted, FLAIR, and T1-weighted post 
contrast, will be retrospectively reviewed to  compare response categories with event-free 
survival.

3.1.4 Study Enrollment  
Patient enrollment will be facilitated us ing the Oncology Patient Enrollment 
Network (OPEN). OPEN is a web-based registration system available on a 24/7 
basis. To access OPEN, the site user must have an active CTEP-IAM account 
(check at < https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ia m/index.jsp >) and a 'Registrar' role on 
either the lead protocol organization (L PO) or participating organization roster. 
 All site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study. It is integrated with the 
CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data and, upon enrollment, 
initializes the patient position in the Ra ve database. OPEN can be accessed at 
https://open.ctsu.org or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU members’ side of the 
website at https://www.ctsu.org .  
 
Prior to accessing OPEN, site staff and the results from the rapid central pathology 
screening review have confirmed the patient is eligible. 
x All eligibility criteria have been met w ithin the protocol stated timeframes. 
x All patients have signed an appr opriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form (if applicable).  Note: The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of 
registration and treatment in formation. Please print th is confirmation for your 
records.  Further instructional information is pr ovided on the CTSU members' web site 
OPEN tab or within the OPEN URL (http s://open.ctsu.org). For any additional 
questions contact the CTSU Help Desk at 1-888-823-5923 or 
ctsucontact@westat.com. 
 
3.1.5 Timing 
Female patients of childbearing potenti al must have negative serum or urine 
pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25  mIU/mL) results performed within 10-14 
days and again within 24 hours prior to th e anticipated start of protocol therapy. 
(Refer to Appendix II  for definition of female chil dren of childbearing potential 
[FCCBP]) Also see Exclusion Criteria in Section 3.2.9.3  regarding the requirement 
for female patients of childbearing potential  to commit to comp lete abstinence or 
to be on two forms of effective birth control prior to, during, and following 
protocol therapy.  
 
Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins. The date protocol therapy is projected to start must be no later than five (5)  calendar days after the date of study 
enrollment. Patients who are started on protocol  therapy on this Phase II study 
prior to study enrollment will be considered ineligible .  
 
3.1.5.1 Required Counseling FDA requires that each clinical trials site  have two counselors (Investigators are 
not eligible) trained by Celgene thr ough the Celgene Pregnancy Prevention 
Counselor Program-Pediatric (CPPCP-PED). The CPPCP-PED is available on the 
internet for each person who has complete d the site counselor identification form 
(Appendix I) and registered with Celgen e prior to completing the CPPCP-PED. 
Each patient/guardian must be counseled  prior to dispensing lenalidomide and 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 17 
 
 
documentation is kept in the patient’s reco rds. Both the training certificates and 
the completed Lenalidomide Education a nd Counseling Guidance Documents are 
auditable documents and must be produc ed upon request. Counselors who wish to 
counsel patients for different protocols at the same site or for the same protocol at different silts should indicate this on the site counselor form. Please not that 
counselor training for pediatric patients is  separate from training for adult patients. 
Counselors who previously obtained CPPC P certificates must complete pediatric 
version. CPPCP-PED, in order to coun sel patients in NCI-sponsored pediatric 
studies. 
 Examples of healthcare professionals that may be trained counselors include nurses, pharmacists and physicians. Inve stigators may not serve as designated, 
trained counselors for the purpose of this study. Trained counselors must complete 
training using the online program provided  free by Celgene. After the training is 
complete, the counselors must generate a training certificate and provide it to the 
CTSU for documentation. Sites may not order lenalidomide until documentation for two trained counselors is provided to the appropriate office as instructed in the email from Celgene. Because it may take up to 7 days for training, it is suggested that 
counselors be identified at the onset of the protocol and receive training as soon as 
possible after IRB protocol approval.  Following completion of training, the designated counselors will be responsible for counseling subjects prior to a ny treatment or the dispensing of lenalidomide to ensure 
that the subject has complied with all requ irements including use of birth control and 
pregnancy testing and that the subject understands the risks associated with 
lenalidomide.  Information pertinent to the risks of lenalidomide that should be used as part of training can be found in the document entitled “Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods” 
(Appendix II ).    All investigators should be familiar with this document and the risks 
associated with lenalidomide.  Counseling must be documented by the completion of 
a Lenalidomide Education and Counseling Guidance Document ( Appendix III ).  No 
drug will be dispensed until counseling and co mpletion of this document occurs.  A 
copy of this document must be maintained in the patient’s medical record. Counseling 
includes verification with the patient that required pregnancy testing was performed and results were negative. Pregnancy test results should be documented on the 
Lenalidomide Patient Card for Pediatric Patients ( Appendix IV ).  
A Lenalidomide Information Sheet ( Appendix V ) will be supplied with each 
medication dispense. 
 Please Note: The counseling requirements fo r investigational use of lenalidomide 
are separate from the RevAssist program re quirements in the United States and the 
RevAid
SM program in Canada.  Participation in these two programs is not required, 
nor sufficient for use of the i nvestigational lenalidomide product. 
 All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed 
within 7 days prior to enrollment unless  otherwise indicated in the eligibility 
section below. 
 
3.1.6 Randomization

EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
 
3.2.9 Pregnancy and Breast Feeding  
 
3.2.9.1 Female patients who are pregnant are not eligible due to risks of fetal and 
teratogenic adverse events as seen in an imal studies of lenalidomide. Lenalidomide 
is structurally related to thalidomide,  which is known to cause severe life-
threatening birth defects in humans. 
 3.2.9.2 Lactating females are not eligible unless th ey have agreed not to breastfeed their 
infants while receiving protocol therapy a nd for 28 days after the last dose of 
lenalidomide. 
 3.2.9.3 
Female patients of childbearing potential are not eligible unless they commit to 
complete abstinence or have been on 2 met hods of birth control, including 1 highly 
effective method and 1 additional method at the same time (unless committing to 
complete abstinence of heterosexual intercou rse) at least 28 days (4 weeks) prior 
to study enrollment. Sexually active fema les must also agree to remain on 2 
methods of birth control, during treatmen t (including during dose interruptions), 
and continuing for at least 28 days afte r the completion of protocol therapy. 
Examples of methods of contraception are as follows: 
x Highly effective methods (must use at least 1): 
 Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 Hormonal (prescription birth control pills, injections, 
implants) 
 Tubal ligation 
 Partner’s vasectomy 
 
x Additional effective methods: 
 Male condom 
 Diaphragm 
 Cervical cap 
 
The two methods of birth control requirem ent applies to all sexually active females 
unless they have undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. 
 
3.2.9.4 Female patients of childbearing potential (including those who commit to complete 
abstinence) are not eligible unless they  agree to ongoing pregnancy testing (see 
Section 4.1  for details) and counseling every 28  days about pregnancy precautions 
and risks of fetal exposure.

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM 
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per C OG administrative Policy 5.14  (except where explicitly 
prohibited within the protocol). 
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan 
Upon enrollment, patients will be randomized  to receive one of two treatments with 
lenalidomide; Regimen A (low dose) versus Re gimen B (high dose). Please note there is a 
requirement for contraception for female patients of childbearing potential, such that they 
must commit to complete abstinence or agr ee to use two forms of effective contraception 
beginning at least 28 days prior to the first dose of lenalidomide and continuing until 28 
days after the last dose of lenalidomide. (See Section 3.2.9.4  and Appendix II ). The primary 
study endpoint is objective response. Therapy may continue for a maximum of 26 cycles, 
in the absence of disease progression (see Section 10.4  for definition) if off protocol criteria 
have not yet been satisfied (see Section 8.1 ). 
 
Each cycle of therapy will last 28 days. Lena lidomide will be administered daily for the 
first 21 days of each cycle followed by a 7 day rest period. The lenalidomide dose for 
Regimen A will be 20 mg/m2/day by mouth daily and the dose for Regimen B will be 115 
mg/m2/day by mouth daily. The dose will be rounde d to within 10% of the prescribed dose 
for convenience of capsule size. The calcul ated dose should be rounded in a manner to 
minimize the daily number of capsules.   
 Patients or their guardians will keep a diar y to document the intake of each dose of 
lenalidomide and potential side effects (see Appendix VI ). Please instruct patient/parents 
to record each dose on the diary immediately rather than waiting until a later time. Errors 
on the diary should be crossed out and initialed.  The patient diary should be reviewed with 
the patient and family at the completion of  each treatment cycle, and drug should be 
accounted for at this time.  
 
Brain MRI will be performed at b aseline (within 1 week prior to VWXG\HQUROOPHQWDQG
week on a stable or decreasing dose of ster oids for those patients receiving steroids) and 
prior to each odd-numbered cycle (ie, prior to cy cles 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) for the first 13 
cycles.  During cycles 14-26, imaging will be performed prior to every third cycle (ie, prior 
to cycles 16, 19, 22, and 25), after cy cle 26, and as clinically indicated. See Section 14.0  
for imaging requirements. Patients with spine disease will also have spine MRI performed 
at the same timepoints after enrollment, (ie, pr ior to cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) for the 
first 13 cycles.  During cycles 14-26, imagi ng will be performed prior to every third cycle 
(ie, prior to cycles 16, 19, 22, and 25), after cycle 26, and as clinically indicated.   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 24 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic Study 
For all patients, a blood sample must be obt ained prior to the daily dose between Day 5-21 
of cycle 1 at the time of routine safety lab m onitoring. In the event of a dose reduction, a 
blood sample must also be obtained between Day 5-21 of the first cycle following each 
dose reduction. Please see Section 13.1  for details on pharmaco kinetic sample collection 
and shipping. 
 Required Pregnancy Testing During Study Participation 
Pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of  25 mIU/mL must be performed for female 
patients of childbearing potential, including those who commit to comp lete abstinence. If 
menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 
days and then every 14 days while on study, wh en the patient is taken off protocol therapy, 
and at Days 14 and 28 following the last dose of lenalidomide. All other female patients of 
childbearing potential must have pregnancy te sts weekly for the first 28 days of study 
participation and then every 28 days while on study, at the time the patient is taken off 
protocol therapy, and at Day 28 following the last dose of lenalidomid e. If pregnancy or a 
positive pregnancy test does occur during pr otocol therapy, lenalidomide must be 
immediately discontinued. Pregna ncy testing and counseling must  be performed if a patient 
misses her period, if her pregnancy test is pos itive, or if her menstrua l bleeding is abnormal.  
Lenalidomide treatment must be disc ontinued during this evaluation.  
 Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (incl uding in the partner of a male study patient 
during study participation) must be reported as an adverse event. See Section 11.0  for 
adverse event expedited reporti ng guidelines for pregnancies and suspected pregnancies. 
 
Required Patient Education and Counseling 
Counseling about pregnancy pr ecautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure will be 
conducted every 28 days, on Day 1 of each cycle. See Section 3.1.5.1  for counselor training 
requirements. Counseling must be completed pr ior to each dispensing of lenalidomide, and 
the counseling of each subject must be docum ented using the Lenali domide Education and 
Counseling Guidance Document ( Appendix III ).   
 
See Section 7.1  for required observations prior to starting protocol therapy. 
 
4.2 Concomitant therapy restrictions 
 
4.2.1 Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemothe rapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients while on this study. The use of 
alternative or complementary therapies is discouraged.  4.2.2 Radiotherapy is not permitted.  
4.2.3 
Filgrastim (G-CSF) may be used at the trea ting physician’s discretion in patients with 
severe neutropenia (i.e. ANC <500 ȝ/) to enhance neutrophil recovery when clinically 
indicated (for culture proven bacteremia or invasive fungal infections). Prophylactic or 
routine use of filgrastim in clinically well patients awaiting count recovery is not 
recommended. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 25 
 
 
 4.2.4 
Corticosteroid therapy is permissible only for the treatment of increased intracranial 
pressure or physiologic replacement. The lowe st dose consistent with good medical 
management should be used. Corticosteroids s hould NOT be used as an antiemetic due to 
their effect on the blood brain barrier. Patients on  steroids who require an increase in steroid 
dose for worsening neurologic symptoms s hould have an MRI performed within 72 hours 
to rule out tumor progression. 
 
 4.2.5 Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antie metics, fluids, electr olytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as n ecessary. Antiemetics should not be given 
prophylactically for cycle 1.  
 
4.2.6 Anticonvulsants may be administered as clinic ally indicated.  However, it is unclear what 
effect, if any, lenalidomide has on antic onvulsant pharmacokinetics.  It is strongly 
recommended that anticonvulsant le vels be checked at least weekly during the first course 
of therapy. 
 4.2.7 Drugs known to be pro-thrombotic (i.e. eryt hropoietic stimulating agents) should be 
avoided.  
For COG Supportive Care Guidelines see:  
https://members.children soncologygroup.org/prot/re ference_materials.asp  under Standard 
Sections for Protocols. 
 
4.3 Lenalidomide Administration 
The lenalidomide cycle will be repeated every 28 days. Each cycle will be comprised of 
lenalidomide orally once daily for 21 days fo llowed by 7 days without lenalidomide. 
Lenalidomide should be taken at  approximately the same time each day.  One cycle of 
lenalidomide is described below. Lenalinomide is distributed by the NCI DTCD. Do 
not use commercially available drug.  
 Begin Cycle 1 on Day 1 if ANC ȝ/ , SODWHOHWFRXQWȝ/WUDQVIXVLRQ

x confirmation of negative serum or urine pr egnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 
mIU/mL) in female patients of childbearing potential, 
x confirmation of the use of 2 forms of eff ective birth control for female patients of 
childbearing potential OR confirmation of  commitment to complete abstinence, 
and 
x completion and documentation of required lenalidomide education and counseling 
(all patients) 
 Dose calculations should be based on actual BSA and adjusted as necessary prior to 
each cycle. There is no maximum dosing.

Lenalidomide: PO once daily  
Days: 1 through 21. 
Dose:  Regimen A (Low Dose):  20 mg/m2/dose (See Appendix X  for Dosing Tables) 
Regimen B (High Dose): 115 mg/m2/dose 
 
Note: The calculated dose shoul d be rounded to within 10% of the prescribed dose for 
convenience of capsule size. The calculated dose should be rounded in a manner to 
minimize the daily number of capsules.  The dose should be given without food when 
possible, although this is not mandatory. If a patient vomits a dose within 10 minutes of 
administration and the capsules are clearly visi ble, the dose may be repeated. The capsules 
should be swallowed whole a nd not opened or chewed.  
 
See Section 5.0  for Dose Modifications based on Toxicities.

the Regimen B (High Dose: 115 mg/m2/dose) therapy delivery map.  
 
Following completion of the first cycle, the lena lidomide cycle is repeated for up to a total 
of 26 cycles, as tolerated and in the absence of disease progression (see Section 10.4  for 
Response Evaluation). If disease progression occu rs, the patient will be taken off protocol 
therapy.

5.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES 
Lenalidomide dose reductions will not be re-escalat ed, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with 
the subsequent reduction in dose. Patients who ex perience significant toxicity (as listed in Sections 
5.1 and 5.2) will have the dose reduced by 25% on subsequent cycles.  Two dose reductions are 
allowed, as long as there is no evidence of disease progression (see Section 10.0 ). Each dose 
reduction will be a reduction of 25% of the starting dose; therefore the first dose reduction will be 
to 75% of the starting dose (either to 15 mg/m2/dose for patients on Regimen A or to 86 mg/m2/dose 
for patients on Regimen B), and a second reduction w ill be to 50% of the starting dose (either to 
10 mg/m2/dose for patients on Regimen A or to 58 mg/m2/dose for patients on Regimen B).  See 
Appendix IX  for Regimen A dosing tables. Patients who again experience dose modifying toxicity 
after two dose reductions will be  taken off protocol therapy.  
 
If a dose reduction occurs, a blood sample fo r pharmacokinetic study sh ould be drawn during the 
cycle subsequent to the reduction. See Section 13.0  for details of pharmacokinetic sample 
collection. 
 
5.1 Non-Hematologic Toxicities  
The dose of lenalidomide will be reduced for any of the following toxicities at least 
possibly attributed to lenalidomide: 
• Any Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity  • Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the specific exclusion of:  
 - Grade 3 nausea and vomiting controlled by antiemetics    - Grade 3 fever or infection  
- Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia,  hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia 
responsive to oral supplementation. 
• Any Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that persists for > 3 days and is considered 
sufficiently medically significant or suffi ciently intolerable by patients that it 
requires treatment interruption  • Any other adverse event attributed to  lenalidomide that requires treatment 
interruption for > 3 days or which re curs upon drug rechallenge and requires 
treatment interruption. 
• Non-hematological toxicity that causes a delay of t 14 days between treatment 
cycles. 
  
Patients who experience non-hematologic toxi city should have a ppropriate laboratory 
testing at least twice week ly (3-4 days apart) until the toxicity has resolved. 
 Lenalidomide will be held for any patient e xperiencing any Grade hemorrhagic or bullous 
skin rash until a specific evaluation to exclude  toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been 
performed.  Any patient with evidence of  TEN or Stevens-Johnson syndrome will not be 
retreated with lenalidomide. 
 If the patient experiences a thromboembo lic event unrelated to a central line, 
lenalidomide will be discontinued and the pa tient will be taken off protocol therapy. 
 
5.2 Hematologic Toxicities   
The dose of lenalidomide will be reduced for any of the following toxicities: 
• Grade 4 decreased neutrophil count (neutropenia) > 3 days duration 
• Grade 4 decreased platelet  count (thrombocytopenia)

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
6.1 LENALIDOMIDE (RevlimidTM, CC-5013, CDC-501) NSC# 703813, IND # (05/15/18) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue with the chemical 
name 3-(4’-amino-1,3-dihydro-1-oxo-2 H-isoindol-2-yl) -2,6-piperidinedione. The 
molecular weight of lenalidomide is 259.25.  
Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with  a mechanism of action that remains to 
be fully characterized. Lenalidomide inhibits proliferation of certain hematopoietic tumor 
cells (including MM plasma tumor cells and those with deletions of chromosome 5), 
enhances T cell- and natural killer (NK) cel l-mediated immunity and increases the number 
of NK T cells, inhibits angiogenesis by bloc king the migration and adhesion of endothelial 
cells and the formation of microvessels, a ugments fetal hemoglobi n production by CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits secre tion of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF- Į 
and IL-6) from monocytes. Lenalidomide also i nhibited the expression of cycoloxygenase-
2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro . 
 Following oral administration, lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma 
concentrations occurring between 0.5 and 1.5 hours postdose. Co-administration with food 
does not alter the extent of lenalidomide absorption (area under the concentration time 
curve, AUC) but does reduce the maximal plasma concentration (C
max) by 36%. The Cmax 
and AUC increase proportionally (linearly) with increases in dose and multiple dosing (up 
to 100 mg twice daily) does not cause a signi ficant drug accumulation. In plasma, the 
relative exposures of the S- and R- enantio mers of lenalidomide are approximately 55% 
and 45%, respectively. 
 Lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is low with mean plasma protein binding around 
30% (22.7% and 29.2% in multiple myeloma pati ents and healthy volunteers, respectively). 
Lenalidomide is neither metabolized by nor i nhibited or induced by the cytochrome P450 
pathway. In healthy volunteers, lenalidomid e undergoes limited metabolism and the parent 
compound is the predominant circulating co mponent. Approximately 65% to 85% of 
lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged in the urine. The half-life of elimination is 
approximately 3 hours at the clinically releva nt doses and steady-state levels are achieved 
within 4 days. Pharmacokinetic analyses in pa tients with impaired renal function indicate 
that as renal function decreases, the total dr ug clearance decreases proportionally resulting 
in an increase in AUC. The half-life of le nalidomide increased from  approximately 3.5 
hours in subjects with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min to more than 9 hours in subjects 
with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min; theref ore, patients with inadequate renal function 
are ineligible for this study.

Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 31 
 
 
 With regards to potential drug interactions , the periodic monitoring of digoxin plasma 
levels is recommended due to increased Cm ax with concomitant administration of 
lenalidomide. Patients taking concomitant ther apies such as erythropoietin stimulating 
agents or estrogen containing therapies may have an increased risk of venous 
thromboembolic events. Therefore, erythropoie tic agents should not be used while patients 
are receiving lenalidomide on this trial. Ot her agents that may increase the risk of 
thrombosis, such as estrogen containing therapie s, should be used with caution in patients 
receiving lenalidomide.

MDS) in multiple myeloma patients being treated with melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide 
post bone marrow transplant. 
 
7Serious tumor flare reactions have been observed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) and lymphoma. 
 
8A decrease in the number of stem cells (CD34+ ce lls) collected from patients treated with >4 
cycles of lenalidomide has been reported. 
 
9Significantly increased risk of deep vein thro mbosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and 
arterial thrombosis has been observed in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide 
with dexamethasone. 
 
10Gastrointestinal hemorrhage includes: Anal hemorrhage, Cecal hemorrhage, Colonic 
hemorrhage, Duodenal hemorrhage, Esophageal he morrhage, Esophageal varices hemorrhage, 
Gastric hemorrhage, Hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, Ileal hemorrhage, Intra-abdominal hemorrhage, 
Jejunal hemorrhage, Lower gastrointestinal he morrhage, Oral hemorrhage, Pancreatic

Small intestinal obstruction under the GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS SOC. 
 
12Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been seen with in creased frequency when lenalidomide is used in 
combination with bevacizumab, docetaxel (Tax otere®), prednisone, and zolendronic acid 
(Zometa®). 
 
 
NOTE :  While not observed in human subjects, lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused 
limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study similar to birth defects caused by 
thalidomide in humans. If lenalidomide is used duri ng pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or 
embryo-fetal death. Pregnancy mu st be excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy 
during treatment by the use of two reliable methods of contraception.

Effect in Pregnancy and Lactation: 
Lenalidomide is Pregnancy category X . It can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman and is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, in an embryofetal developmental toxicity study in monkeys, teratogenicity, including 
thalidomide-like limb defects occurred in offs pring when pregnant monkeys received oral 
lenalidomide during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.17 times the adult maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg, b ased on BSA. Similar studies in pregnant 
rabbits and rats at 20 times and 200 times the MRHD respectively, produced embryolethality in rabbits and no adverse repr oductive effects in rats. In another study, 
pregnant rats received lenalidomide from or ganogenesis through lactation; some delay in 
sexual maturation occurred in male offspring. As with thalidomide, the rat model may not 
adequately address the full spectrum of po tential human embryofetal developmental 
effects for lenalidomide.  
The requirements of this study and the requirem ents to receive the co mmercially available 
supply are slightly different.  For the purpose of  this study, female of childbearing potential 
(FCBP) is a sexually mature (at least Tanner 2) female who: 1) has achieved menarche or 
breast development in Tanner Stage 2 or great er, and 2) has not un dergone a hysterectomy 
or bilateral oophorectomy and must use effectiv e means of contraception for 28 days before 
therapy, during lenalidomide therapy and dos e interruptions, and for 28 days following 
discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy or  continually abstain from reproductive 
heterosexual intercourse.  Venous thromboemb olism (VTE) has been seen in patients with 
multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide pl us dexamethasone and patients with 
myelodysplastic syndrome receiving lenalidomid e monotherapy (to a lesser extent).  
Because oral contraceptives may also place the patient at risk of VTE, physicians should 
discuss this increased risk and the risk/b enefit of contraceptive methods with patients 
receiving lenalidomide. 
Male patients must agree to completely abst ain from sexual contact with women who are 
pregnant or are able to become pregnant or use a latex condom every time he engages in 
sexual contact with women who are pregna nt or who may become pregnant.   
 
If a pregnancy occurs during treatment, the dr ug must be immediately discontinued and the 
suspected fetal exposure should be reporte d to CTEP via CTEP-AERS. Refer to Section 
11.9. 
 
It is not known whether lenalidomide is ex creted in human milk. Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk and because of the pote ntial for adverse reactions in nursing infants 
from lenalidomide, a decision should be ma de whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue the drug, taking into considera tion the importance of the drug to the mother.  
 Formulation and Stability: Lenalidomide is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, an d 25 mg capsules for oral administration for 
the purpose of this study. Lenalidomide 10 mg capsules will not be used in this study. 
 Each capsule contains lenalidomide as the active ingredient and the following inactive 
ingredients: lactose anhydrous, microcryst alline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and 
magnesium stearate. The capsules are supplied in tamper-evident, child-resistant, opaque, 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 38 
 
 
high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles) with  polypropylene caps.  Each bottle contains 
100 capsules. Lenalidomide should be stored at  25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15-
30°C (59-86°F).  
 Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the 
protocol. Each subject must receive counseling regard ing the use and risks of lenalidomide by a 
healthcare professional who has received sp ecific training by Celgene.  Additional 
information about the training of these h ealthcare professionals can be found in Section 
3.1.5.1  and Appendix I .  The counseling of each subject  must be documented using the 
Lenalidomide Education and Coun seling Guidance Document ( Appendix III ).  Once 
documentation has been confirmed, a phar macist may dispense the investigational 
lenalidomide to the patient.  Pharmacists may on ly dispense up to a 28-day supply at one 
time (1 cycle, or a 21-day supply for th e purpose of this study).  A Lenalidomide 
information sheet ( Appendix V ) must be provided each and every time the medication is 
dispensed.  Prescriptions may not be mailed to the patient.   
 
Lenalidomide capsules should not be opened or crushed. If lenalidomide powder contacts 
the skin, it must be washed immediatel y and thoroughly with soap and water. If 
lenalidomide contacts mucous membran es, flush thoroughly with water.  
 
Lenalidomide s hould be taken  by mouth with a full glass of water and without food at 
approximately the same time each day for 21 consecutive days. If nausea occurs after 
taking the dose, administer with food as this may decrease nausea.  If a dose is forgotten 
but remembered within 8 hours, the missed dose should be taken/given immediately. If 
more than 8 hours have passed since the time th e dose was due, that day’s dose should be 
skipped.  If a dose is vomited within 10 minut es of taking the dose and the capsules are 
visible in the emesis, the dose should be re peated and the patient’s provider should be 
notified.  
 
Procedures for the proper handling and dispos al of hazardous/antic ancer drugs should be 
considered.  
 
Supplier:   Supplied by Celgene and distributed by the NCI DTCD. Do not use 
commercially available drug.  
 
Agent Ordering 
NCI supplied agent may be requested by the Pr incipal Investigator (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be 
treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of  agents between institutions (unless prior 
approval from PMB is obtained.)  The CTEP assi gned protocol number must be used for 
ordering all CTEP supplied investigational agen ts.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be register ed with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If 
there are several participating investigat ors at one institution, CTEP supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead 
investigator at that institution. One additi onal dose of lenalidomid e may be ordered and 
dispensed so it is readily available in the event the patient vomits the capsules.

7.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED 
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response a ssessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental de sign or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient  and family logistical, or  facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per C OG administrative Policy 5.14  (except where explicitly 
prohibited within the protocol). 
 
7.1 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluations  
All baseline studies must be performed prior to starting protocol therapy unless otherwise 
indicated below.  Obtain other studies prior to start of subsequent cycles and as

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration 
Approximately 45 patients per year less than 10 years of age with progressive/recurrent 
and high-risk LGA were enrolled on COG-A9952, Chemotherapy for Progressive Low 
Grade Astrocytoma in Children Less Than Ten Years Old . About half of these children (22 
patients) would be expected to progress and would be eligible for the current study.  
 
The total accrual of newly diagnosed LGA patients on CCG-9891/POG-9130, Treatment 
of Newly Diagnosed Low Grade Astrocytomas , was 713 over a period of 5 years. About 
40% of these patients were older than 10 ye ars of age and 20% progressed within 6 years 
of diagnosis. This corresponds to about 11 patients per year older than 10 years with 
progressive LGA. Adding to this those wh o will be entered because of symptomatic, 
incomplete resections, we would expect approximately 20 pati ents per year older than 10 
years of age.   Adding together patients who are younger than and those older than 10 years of age (22 + 
20 = 42), and taking into account patients  who may opt for other treatments and the 
eligibility criteria of at least 1 prior therapy including carboplatin, we expect a total of 30 
patients with recurrent or progressive low-grade glioma per year.  This study will enroll only patients with pilocytic astrocytoma and progressive optic 
pathway gliomas.  Based on prior COG enrollm ent, we estimate 70% of low grade glioma 
patients to be in this subset (30*0.7=21/yr).  The total accrual target for this study is 74 
patients enrolled in 3.5 years. Considering that  some patients enrolled may be found to be 
ineligible, the maximum number of patients e xpected to be accrued is 80 patients.   
 
9.2 Study Design 
This is a randomized study to estimate the response rate of children with recurrent or 
progressive pilocytic astrocytoma and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with lenalidomide assigned to either Regimen A low dose (20 mg/m
2/dose) or Regimen B high 
dose (115 mg/m2/dose). 
 
9.3 Methods of Analysis 
9.3.1 Endpoints 
 
9.3.1.1 Primary Endpoint 
x Objective response – best response  determined from the sequence 
of the objective statuses described in Section 10.0  ‘Response 
Criteria.’ 
9.3.1.2 Secondary Endpoints 
x Time to treatment failure (Event-free survival, EFS) – the time 
from study enrollment to tumor progression, tumor recurrence, death from any cause, or occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 43 
 
 
x Time to death (Overall survival, OS) – the time from study 
enrollment to death from any cause. 
 
9.4 Analysis of Efficacy 
A total of 74 eligible patients will be enro lled on this trial. Patients will be randomly 
assigned to either the low dose (Regimen A) or the high dose arm (Regimen B).  Each 
patient will be classified according to their ‘b est response’ for the purposes of analysis of 
treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the objective statuses 
described in Section 10.0  ‘Response Criteria.’ A responder is defined as a patient who 
achieves a best overall response of CR or PR at  any time on the study. If a patient achieves 
a PR or CR and later has progressive disease or relapse, then the patient will be counted as 
a responder. The response rate will be calculat ed as the ratio of the number of patients who 
demonstrate response (CR or PR) divided by th e number of patients evaluable for response. 
The 95% confidence bounds for response rate  are shown in the table below for several 
different outcomes. The computation is based  on the binomial distribution, assuming the 
availability of 30 evaluable patients (7 inevalua ble patients) for response in each arm (each 
dose level). All patients eligible for study who receive any study dr ug will be considered 
evaluable for response. Any patient who goe s off protocol therapy for any reason 
(patient/parent/physician choice,  adverse event profile, etc.) prior to the first response 
evaluation will be considered a non-responder. Fo r example, an observed response rate of 
33% (10/30) will be consistent with the view that 17% or more patients will respond to the 
treatment. 
 
Outcome (#Response/#Patients) 95% Exact Confidence Bound on 
Response Rate 
20/30 (0.47, 0.83) 
15/30 (0.31, 0.69) 
10/30 (0.17, 0.53) 
5/30 (0.06, 0.35) 
 
There would be modest power to compare the response rates for the 2 dose cohorts.  With 
74 patients, we would have 80% power to detect a response rate difference of 35% vs. 15%, at the 1-sided 20% significance level.  
Disease progression will be based on the results of institutional review. Standard survival 
methods will be used for analysis of EFS a nd OS. Analyses include log rank tests and the 
product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate fo r estimation of EFS and OS probability. 
Comparison of EFS between the two dose levels will primarily be exploratory.  With 74 
patients, we will have only approximately 69%  power to detect a 15% increase in long-
term EFS (30% to 45%) with 50% patients rece iving high dose vs. 50% receiving low dose, 
based on a one-sided logrank test with 20% Type I error rate. 
 
 
9.5 Monitoring for Efficacy 
Patients will be randomly assigned to either  the low dose or the high dose treatment.  Of 
the 37 patients on each treatment, we will closel y monitor the first 20 patients enrolled. For 
each regimen, the early stopping criterion an d the decision regarding ultimate further 
interest in this agent will be based on th e number of objective responses and disease 
progressions in the first 6 months of treatmen t. If the early stopping rule is met for one 
treatment, that particular arm will be closed and the other arm will continue as planned. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 44 
 
 
A true response rate of 5% and a true early (6-month) progression rate of 40% are 
considered inadequate, whereas a true respon se rate of 20% and a true early (6-month) 
progression rate of 25% would be sufficient  for further interest in this agent. 
 The study will be a 2-stage design, with 20 evaluable patients in the first stage and 17 
evaluable patients in the second stage (37 patients total per treatment regimen), with 
decisions made as follows:   
 
Number of Evaluable 
Patients Enrolled Results Decision 
Stage I: 20 evaluable 
patients Zero or one responders or 10 
or more with early 
progression Terminate enrollment with the 
conclusion the regimen does 
not demonstrate sufficient disease control 
All other configurations of response or early progression Continue to the next stage and 
enroll 17 more patients 
Stage II:  17 additional evaluable patients (Total of 37: 20 from Stage I and 17 from Stage II) Cumulatively 3 or fewer 
responders or 15 or more with early progression Conclude the regimen does not 
demonstrate sufficient disease control 
All other configurations of response or early progression Conclude the regimen 
demonstrates sufficient disease control for further investigation 
  
A summary of the operating characteristics  of this design are provided below:

0.15 0.25 0.18 0.73 
0.20 0.25 0.08 0.88 
 
9.6 Monitoring for Toxicity  
“Toxic events” will be defined as one in which a patient has two dose reductions and then 
experiences another significant toxicity as defined in Section 5.0 , irrespective of 
attribution. A two-stage stopping rule will be  used to monitor for an excessive number of 
these toxic events. All patients described below must be evaluable for toxicity.  All patients 
who receive at least one dose of lenalidomide wi ll be evaluable for toxicity.  A review of 
treatment feasibility and patient safety will be  undertaken if we observe at least 5/18 or 
8/36 toxic events.  The rule will be met about 4%  of the time if the true incidence of toxic 
event is 10%, and 90% of the time if the true incidence is 30%. 
 
9.7 Interim Monitoring of Toxic Death 
Toxic death is death predominantly attributable  to treatment-related causes. The occurrence 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 45 
 
 
of toxic death at any time will be a primary endpoint for safety monitoring. Any toxic death 
on study will be reviewed with CTEP and th e DMSC prior to continuing enrollment on 
study.  The study will be stopped if there are two toxic deaths on study.  
 
9.8 Analysis of Toxicity 
Estimates will be obtained using life-table meth ods, with an event defined as the first 
occurrence of a primary toxicity. Time scale us ed in the time to first occurrence of a key 
acute and subacute toxicity is time in days since the start of therapy.  Patients who have 
progression or recurrence of disease will be censored in these analyses. The rates of 
individual toxicities in each course of treatmen t, the number of patients who require a dose 
reduction and number of patients who come off protocol therapy due to toxicity will be 
summarized using standard descri ptive statistical methods. To evaluate hematologic 
toxicity of long term le nalidomide administration  adverse event data will be collected 
using CTCAE version 4 toxicity coding. Grade 3 or greater hematologic toxicities will be 
recorded per reporting period and comp ared between 2 lenalidomide doses  
 
9.9 Analysis of Lenalidomide Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Correlation of lenalidomide concentration obtai ned from the steady-state sample and the 
number of cycles received prior to the occurr ence of disease progression will be performed 
using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Cox regr ession analysis will be used to assess the 
association between outcome and steady state levels at a particular cycle. 
 
9.10 Analysis of Standard MR Sequences 
To compare the methods of MRI sequence, th e response categories (complete response, 
partial response, stable disease, and progress ion) will be determined from the following 
three standard MR sequences, T2-weighted, FLAIR, T1-weighted post-contrast.  Percent 
agreement between the sequences will be estim ated as the number of  follow-up scans in 
which the corresponding sequence agreed divided by the total number of follow-up scans.  
Standard error will be estimated by use of the bootstrap method28 to account for the 
correlated dependent response data, and these values will be used to estimate the 95% 
confidence intervals.  The event- free survival distributions will  be compared across the MR 
sequences, with a proportional hazards model developed for dependent  survival data by 
Wei et al (1989).29 
 
9.11 Effect of the Stratification on Response Rate 
At enrollment, the number of prior therapies, classified as 2 or fewer versus more than 2 
will be required to complete the treatment assi gnment process.  The efficacy rule described 
in Section 9.5  will be executed as written regardless of the number of prior therapies that a 
patient has received.  The risk for EFS-event an d death associated with receiving more than 
2 prior regimens will be assessed using the st ratified 1-sided log-rank test, with randomized 
regimen as the stratification factor.  Only patients enrolled after approval of the proposed 
amendment will be considered in the analysis.  If the resulting p-value is not significant at 
the 0.10 level or less, the EFS and OS r esults will be presented without regard to 
stratification factor. 
 
The following logistic regression model will be utilized:

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCA E of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for 
toxicity and performance repor ting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ).  
 
Please note: ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE 
v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website (ie, v4. 02 and all subsequent iterations prior to 
version 5.0). 
 
10.2 Methodology to Determine Tumor Measurement  
Tumor dimensions are determined by measurem ent of the longest tumor dimension and its 
perpendicular for each target lesion. Regard ing MRI imaging, the radiologist at each 
institution may select whatever sequence be st highlights the tumor (T1 enhanced or T2 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 47 
 
 
weighted or FLAIR images) and the same sequence should be used for serial measurements. Response determination will be based on a comparison of an area (W x T – see below) between 
the baseline assessment and the study date design ated in the follow-up Report Form.  Reports 
for the follow-up exams should reiterate the meas urements obtained at baseline for each target 
lesion.  Non-target lesions or newly occurring lesions should also be  enumerated in these 
reports, and changes in non-target lesions should be described. 
 Tumor response criteria are determined by  changes in size usin g the longest tumor 
dimension, and its perpendicular. Either T1 or  T2 weighted images are used - which ever 
gives the best estimate of tumor size. The fo llowing section describes the methodology. 
(See Figure 10.1 below for illustration)  1. For MRI imaging (preferred), the longest di ameter can be measured from the axial 
plane or the plane in which th e tumor is best seen or meas ured, provided the same plane 
is used in follow ups. This longest measurem ent of the tumor is referred to as the width 
(W). Longest diameter of target lesion(s) should be selected in the axial plane only for 
CT. 
2. The perpendicular measurements  should be determined - tr ansverse (T) measurement, 
perpendicular to the width in the selected plane.  
3. The cystic or necrotic components of  a tumor are not considered in tumor 
measurements. Therefore only the solid com ponent of cystic/necrotic tumors should 
be measured. If cysts/necrosis composes th e majority of the lesion, the lesion may not 
be “measurable”.   
Options:  
- if the cyst/necrosis is eccentric, the W and T of the solid portion should be 
measured, the cyst/necrosis excluded from measurement 
- if the cyst/necrosis is central but repr esents a small portion of the tumor (< 
25%), disregard and measure the whole lesion 
- if the cyst/necrosis is central but re presents a large portion of the tumor, 
identify a solid aspect of the mass that can be reproducibly measured 
4. Leptomeningeal tumor spread is usually not  a target lesion, and usually cannot be 
measured accurately. Presence and location of  leptomeningeal tumor spread should be 
noted and change in extent/thickness assessed on follow up studies.

5. Overall Response Assessment 
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both the target and non-
target lesion, and the appearance of new le sions, where applicable, according to the 
criteria described in the table below.  The ov erall response assessment is shown in the 
last column, and depends on the assessments of target, non-target, and new lesions in 
the preceding columns.

10.3 Selection of Target and Non-Target Lesions 
1. For most CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response.  
2. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 3 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target lesions should be selected  on the basis of size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements.  All othe r lesions will be followed as non-target 
lesions (including CSF positive for tumor cells).   
3. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickness of 
the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect (e.g. 8 mm lesion 
for a 4 mm slice). 
4. Any change in size of non-target lesions should be noted, though does not need to 
be measured. 
 
10.4 Response Criteria for Target Lesions 
1. Response criteria are assessed in 2 dimensions – the product of W x T.  
2. To assess response/progression, the ratio is calculated: 
   W x T (current scan)  
   W x T (reference scan) 
 
3. Development of new disease or progre ssion in any established lesions is 
considered progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g. when 
multiple lesions show opposite respon ses, the progressive disease takes 
precedence. 
 
4. For purposes of this study, response  criteria for target lesions are: 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Complete disappearance of all known disease for at least 4 
weeks. Complete response is dated from the time all lesions have disappeared.  
 
Partial response (PR):  A reduction of at least 50% in th e size of all measurable tumor as 
quantitated by the sum of the products of the largest diameters of me asurable lesions and 
maintained for at least 4 weeks. Partial response is dated from the time of first observation. 
In addition, there can be no appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion. 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  A decrease of <50% or an increase of <25% in the sum of the 
products of the largest diameters of measurab le lesions and no evidence of new lesions. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  LQFUHDVHLQWKH sum of the products of the largest 
diameters of the measurable lesions or the ap pearance of one or more new lesions. Two-
dimensional measurements (using WHO criteria)  of an existing tumor will be compared to 
the study baseline or best response scan (whi chever is smaller) compared side-by-side. 
 
Local progression is defined as progression of known residual tumor or the appearance of 
tumor at known prior sites of disease that were  at some point without evidence of disease. 
Distant progression is defined as the appearan ce of tumor at sites other than known prior 
sites of disease. Distant progression most of ten occurs in the subarachnoid space and may 
occur at any point within the neuraxis. Alt hough rare, extra-CNS metastasis represents 
distant failure. Combined local and distant pr ogression is defined when evaluation of the 
entire neuraxis reveals local and distant progression.

10.5 Response Criteria for Non-target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions.  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):   The persistence of one or more non-target 
lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions.  
 
10.6 Retrospective Response Review 
MRI imaging for all patients on study will underg o retrospective central review following 
the completion of treatment. See Section 14.4  for imaging central review requirements. 
 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose 
Adverse event (AE) data collection and repor ting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of  patients enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll in future studies using simila r agents. Certain adverse events must be 
reported in an expedited manner to allow for tim elier monitoring of patient safety and care. 
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 
 
11.2 Expedited Reporting Requirements – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
To ensure compliance with these regulatio ns/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI 
requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting table 
assigned to the protocol, using the NCI’s Adverse Event Expedi ted Reporting System 
(CTEP-AERS). 
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with th e use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adver se Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that re sults in ANY of the following outcomes: 
 
1) Death. 
2) A life-threatening adverse drug experience. 
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
KRVSLWDOL]DWLRQIRU  24 hours). This does not incl ude hospitalizations which are 
part of routine medical practice. 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or  substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be consid ered a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. 
7)  Pregnancy (See Section 11.9 )

Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 51 
 
 
11.3 Specific Examples for Expedited Reporting  
11.3.1 SAEs Occurring More than 30 Da ys After Last Dose of Study Drug 
Any Serious Adverse Event that occurs more than 30 days after the last 
administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a 
possible, probable, or definite relationshi p to the study therapy must be reported 
according to the CTEP-AERS reporting table in this protocol.  
 
11.3.2 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities 
Any AE that results in persistent or signific ant incapacity or substantial disrubtion of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP-AERS if it occurs at 
any time following treatment with an ag ent under a NCI IND/IDE since these are 
considered serious AEs. 
 
11.3.3 Death 
Reportable Categories of Death  
 
x Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
x Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life 
during the first 28 days of life.  
x Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defin ed as instant or within one 
hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CT CAE term associated with Grade 
5.  
x Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a 
CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
x Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease 
progression” in the system organ class (SOC)  “General disorders and 
administration site conditions .” Evidence that the death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting 
tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requi res expedited reporting within 24 hours.  
Any death occurring greater than 30 days after the last dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedi ted reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention. 
 
11.3.4 Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (eg, treatment with investig ational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initia l neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
The NCI requires all secondary malignancie s that occur following treatment with 
an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be repor ted via CTEP-AERS. Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 52 
 
 
x Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
x Myelodysplastic syndrome  
x Treatment related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to can cer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
must also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this 
protocol. 
 
11.3.4 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatme nt of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malign ancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
11.3.5  Pregnancy, Pregnancy Lo ss, and Death Neonatal  
NOTE: When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form, available at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopmen t/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and fa xed along with any additional 
medical information to (301) 230-0159.  The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or chem otherapy agent(s) shoul d be documented in 
the “Description of Event” sec tion of the CTEP-AERS report. 
 
11.3.5.1 Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents that may be teratoge nic. For this reason, pregnancy needs 
to be reported in an exped ited manner via CTEP-AERS as  
Grade 3 “ Pregnancy, puerperium an d perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy )” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions” SOC. 
 Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby 
is born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP-AERS report 
is required. 
 
11.3.5.2 Pregnancy Loss (Fetal Death)  
Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “ Death in utero. ” Any 
Pregnancy loss should be re ported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy loss ” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions”  SOC . Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP-AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
11.3.5.3 Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn death occurring 
during the first 28 days of birth ”, should be reported expeditiously, as 
Grade 4 “ Death neonatal ” under the “General disorders and 
administration”  SOC when the death is the result of a patient 
pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report 
a neonatal death resulting from a pa tient pregnancy or pregnancy in 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 53 
 
 
partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP-AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.4 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
11.4.1 Baseline AEs 
Although a pertinent positive finding identi fied on baseline assessment is not an 
AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protocol with a pre-existing condition (eg, elevated laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re -assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines. 
a. If the pre-existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required. 
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must  re-assess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required. 
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities 
existing at baseline. 
 
11.4.2 Persistent AEs 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between 
treatment cycles/courses.  ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in a subsequent co urse. If the grade becomes more severe 
the AE must be reported again with the new grade. EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course. 
 
11.4.3 Recurrent AEs 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and re solves during a cycle/course of therapy 
and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course. ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves  and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course must be reported by the routine procedures. EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course does not requ ire CTEP-AERS reporting unless: 
1) The grade increases OR 2) Hospitalization is associated with the recurring AE. 
 
11.5 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 
11.5.1 Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) 
SPEER: Is a subset of AEs within th e Comprehensive Adverse Events and 
Potential Risks (CAEPR) that contains a list of events that are considered expected 
for CTEP-AERS reporting purposes. (Formerly referred to as th e Agent Specific 
Adverse Event List (ASAEL).)  
 
AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported  expeditiously by investigators to the 
NCI via CTEP-AERS ONLY if they exce ed the grade of the event listed in 
parentheses after the event. If the CAEPR is part of a combination IND using 
multiple investigational agents and has an  SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the 
lower of the grades to determine if  expedited reporting is required. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 54 
 
 
11.5.2 Special Situations as Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 
An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is 
listed as expected. The exception or ac ceptable reporting procedures will be 
specified in the protocol. The protocol  specific guideline s supersede the NCI 
Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines. These sp ecial situations are listed under the 
CTEP-AERS reporting table for this protocol. 
 
11.6 Reporting Requirements - Investigator Responsibility 
Clinical investigators in the treating institu tions and ultimately the Study Chair have the 
primary responsibility for AE identification,  documentation, grading, and assignment of 
attribution to the investigational agent/interven tion. It is the responsibility of the treating 
physician to supply the medical documentation needed to suppor t the expedited AE reports 
in a timely manner.  
 
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP-A ERS) must also be reported via routine 
reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report 
Form (CRF) within the study database.   
 
11.7 General Instructions for Expedited Reporting via CTEP-AERS  
The descriptions and grading scales found in  the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All 
appropriate treatment areas should have acces s to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be do wnloaded from the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopmen t/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  
 An expedited AE report for all studies utiliz ing agents under an NCI IND/IDE must be 
submitted electronically to NCI vi a CTEP-AERS at: https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers 
 
In the rare situation where Internet connectivity  is disrupted, the 24-h our notification is to 
be made to the NCI for agents supplied under a CTEP IND by telephone call to 301-897-
7497.  
 In addition, once Internet connectivity is restored, a 24-hour notification that was phoned in must be entered into the electronic CTEP-A ERS system by the original submitter of the 
report at the site.   
 
x Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as: 
o 24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days -  The AE must initially be reported via CTEP-
AERS within 24 hours of learning of the event, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar da ys of the initial 24-hour report. 
o 7 Calendar Days -  A complete expedited report on the AE must be 
submitted within 7 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.  
 
x Any event that results in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functi ons, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
or is an IME, which based upon the me dical judgment of the investigator may 
jeopardize the patient and require interven tion to prevent a serious AE, must be 
reported via CTEP-AERS if the event occurs following investigational agent 
administration.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 55 
 
 
 
x Any death occurring within 30 days of the l ast dose, regardless of attribution to an 
agent/intervention under an NCI IND/ IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours .  
x Any death occurring greater than 30 days of the last dose with an attribution of 
possible, probable, or definite to an  agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE 
requires expedited reporting within 24 hours .  
 
CTEP-AERS Medical Reporting includes the followi ng requirements as part of the report: 
1) whether the patient has received at least on e dose of an investigational agent on this 
study; 2) the characteristics of  the adverse event including the grade  (severity), the 
relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of 
the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization w as associated with  the event.  
 Any medical documentation supporting an expedited report (eg, H & P, admission 
and/or notes, consultations, ECG results, etc.) MUST be faxed within 48-72 hours to 
the NCI. NOTE: English is strongly reco mmended for supporting documentation 
submitted to the numbers listed below in order for the NCI to meet the regulatory 
reporting timelines.   Fax supporting documentation for AEs related to investigational agents supplied under 
a CTEP IND to: 301-230-0159 (back-up: 301-897-7404).  
 Also: Fax or email supporting documentation to COG for all IND studies (Fax# 626-303-
1768; email: COGAERS@child rensoncologygroup.org; Attention: COG AERS 
Coordinator).  
 
x ALWAYS include the ticket number on all faxed documents.  
 
x Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specific patient ID 
provided during trial registration on all reports.

Pregnancy Females of Childbearing Potential: 
 
x Pregnancies and suspected pregnanc ies (including a positive pregnancy 
test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject or the partner of a male subject occurring while the subj ect is on lenalidomide or within 28 
days after the subject’s last dose, are considered immediately reportable events. Lenalidomide must be discont inued immediately. The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported via 
CTEP-AERS as a grade 4  event under: SOC pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions; adverse event: pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions-other, fetal exposure.  
o The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-
gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity 
for further evaluation and counseling. 
x The Investigator will follow the fe male subject until completion of the 
pregnancy, and must make an amendm ent to the initial pregnancy report 
immediately regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and neonatal status 
(either normal or abnormal outcome). 
x If the outcome of the pregnancy wa s abnormal (including spontaneous or 
therapeutic abortion, fetal demise and congenital abnormalities), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an amendment to the initial pregnancy report as soon as the as the Investigator has knowledge of the outcome.  
x All neonatal deaths and neonatal comp lications that occur within 28 days 
of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as an amendment 
to the initial pregnancy report. In add ition, any infant death after 28 days 
that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero  exposure to the 
lenalidomide should also be reported as  an amendment within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
 
Male Subjects 
x If a female partner of a male s ubject taking investigational product 
becomes pregnant, the male subject ta king lenalidomide should notify the 
Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call her 
healthcare provider immediately. 
 
11.10  Routine Reporting of Adverse Events 
Note: The guidelines below are for routine repor ting of study specific adverse events on 
the COG case report forms and do not affect  the requirements for CTEP-AERS reporting. 
 
Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adve rse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) 
within the study database. For this study, routine reporting will include all CTEP-AERS 
reportable events and Grade 3 and higher Adverse Events. 
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 58 
 
 
12.0 STUDY REPORTING AND MONITORING  
The Case Report Forms and the submission schedule  are posted on the COG web site with each 
protocol under “ Data Collection/Specimens ”. A submission schedule is included. 
 
12.1 CDUS 
This study will be monitored by the Clini cal Data Update System (CDUS). Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due 
January 31, April 30, July 31 an d October 31. This is not a responsibility of institutions 
participating in this trial. 
 
12.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
To protect the interests of patients and the scien tific integrity for all clinical trial research 
by the Children’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses  of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by 
the study statistician, in conjunction with  the study chair’s report. The DSMC may 
recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses.  
 
Toxicity monitoring is also the responsib ility of the study committee and any unexpected 
frequency of serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC. The 
study statistician is responsible for the monitoring  of the interim results and is expected to 
request DSMC review of any protocol issues  s/he feels require special review. Any COG 
member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of the DSMC.   The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by the study committee prior to 
implementation (eg, termination,  dropping an arm based on toxici ty results or other trials 
reported, increasing target sample size, etc.).  The DSMC determines whether and to whom 
outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified 
in the protocol document. 
 
12.3 CRADA/CTA

14.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and su rgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental de sign or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per C OG administrative Policy 5.14  (except where explicitly 
prohibited within the protocol). 
 
14.1 Timing of MRIs 
To document the degree of residual tumor, st andard whole brain MRI with and without 
contrast (gadolinium) and spine MRI with a nd without contrast (gadolinium) must be 
performed at the following time points: 
x within 1 week preceding enrollment into the study 
x at the following timepoints during protocol therapy: 
o within 1 week prior to each odd-numbe red treatment cycle (ie, prior to 
cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) for the first 13 cycles,   
o within 1 week prior to every third trea tment cycle (ie, prior to 16, 19, 22, 
25) for cycles 14-26. 
x when patient is removed from protocol th erapy (upon completion of therapy or at 
progression)  
 
In addition, for patients who have undergone surgical tumo r debulking prior to protocol 
therapy, pre-operative and post-operative imagi ng must be obtained preferably within 48 
hours of surgery.  
 
14.2 MRI Guidelines for Brain/Spine Tumors 
Juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic path ways gliomas are generally measured on the 
sequence that best demonstrates tumor (usua lly FLAIR or T2), although this sometimes 
varies. For the purposes of this study, tumors  will be measured two-dimensionally using 
the sequence that best demonstrates tu mor as determined by the institutional 
neuroradiologist. No additional measurements  will be required from the institution.   
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 62 
 
 
For recommended brain/spine imaging, requi red and optional sequences and technical 
details, see the COG CNS Imaging Guidelines  posted on the COG member website at: 
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.or g/_files/reference/RefMaterial/COGCNSImag
ingGuidelines6_4_10.pdf. 
 
14.3 Tumor Response Assessment 
For the response assessments, MRI scans ob tained at the time-points during protocol 
therapy (see Section 14.1) will be compared to the baseline MRI scan.  Exception:  In cases 
of progressive disease, the reference scan sh ould be the MRI with the smallest product 
observed since the start of treatment). 
 
14.4 Retrospective Central Review 
A retrospective central review of imaging wi ll be performed for all patients enrolled on 
ACNS1022 for determination of best response. Results of the retrospective review will not be returned to the site. Submit the followin g studies with their co rresponding reports for 
central review at the completion of treatment or when the patient is removed from protocol 
therapy:  
 
- Initial (pre-operative) scan 
- Post operative scan (if applicable) 
- Recurrence scan (baseline scan) 
- Removal from protocol therapy 
- Best response (if different from end of treatment scan) (Subsequent evaluations do 
not need to be submitted if no change from earliest best response) 
 For each study sent to IROC RI (QARC), all im aging sequences obtain ed (e.g. Precontrast 
T1, FLAIR, T2, diffusion, post contrast T1, etc.) must be submitted. 
 
14.4.1 Address Information 
Submission of Diagnostic Imaging data in di gital format is required. Digital files 
must be in DICOM format. These files ca n be submitted via sFTP. Information for 
obtaining a sFTP account and submissi on instructions can be found at 
www.QARC.org. Follow the link labeled digital data. Alternatively, if sFTP is not 
feasible, the imaging may be burned to a CD and mailed to IROC RI (QARC) at 
the address below. Multiple studies for th e same patient may be submitted on one 
CD; however, please submit only one pati ent per CD. Sites using Dicommunicator 
may submit imaging via that application. Contact IROC RI (QARC) with questions 
or for additional information. 
Copies of scans of the required studies for central review should be forwarded to: 
 
IROC RI (QARC) 640 George Washington Highway 
Buildig B, Suite 201 
Lincoln, RI 02865-4207 
Phone: (401) 753-7600 Fax: (401) 753-7601 
 
 
Imaging will then be uploaded by IROC RI (QARC) for review by the National 
Cancer Institute (Drs Warren and Patron as). Measurements on T2, FLAIR and T1 
post gadolinium will be ta ken to determine correlat ion between sequences and 
patient outcome.

APPENDIX II: LENALIDOMIDE RISKS OF FETAL EXPOSURE, PREGNANCY TESTING GUIDELINES AND ACCEPTABLE BIRTH CONTROL METHODS 
 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  Lenalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of 
organogenesis. Thalidomide is a known human teratoge n that causes severe life-threatening human birth 
defects.  If Lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it may cause birth de fects or death to an unborn baby. 
 
 
Definition of female children of childbearing potential (FCCBP)  
 
A FCCBP is a female child who:  
 
• Has achieved menarche and/or breast development in Tanner stage 2 or greater  
x Onset of fertility typically occurs within 3- 12 months after menarche. Menarche varies 
considerably from person to pe rson, and thus no age cut off can be attributed. One of the 
primary tools used to follow a girl’s progress through puberty is the Tanner staging 
system which describes the pattern of devel opment of the secondary sex characteristics. 
Tanner stage 2 corresponds to the beginning of  breast development, which is the first 
visible sign of puberty in girls. Breast development is estrogen stimulated, and since 
ovulation cannot occur without estrogen, Tanner stage 2 will be a reliable marker for the 
definition of fertility.   
• Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy.   
Note: Amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential    
 
Definition of Female Children NOT of Childbearing Potential (FCNCBP)   
 
A FCNCBP is a female child who:  
• has not yet experienced menarche or breast develo pment has not reached Tanner stage 2 or  
• has undergone a hysterectomy or  bilateral oophorectomy.  
 
Counseling  
 
Female Children of Childbearing Potential (FCCBP) 
 For a, FCCBP lenalidomide is contraindicated unless a ll of the following are met (i.e., all female children 
of childbearing potential must be counseled concerni ng the following risks and requirements prior to the 
start of lenalidomide):   
• She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child  
• She understands the need to co mmence the study treatment as soon as lenalidomide is dispensed 
following a negative pregnancy test  
• She understands and accepts the need to unde rgo pregnancy testing based on the frequency 
outlined in this protocol and in the Informed Consent.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 66 
 
 
For FCCBP who do not commit to complete abstinence or  plan not to commit to complete abstinence, the 
following are required prior to the start of lenalidomide:  
x She understands the need for effective contracepti on, without interruption, 28 days (4 weeks) 
before starting lenalidomide, throughout the en tire duration of lena lidomide, during dose 
interruptions and at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide 
x She understands and agrees to inform the Invest igator if a change or stop of method of 
contraception is needed 
x She must be capable of complying with  effective contraceptive measures   
x She is informed and understands the potential cons equences of pregnancy and the need to notify 
her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy  
x She acknowledges that she understa nds the hazards lenalidomide can  cause to an unborn fetus and 
the necessary precautions associated  with the use of lenalidomide. 
 
The investigator must ensure that:  
• A FCCBP complies with the conditions of the PPP, including confirmation that she has an 
adequate level of understanding  
• A FCCBP and/or her parent/guardian acknow ledge the aforementioned requirements  
Female Children Not of Childbearing Potential 
 For a FCNCBP, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (i.e., all FCNCBP must 
be counseled concerning the following risks and requi rements prior to the start of lenalidomide):  
  
• She and/or her parent/guardian acknowledge an  understanding of the hazards lenalidomide can 
cause to an unborn fetus and necessary precautions  associated with the use of lenalidomide  
• She and/or her parent/guardian will inform site staff as soon as possible regarding new onset of 
menarche  
Male Children 
The effect of lenalidomide on sperm development is not known and has not been studied. The risk to an 
unborn baby in females of child bearing potential whos e male partner is receiv ing lenalidomide is unknown 
at this time. Male subjects taking lenalidomide (and/ or his parent/guardian) must meet the following 
conditions (ie, all males must be counseled concerni ng the following risks and requirements prior to the 
start of lenalidomide): 
x Understand the potential teratogenic risk if enga ged in sexual activity with a pregnant female 
or a female of childbearing potential 
x Understand the need for the use of a condom ev en if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged in 
sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential. 
x Understand the potential teratogenic risk if the subject donates semen or sperm.

Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 67 
 
 
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCB P) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable forms of 
contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abs tinence (true abstinence is acceptable when this is 
in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal or post-ovulation methods] and withdraw al are not acceptable methods of contraception.) 
from heterosexual contact during the following time periods re lated to this study:   1) for at least 28  days 
(4 weeks) before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) for at 
least 28 days after study treatment discontinuation.    
The two methods of reliable contraception must in clude one highly effectiv e method and one additional 
effective (barrier) method. If the below contraception methods are not appropriate for the FCCBP, she must 
be referred to a qualified provide r of contraception methods to de termine the medically effective 
contraception method appropriate to the subject. The following are examples of highly effective and 
additional effective methods of contraception:    
x Highly effective methods:  
x Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants)  
 Tubal ligation  
 Partner’s vasectomy  
x Additional effective methods:  
 Male condom  
 Diaphragm  
 Cervical Cap  
 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of infection 
at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleed ing. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered 
particularly in patients with neutropenia.    
Male children must practice complete abstinence (true abstinence  is acceptable when this is in line with the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or 
post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not accepta ble methods of contraception.) or agree to use a 
condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while taking 
lenalidomide, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide, even if 
he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

Pregnancy testing  
 
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimu m sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL must be performed for 
FCCBP.  Before starting study drug   Female Patients: 
 
FCCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sens itivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to starting 
lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be pe rformed within 10-14 days prior to the start of 
lenalidomide and the second pregnanc y test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of 
lenalidomide.  The patient may not receive study drug unt il the Investigator has veri fied that the results of 
these pregnancy tests are negative.  
 
Female children of childbearing potential with regular  or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy 
tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participa tion and then every 28 days while taking lenalidomide, 
at study discontinuation, and at Day 28 following the last dose of lenalidomide. 
Female children of childbearing potential with irregu lar menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy 
tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participa tion and then every 14 days while taking lenalidomide, 
at study discontinuation, and at Days 14 and 28 following the last dose of lenalidomide. 
 
Male Patients: Must practice complete abstinence or  agree to use a condom during sexual  contact with a pregnant female 
or a female of childbearing potential while participati ng in the study, during dose interruptions and for at 
least 28 days following study drug discontinuation, ev en if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
 During study participation and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation   Female Patients: 
 
x FCCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must ag ree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 
28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and 
at day 28 following study drug discontinuation.  
 
x Female children of childbearing potential with  irregular menstrual cycles , must agree to have 
pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days a nd then every 14 days while on study, at study 
discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 fo llowing study drug discontinuation.  
 
x At each visit the Investigator must confirm with  the FCCBP that she is continuing to use two 
reliable methods of birth control   
x Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the poten tial risks of fetal exposure must be conducted 
at a minimum of every 28 days (once per cycle).   
 
x If a FCCBP considers the need to change or to stop a method of contraception, the Investigator 
must be notified immediately. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ACNS1022 
Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 69 
 
 
 
x If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does  occur in a study patient, lenalidomide must be 
immediately discontinued.  
 
x Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient  misses her period or if her 
pregnancy test or her me nstrual bleeding is abnor mal.  Study drug treatment  must be discontinued 
during this evaluation.  
 
x Female children must agree to abstain from breastfeed ing during study participation and for at least 
28 days after study drug discontinuation.  
 Male Patients:  
• Must practice complete abstinence (Tru e abstinence is acceptabl e when this is in line with the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstin ence [eg calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or 
post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not accepta ble methods of contraception.) or use a condom 
during sexual contact with a preg nant female or a female of childbearing potential while receiving 
lenalidomide, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide, even 
if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
x Must not donate semen or sperm while receiving lenalidomide, during dose interruptions and for 
at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide. 
 
x Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the poten tial risks of fetal exposure must be conducted 
at a minimum of every 28 days (once per cycle).   
 
x If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occu r in the partner of a male study patient during 
study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately.  
 
Additional precautions  
 
Patients should be instructed never to  give lenalidomide to another person and to return any unused capsules 
to the Investigator at the end of treatment.   
Patients should not donate blood duri ng therapy and for at least 28 da ys following discontinuation of 
lenalidomide.   Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy ma y be dispensed with each cycle of lenalidomide.

1. I have verified and counseled the male subject a nd/or his parent/guardian regarding the following: 
 Potential risks of fetal exposure to lenalidom ide: A teratogenic potential of lenalidomide in 
humans cannot be ruled out. If lenalidomide is  taken during pregnancy, it may cause birth 
defects or death to any unborn baby. 
 The subject confirmed that he has practiced comp lete abstinence (True ab stinence is acceptable 
when this is in line with the preferred and usua l lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence 
[eg calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or pos t-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.) or used  a condom when engagi ng in sexual contact 
(including those who have had a vasectomy) with a pregnant female or a female of 
childbearing potential, while taking lenalidomide,  during dose interruptions and for at least 
28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide.  
 The subject confirmed that he has not impre gnated his female partner while in the study. 
 The subject confirmed that he will notify hi s study doctor if his female partner becomes 
pregnant and the female partner of a male subj ect taking lenalidomide confirmed that she will 
call her healthcare provider immediately if she becomes pregnant.

APPENDIX V:   LENALIDOMIDE INFORMATION SHEET  
 
FOR PATIENTS ENROLLED IN CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES 
 Please read this Lenalidomide Information Sheet be fore you start taking lenalidomide and each time you 
get a new supply, since there may be new information.  This Lenalidomide Information Sheet does not take 
the place of an informed consent to  participate in clinical research or talking to your study doctor or 
healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.    
 
What is the most important informatio n I should know about lenalidomide?  
 Lenalidomide may cause birth defects (deforme d babies) or death of an unborn baby. Lenalidomide 
is similar to the medicine thalidom ide. It is known that thalidomide causes life-threatening birth defects. 
Lenalidomide has not been tested in pregnant women but may also cause birth defects. Lenalidomide was 
found to cause birth defects when tested in pregnant rabbits.  If you are a female who is able to become pregnant:   
x Do not take lenalidomide if you are preg nant or plan to become pregnant  
x You must either not have any sexual relations with a man or use two reliable, 
separate forms of effective birth control at the same time: 
o for 28 days before starting lenalidomide  
o while taking lenalidomide   
o during dose interruptions of lenalidomide   
o for 28 days after stopping lenalidomide   
x You must have pregnancy testing done at the following times:  
o within 10 – 14 days and again 24 hours pr ior to the first dose of lenalidomide   
o weekly for the first 28 days  
o every 28 days after the first month or  every 14 days if you have irregular 
menstrual periods  
o if you miss your period or ha ve unusual menstrual bleeding  
o 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomid e (14 and 28 days after the last dose if 
menstrual periods are irregular)  
x Stop taking lenalidomide if you become pregnant during lenalidomide treatment  
o If you suspect you are pregnant at any time during the study, you must stop 
lenalidomide immediately and immediately inform your study doctor. The 
study doctor will report all cases of pregnancy to the NCI. 
x Do not breastfeed while taking lenalidomid e and for at least 28 days after thee last 
dose of lenalidomide  
o The study doctor will be able to advise you where to get additional advice on 
contraception

Version Date: 6/1/2018  Page 78 
 
 
If you are a female child not able to become pregnant:   
In order to ensure that an unborn baby is not exposed to lenalidomide, your study doctor will confirm that 
you are not able to become pregnant. Any awareness of me nstrual periods must be reported to site staff.  
 If you are a male:   The effect of lenalidomide on sperm development is not known and has not been studies. The rsik to an 
unborn baby in females whose male partneris r eceiving lenalidomide is unknown at this time. 
 
 
1. Male children, (including those who have had a vasectomy), must either not have any sexual 
relations with a pregnant female or a female who can become pregnant, or must use a condom 
during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female who that can become pregnant: 
o While you are taking lenalidomide   
o During dose interruptions of lenalidomide   
o For 28 days after you stop taking lenalidomide    
2. Male children should not donate sperm or semen  while taking lenalidomide and for 28 days 
after stopping lenalidomide.  
3. If you suspect that your partner is pregnant any time during the study, you must immediately 
inform your study doctor. The study doctor will re port all cases of pregnancy to the National 
Cancer Institute. Your partner should call her healthcare provider immediately if she gets 
pregnant. 
All subjects: 
 
x Do not share lenalidomide with other people. It must be kept out of the reach of 
children and should never be given to any other person.  
x Do not give blood  while you take lenalidomide and for 28 days after stopping 
lenalidomide.   
x Do not break, chew, or open lenalidomide capsules.  
x You will get no more than a 28-day supp ly of lenalidomide at one time.  
x Return unused lenalidomide capsules to your study doctor.  
Additional information is provided in the informed consent form and you can ask your study doctor for 
more information.

APPENDIX VIII:  YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY – ACNS1022 
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
 
A Study of An Experimental Drug in Children and Teens with Brain Tumors 
That are Hard to Treat or Have Come Back after Treatment 
 
1. We have been talking with you ab out your brain tumor. Your brain tumor has either come back or 
not gone away with the treatments you already received. 
 
2. We are asking you to take  part in a research study because ot her treatments did not get rid of your 
tumor. A research study is when doctors work toge ther to try out new ways to help people who are 
sick. In this study, we are trying to find out if an experimental anti-cancer medicine can make your 
tumor get smaller or go away.  
 
3. Children who are part of this study will be tr eated with the anti-cancer medicine called 
lenalidomide. This medicine has been used to treat children with different kinds of cancers, 
including brain cancer. In this study, we want to treat more children with brain cancers so we can 
get more information about how we ll lenalidomide works.  This study will look at two doses of the 
anti-cancer medicine. Half of the children in this  study will get a lower dose of the anti-cancer 
medicine and half will get a highe r dose. Which dose you get will get is decided on by chance. This 
is like flipping a coin and saying, “Heads means I get the lower dose treatment, but tails means I 
get the higher-dose treatment.” A computer decide s which treatment you will get, not you or your 
doctor. 
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when th ey are in a research study.  These good things 
are called “benefits.”  We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that the new anti-
cancer medicine will make your tumor get smaller or  go away for as long as possible.  But, we do 
not know for sure if there is any be nefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when th ey are in a research study.  These bad things 
are called “risks.”  One risk to you from this study is  that the study treatment may not work as well 
as other treatments to make your tumor get smaller or go away for as long as possible. Other things 
may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or  not.  Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start.  There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about.  Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have. 
 
7. We are asking your “okay” to collect extra blood.  We  want to see if there are ways to tell how the 
tumor will react to treatment. We would like to co llect about ½ teaspoon of blood at up to 3 times 
during your treatment. We will try to collect the ex tra blood at the same ti me other standard blood 
tests are being done. If we can’t do this, you mi ght have up to two extra needle sticks.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY – ACNS1022 
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age) 
 
A Study of An Experimental Drug in Children and Teens with Brain Tumors 
That are Difficult to Treat or Have Come Back after Treatment 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your low grad e glioma. Low grade glioma s are types of cancer 
that grow in the brain . Your tumor has either come back or no t gone away with previous treatments.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research stud y because other treatments did not get rid of your 
low grade glioma. A research study is when doctors  work together to try out new ways to help 
people who are sick.  In this study, doctors want to  try an experimental anti-cancer drug to see if 
this drug will work well to make your tumor get smaller or go away. 
 
3. All children and teens who are part of this study will be treated with the anti-cancer drug called 
lenalidomide. This drug has been used to treat children and teens with di fferent types of cancer, 
including some children and teens with brain cancer. In this study, doctors would like to treat a 
larger group of children and teens with brain can cers so they can get more  information about how 
well lenalidomide works.  This st udy will look at two doses of the anti-cancer drug. Half of the 
children in this study will get a lower dose of the anti-cancer drug and half will get a higher dose. 
Which dose you get will get is decided on by chance. Th is is like flipping a coin and saying, “Heads 
means I get the lower dose treatment, but tails me ans I get the higher-dose treatment.” A computer 
decides which treatment you will get, not you or your doctor. 
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when th ey are in a research study.  These good things 
are called “benefits.”  We hope that a benefit to  you of being part of this study is that the 
lenalidomide will make your tumor get smaller or  go away for as long as possible, but we don’t 
know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when th ey are in a research study.  These bad things 
are called “risks.”  One risk to you from this st udy is that the treatment you get may not work as 
well as other treatments to get rid of the tumor for as long as possible.  Another risk is that you may 
have more side effects from the drug if you get th e higher dose. If you get the lower dose, there is 
a risk is that you may get a treatment that does not work as well as the higher dose. Other things 
may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or  not.  Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start.  There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your  doctors any questions that you have.  
 
7. We are asking your permission to collect additional bl ood.  We want to see if there are ways to tell 
how the cancer will respond to treatment. We woul d like to collect about ½ teaspoon of blood at 
up to 3 times during your treatment. We will try to  collect the extra blood at the same time other 
standard blood tests are being performed. If we ca n’t do this, you might have up to two extra needle 
sticks.

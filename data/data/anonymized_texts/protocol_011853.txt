11. OBJECTIVES: 
The study hypotheses are that adjuvant post-hysterectomy proton teletherapy for women with 
uterine and cervical cancers and histologically  confirmed metastases to regional lymph nodes 
will be efficacious (cancer control within th e irradiated volume) and reduced in both acute and 
delayed toxicity when compared to treatment with conventional photon teletherapy techniques.  The study will quantitate the magnitude of normal tissue spared with scanning proton beam 
therapy compared to 3-dimensional conformal and intensity modulated photon radiation techniques, and correlate acute and late toxicity outcomes to the reduced volumes of normal tissues irradiated.
1.1 Study Design:
Patients who undergo hysterectomy for invasive  cancer of the uterus or cervix who have 
histologically confirmed metastases to one or more  regional lymph nodes (parametrial, pelvic, or 
para-aortic nodal groups) convent ionally undergo radiation treatment as all, or a component of 
their adjuvant post-surgical therapy. 
Such patients will be identified at the weekly Gynecologic Oncology-Pathology 
Multidisciplinary Tumor Board that routinely reviews all gynecologic cancer pathology in patients operated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). 
Potentially eligible patients operated elsewhere and referred for adjuvant treatment to MGH 
would be identified based on pathology review  of submitted histologic sections from the 
referring institution. 
After obtaining informed consent, eligible patien ts will receive conventional doses of adjuvant 
teletherapy conventionally scheduled (fractiona ted) delivered to conventional target volumes 
using scanning proton beam instead of photon beam.
Using data from the same treatment planning CT scans used to plan proton therapy, conventional 
photon plans will be generated using three di mensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT)  
and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMR T) for comparison purposes to quantitate the 
extent of normal tissue sparing through the use of dose volume histograms. 
Monitoring during and after such treatment will  be essentially equivalent to standard clinical 
practice at MGH with the exception that the sche dule of post-treatment assessments will more 
tightly conform to the study calendar.
Assuming successful accrual and treatment of sufficient numbers of patients, a retrospective 
outcomes study will compare cancer control within  the irradiated volume, acute side effects of 
teletherapy, and delayed complications of rad iation treatment to a historical control population 
treated with photon teletherapy at MGH.

21.2 Primary Objective
1.2.1 In a population of women with cancers of the cervix or endometrium with pathologically 
proven spread to regional lymph nodes, to quantitate the magnitude of the normal tissue radiation 
dose reductions achieved by comparison of dose volume histograms achieved by scanning proton
beam teletherapy with dose volume histograms of treatment plans for the same patients using 3-
dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
1.2.2 To prospectively assess acute radiation side effects and delayed complications in proton 
treated patients and to compare toxicity outcomes (acute side effects and delayed complications) 
with patients historically treated with photon telet herapy using institutional historical controls 
(retrospective outcomes comparison study).
1.3 Secondary Objectives
1.3.1 To prospectively collect data on quality of life (QOL) before and after adjuvant scanning 
proton beam therapy employing contemporary, validated instruments tailored for women treated 
for gynecologic cancer.
1.3.2 To determine the progression-free survival and patterns of recurrence with this treatment.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Study Agent(s)
2.1.1 Proton beam radiation therapy has been employed in the clinical treatment of cancer at 
MGH since 1961. Initially patients were treated at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory in Cambridge, but since 2001 treatment has been administered on the MGH campus in the Francis 
H. Burr Proton Treatment Center. To date, over 10,000 patients have been treated using proton 
beam in MGH programs. Proton beam has equivalent biologic effects in tissue to high energy photon beams from li near accelerators employed at MGH and elsewhere.  The principal clinical 
advantage of proton beam lies in the nature of it s energy (radiation dose) deposition in tissue. In 
contrast to photons (X-rays), protons penetrate to  a depth in tissue determined by their energy, 
then deposit dose over a very narrow range (Bragg peak) transmitting minimal radiation beyond 
that point.  Exploiting this difference in physical dose deposition characteristics allows design of clinical treatments with more conformal dose distributions delivering proportionately much lower dose to normal tissues lying adjacent to the targeted malignant tissues than conventional photon 
techniques. [1] In general, this will result in milder acute treatment side effects, and potentially 
fewer and milder long-term complications of radiation treatment.

32.2 Study Disease:
2.2.1 Patients with primary cancers of the uterus conventionally undergo surgery as their initial 
intervention. Generally this will consist of open or laparoscopic total hysterectomy and bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy with variable sampling or full dissection of pelvic and/or para-aortic 
lymph nodes. Patients in whom cancer has spread to lymph nodes (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IIIC) routinely undergo radiation treatment to the 
pelvis or extended volumes (pelvis and para-aortic nodal basins) postoperatively, either as their 
only adjuvant treatment, or more commonly following 4-6 cycles of adjuvant systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxol.  Such treatment is endorsed by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidel ines.[2] Teletherapy (external radiation) is 
commonly supplemented by limited additional vaginal brachytherapy (internal vaginal 
radiation). This approach has been standard management at MGH for more than 7 years and is 
also endorsed by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.[2] Based on retrospective outcomes comparisons from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, cancer control and overall survival statistics are substantially better  in patients getting teletherapy/brachytherapy as 
all or a component of their treatment compared to patients getting systemic adjuvant 
chemotherapy/brachytherapy without teletherapy.[3] Additional data from Duke University and the University of North Carolina support this approach as well.[4]
2.2.2 Patients with primary cancer of the cervix limited to the cervix and upper vagina (FIGO 
stages IB and IIA) based on examination under anesthesia (EUA) supplemented by diagnostic 
imaging (MRI, PET/CT) will conventionally unde rgo modified radical or radical hysterectomy 
with therapeutic pelvic lymphadenectomy +/- s ampling para-aortic lymphadenectomy as their 
initial therapeutic intervention. Patients with hi stologically confirmed metastasis to lymph nodes 
undergo adjuvant teletherapy to the pelvis or extended volumes (pelvis and para-aortic nodal 
basins) administered in conjunction with concurrent cisplatin-based adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy and limited intra-vaginal brachythe rapy. This has been standard therapy at MGH 
for more than 7 years and is consistent with NCCN guidelines.[2]
2.3 Rationale
While combined modality therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for patients with FIGO 
Stage IIIC uterine cancer and American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) pT
1,2,N1,M0cancer 
of the cervix is associated with prolonged cancer-free sur vival (“cure”) in many patients [3,4,5]
acute side effects and late complications of treatment can be severe with substantial impact on 
quality of life (QOL) for many subsequent years. Despite chronic toxicities of treatment being recognized by both patients and the physicians involved in their longitudinal care, minimal prospective data are available documenting the impact  of such treatment on quality of life, and no

4quantitative data employing contemporary assessment instruments tailored for women with 
gynecologic malignancies.
Acute toxicities associated with radiation treatment include cramps, erratic bowel movements, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, urinary frequency, burning, and fatigue.
Late complications, which occur months to years after radiation treatment, can include leg 
lymphedema, radiation insufficiency fractures in pelvic bones or lumbar spine, small or large bowel obstruction which can require surgery to re lieve, or chronic erratic  bowel function with 
varying degrees of intestinal malabsorption. In so me premenopausal patients with cervical cancer, 
ovaries will be conserved, often surgically translocated to the para-colic gutters. Teletherapy is 
often a contributing factor in the premature endocrine failure of such ovaries, resulting in 
premature menopause.
Both acute side effects and late complications of radiation treatment are mostly a function of the 
volume of adjacent organs at risk (OAR), the “innocent bystanders” that are unavoidably irradiated 
when conventional photon beam techniques are empl oyed to target potentially cancerous tissues.  
Volume of normal tissue exposed, total dose, and do se per treatment fraction all correlate with the 
severity of both acute symptomatic side effects as well as late effects in normal tissues. Each of 
these parameters could be expected to be reduced by using proton beam therapy [1] rather than 
conventional photon beam techniques, with resultan t better tolerance during treatment as well as 
reduced late complications. Virtually every pa tient undergoing pelvic or extended volume 
teletherapy will experience some degree of acute side effects. Only a minority will experience major symptomatic late complications. But for those patients, the effects can last a lifetime. 
      
The hypothesis of this study is that use of proton beam teletherapy in-lieu of conventional              
photon techniques will result in reduced radiation exposure to normal tissues and reduced side 
effects and complications of treatment. Use specifically of the “pencil -beam” scanning (PBS) 
proton capability at the FHBPTC makes the treatment of these protocol patients practically feasibleby reducing the complexity of treatment planning and delivery compared to scattered proton 
fields. Due to limitations on field size and deep range of scattered proton fields, treatment of 
large, deep-seated target volumes becomes co mplex, time consuming, and expensive. PBS 
reduces costs incurred in the construction of  field-specific hardware and provides more 
conformal dose distributions. [6,7]

transfusions, etc. as required to provide optimal medical symptom management and support of 
study participants. No experimental medications  or off-label medications will be employed.
Transfusion of red blood cells to maintain hemoglobin >10 g/dl will be employed at discretion of 
treating physician and medical team in the case of hemoglobin <10 g/dl at study entry and in the 
eventuality that hemoglobin declines during the course of protocol therapy.
5.5 Duration of Therapy
Duration of therapy will depend on evidence of disease progression and tolerance.  In the 
event of a treatment break for circulating blood counts (neutrophils, platelets) to recover, treatment will resume when counts have recovered per section 5.1.2.  The treatment break will be documented in the data set; any length of break to allow blood counts to recover is allowed.  In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until completed or until one of the following criteria applies:
xDisease progression outside of the radiation target volume,
xIntercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
xUnacceptable adverse event(s), including grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
or neutropenia; grade 3 hemoglobin, diarrhea, urinary frequency, or 
fatigue; or grade 2 weight loss.
xParticipant decides to withdraw from the study, or
xGeneral or specific changes in th e participant's condition render the 
participant unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating 
investigator .
5.6 Duration of Follow Up
Participants will be followed for 60 months after completion of protocol therapy or 
removal from study or until death, whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study 
for unacceptable adverse events will be followe d until resolution or stabilization of the adverse 
event. Participants who experience a recurrence of their disease will be followed for survival 
only after the recurrence.

156.1 Anticipated Toxicities  
Acute toxicities expected from conventional photon therapy administered alone, or with 
concurrent chemotherapy, to the pelvis or extended volume (pelvic and para-aortic nodal 
basins) are listed below. Because radiation will be administered to a smaller volume using proton beam, acute toxicities are expected to be delayed in onset and/or milder in severity.Recovery from acute side effects is expected over a 3-6 week period after the last treatment 
has been administered.
Acute (temporary) effects include:
Likely (more than 50% chance this will happen):
xFatigue
xCramps
xFrequent bowel movement 
xDiarrhea
xNausea
xUrinary frequency and urgency
xBurning with urination
xVaginal irritation with itching and discharge
xSkin reaction (radiation dermatitis)
xRectal irritation
Frequent (10-50% chance this will occur):
xNausea (mild) and vomiting (rare) that is treatable with medications.  
xReduction in circulating blood counts including red cells which are important for 
carrying oxygen, platelets which are important for normal blood coagulation, and white cells which are important in fighting infection. If severe, changes in circulating blood counts may require blood transfusion, hospitalization, and medication intended to bring blood counts to normal levels.
Occasional (Between 1-10% chance this will occur):
xDehydration and Electrolyte imbalances (changes  in body salts) may occur in patients 
experiencing nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  This may not cause symptoms but sometimes causes fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, irregular heart beat or 
seizures. This can be severe and possi bly life threatening, and may require 
hospitalization and intravenous treatment.
Delayed effects which may develop after completion of Proton beam radiation 
treatment include:
Frequent (10-50% chance this will occur):
xLeg lymphedema (swelling of legs due to a block in lymphatic flow)

16Occasional (Between 1-10% chance this will occur):
xBowel obstruction requiring surgery to repair. 
xBowel injury
xPremature menopause: probable if ovaries ha ve not been conserved surgically and 
removed to locations remote from the radiation target volumes.
xBone fractures in the pelvis or spine
xWeight loss is slow and progressive and ra rely exceeds 10% of pre-protocol treatment 
weight.
Rare (Less than a 1% chance this will occur):
xAppearance of radiation caused cancer in or next to the radiation site: very rare and 
usually observed 20 or more years after radiation treatment.
xReduced bladder capacity with urinary frequency and urgency
xPotential injury to any/all normal tissues unavoidably irradiated
xPossible injury to liver and/or kidneys
6.1.2 Toxicity Management
Standard supportive therapies currently employed for radiation side effects will be administered in 
conventional dose, including anti-diarrheal medication (Imodium, Lomotil) anti-emetic medication (Ativan, Zofran, Reglan, Compazine, etc.) as required. No experimental medications or off-label 
medications will be employed.  All supportive medications will be commercially available. 
Outpatient intravenous hydration will be institu ted for symptomatic dehydration or electrolyte 
imbalance induced by diarrhea (hypokalemia, hyponatremia).
6.2 Dose Modifications/Delays
6.2.1 Dose per proton teletherapy fraction will be 1.8 Gy (RBE) and will not be modified.
6.2.2 Treatment for uterine cancer patients will be suspended for thrombocytopenia with platelets 
<35,000 mcL or neutropenia with absolute neutro phil count <800/mcL or for abnormal bleeding or 
febrile neutropenia.
6.2.3 Treatment will resume at the same daily dose and fractionation schedule when circulating 
blood counts rise above these levels. Differenti al blood counts may be obtained twice weekly for 
uterine cancer patients, once weekly for cervix cancer patients commencing on or before fraction 8 
of teletherapy.

detected by physical examination, laboratory tes t or other means, will be collected, recorded, 
followed and reported as described in the following sections. 
Adverse events experienced by participants will  be collected and reported from initiation of 
study treatment, throughout the study, and within 60 months of the last dose of study medication. 
Participants who experience an ongoing adverse event or related to a study procedures and/or study medication beyond 60 months will continue to be contacted by a member of the study team until the event is resolved, stabilized, or deter mined to be irreversible by the participating 
investigator. 
Participants should be instructed to report any se rious post-study event(s) that might reasonably 
be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the IRB and any other applicable regulatory agency of any unanticipated death or adverse event occurring after a 
participant has discontinued or te rminated study participation that may reasonably be related to 
the study. 
11.2 Definitions 
11.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symp tom or medical condition or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure 
specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests. 
11.2.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition which:
xis fatal or life-threatening;
xrequires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization;
xresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
xconstitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
xjeopardizes the participant and requires med ical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.

11.2.3 Expectedness Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.' 
11.2.3.1 Expected adverse event
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of adjuvant radiation treatment. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is 
considered expected when it is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
Refer to Section 6.1 (Anticipated Toxicities) for a listing of expected adverse events 
associated with the study treatment. 
11.2.3.2 Unexpected adverse event
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected when it varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the informed consent document or 
when it is not included in the informed consent documentation as a potential risk.
11.2.4 Attribution 
Attribution is the relationship between an advers e event or serious adverse event and the study 
treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:
xDefinite –The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
xProbable –The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
xPossible –The AE may be related to the study treatment. 
xUnlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.

22Adverse event information will be obtained at each contact with the participant. All adverse 
events will be recorded on the appropriate study-specific case report forms (CRFs). 
11.4 Reporting Adverse Events 
Each adverse event will be assessed to determine if  it meets the criteria for serious adverse event. 
If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local policies, and federal guidelines and regulations as appropriate. 
It is the responsibility of the participating investigator to notify the Principal Investigator (or 
Protocol Chair), IRB, and others of all serious  adverse events as required in the protocol. 
The Principal Investigator (or Protocol Chair) will provide information with respect to adverse 
events and safe use of the study treatment (e.g., safety reports, Action Letters) to all participating 
investigators as soon as the information becomes available. 
11.4.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All events meeting the criteria for Serious Adve rse Event (see Section 11.2.2) that occur after the 
initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days of the last dose of treatment 
must be reported as serious adverse events. 
The participating investigator must report each se rious adverse event, regardless attribution, to 
the Principal Investigator (or Protocol Chair) within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator does  not become aware of the serious adverse event 
immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator is to 
report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first 
awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by telephone and facsimile to:
Andrea Russo, MD  Tel: 617-219-1200 FAX: 617-726-3603
Within the following 24-48 hours, the participating investigator must provide follow-up 
information on the serious adverse event. Foll ow-up information should describe whether the 
event has resolved or continues, if and how the event was treated, and whether the participant 
will continue or discontinue study participation. 
11.4.2 Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
Non-serious adverse events will be reported to the Principal Investigator (or Protocol Chair) on 
the toxicity Case Report Forms.

27The primary objective of this protocol is to determine whether the substitution of scanning 
pencil beam proton teletherapy for conven tional photon teletherapy will administer less 
radiation dose to the normal tissues of organs at risk compared to conventional techniques 
(IMRT or 3-D conformal teletherapy). Add itional endpoints are to determine whether 
scanning pencil beam proton teletherapy is associated with cancer control rates within the 
irradiated volumes comparable to those reported in existing literature and to determine the 
rates of acute radiation side effect s and delayed radiation complications. 
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints:
The primary endpoint is the comparison of dose volume histograms (DVH) from proton 
teletherapy and conventional photon teletherapy. Structure sets contoured for proton beam 
treatment will be used to plan alternative IMRT and 3DCRT plans by the same medical physics team and attending physician, and DVH will be generated for each plan. It is hypothesized that the 
area under the DVH curve will be at least 25% sm aller in the bowel, in favor of the proton plan, 
for virtually all patients. With a sample size of 22 patients, we will have 91% power to accept 
that the proton plan is superior for 95% of patients  if at least 20 of them have a proton plan with 
an area under the DVH curve at least 25% smaller in the bowel. The decision rule is associated with type 1 error of 15% if only 80% of patients truly have a superior proton plan for the bowel. This magnitude of radiation dose difference is expected to be clinically significant with respect to acute GI side effects, thus GI toxicities will be a major focus of the data analysis to explore the 
correlation between DVH and radiation effects.
14.2   Sample Size/Accrual Rate:
As of October 2016, 9 node positive uterine cancer patients and 5 node positive cervical 
cancer patients have been enrolled and treated with proton beam teletherapy. We project another 8 patients will be enro lled and treated by the end of  2018 for a total accrual of 22
patients. Based on the tumor distribution to date , we expect the final accrual will consist of 
approximately 14 uterine cancer patients a nd 8 cervical cancer patients. Patients who do not 
start protocol treatment will be replaced.
All patients will be followed for a minimum of 60 months following completion of protocol 
therapy.

28Secondary endpoints are QOL, progression-f ree survival and patterns of recurrence. QOL 
outcomes will be analyzed using mixed models for longitudinal data. Progression-free survival 
will be analyzed using standard methods for fa ilure time data, primarily the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate. Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from the start of protocol treatment to 
the time of objective disease progression at an y site or death in th e absence of documented 
progression, while p atients who have not progressed or died  will be censored at the time of last 
follow-up. Differences between patient subgroups may be explored by the log-rank test, using exact methods as the event numbers will be mode st. Patterns of recurrence will be reported 
descriptively.
14.5 Reporting and Exclusions;
All patients starting protocol therapy will be analyzed and reported for all study endpoints, whether or not treatment is completed.
14.5.1 Evaluation of toxicity.
All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment.
14.5.2    Evaluation of response. N/A. Patients with measurable disease are 
ineligible. 
14.5.3   Evaluation of cancer control. At or before each scheduled follow-up 
surveillance visit patients will be categori zed as clinically cancer-free, alive with 
cancer, dead from cancer, dead from comp lications of therapy, or dead from inter-
current illness, or cause of death unknown.
14.5.4 Pattern of cancer recurrence : In patients developi ng cancer recurrence, 
the pattern of recurrence will be recorded according to the criteria in 10.2 for local, regional and distant sites. As a patient may recur at multiple sites and at different 
times, the dates of recurrence will be reco rded for each site. Progression-free survival 
will be based on the date of the earliest date of documented recurrence.
15. PUBLICATION PLAN
15.1.1 The intent of the investigators is to publish results in peer-reviewed journals.
15.1.2  A preliminary publication will compar e DVH results from proton, IMRT, and 3DCRT 
plans after accrual has been completed.

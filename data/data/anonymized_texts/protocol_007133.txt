DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 4of 92 Dyax Corp.Study Design:
This study  is an open- label, long term safet y and efficacy  study  to evaluat e DX -2930 in 
preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Ty pe II HAE. There are two 
types of subjects who will be enrolled into this study :
1.Subjects who rollover from the DX-2930-03 study
2.Subjects who were not participants in DX-2930- 03.
Roll- over Subjects:
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  182 of 
the DX -2930- 03 study  and consent to enter DX -2930 -04.  Subjects who discontinue from 
DX-2930-03 after enrollment are not eligible t o enroll in DX -2930- 04.  Willing subjects must 
sign informed consent for DX -2930- 04 no later than the DX -2930
-03Day 182 treatment 
period study  visit .  
The first DX -2930- 04 visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) will occur on the same day  as the 
DX-2930-
03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will complete all DX -2930 -03 final study  
assessments at which time they  will be discharged from that study . No assessments 
conducted between the DX -
2930-03 Day  182 study  visit and the first DX- 2930 -04 visit 
(Day 0) wi ll be duplicated. Results of the final DX -2930-03 assessments will be used as the 
pre-dose results for Day  0 Dose 1 of DX
-2930- 04.
Subjects who are eligible to roll over into DX- 2930 -04 but elect not to may not enroll 
in 
DX-2930-04 
at a later time .
All subjects, caregivers, Investigators and site personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX
-2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of the DX -2930- 04 study .
Non-rollover subjects:
Up to 50 subjects who were not participants in the DX-2930- 03 study  will be permitted to 
enroll if they  meet the eligibility  requirements. Subjects who screen fail out of DX -2930-03 
for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run -in period must wait until 
enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for DX -2930- 04. The 
Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX -2930-
03.
Screening Period:
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screenin g assessments 
completed within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects 
who are on long- term prophy lactic (LTP) therapy  for HAE are required to undergo a 
minimum 2 week washout period prior to the start of the treatment period.  This L TP 
washout is permitted as long as the Investigator determines that doing so would not place the 
subject at an y undue safety risk and the subject is at least 18 years of age.  The Investigator 
must confirm the subject has successfully  completed the 2 week washout period and have no 
ongoing adverse events related to the washout before they can receive their first open- label 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 5of 92 Dyax Corp.dose.
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects: Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects 
will r eceive a single open -label dose of 300 mg DX- 2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC).    
Subjects will not receive any  additional DX -2930 doses until their first reported HAE attack.   
The duration of time between the first open -label dose and first reported HAE attack will 
vary by rollover subject.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study  Activities Schedule, 
for the entire duration of the study .  However, until a rollover subject reports their first HAE 
attack, onl y scheduled study visits where the f ollowing tests and assessments are performed 
must be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  testing, 
physical examination, 12-Lead ECG, QOL , PK, PD and anti -drug antibody sample 
collection.  All other scheduled study  visits may  be conducted via site check -in calls to 
collect information on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data .  Refer to 
the Appendix 1 Study  Activities Schedule.
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative 
site for their second open -label dose of DX -2930 as quickly  as subject and site schedules 
allow.  If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day  window around a
scheduled study  visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that 
scheduled visit has already  occurred
.  
For example, if the second dose is to be administered on Day  52, all of the tests and 
assessments scheduled for the Day  56 visit will be conducted.  This Day  52 visit to 
receive the second dose will count as the Day  56 visit. 
As another example, if the second dose is to be administered on Day  46, the subject can 
have this study  visit count as their Day  42visit if they  have not already  attended the Day  
42visit.If the y have alr eady  attended the Day  42 visit, then this Day 46 visit will be 
considered an acceptable, extra study  visit.
In the scenario that the second dose is to be administered outside of theaccepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit, this visit will not repla ce an y scheduled visit and will thus 
represent an acceptable, extra study  visit. 
For example, if the second dose is to be administered on Day  63, this visit will represent 
an acceptable, extra study  visit.   
Regardless of the stud y day, a t the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX -2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, phy sical 
examination, clinical laboratory  testing, PK, PD, and anti- drug antibod y. Vital signs will be 
obtained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be collected on 
adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data. 
Subsequent doses after dose 2 require a minimum of 1 0days and maximum of 1 8days 
between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 day  window around study  
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 6of 92 Dyax Corp.visits.
For example, if the second dose is to be administered on Day 37, the third dose should be 
administered between Day 52 and Day  55, which would ensure both a dosing interval 
within 10 to 18 day s from the second dose and a visit within the ±4 day  window around 
the Day  56 study  visit.  The fourth dose should then be administered between Day  66 and 
Day 73, which would ensure both a dosing interval within 10 to 18 day s from the third 
dose an d 
a visit within the ±4 day  window around the Day  70 study  visit.
Regardless of when a subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 1 0days 
between their first open -label dose and their second open-label dose. Following their second 
dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open- label 
300mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment period. The 
treatment period will last 26 weeks from the date of the first open -label dose. The nu mber of 
doses administered during this period will vary  by subject based on the date of each subject’s 
second dose, but will not exceed 13 doses. The Day 168 study  visit is the last visit at which a
dose may  be administered. 
Non-rollover Subjects: Once al l screening assessments have been completed, eligibility  
confirmed and LTP washout completed (if applicable), non -rollover subjects will arrive at 
the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open -label dose of 300 mg 
DX
-2930 administered SC.  Non -rollover subjects will continue to receive SC 
administrations of open -label 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks throughout the duration of the 
treatment period.  A total of 13 doses will be administered with the last dose administered at 
the Day  168 study visit .
Follow -up Period:
After completion of the 26 -week treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y 
evaluations during an 8-week follow -up period unless rolling over into an other ongoing 
DX-2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.
Modifications to Open -Label Dosing :
If,at an y time ,an important dose -related safety signal is identified either from this study  or 
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et 
completed the treatment period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -
label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency .
In addition, b ased on the results of the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may switch to a 
different dose and/or frequency . 
Study Population:
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from the DX -2930- 03 study , as well as up to 50 
additional subjects who were not enrolled in DX -2930- 03. The total enrollment is expected to 
be approximately  150 HAE Ty pe I or II subjects. Subjects will be 12 y ears of age or older 
who experience at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE diagnosis will be confirmed through 
documented clinical history  and diagnostic testing conducted either during screening or 
during prior participation in study  DX-2930- 02 or DX -2930-03.  The study  will aim to enroll 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 7of 92 Dyax Corp.at least 10 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, inc lusive of subjects 12 to 17 y ears old

9.Pregnancy  or breastfeeding.
10.Subject has an y condition that, in the opinion of the Investiga tor or Sponsor, may  
compromise their safety  or compliance, preclude successful conduct of the study , or 
interfere with interpretation of the results (e.g., history  of substance abuse or dependence, 
a significant pre -existing illness or other major comorbidity  that the Investigator 
considers may  confound the interpretation of study  results).
Test Product; Dose; and Mode of Administration:
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium 
phosphate dibasic dih ydrate , 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 
0.01% Poly sorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of 150 mg 
DX-2930 active ingredient in 1mL solution.
For each 300 mg dose of DX -2930, each subject will receive a total of 2 mL, which will be 
administered in a single 2 mL  SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, 
thigh or abdomen.
Duration of Treatment:
All subjects wi ll receive open -label DX -2930 during a 26 -week treatment period. The 
number of doses that rollover subjects receive during this period will vary  by subject but will 
not exceed 13doses. The last dose of open -label DX -2930 administered to these subjects 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 9of 92 Dyax Corp.may be given at the Day 168 study  visit . Non- rollover subjects will receive 300 mg DX -2930 
every  2 weeks for a total of 13 doses, with the first dose administered on Day  0 and the final 
dose administered at the Day 168 study  visit .
There will be a ± 4-day wind ow around each stud y visit. There will be a minimum of 1 0days 
between an y two doses. Excluding the interval between the first and second open -label doses 
for rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 days between any  two doses. Subjects 
will be mon itored at the study site through 1 hour post -dose.
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non-rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non-rollover 
subjects must occur within 4 weeks prior to the first open- label dose. Eligible subjects will be 
enrolled and undergo a 26-week treatment period. At the conclusion of the 26- week 
treatment period, subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks unless rolling over into 
another ongoing DX -2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (e.g., use of C1 -INH for long -term prophylaxis, 
attenuated androgens, or anti -fibrinoly tics).
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
•Estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or 
hormonal replacement ther apy).
•Androgens (e.g., stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methy ltestosterone, testosterone).
•Any other investigational drug or device.
The use of short -term prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  
indicated.  Short -term prophy laxis is defined as C1- INH, attenuated androgens, or anti -
fibrinoly tics used to avoid angioedema complications from medicall y indicated procedures.
Management of Acute Attacks:
Acute HAE attacks during the stud y are to be managed in accord with the Investigator’s 
usual care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapies that the Investigator 
deems as medically appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y 
but not as a long- term prophy lactic therap y.
Safety Assessments:
Safety  assessments will include the following:
•Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of 
special interest (AESI). SAEs and AESI will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the event.
•Vital signs, including sitting or supine blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body  
temperature, and respiratory  rate (RR)
•Physical examination
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 10of 92 Dyax Corp.•Clinical laboratory  testing (hematology , serum chemistry , coagulation and urinaly sis)
•12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Hypersensitivity  reactions and events of disordered coagulation will be considered AESI.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of plasma DX-2930 concentrations.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacod ynamic effects of DX -2930 
through biomarker assays.
Immunogenicity Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to as say for the presence of anti-drug antibodies, including 
evaluation of neutralizing antibodies (if an y confirmed positive anti- drug antibodies are 
detected).
C1-INH, C1q and C4 Assessments:
Samples will be obtained for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assay s at screeni ng for non -rollover 
subject eligibility  assessment.
Quality of Life Assessments:
Quality  of life (QOL) assessments will be conducted using the EQ5D , SF-36and the 
Angioedema Quality  of Life Questionnaire (AEQoL ).
Collection of HAE Attack Data:
The collec tion, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance 
with the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP) . Refer to Appendix 4 .  
Site personnel will be trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at t heir 
site.
Site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identify ing s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
patient (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for 
reporting attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average 
severit y, predom inant attack location(s), average duration, acute attack therapy  use and 
history  of long -term prophy laxis.
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack. This includes the first attack experienced 
by rollover subjects following their first open -label dose.  In the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by  a famil y 
member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by  the subject, 
memory  aids may  be provided to assist in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced. 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 11of 92 Dyax Corp.Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
Impact on activit y and whether an y assistance or medical intervention was required, 
including hospitalizations or emergency  department visits
Any medications used to treat the attack
If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer ex periencing sy mptoms
Site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately  every  7 day s following the fi rst 
dose of open- label DX -2930 to solicit for any  HAE attacks not already  reported.  Site check-
ins will continue until the subject has received their second open -label dose.
During each stud y visit, site personnel will solicit for an y new HAE attack infor mation that 
was not alread y provided to the site.
In this stud y, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, 
severit y, or causal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Any AE reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be 
reported to the Sponsor using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE 
attacks, the Principal Investigator or ph ysician designee will review the event within 24 hours 
of initial notification and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed 
HAE attack. For all non-serious AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the Principal 
Investigator or ph ysician designee will review the event within 3 day s of initial notification 
and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack. If 
necessary  for the evaluation, the I nvestigator or designee may  contact the subje ct to receive 
additional information. Any subject -reported attack not confirmed b y the Investigator or 
physician designee must have an alternate AE diagnosis recorded.  All subject- reported and 
Investigator / phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital 
admissions will be captured.
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an 
attack in at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 12of 92 Dyax Corp.•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea
•Lary ngeal angi oedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx
Despite the presence of these s ymptoms, the investigator or ph ysician designee may  still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that 
strongl y refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y 
symptoms that are not consistent with an HAE attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event 
persists well bey ond the ty pical time course of an HAE attack (e.g., greater than 7 day s), or 
there is a likel y alternate etiology for the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal sy mptoms are 
attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted a s a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s s ymptoms.
Study Stopping Rules:
Safety  data, including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration 
of the study . If any potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, 
or from an y safet y findings from the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may  take actions as 
deemed appropriate, including suspending further dosing, while the potential risk is 
evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
Individual Stopping Rules:
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non-serious AE) that, in 
the assessment of the Investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that 
subject’s well -being. The I nvestigator has the ability  to contact and consult with the Medical 
Monitor on such matters. Subjects will continue to be followed through the completion of all 
scheduled non- dosing visits , unless they  request to be discontinued from the study .
Criteria for Evaluation:
Safety Measures:
•AEs including SAEs and AESI
•Clinical L aboratory  testing (hematology, clinical che mistry , coagulation and urinaly sis)
•Vitals signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oral body  temperature and respiratory  
rate
•Physical Examination
•12-lead ECG
Efficacy Endpoints:
•Time to first HAE attack for rollover subjects (based upon time from first open label 
study  dose until first HAE attack)
•Mean rate of HAE attacks for all subjects ( 14 day s post- second dose to Day 182 for 
rollover subjects; Day 14to Day  182 for non -rollover subjects)
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 13of 92 Dyax Corp.•Mean rate of acute therapy  usage for all subjects ( 14 day s post -second dose to Day  182 
for rollover subjects; Day  14 to Day  182 for non- rollover subjects)
•Mean rate of moderate or severe attacks for all subjects ( 14 day s post -second dose to 
Day 182 for rollover subjects; Day  14 to Day  182 for non- rollover subjects )
•Mean rate of high -morbidity  attacks for all subjects ( 14 day s post -second dose to 
Day 182 for rollover subjects; Day  14 to Day  182 for non- rollover subjects ); a high -
morbidity  HAE attack is defined as any  attack that has at least one of the follo wing 
characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation 
<24 hours), hemod ynamically  significant (s ystolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV 
hydration, or associated with sy ncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal.
Addit ional Measures:
•Anti- drug antibody  development
•Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
•Pharmacod ynamic (PD) effects
•Quality  of Life Assessments
Analysis Populations:
Theanalysis population will be based on subjects who receive at least one dose of DX-2930 
after entering the study .
Sample Size Determination:
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open-
label treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in DX -2930- 03 and individuals 
who were not otherwise able to participate in DX -2930-03.
Statistical Methodology:  
The distribution of time from first open -label dose to first HAE attack will be determined for 
rollover subjects. The estimation will be based on a standard Cox proportional hazards model 
where several baseline covariates will be tested including baseline attack rate prior to 
entering DX -2930- 03, the treatment arm in DX -2930 -03, the time since the last dose given in 
DX-2930 -03, the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during DX -2930 -03. 
The distribution of time to first attack will be adjusted for an y significant baseline (p <0.05) 
covariates, and b y examining the distribution separatel y by the trea tment arm the patient was 
in during DX -2930- 03. In this survival analy sis, one observation (time to first attack) per 
subject will be generated.
For other efficacy  endpoints, mean event rates will be assessed for all subjects (14 day s post -
second dose to Day 182 for rollover subjects; Day  14 to Day  182 for non-rollover subjects).
In addition, for rollover subjects, the mean change from the documented values in 
DX-2930- 03 at baseline (last measurement prior to randomization into DX -2930- 03) and 
entry  (last measurement in DX -
2930- 03 prior to enrollment into DX -2930- 04) will be 
compared to the values assessed at DX -2930- 04 time points from 14 day s after the second 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 14of 92 Dyax Corp.dose in DX -2930-04 through Day  182 (i.e., 2 weeks after the final scheduled dose on 
Day 168). Changes will be calculated and presented as descriptive statistics for each 
DX-2930-03 
treatment group (300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks, 300 mg DX -2930 every  4 
weeks, 150 mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks). For each time period, graphs will be constructed 
for mean changes in efficacy  variables from baseline. Time periods will be defined as 
relative time from the DX -2930- 03 baseline for those who participated.
For non -rollover subjects, efficacy  variables wi ll be presented as descriptive statistics only .
For disposition, demographic and safety  anal yses, subjects will be represented in the 
reporting as follows:
Subjects who received 26 weeks of 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks in DX
-2930-03 
and up to 26 weeks of DX-2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received 26 weeks of 300 mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks in DX-
2930-03 
and up to 26 weeks of DX -2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received 26 weeks of 150 mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks in DX
-2930-
03 
and up to 26 w eeks of DX -2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received 26 weeks of placebo in DX
-2930- 03 and up to 26 weeks of 
DX
-2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received up to 26 weeks of DX -2930 treatment in DX -
2930-04.
Data from the start of DX
-2930 
treatment through the final treatment period study visit (up to 
52 weeks for subjects whose treatment with DX -2930 was initiated in DX -2930- 03) will be 
combined for safet y evaluation of the overall DX -
2930 exposure.
Safety Analysis:
All Subjects:
Safety  measures include AEs, concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs 
(blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory  rate, and body temperature), phy sical examination 
findings, and ECGs.
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with onse t at the time of or following 
the start of treatment with DX -2930, or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. The number and percentage of sub jects with TEAEs will be display ed by  body  
system and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA®). Summaries in terms of severit y and relationship to DX -2930 will also be 
provided. SAEs will be summarized separatel y in a similar fashion. Patient listings of AEs 
causing discontinuation of DX -2930 treatment, AEs resulting in death, SAEs and AESI will 
be produced.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 15of 92 Dyax Corp.AESI  will be anal yzed according to primary  System Organ Classes (SOCs) and Preferred 
Terms (PTs) determined by  the search ofrelevant Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs). 
Summary  tables with SOCs and PTs, from the SMQ searches, will be generated 
presenting the number and percentage of subjects by  AE, severit y, seriousness, and 
relationship to study  medication.
Usage of concomitant medications (other than rescue medications) will be summarized 
descriptivel y.
Actual values and change from Day  0 in vital signs and clinical laboratory tests will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics at each assessment obtained. For al l laboratory  tests, a 
shift table will be produced summarizing changes from normal to abnormal and vice -versa.
The number and percentage of subjects with normal, abnormal -not clinically significant, and 
abnormal -clinicall y significant ECG findings will be display ed. Other safety  parameters, 
such as subject withdrawals will be summarized.
Rollover Subjects: Adverse events that started during subject participation in DX -2930-03 
and were ongoing at the time of first open- label dose in DX -2930 -04 will not be counted as 
an AE in DX -2930- 04 unless that event has worsened in severit y or frequency following the 
first open- label dose.  Adverse events that started during subject participation in DX -2930-03 
and resolved following the first open -label dose in DX -2930-04 and then subsequently  
reappeared in DX -2930- 04 will be counted as a new TEAE in DX -2930- 04.
The incidence of AEs in DX-2930- 04 from each DX -2930-
03 treatment group (300 mg 
DX-2930 every  2 weeks vs. 300 mg DX- 2930 every  4 weeks vs. 150mg DX -2930 every  4 
weeks vs placebo) as well as evaluation of overall AEs in the combined group of all rollover 
subjects will be assessed.  Changes from baseline (last measurement prior to the firs t dose of 
DX-2930 received, regardless of if it occurred in DX -
2930- 03 or DX -2930-04
) to the 
DX-2930- 04 time points for phy sical examination results, vital sign parameters, and clinical 
laboratory  parameters will be summarized by  DX-2930- 03 treatment group and for the 
combined group of all rollover subjects.
Non-rollover Subjects: Adverse events will be captured from the time of informed consent 
through the final study  visit.  Adverse event tabular summaries will be based on all 
treatment -emergent AEs

1.Screening visit is for non -rollover subjects only.  Screening visit can occur up to 28 days prior to first open -label dose.
2.The Follow -up Period is not required for subjects who choose to roll over into an ongoing DX -2930 clinical study or access program that permits such a rollover.
3.Site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately every 7 days following the first dose of open -label DX -2930 to solicit for any HAE attack s not already reported.  Site 
check -in with rollover subjects will continue until the subject receives their second open label dose.
4.For rollover subjects, t he timing of Dose 2 for will vary by subject based on when their first HAE attack occurs following Dose 1.  Following the first reported attack , subjects 
will begin receiving regular SC administrations of 300 mg DX -2930 every 2 weeks .  A minimum of 1 0 days between the first and s econd open -label doses is required. If the 
second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window around a scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that scheduled 
visit has already occurred . If tha t scheduled visit has already occurred, or if the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled 
visit, this visit will not replace any scheduled visit and will thus represent an acceptable, extra study visit. Regardless, a t the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX -
2930 is administered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody. Vital signs 
will be ob tained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with all study visits, information will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data. 
5.The Day 210 Visit is a site check- in for all rollover and non -rollover subjects.
6.Rollover subjects will prov ide consent no later than the Day 182 DX-2930 -03 study visit.
7.Non-rollover subjects who are on long -term prophylactic (LTP) therapy for HAE are required to undergo a minimum 2 week washout period prior to the start of the tre atment 
period.
8.Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment unless already collected as part of protocol DX-2930 -02 or DX -2930 -03.  
9.The pregnancy test will only be conducted in females of childbearing potential.  Tests performed on Day 0 must be urine -based to confirm eligibility prior to first dose .  Tests 
performed at screening, Day 98, Day 182, and Day 238 can be serum or urine -based.
10.There is a ± 15 minute window for all vital signs. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing.
11.Height and weight will be collected at the Screening visit only. Physical examinations will be conducted for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study 
activities schedule.  In addition to the physical examinations specified in the study activities schedule, an additional physical examination will be conducted for these subjects 
prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 18of 92 Dyax Corp.12.Clinical laboratory testing will include He matology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis. Clinical laboratory testing will be conducted for all rollover and no n-
rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In addition to the testing specified in the study activities s ched ule, additional testing will be conducted for rollover 
subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.
13.Historical attack information will be collected at screening. During the study subjects (or car egivers) are instructed to report details of the attack to the study site within 72 hours 
of the onset of the attack. During study visits, site personnel will solicit for any new HAE attack information that was not given through prior subject contact with the site.
14.Quality of life data will be obtained using the EQ5D , SF-36and Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL).
15.PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody PD samples will be drawn for all rollover and non-rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In addition to the samples 
specified in the study activities schedule, an additional PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody sample will be drawn for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second 
open -label dose, at whatever study visit th at occurs.
16.Subjects who terminate from the study early will undergo (if possible) all of the assessments and procedures as Day 182 at th eir final study visit.

Confidential Page 27of 92 Dyax Corp.1INTRODUCTION
1.1 DX-2930
DX-2930 is a full y human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds specificall y to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for proph ylactic treatment of 
angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary  angioedema (HAE) , a serious and 
life-threatening disease.
1.2 Hereditary  Angioedema
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life- threatening disease caused by  mutations in the 
C1-inhibitor (C1- INH) gene, resulting in deficiency  or dy sfunction of C1 -INH protein. HAE 
manifests cl inically  as unpredictable, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal 
edema of the face, lary nx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw, 2008). 
Swelling may  last up to five or more days; most patients suffer multiple attacks per y ear. 
HAE is an orphan disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates 
range from 1 per 10,000 to 1 per 150,000 persons, with many  authors agreeing that 
1per50,000 is likely  the closest estimate (Bygum, 2009 ; Goring et al., 1998 ; Lei et al., 2011 ; 
Nordenfelt et al., 2014 ; Roche et al., 2005 ). 
Swelling in the lary nx can obstruct the airway s and cause death from asphyxiation (Bork et 
al., 2012 ; Bork et al., 2000 ). Approximately  50% of all HAE patients will experience a 
laryngeal attack in their lifetime, and there is no way  to predict which patients are at risk of a 
laryngeal attack (Bork et al., 2003 ; Bork et al., 2006 ). 
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, and severe pain; intestinal 
symptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may  lead to unnecessary  surgery  (Zuraw, 
2008)
. 
Approximately  85% of patients have Ty pe I HAE, characterized b y ver y low production of 
functionally  normal C1 -INH protein, while the remaining approximately  15% of pati ents 
have T ype II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionally  impaired C1 -INH 
(Zuraw, 2008 ). In patients with Ty pes I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein 
generation results in excess brad ykinin release from high -molecular weight kininogen 
(HMWK) and vascular leak mediated b y brad ykinin binding to the B2 receptor (B2 -R) on the 
surface of endothelial cells (Zuraw, 2008) . Clinical suspicion of Ty pes I and II HAE can be 
confirmed b y available blood tests. In addition to abnormalities in C1- INH level and 
function, plasma C4 levels are markedly  reduced at all times in blood from most patients.
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX-
2930
Plasma kallikrein play s a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks ( Davis, 2006; 
Kaplan and Joseph, 2010) . In normal ph ysiology , C1-INH regulates the activity  of plasma 
kallikrein as well as a variety  of other protea ses, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor 
XIIa. Plasma kallikrein regulates the release of brady kinin from HMWK. Due to a deficiency  
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 28of 92 Dyax Corp.of C1- INH in HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity  occurs and leads to the excessive 
generation of brad ykinin. B radykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for 
the characteristic HAE sy mptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain (Craig et al., 
2012; Zuraw et al., 2013) . Intervening at the level of brady kinin production with a plasma 
kallikrein inhibitor therefore represents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy  for 
HAE. Indeed, the im portance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated 
through the observed effectiveness of Kalbitor®(ecallantide), a peptide that specifically  
targets plasma kallikrein, which was approved b y the FDA for the treatment of acute HAE 
attacks ( Kalbitor®Package Insert, 2015). 
DX-2930 is a highly  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X -ray 
crystallograph y of DX- 2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX -2930 
binding to the active site of kallikrein (Kenniston et al., 2014 ).
1.4 Safet y Rationale for DX -2930
Safety  data from the Phase 1a clinical study , a first -in-human study  with DX -2930 in health y 
subjects did not identify  any safet y concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX
-2930 were 
well-tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse e vents, or any  other 
safet y concerns identified.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX-2930- 01) and Phase 1b (DX -2930- 02) 
clinical stud ies in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity  studies support a wide 
safet y margin. The mean C maxfor human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Day s 1 and 
15 was approximately  27g/mL. As comparison, a mean C maxof 744 g/mL was observed 
following dosing of monkey s with 50 mg/kg DX -2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekl y for 6 
months resulting in a safety
 margin of approximately  28-fold. No toxicologically  significant 
findings were observed in these treated animals or in any  other nonclinical toxicity  study  to 
date forsystemically  administered DX -
2930.
Safety  data is also available from the Phase 1b study  (DX -2930- 02), a multiple -ascending 
dose study  in HAE patients. I n this study , two doses of DX-
2930 up to 400 mg administered 
14 day s apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse 
events in an y DX -2930 treated subjects, or any  other safety  concerns identified in this study  
of HAE patients. Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study  found that the drug exposure 
following two administrations of DX
-2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially  
less than that attained and ev aluated in the nonclinical toxicity  studies.

Confidential Page 29of 92 Dyax Corp.1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data
The clinical development program to date for DX -2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of DX -2930, including one completed Phase 1a single -ascending 
dose study  in healthy  subjects and a Phase 1b multiple -ascending dose study  in HAE 
patients. These studies are summarized in the following sections.
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Su bjects (DX -2930 -01)
DX-2930- 01 was a Phase 1a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in health y 
subjects to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active stud y drug within one of 
the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing 
cohort, 6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo. 
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study  and were randomized. The treatment groups were 
well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX- 2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) 
across all cohorts.
Based on the safety  anal ysis, a single administration of DX -2930 was well tolerated up to 
doses of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose- limiting toxicity . There were no deaths, SAEs, 
or subject discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the st udy. Furthermore, there 
was no significant imbalance between placebo and DX- 2930 for any  particular treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly  reported TEAE was headache, which 
occurred at a rate of 25% for both DX -2930 and placebo.
The PK profile demonstrated linear, dose-
dependent drug exposure with a mean half- life of 
approximately  17 to 21 day s across dose groups. Results from two exploratory  biomarker 
assay s provide evidence for an important pharmacody namic effect of DX -2930 in humans. 
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study  in healthy  subjects, please refer 
to the DX- 2930 Investigator’s Brochure .
1.6.2 Multiple- Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX -2930 -02)
DX-2930-02 was a Phase 1b rand omized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multiple 
ascending -dose study  in patients with HAE to evaluate safet y, tolerability , and PK of SC 
DX-2930. Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study  drug or 
placebo within one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 
400 mg (nominal 6 subjects per cohort). Each subject received 2 doses of study  drug 
separated b y 14 days. 
A total of 37 subjects were randomized and treated with DX- 2930 or placebo. One subje ct in 
the 400 mg dose group received a single dose of DX
-2930 and, following several 
unsuccessful attempts to schedule their second dose, was replaced. This subject returned for a 
single follow -up visit before being lost to follow -up for reasons not relate d to the study .

Confidential Page 30of 92 Dyax Corp.Routine C1 -INH testing revealed that one other subject did not have HAE Ty pe I or II, 
despite a historical lab test indicating otherwise.
Subject demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity  and BMI . There were 
slightly  more females in the DX-2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 
53.8%). 
The most common AEs reported were HAE attacks, injection site pain, and headache. The 
rates were not appreciably higher in the DX -2930 subjects compared to placebo. Two 
subjects were reported to have 3 related severe TEAEs. One of these was a DX -2930 subject 
(30 mg) with injection site pain lasting 1 minute and one was a DX -2930 subject (400 mg) 
with worsening headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats.
No safet y signals were ide ntified for vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory  
tests, or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX-2930 was well tolerated in this 
study  with no evidence of dose -limiting toxicity  at doses up to 400 mg.
A total of 3 out of 92 post -dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), 
were confirmed to be anti -drug antibody -positive. No samples were positive for neutralizing 
activity .
The pharmacokinetic analy sis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300 and 400 mg doses showed
drug levels in HAE subjects were dose- dependent and exhibited a prolonged half -life of 
approximately  2 weeks, ty pical of a human monoclonal antibody . Cmaxdrug levels increased 
with increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with value s obtained in 
healthy  subjects in study  DX-2930-01.
A Western blot assay  showed pre -dose baseline levels of mean 2- chain HMWK in 
unactivated plasma collected from HAE patients was approximately  50%. A statistically  
significant reduction in 2 -chain HMWK levels was observed on study  days 8 and 22 in the 
300 and 400 mg dose groups compared to pre- dose levels, and approached levels similar to 
that observed in healthy  subjects. This outcome demonstrated the pharmacody namic activity  
of DX -2930 and its ability  to effectively  normalize the instability  of HAE plasma in this 
assay . 
Primary  efficacy  anal yses were based on subjects in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and placebo dose 
groups who reported having at least 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry  
(0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX -2930, 15 of 
16 subjects met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these 
criteria. 
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo 
group, 0.33 attacks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per w eek in the 400 mg group 
and 0.49 attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre -specified, 
primary  efficacy  interval of 6 weeks (from day s 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of notable 
drug exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted fo r baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300 mg 
group and 0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 31of 92 Dyax Corp.the placebo group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX-2930 
group ( P< 0.0001) and an 88% redu ction vs placebo for 400 mg DX -2930 ( P= 0.005). 
During this primary  efficacy  interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P= 0.026) and 
82% of subjects in the 400 mg group ( P= 0.03) were attack -free compared with 27% of 
subjects in the placebo group.
The data from this study  demonstrated proof of concept of the abilit y of DX- 2930 to prevent 
acute attacks of HAE. A statistically  significant finding of HAE attack prevention by  DX-
2930 was observed. DX -2930 was well tolerated in HAE subjects up to 400 mg . Drug 
exposure appeared to be dose- proportional and consistent with the results obtained in healthy  
subjects in study  DX-2930 -01. Pharmacod ynamic effect assay s provided evidence that 
DX-2930 has a direct effect on plasma kallikrein activity  in patient pla sma.
For additional detail regarding the multiple dose, clinical study  in HAE subjects, please refer 
to the DX- 2930 Investigator’s Brochure .
1.7 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Study  DX-2930- 04
The open- label DX -2930 extension st udy will be preceded by  the initiation of a pivotal, 
multi
-center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm study  (DX -2930- 03) 
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with 
Type I or T ype II HAE.  Further information on the DX -2930- 03 study  design can be found 
in Appendix 5 .
Subjects who complete the DX
-2930-
03 treatment period will be offered the option of rolling 
into the open -label extension study , DX-2930
-04.  A limited number of individuals with 
HAE T ype I or T ype II who were not enrolled in DX -2930- 03 (up to 50) will be also 
enrolled. 
The rationale for this open -label extension study  is to evaluate the long term safet y and 
efficacy  of repeated treatment with DX-2930.  For subjects rolling over from DX- 2930 who 
were randomized to one of the active study  arms, the duration of exposure will cover 1 full 
year.  For rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX -2930- 03, and for non- rollover 
subjects, the duration o f exposure will cover 6 months.  Combined, the overall exposure 
between DX -2930- 03 and DX -
2930- 04 provide a sizable dataset to evaluate DX -2930 as a 
life-long, chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.  
This study  also seeks to characterize the outer bounds of DX-
2930 dosing frequency  
(possibly  beyond 2 to 4 weeks) 
by assessing the duration of time between rollover subject ’s 
first open- label dose and their first reported HAE attack .  Additionally , this study  will assess
the immunogenicit y of D X
-2930 administered chronically  as well as evaluate PK, PD and 
subject quality  of life data following repeated administrations.

3.1 Overall Study  Design and Plan
3.1.1 Overview
This study  is an open- label, long term safet y and efficacy  study  to evaluate DX -2930 in 
preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Ty pe II HAE. There are two 
types of subjects who will be enrolled into this study :
1.Subjects who rollover from the DX-2930-03 study .
2.Subjects who were not participants in DX -2930- 03.
Roll- over Subjects:
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  182 of 
the DX -2930- 03 study  and consent to enter DX -2930 -04.  Subjects w ho discontinue from 
DX-2930-03 after enrollment are not eligible to enroll in DX-2930- 04.  Willing subjects must 
sign informed consent for DX -2930- 04 no later than the DX
-2930-03 Day  182 treatment 
period study  visit.  
The first DX -2930- 04 visit for rollov
er subjects (Day  0) will occur on the same day  as the 
DX-2930-03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will complete all DX -2930 -03 final study  
assessments at which time they  will be discharged from that study . No assessments 
conducted between the DX -2930-03 Day  182 study  
visit and the first DX- 2930 -04 visit 
(Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final DX -2930-03 assessments will be used as the 
pre-dose results for Day  0 Dose 1 of DX -
2930-04.
Subjects who are eligible to roll over into DX
-2930 -04 but elect not to may not enroll in 
DX-2930- 04 at a later time .
All subjects, caregivers, Investigators and site personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX
-2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of the DX -2930- 04 study .
Non-rollover subjects :
Up to 50 subjects who were not participants in the DX-2930- 03 study  will be permitted to 
enroll if they  meet the eligibility  requirements. Subjects who screen fail out of DX -2930-03 
for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run -in period must wait until 
enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they can screen for DX -2930- 04. The 
Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX -2930-
03.
Screening Period:
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments 
completed within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects

DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 34of 92 Dyax Corp.minimum 2 week washout period prior to the start of the treatment period.  This L TP 
washout is permitted as long as the Investigator determines that doing so would not place the 
subject at an y undue safety risk and the subject is at least 18 years of age.  The Investigator 
must confirm the subject has successfully  completed the 2 week washout period and have no 
ongoing adverse events related to the washout before they can receive their first open- label 
dose.
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects: Followi ng informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects 
will receive a single open -label dose of 300 mg DX- 2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC). 
Subjects will not receive any  additional DX -2930 doses until their first reported HAE attack.  
The duration of time between the first open-label dose and first reported HAE attack will 
vary by rollover subject.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study  Activities Schedule, 
for the entire duration of the study .  However, until a rollover subject reports their first HAE 
attack, onl y scheduled study visits where the following tests and assessments are performed 
must be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  testing, 
physical examination, 12-Lead ECG, QOL, PK, PD and anti -drug antibody sample 
collection.  All other scheduled study  visits may  be conducted via sit e check -in calls to 
collect information on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data .  Refer to 
Appendix 1 Study  Activities Schedule.
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative 
site for their second open -label dose of DX -2930 as quickly  as subject and site schedules 
allow.  If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ± 4 day  window around a 
scheduled stud y visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that 
scheduled visit has already  occurred.  
For example, if the second dose is to be administered on Day  52, all of the tests and 
assessments scheduled for th e Day  56 visit will be conducted.  This Day  52 visit to 
receive the second dose will count as the Day  56 visit. 
As another example, if the second dose is to be administered on Day  46, the subject can 
have this study  visit count as their Day  42 visit if th ey have not already  attended the 
Day 42 visit. If they  have alread y attended the Day 42 visit, then this Day  46 visit will be 
considered an acceptable, extra study  visit.
In the scenario that the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit and will thus 
represent an acceptable, extra study  visit.   
For example, if the second dose is to be admin istered on Day  63, this visit will represent 
an acceptable, extra study  visit .  
Regardless of the stud y day, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX -2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, phy sical 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 35of 92 Dyax Corp.examination, clinical laboratory  testing, PK, PD, and anti- drug antibod y. Vital signs will be 
obtained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be collected on 
adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data.
Subsequent doses after dose 2 require a minimum of 1 0 day s and maximum of 18 days 
between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ± 4 day  window around study  
visits. 
For example, if the second dose is to be administered on Day  37, the third dose should be 
administered between Day 52 and Day  55, which would ensure both a dosing interval 
within 10 to 18 day s from the second dose and a visit within the ±4 day  window around 
the Day  56 study  visit.  The fourth dose should then be administered between Day  66 and 
Day 73, which would ensure both a dosing interval within 10 to 18 day s from the third 
dose and a visit within the ±4 day  window around the Day  70 study  visit .
Regardless of when a subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 1 0days 
between their first open -label dose and their second open-label dose. Following their second 
open -label dose, subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open- label 
300mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment period. The 
treatment period will last 26 weeks from the date of the first open -label dose. The number of 
doses administered during this period will vary  by subject based on the date of each subject’s 
second dose, but will not exceed 13 doses. The Day  168 study  visit is the last visit at which a 
dose may be administered .
Non-rollover Subjects: Once all screening assessments have been completed, eligibility  
confirmed and LTP washout completed (if applicable), non -rollover subjects will arrive at 
the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open -label dose of 300 mg 
DX
-2930 administered SC.  Non- rollover subjects will continue to receive SC 
administrations of open -label 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks throughout the duration of the 
treatment period.  A total of 13 doses will be administered with the last dose a dministered at 
the Day  168 study  visit.
Follow -up Period
:
After completion of the 26 -week treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y 
evaluations during an 8 -week follow -up period unless rolling over into an other ongoing 
DX-2930 clinical study  or ac cess program that permits such a rollover. Figure 1shows a 
schematic of the open -label extension study .

Modifications to Open -Label Dosing :
If at an y time an important dose- related safet y signal is identified either from this study  or 
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et 
completed the treatment period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -
label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency .
In addition, b ased on the results of the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may switch to a 
different dose and/or frequency .
3.1.2 Stopping Rules
3.1.2.1 Study Level Stopping Rules
Safety  data, including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration 
of the study . If any potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, 
or from an y safet y findings from the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may  take actions as 

DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 37of 92 Dyax Corp.deemed appropriate, including suspending dosing in the study , while the potential risk is 
evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
3.1.2.2 Individual Stopping Rules
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non -serious AE) that, in 
the assessment of the Investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that 
subject’s well -being. The I nvestigator has the ability  to contact and consult with the Medical 
Monitor on such matters. Subjects wil l continue to be followed through the completion of all 
scheduled non- dosing visits, unless they  request to be discontinued from the study .
3.1.3 Follow -up for Subjects Meeting Stopping Criteria
Subjects that develop either an SAE or other toxicity  considered clinically relevant (AE, 
laboratory , phy sical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be carefully  monitored 
until resolution, which may  include the following:
•Additional clinical laboratory  tests and/or other clinical investigations
•Additional visit s or extended duration of follow -up
•Obtaining a specialist consultation
3.2 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Dose Selection
The dose selected for the open- label extension (300 mg every  2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pivotal, double -blind DX -2930- 03 trial. If at an y time 
an important dose-related safet y signal is identified either from this study or DX -2930- 03, the 
Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et completed the treatment 
period, and a ny subsequent subjects, to receive a different open- label DX -2930 dose and/or 
frequency .
Additionally , based on the efficacy  results of the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may switch 
to a different dose and/or frequency .
3.3 Individual Subject Dosing and Follow -
Up
All subjects will receive open -label DX -2930 during a 26 -week treatment period.  The 
number of doses that rollover subjects receive during this period will vary  by subject but will 
not exceed 1 3doses .  The last dose of open -label DX -2930 administered t o these subjects 
may be given at the Day  168 study  visit .  Non
-rollover subjects will receive 300 mg 
DX-2930 every  2 weeks for a total of 13 doses, with the first dose administered on Day  0 and 
the final dose administered at the Day  168 study  visit.
There will be a ± 4day window around each study visit. There will be a minimum of 1
0days 
between an y two doses. Excluding the time interval between the first and second open -label 
doses for rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 days between any  two d oses. 
Subjects will be monitored at the study  site through 1 hour post- dose.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 38of 92 Dyax Corp.3.4 Stud y Duration for Individual Subjects
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non-rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non- rollover 
subjects must occur within 4 weeks prior to the first open- label dose. Eligible subjects will be 
enrolled and undergo a 26-week treatment period. At the conclusion of the 26- week 
treatment period, subjects will be followed fo r an additional 8 weeks unless rolling over into 
another ongoing DX -2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 39of 92 Dyax Corp.4STUDY POPULA TION SEL ECTION
4.1 Stud y Population
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from the DX -2930- 03 study , as well as up to 
50 additional subjects who were not enrolled in DX-2930- 03.  The total enrollment is 
expected to be approximately  150 HAE Ty pe I or II subjects.  Subjects will be 12 years of 
age or older who experience at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE diagnosi s will be confirmed 
through documented clinical history  and diagnostic testing conducted either during screening 
or during participation in study  DX-2930- 02 or DX -2930-
03.
The subject population includes subjects who are 12 to 17 y ears old. Like adults, ch ildren 
with HAE can suffer from recurrent and debilitating attacks. Sy mptoms may  present very  
early in childhood, and upper airway angioedema has been reported in HAE patients as 
young as the age of 3 (Bork et al., 2003 ). In one case series of 49 pediatric HAE patients, 
23 had suffered at least one episode of airway  angioedema by  the age of 18 ( Farkas, 2010
). 
Animportant unmet medical need exists among children with HAE, especially  adolescents, 
since the disease commonly  worsens after pubert y (Bennett and Craig, 2015 ; Zuraw, 2008).  
The study  will aim to enroll at least 10 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive of 
subjects 12 to 17 y ears old who roll over from the DX -
2930- 03 study .
4.2 Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening. 
2.Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Ty pe I or II) based on all of the following:
Documented cli nical history  consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompan ying urticaria).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX -2930 study ) 
that confirm HAE Ty pe I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1- INH) functional level < 40% of 
the normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal 
level may  be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  
Subjects may  be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or 
believed b y the Investigator to be confounded b y LPT use. 
At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema s ymptoms 
≤30 years, a family  history  consistent with HAE Ty pe I or II, or C1q within 
normal range.
3.A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1 attack per 12 weeks.
4.Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form.  Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver 
DX-2930

Confidential Page 40of 92 Dyax Corp.has provided informed cons ent, are willing and able to read, understand and sign an 
assent form.
5.Males and females who are fertile and sexually  active must adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study  as follows:
Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use any  two of 
the following medically  acceptable forms of contraception from the screening period 
through 30 days after the final study  visit: progestin- only oral contraceptive, condom 
with or without spermicidal jelly , diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicidal jelly , or 
intra-uterine device (IUD, all ty pes). A female whose male partner has had a 
vasectom y must agree to use one additional form of medicall y acceptable 
contraception.
Females of non- childbearing potential, defined as su rgically  sterile (status post 
hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post- menopausal 
for at least 12 months do not require contraception during the stud y.
Males, including males who are surgicall y sterile (post vasectom y), wi th female 
partners of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medically  
acceptable form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the 
final study visit. 
4.3 Exclusion Criteria
Subjects who meet an y of the following criteria will be excluded from the study :
1.Discontinued from DX -2930 -03 after enrollment for any  reason.
2.If rolling over from DX -2930- 03, presence of important safet y concerns that would 
preclude participation in this study .
3.Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as 
acquired angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1- INH (also known as HAE Ty pe III), 
idiopathic angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.
4.Dosing with an investigational drug (not incl uding DX
-2930) or exposure to an 
investigational device within 4 weeks prior screening.
5.Exposure to angiotensin -converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors or any  estrogen -containing

5.1 Description of Trea tment(s)
For detailed information regarding open- label DX -2930 administration, refer to the 
Pharmacy  Manual.
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendia l components:  30 mM sodium 
phosphate dibasic dih ydrate , 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 
0.01% Poly sorbate 80. Each open label vial contains a nominal concentration of 150 mg 
DX-2930 active ingredient in 1 mL solution.
For each 300mg dose of DX -2930, each subject will receive a total of 2 mL, which will be 
administered in a single 2.0 mL  SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, 
thigh or abdomen.
5.2 Dosing and Follow -Up Scheme
Details of subject dosing and follow- up are outlined in Section 3.1.1 and included in the 
Study  Activities Schedule, Appendix 1 . 
Rollover subjects will receive their first open label SC dose of 300 mg DX -2930 on Day  0.  
Subjects will not receive any  additional DX -2930 doses until their firs t reported HAE attack.  
Following this attack subjects will receive open label SC doses of 300 mg DX
-2930 every  
2weeks until the end of the treatment period. 
The treatment period will last 26 weeks from the date of the first open -label dose.  The 
number of doses administered during this period will vary  by subject based on the date of 
each subject’s second dose, but will not exceed 13 doses.  The Day  168 study  
visit is the last 
visit at which a dose may be administered.
Non-rollover subjects will receive their first open- label dose SC dose of 300 mg DX -2930 on 
Day 0 and will continue to receive SC administrations of open -label 300 mg DX -2930 every  
2 weeks throughout the duration of the treatment period.  A total of 13 doses will be 
administered with the last dose administered at the Day  168 study  visit.
After completion of the 26 -week treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y 
evaluations during an 8 -week follow -up period unless rolling over into an other ongoing 
DX-2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.
5.3 Method of Identify ing Subjects
Subjects meeting all eligibility
 criteria will be enrolled in the study  and sequentially  assigned 
a unique site- based identification number.

all relevant treatments received b y the subject from the time of screening through the f inal 
study  visit . For subjects rolling over from DX -2930 -03, concomitant therapy  use will be 
carried forward from that study and will continue to be collected through the final study  visit . 
All information on concomitant therapy  (including all prescription/non -prescription 
medications, herbal medications and vitamin supplements) must be recorded on the subject’s 
eCRF and should include the name of the procedure or drug and duration of the treatment 
(start and stop dates). Concomitant treatments (non- pharma cological treatments) include an y 
surgical or diagnostic procedures.
5.4.1 Allowed Therapies
The following therapies are allowed during the study :
•Therapies for co -existing conditions, including those for acute attacks of HAE, are 
permitted if not excluded in Se ction 5.4.2.
•The use of short -term prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  
indicated.  Short -term prophy laxis is defined as C1 -INH, attenuated androgens, or anti -
fibrinoly tics used to avoid angioedema complications from medicall y indi cated 
procedures.
•Therapies to treat an y AEs the subject experiences during the stud y are permitted.
5.4.2 Excluded Concomitant Therapies
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the stud y:

Please refer to the Stud y Activities Schedule, Appendix 1 .
6.1 Informed Consent
The I CF must be executed prior to performing any study  related activities and must be 
approved b y the reviewing institutional review board (IRB), research ethics board (REB) or 
independent ethics committee (IEC). Subjects may withdraw consent at an y time. 
Participation in the study may  be terminated at any  time withou t the subject’s consent as 
determined b y the Investigator.
Subjects who are not rolling over from the double -blind DX -2930- 03 study will provide 
informed consent at Screening. Subjects who are rolling over from the double -blind 
DX-2930- 03 study  will provide consent no later than the DX -2930-03 Day  182 study  visit. 
Upon completion of the final assessments, the subjects will be discharged from the double -
blind study  and will start participation in the OLE study  and receive their first open -label 
dose.
6.2 Eligibi
lity Review
The Investigator or qualified site personnel will confirm that all I nclusion and Exclusion 
criteria have been met.
6.3 Demographics and Medical History
Demographics: date of birth (alternately  age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be
collected for legal reasons), sex,  race and ethnicity (where locall y permitted) and medical 
history  will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from DX -2930- 03 and 
will be recorded on the source document and eCRF. Medical history  will ca pture the 
subject’s current medical status (current disease processes), past medical status (past disease 
processes), history  of surgery , allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling 
over from DX -2930- 03, these data will be carried forward f rom that study . 
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance 
with the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Site personnel will 
be trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site.
Site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identify ing s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
patient (and caregi ver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for 
reporting attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, at tack frequency , average 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 46of 92 Dyax Corp.severit y, predominant attack location(s), average duration, acute attack therap y use and 
history  of long -term prophy laxis.
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack. This includes the first attack experienced 
by rollover subjects following their first open -label dose.  I n the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by  a famil y 
member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by  the subject, 
memory  aids may  be provided to assist in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced. 
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following in formation when reporting an 
attack:
Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
Impact on activit y and whether an y assistance or medical intervention was required, 
including hospital izations or emergency  department visits
Any medications used to treat the attack
If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms
Site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately  every  7 day s following the first 
dose of open- label DX -2930 to solicit for any  HAE attacks not already  reported.  Site check-
ins will cont inue until the subject has received their second open -label dose. 
During each stud y visit, site personnel will solicit for an y new HAE attack information that 
was not alread y provided to the site.
In this stud y, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs. All A Es, regardless of seriousness, 
severit y, or causal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Any AE reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be 
reported to the Sponsor using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE 
attacks, the Principal Investigator or ph ysician designee will review the event within 24 hours 
of initial notification and, in accor dance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed 
HAE attack. For all non-serious AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the Principal 
Investigator or ph ysician designee will review the event within 3 day s of initial notification 
and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack. If 
necessary  for the evaluation, the I nvestigator or designee may  contact the subject to receive 
additional information. Any subject -reported attack not confirmed b y the Investigator or 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 47of 92 Dyax Corp.physician designee must have an alternate AE diagnosis recorded.  All subject- reported and 
Investigator / phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital 
admissions will be captured.
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an 
attack in at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso,
and/or genitourinary  region
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea
•Lary ngeal angioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx
Despite the presence of these s ymptoms, the investigator or ph ysician designee may  still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that 
strongl y refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y 
symptoms that are not consistent with an HAE attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event 
persists well bey ond the ty pical time course of an HAE attack (e.g., greater than 7 day s), or 
there is a likel y alternate e tiology  for the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal sy mptoms are 
attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after r esolution of the prior attack’s s ymptoms.
6.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed by the Investigator or his/her qualified designee according to the 
Study  Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1 ). Routine vital sign assessments will be taken with 
the subject in the sitting or supine position after 5 minutes at rest and will include bod y 
temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and respiratory  rate (RR). BP should be 
determined using the same arm and the same equipment for each assessment.  For subjects 
who rollover from DX -2930 -03, vital signs taken during the final study  visit in DX -2930-03 
will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose vital signs in this study  and will not be duplicated.
6.6 Ph ysical Examination
A complete ph ysical examination including height, weight an d calculation of Body  Mass 
Index (BMI) will be performed by  the Investigator or his/her qualified designee according to 
the Study  Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1 ). The phy sical examination will include the 
following bod y systems:
•Height and weight (at Screening visit only  for non -rollover subjects)
•General appearance

duplicated.
6.7 Electrocardiography  (ECG)
A standard 12- lead ECG (single recording) will be performed according to the Study  
Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1 ). The date and time of each ECG and its results will be 
documented in the source documents and eCRF. Electrocardiograms will be sent to a central 
reading vendor for assessment.  For subjects who rollover from DX -2930- 03, the ECG taken 
during the final study  visit in DX -2930- 03 will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose ECG in this study  
and will not be duplicated.
6.8 Clinical Laboratory  Tests

study  visit in DX -2930- 03 will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose quality  of life assessments in this 
study  and will not be duplicated.
6.15 Adverse Event Reporting
Adverse events will be collected from signing of the informed consent through the last study  
visit.
6.15.1 Definitions
6.15.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a c linical trial subject whether or not it 
appears to have a causal relationship with the treatment administered. 
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product or participation in a clinical study , whether or not directl y related to the medicinal 
product or stud y participation.
•AEs may be new events or may  be pre -existing conditions that have become aggravated 
or have worsened in severity  or frequency  during the course of the study .
•AEs may  be clinicall y significant changes from baseline in physical examination, 
laboratory  tests, or other diagnostic investigation (e.g., laboratory  results, x- ray findings).
Laboratory  abnormalit ies generall y are not considered AEs unless they
 are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant 
laboratory  abnormality  that is independent from a known underl ying medical condition and 
that require s medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX -2930 interruption or 
discontinuation, will in itself, be considered an AE. Laboratory  or diagnostic testing 
abnormalities that reflect or are part of a known underly ing medical condition are not, in 
themse lves, AEs; rather, the underl ying medical condition leading to the abnormalities would 
be reported as the AE.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 53of 92 Dyax Corp.Pregnancy  is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct 
of the study , the Investigator must notify the Sponsor ac cording to the procedures provided in 
Section 6.15.5.2.
6.15.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
A SAE is any  adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any  of the following 
outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
might have caused death if it were more severe.
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Note: Does 
not include hospitalization for observation with release within 24 hours. A scheduled 
hospitalization for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened during participation in 
the study  does not meet this criterion. Pre -planned hospitalizations for an elective 
medical/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion.
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
•Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
•Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition 
above.
6.15.1.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage 
for a product. The dosing for this study  will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and 
an overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study , an 
overdose of DX -2930 is considered a dose that is two- fold higher than the intended dose for 
the subject.
6.15.1.4 Planned Hospitalization
A hospitalization planned by  the subject prior to the first dose of open- label DX -2930 is 
considered a therapeutic intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded 
as medical history . If the planned hospitalization or procedure is executed as planned, the 
record in the subject’s medical history  is considered complete. However, if the 
event/condition worsens during the trial, it must be reported as an AE.
6.15.1.5 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)
An AE is treatment -
emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open -label 
DX-2930 through the final follow -up visit or, in the event that onset time precedes first 
DX-2930 administration, the AE increases in severity  during the open
-label treatment period.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 54of 92 Dyax Corp.For rollover subjects, an y adverse event that started during the subject’s participation in 
DX-2930-03 and was ongoing at the time of the first open- label dose in DX -2930- 04 will not 
be counted as an AE in DX -2930- 04 unless that event has worsened in severity  or frequency  
following the first open -label dose.  Adverse events that started during subject participation 
in DX-2930- 03, resolved following the first open- label dose in DX -2930- 04, and then 
subsequently  reappeared in DX -2930- 04 will be counted as a new TEAE in DX -
2930-04.
6.15.1.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Investigators will report all AESI to Dyax, regardless of causality, using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting. The following describe the AESI  and the criteria 
for reporting AESI . 
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS
As hy persensitivity  reactions have been observed for monoclonal antibodies as a class, these 
events are considered AESI  for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with hy persensitivity  
reactions, regardless of causality , within 24 hours from the time of study
 drug administration. 
Investigators will report hy persensitivity  reactions that occur after 24 hours, only ifthe 
reactions are suspected to be related to study drug.
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION
Bleeding AESI
Athough aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro
phenomenon, as a precautionary  measure in evaluating the safet y of DX- 2930, bleeding 
events will be reported as A ESI for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs 
and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event 
of bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and 
when t emporall y reasonable, with any reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly  
indicative of bleeding.
Hypercoagulable AESI
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent with a thrombotic or embolic etiology . 
6.15.2 Monitoring
6.15.2.1 Monitoring of Adverse Events
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow- up visit.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 55of 92 Dyax Corp.•Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by  the Investigator or a qualified designee 
for evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence 
of AEs will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  
The presence or absence of specific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.
•Subjects having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory  tests, as determined by the Investigator.
•AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow -up res ults must be recorded in the eCRF 
as well as in the subject's source documentation. Follow -up laboratory  results should be 
filed with the subject's source documentation.
For an y SAEs or AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant
clinical assessments and laboratory  tests will be repeated as clinically  appropriate, until final 
resolution or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through 
completion of all scheduled visits.
6.15.2.2 Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments
All safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed at a central laboratory . The clinical 
laboratory  values will be reported to the Investigator who will review them for clinical 
significance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AEs.
6.15.3 Assessment of Adverse Events
6.15.3.1 Assessment of Severity
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe my ocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of 
relativel y minor medical significance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually  associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.
In this stud y, the severity of AEs will be assessed according to Division of Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National 
Institutes of Health: National I nstitute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 2 ) and 
the Division o f Microbiology  and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric Toxicity  Table, 
Draft, November 2007 (US National Institutes of Health: National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3 ). For abnormalities not specificall y found in the Toxicity  
Tables, the following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severity:
•GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort ; no medical intervention/therap y 
required
•GRADE 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity  -some assistance may  be 
neede d; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy  required
•GRADE 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity , some assistance usuall y required; 
medical intervention/therapy  required, hospitalizations possible 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 56of 92 Dyax Corp.•GRADE 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme limitation in ac tivity , significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therap y required, hospitalization or hospice 
care probable
Any treatment -emergent ECG abnormality  that is considered by  the Investigator as clinicall y 
significant and requiring inte rvention/therap y will be assessed as a severe AE.
6.15.3.2 Assessment of Causality
A medicall y qualified Investigator must assess the relationship of an y AE (including SAEs) 
to the use of DX -2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all 
available information, and may  include consideration of the following factors:
•Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre -existing 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic 
factors.
•The temporal association between DX -2930 exposure and onset of the AE.
•Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity  of 
DX-2930.
•The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping use of DX -2930 
(dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.
The causal relationship between DX- 2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories:
Not Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:
Temporal relationship is lacking (e.g., the event did not occur within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX -2930); or
Other causative factors more likely explain the event (e .g., a pre -existing 
condition, other concomitant treatments).
Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Related include:
There is a positive temporal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX-2930); or
The AE is more likel y explained by administration of DX -2930 than b y 
another cause (i.e., the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous 
knowledge of DX -2930 or the class of DX -2930).
6.15.3.3 Assessment of Clinical Significance
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined by  the Investigator, with 
discussion with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 57of 92 Dyax Corp.6.15.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant 
laboratory  abnormality  that is independent from a known underl ying medical condition and 
that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX- 2930 treatment interruption or 
discontinuation, will be considered an AE.
When laboratory  abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity  Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMID Pediatric Toxicity Tables ( Appendix 3 ) will be used to assess 
severit y. Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lower limit of normal 
(LLN) of laboratory  ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of 
the laboratory  that performs the assay s, the values provided by  the laboratory will be used for 
assignment of severit y grade. Clinical significance of individual laboratory  AEs will be 
determined b y the Investigator with input from the Medical Monitor as needed. 
Following is an exception to defining clinically  significant, abnormal laboratory  values as 
AEs:
APTT prolongation in the absence of an y associated bleeding or other evidence of 
clinical relevance will not be considered a clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  or 
AE. In the appropriate physiologic setting, such as IV heparin therap y, aPTT can be used 
to monitor bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT 
prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro phenomenon. 
Although plasma kallikrein drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay , plasma 
kallikrein -driven coag ulation does not appear to have hemostatic or other phy siologicall y 
important functions in vivo . It is well documented that, in humans, deficiency of factor 
XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal 
bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgical procedures ( Renne and Gruber, 2012 ). 
Despite the lack of clinical effect, deficiency  of eit her protein is associated with marked 
prolongation of the aPTT. 
6.15.5 Reporting Investigator Safety Observations to the Sponsor
6.15.5.1 Reporting Non- serious Adverse Events
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or causal relationship to DX -2930, will be 
recorde d on the AE page of the eCRF. In this study  all HAE attacks reported by  the subject, 
regardless of whether or not they  are confirmed by  the Investigator, will be captured as AEs.
6.15.5.2 Reporting Pregnancies
If a female subject or the female partner of a male sub ject becomes pregnant during the 
course of the stud y, the Investigator must report the pregnancy  to the Dy ax 
Pharmacovigilance Department using the Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24hours of 
becoming aware of the event. The Investigator must obtain consen t to collect pregnancy  
information (including the status of the newborn, if applicable).

unavailable at the time of the initial report, follow- up reports will be complete d and 
submitted within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new information. The Investigator is 
required to follow the pregnancy  through delivery . The outcome of the pregnancy  and the 
status of the newborn (if applicable) will be reported on the Pregnancy  Reporting Form 
within 24 hours of becoming aware.
6.15.5.3 Safety Observations Requiring Expedited Reporting by the Investigator to Dyax
Any occurrence of the following events or outcomes in a subject in the trial must be reported 
expeditiously  by the Investigator or qualified designee to the Dy ax Pharmacovigilance 
Department:
•SAE
•AESI
•Overdose
•Cancer
The Investigator is to report any  expedited safet y observations from the list above to Dy ax 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system within 24 hours of becoming a ware of 
the event.
Any SAE reported to the Dy ax Pharmacovigilance Department using the SAE Reporting 
Form in the EDC s ystem is to be recorded in the eCRF, as well as in the subject's source 
documentation along with any  actions taken. If all required inform ation on the form is not 
available at the time of the initial report, follow -up information will be completed in the EDC 
system.
The Investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the 
subjects are still participating in the study . SAE resolution is defined as:
•Resolved with or without residual effects.
•A return to baseline for a pre -existing condition.
•Laboratory  values have returned to baseline or stabilized.
•The Investigator does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event.
•Fatal outcome —if an autopsy  is performed; the autopsy  report is requested to be provided 
to the sponsor as soon as it is available.

DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 60of 92 Dyax Corp.6.17 Appropriateness of Measurements
This is a Phase 3 open- label extension study  that is designed to evaluate the long -term safet y 
and efficacy  of DX -2930 in prophy lactic therapy  for angioedema attacks in subjects with 
HAE. DX -2930 is a recombinant, fully  human IgG1, kappa light chain, monoclonal antibody . 
The open- label, non -controlled study  design is a standard approach for extension studies tha t 
follow double -blind pivotal trials. Measures employ ed in this protocol are standard measures 
routinely  used for the evaluation of the efficacy , safety  and tolerability  of an investigational 
product.  Measures employ ed for rollover subjects between the first and second open- label 
doses are appropriate to characterize the outer bounds of dosing frequency  for DX -2930.

visit is completed. Diagnostic test results and demographic and medical history  for these 
subjects will be carried forward from that s tudy.
7.2 Start of Treatment Period: Visit 1, Dose 1 (Day  0)
The following procedures and assessments are to be performed on Day 0 prior to the first 
dose of DX -2930.  For subjects who rollover from DX-2930- 03, all final assessments taken 
during the final study  visit in DX -2930-03 will be used as the pre- dose results on Day  0 and

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 74of 92 Dyax Corp.9.7 Analysis of Efficacy  Endpoints
9.7.1 Efficacy Endpoints
Efficacy  variables will be evaluated by  endpoint as outlined below.
The distribution of time from first open -label dose to first HAE attack will be determined for 
rollover subjects.  The estimation will be based on a standard Cox proportional hazards 
model where several baseline covariates will be tested including baseline attack rate prior to 
entering DX -2930- 03, the treatment arm in DX -2930 -03, the time since the last dose given in 
DX-2930- 03, the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during DX -2930-03. 
The distribution of time to first attack will be adjusted for an y significant baseline (p <0.05) 
covariates, and b y examining the distribution separatel y by the treatment arm the patient was 
in during DX -2930- 03. In this survival analy sis, one observation (time to first attack) per 
subject will be generated.
For other efficacy  endpoints, mean event rates will be assessed for all subjects (14 day s post -
second dose to Day  182 for rollover subjects; Day  14 to Day  182 for non-rollover subjects).
In addition, for rollover subjects, the mean change from the documented values in 
DX-
2930- 03 at baseline (last measurement prior to randomization into DX -2930-03) and 
entry  (last meas
urement in DX-2930- 03 prior to enrollment into DX -2930- 04) will be 
compared to the values assessed at DX -2930- 04 time points from 14 days after the second 
dose in DX -2930-
04 through Day  182 (i.e., 2 weeks after the final scheduled dose on 
Day 168). Changes will be calculated and presented as descriptive statistics for each 
DX
-2930-03 
treatment group (300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks, 300 mg DX -2930 every

hydration, or a ssociated with sy ncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal .
9.8 Safet y Analysis
Evaluation of safety  data will include all patients who received at least one dose of study  
medication. Clinical interpretation will be based upon review of display s of adverse events 
and laboratory  values. Principal considerations in this evaluation will be time to onset, and 
investigator -reported relationship of either adverse events or laboratory  abnormalities to 
study  medication.
All Subjects:
Safety  measures include AEs, concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs 
(blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory  rate, and body temperature), phy sical examination 
findings, and ECGs.
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the start 
oftreatment with DX -2930, or medical conditions present prior to the start of treatment but 
increasing in severity  or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment. The 
number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be display ed by bod ysystem and 
preferred term using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA®). 
Summaries in terms of severity  and relationship to DX -2930 will also be provided. SAEs will 
be summarized separately  in a similar fashion. Patient listings of AEs causing 
discontinuation of DX- 2930 treatment, AEs resulting in death, SAEs and AESI  will be 
produced.
AESI  will be anal yzed according to primary  System Organ Classes (SOCs) and Preferred 
Terms (PTs) determined by  the search ofrelevant Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs). 
Summary  tables with SOCs and PTs, from the SMQ searches, will be generated 
presenting the number and percentage of subjects by  AE, severit y, seriousness, and 
relationship to study  medication.
Usage of concomitant medications (other than res cue medi cations) will be summarized 
descriptivel y.
Actual values and change from Day  0 in vital signs and clinical laboratory tests will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics at each assessment obtained. For all laboratory  tests, a 
shift table will be produced summarizing changes from normal to abnormal and vice-versa.
The number and percentage of subjects with normal, abnormal -not clinically significant, and 
abnormal -clinicall y significant ECG findings will be display ed. Other safety  parameters, 
such a s subject withdrawals will be summarized.
Rollover Subjects: Adverse events that started during subject participation in DX -2930-03 
and were ongoing at the time of first open- label dose in DX -2930 -04 will not be counted as 
an AE in DX -2930- 04 unless that e vent has worsened in severit y or frequency following the 
first open- label dose.  Adverse events that started during subject participation in DX -2930-03 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 76of 92 Dyax Corp.and resolved following the first open -label dose in DX -2930- 04 and then subsequently  
started again in DX -2930-04 will be counted as a new AE in DX-2930-04.
The incidence of AEs in DX
-2930- 04 for subjects rolling over from each DX -2930-03 
treatment group (300 mg DX- 2930 every  2 weeks vs. 300 mg DX- 2930 every  4 weeks vs. 
150mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks vs placebo) as well as evaluation of overall AEs in the 
combined group of all rollover subjects will be assessed. Changes from baseline (last 
measurement prior to the first dose of DX- 2930 received, regardless of if it occurred in 
DX-2930- 03 or DX -
2930-04
) to the DX-2930- 04 time points for phy sical examination 
results, vital sign parameters, and clinical laboratory  parameters will be summarized by  
DX-2930- 03 treatment group and for the combined group of all rollover subjects. 
Non-rollover Subjects: Adverse events will be captured from the time of informed consent 
through the final study  visit.  Adverse event tabular summaries will be based on all 
treatment -emergent AEs.
9.9 Analysis of Quality  of Life A ssessments
Quality  of life data will be obtained using the EQ5D, SF -36, and Angioedema Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire (AE -QoL) at pre -dose on Day s 0, 98 ±3, and 182 ±3. An additional assessment 
will be conducted on Day  238 ±3 for subjects who complete the Follow- up Period.   Full 
details of the planned analy ses using these quality  of life assessments will be included in the 
SAP.

the Investigator, inspect the facili ties, and inform the Investigator of responsibilities and 
procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation.
The Investigator must prepare and maintain adequate and accurate records of all observations 
and other data pertinent to the clinical stud y for each study  participant. Frequent 
communication between the clinical site and the Sponsor is essential to ensure that the safet y 
of the study  is monitored adequatel y. The Investigator will make all appropriate safety 
assessments on an ongoing basis. T he Medical Monitor may  review safet y information as it 
becomes available throughout the study .
All aspects of the stud y will be carefully  monitored with respect to GCP and SOPs for 
compliance with applicable government regulations. The Study  Monitor will b e an 
authorized individual designated b y the Sponsor. The Study Monitor will have access to all 
records necessary  to ensure integrit y of the data and will periodically review the progress of 
the study  with the Investigator.
10.6 Case Report Forms and Study  Reco rds
The Investigator will ensure the accuracy , completeness, and timeliness of the data reported 
to the Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to 
ensure completeness, accuracy , reliability , and consistency . A compl ete audit trail will be 
maintained of all data changes. The Investigator or designee will cooperate with the 
Sponsor’s representative(s) for the periodic review of study  documents to ensure the 
accuracy  and completeness of the data capture s ystem at each s cheduled monitoring visit.
Electronic consistency  checks and manual review will be used to identify  any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the clinical sites by  means of 
electronic or manual queries.
The Investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study  
documents (medical records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, raw data 
collection forms, etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each

DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 80of 92 Dyax Corp.10.7 Protocol Violations/Deviations
The Investigator will be instructed not to deviate from the protocol, except where necessary  
to eliminate an immediate hazard to study  participants. Should other unexpected 
circumstances arise that will require deviation from protocol- specific procedures, the 
Investigator should contact their Sponsor representative to discuss the appropriate course of 
action. 
The Investigator should document all protocol deviations/violations in the subject’s eCRF 
and source documents. In the event of a significant deviation/violation, th e Investigator 
should notify  the Sponsor representative. Significant deviations/violations include, but are 
not limited to those that increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of 
primary  study  assessments. The I nvestigator will pr omptly  report all changes in research 
activity  and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others to his or 
her IRB/REB/IEC.
10.8 Access to Source Documentation and On-Site Audits
Regulatory  agencies may request access to all study  records, including source documents, for 
inspection and cop ying, in keeping with country  regulations. The Investigator should 
immediately  notify  the Sponsor representative of any  announced or unannounced regulatory  
agency  inspections. An auditing inspection may  also be conducted b y the Sponsor 
representative or designee. An y aspect of the trial may be subject to audit by the Sponsor 
and/or inspection b y regulatory authorities or the IRB/REB/IEC. Such audit s/inspections may  
take place at the Sponsor’s site(s), the CRO, or at the clinical sites, including laboratories, 
pharmacies and any other facilities used for the study. 
The Investigator will be responsible for the accuracy  of the data entered in the eCRF . The 
Investigator will permit the designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory  bodies to have 
direct access to the source documents to verify  data represented in the eCRF.

1.Screening visit is for non -rollover subjects only.  Screening visit can occur up to 28 days prior to first open -label dose.
2.The Follow -up Period is not required for subjects who choose to roll over into an ongoing DX -2930 clinical study or access program that permits such a rollover.
3.Site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately every 7 days following the first dose of open -label DX -2930 to solicit for any HAE attacks not already r eported.  Site 
check -in with rollover subjects will continue until the subject receives their second open-label dose. 
4.For rollover subjects, t he timing of Dose 2 will vary by subject based on when their first HAE attack occurs following Dose 1.  Following the first reported HAE attack, subjects 
will begin receiving regular SC administrations of 300 mg DX -2930 every 2 weeks .  A minimum of 1 0 days between the first and second open-label doses is required . If the 
second dose is to be administered wit hin the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unle ss that scheduled 
visit has already occurred . If that scheduled visit has already occurred, or if the second dose is to be administ ered outside of the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled 
visit, this visit will not replace any scheduled visit and will thus represent an acceptable, extra study visit. Regardless, a t the visit in which the second open -label dose of 
DX-2930 is admin istered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody. Vital 
signs will be obtained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with all study visits, information will be col lected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data . 
5.The Day 210 Visit is a site check- in for all rollover and non -rollover subjects.
6.Rollover subjects will provide consent no later than the Day 182 DX-2930 -03 study visit.
7.Non-rollover subj ects who are on long -term prophylactic (LTP) therapy for HAE are required to undergo a minimum 2 week washout period prior to the start of the tre atment 
period .
8.Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment unless already collected as part of protocol DX -2930 -02 or DX -2930 -03.  
9.The pregnancy test will only be conducted in females of childbearing potential. Tests performed on Day 0 must be urine -based to confirm eligibility prior to first dose . Tests

Confidential Page 124of 92 Dyax Corp.Appendix 5 Summary  of Planned Pivotal Study  of DX -2930 in HA E 
Subjects
The proposed pivotal clinical study  (DX -2930- 03) is entitled “HEL P StudyTM: A Multicenter, 
Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Efficacy  and Sa fety Study  to Evaluate 
DX-2930 For Long -Term Prophy laxis Against Acute Attacks of Hereditary  Angioedema 
(HAE).” This study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, randomized, placebo -controlled 
parallel -arm study evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in prevent ing acute angioedema 
attacks in patients with Type I or T ype II HAE. The double -blind study  is planned to be 
followed b y the study described in the present protocol, an open -label extension (OL E) study
(DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of study  DX-2930-
03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in 
preventing HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to evaluate the safet y of repeated SC 
administrations of DX- 2930. The tertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic 
effects of chronicall y administered DX-2930; to assess the immunogenicity  of chronically  
administered DX -2930; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of chronically  administered 
DX-2930; and to evaluate the effect of DX -2930 upon quality  of life assessments.
Subjects aged 12 years and over with a documented diagnosis of Ty pe I or Ty pe II HAE who 
experience at least 1 attack per 4 weeks will be eligible for the study . 
Up to 120 subjects are 
planned for enrollment across approximately  60 sites in the United States, Canada, Ital y, 
German y, United Kingdom and Jordan.
Following informed consent, subjects will undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who are 
on long -term prophy lactic therapy  for HAE are required to undergo a minimum 2 week 
washout period prior to the start of the run -in period.  Subjects who are either not on long -
term proph ylactic therapy  for HAE, or have completed the required washout period will enter 
a run -in period of 4 weeks to determine the baseline HAE attack rate. The run -in period may  
be extended to 8 weeks if the minimum baseli ne attack rate is not achieved in the first 
4 weeks. HAE subjects will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) 
administrations of DX- 2930 or placebo in a double -
blind fashion.  Subjects who are 
randomized to DX-2930 will be assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: 
300mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  4 weeks or 150 mg every  4 weeks.  Each subject will 
undergo a treatment period consisting of 13 doses of blinded study  drug, for a period of 
26weeks from the date of first do se on Day  0 through Day  182
Subjects may  consent to rollover into the OLE study  (present protocol DX -2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the mean rate of investigator- confirmed HAE 
attacks observed in each DX-2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the 
efficacy  assessment period (Day  14 through Day  182).

Confidential Page 125of 92 Dyax Corp.Figure 1. Overview  of the Design of Pivotal Study  DX-2930 -03
Dose Rationale for Double -Blind, Pivotal Study  DX-2930-03
The dose rationale is based on the pharmacod ynamic bioactivity, PK, safety, and efficacy of 
DX-2930 from the Phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical studies. Together, th ese attributes 
provide the rationale for the selected doses and regimens to achieve drug levels likely  to 
prevent a majority  of HAE attacks. Based on these considerations, 300 mg every  2 weeks, 
300mg every  4 weeks, and 150 mg every  4 weeks were identified as the dosing regimens for 
evaluation,
The 3 proposed dose -regimen combinations provide a 6 -fold range of steady -state trough 
concentrations and leverage both the biomarker and efficacy  data generated in study  
DX-2930-02.  Evaluation of the DX- 2930 plasma concentrations at the time of attacks 
reported b y DX -2930 treated subjects in DX-
2930- 02 suggests that the 3 planned dosing 
regimens will provide a meaningful range of clinical response while avoiding non -
therapeutic or super -therapeutic doses and regimens

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04 27 June 2016 
Study Design:  
DX-2930-04 is an open- label, long term safety and efficacy extension study  of DX -2930-03, to 
evaluate the investigational medicinal product (IMP), DX-2930, in preventing acute angioedema 
attacks in patients with Type I and Type II HAE. There are two types of subjects who will be enrolled into this study: 
•Subjects who rollover fr om the DX -2930-03 study
•Subjects who are non- rollover (i.e.,  were not participants in DX -2930-03)
Rollover Subjects  
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period at Day 182 of the DX-2930-03 study and consent to enter DX-2930-04.  Subjects who discontinue from DX-2930- 03 after enrollment are not eligible to enroll in DX -2930-04.   
Willing subjects must sign informed consent for DX-2930-04 after Day 168 of study DX-2930-03 and no later than the final DX-2930-03 Day 182 treatment period study visit.   
Subjects who are eligible to roll over into DX -2930-04 but elect not to, may not enroll in 
DX-2930- 04 at a later time.  The first  DX-2930- 04 visit for rollover subjects (Day 0) will occur 
on the same day as the DX -2930-03 Day 182 study visit. Rollover subjects will complete all 
DX-2930- 03 final study assessments (Day 182) at which time they will be discharged from that 
study. No assessments conducted between the DX-2930-03 Day 182 study visit and the first DX-2930- 04 visit (Day  0) will be duplicated. Results of the final DX -2930- 03 assessments on 
Day 182 will be used as the pre -dose results for Day 0 Dose 1 of DX-2930-04. 
All subjects, caregivers, investigators and study site personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX-2930- 03 treatmen t assignment until the conclusion of the DX-2930-04 study. 
Non-rollover subjects  
At least 50 subjects (up to a maximum of 100) who were not participants in the DX-2930-03 study will be permitted to enroll if they meet the eligibility requirements. Subjects who screen 
fail out of DX-2930-03 for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run-in period must wait until enrollment for the double- blind study has ended before they can screen for 
DX-2930-04. The Sponsor may ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX-2930-03. Subjects who are still in the run-in period for DX-2930-03 when enrollment for 
that study closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP  who screen fail out of DX-2930-03 due to an 
inability to wash -out of th eir LTP, may screen for DX -2930-04 following discussion with the 
Sponsor medical monitor. 
Screening Period:  
There is no screening period for rollover subjects. 
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects  (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1 -INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Page 4 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04 27 June 2016 
Day 8 (or Day 15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) dose s of C1 -INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti -fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), a 
similar tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by an additional 
week , if medically indicated,  as long  as androgen or anti-fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within 3 
weeks after  receiving the first dose of DX -2930.   
Treatment Period:  
Rollover Subjects 
Following informed consent and pre- dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open- label dose of 300 mg DX-2930 administered subcutaneously (SC) on Day 0.  Subjects will 
not receive any additional DX- 2930 doses until their first reported , and investigator -confirmed, 
HAE attack.   
The duration of time between the first open-label dose and first reported HAE attack will vary by rollover subject.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study Activities Schedule for the entire duration of the study.  However, until a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack, only scheduled study visits whe re the following tests and assessments are performed must be 
conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory testing, physical examination, 12-Lead ECG, QoL, PK, PD and anti-drug antibody sample collection. All other 
scheduled s tudy visits may be conducted via site check -in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.  See Study Activities Schedule  for which 
visits must be conducted at the study site. 
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they will present to the investigative site 
for their second open-label dose of DX-2930 as quickly as subject and site schedules allow.  If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window around a scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
already occurred , the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study visit (i.e., an 
unscheduled visit).  Similarly, if the  second dose is admini stered outside of the accepted ±4 day 
window around a scheduled visit, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra unscheduled study visit, (i.e., this visit will not replace any scheduled visit).  
Regardless of the study 
day, at the visit  in which the second open- label dose of DX -2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre- dose assessments for vital signs, physical 
examination, clinical laboratory testing, and blood sampling for PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody 
assessments. Vital sign s will be obtained at 1 hour post-dosing. As with all study visits, 
information will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.  
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 10 days between their first open -label dose and their second open-label dose. Following their second 
dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC ad ministrations of open-label 300 mg 
DX-2930 every 2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment period per the scheduled dosing in the Study Activities Schedule . The treatment period will last 350 days from the date of 
the first open -label dose. The number of doses administered during this period will vary by 
subject based on the date of each subject’s second dose, but will not exceed 26 doses. The Day 
Page 5 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
350 study visit is the last visit at which a dose may be administered.  
Non-rollover Subjects  
Once al l screening assessments have been completed and eligibility confirmed, non- rollover 
subjects will arrive at the study site and, following pre- dose assessments, receive an open -label 
dose of 300 mg DX-2930 administered SC on Day 0.  Non- rollover subjects will continue to 
receive SC administrations of open -label 300 mg DX-2930 every 2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period per the scheduled dosing in the Study Activities Schedule.  A total of 26 doses will be administered with the last dose adm inistered at the Day 350 study visit. 
All Subjects: 
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require  a minimum of 10 
days and maximum of 18 days between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 day window around study visits.  
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any time during the study that in the 
opinion of the investigator requires medical intervention, standard of care therapy should be provided based on subject’s medical history and per locally approved product information.  Administration of DX -2930 and study procedures will continue without alteration to the protocol 
study activities schedule, even if a subject receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema attack  on the day of a scheduled dose of study drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study 
visit. 
Self-Administration  
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self -
administer treatment .  Subjects must complete appropriate training by the investigator or 
designee and  understanding of the training must be confirmed by the investigator or designee. 
Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at 
the study site. Once initiated, subjects may self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the 
investigational site (when visits are scheduled study site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study permits off- site dosing). See Schedule of Activities for 
details. Adolescent subjects self-administering  investigational product will be supervised by a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver. Alternatively, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training , will be allowed to administer DX-2930 to an adolescent without study site 
personnel supervision.  Site personnel will call subjects after the planned off-site self -
administration s to ensure the adminis tration occurred, to collect AEs,  concomitant medications, 
and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately documented.  Throughout the study, study site personnel will document information in source documents (ie, 
the subject’s medical record ) and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-
administration  and SC administration of DX -2930. 
 Follow- up Period  
After completion of the 350 day  treatment period, all subjects will undergo safety evaluations 
 
Page 6 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
during an 8 -week follow -up period.  
Modifications to Open -Label Dosing  
If, at any time, an important dose- related safety signal is identified either from this study or 
DX-2930-03, the Sponsor may decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not yet completed the treatment period, and any subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label 
DX-2930 dose and/or frequency. 
In addition, based on the results of the DX -2930-03 study, the Sponsor may switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency.  
Study Population:  
The study is expected to enroll subjects from the DX-2930-03 study, as well as at least 50 (up to 
a maximum of 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in DX-2930-03. The total enrollment is expected to be at least  150 but not more than 250 HAE Type I or II subjects. 
Subjects will be 12 years of age or older who experience at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE diagnosis will be confirmed through documented clinical history and diagnostic testing conducted either during screening or during prior participation in study DX -2930-02 or DX-
2930- 03.  The study will aim to enroll at least 15 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, 
inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 12 to 17 years old who roll over from the DX-2930-03 
study. 
Criteria for Inclusion:  
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening.  
2. Documented diagnosis of HAE (Type I or II)  based on all of the following: 
• Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompanying urticaria). 
• Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX -2930 study) that 
confirm HAE Type I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) func tional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1- INH level 40 -50% of the normal level may 
be enrolled if they also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history or beli eved by the i nvestigator 
to be confounded by recent LTP use.  
• At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema symptoms ≤ 30 years, a family history consistent with HAE Type I or II, or C1q within normal 
range. 
3. A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. 
4. Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form. Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver has provided informed cons ent, are willing and able to read, understand and sign an assent form. 
5. Males and females who are fertile and sexually active must adhere to contraception requirements for the duration of the study as follows: 
• Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended to use 
highly effective forms of contraception from screening through 30  days after the final 
 
Page 7 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
study visit. This includes stable doses (for 3 months  prior to study screening ) of 
combined estrogen and proges tin-containing  hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra -uterine device (IUD, all types) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing systems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner has had a vasectomy must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable contraception. 2) Use of a male condom with or without spermicide or cervical cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) are  not 
considered highly effective. 
• Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal for 
at least 12 months do not require contraception during the study. 
• Males, including males who are surgically sterile (post vasectomy), with female partners 
of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medically acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study 
visit.  
Criteria for Exclusion:   
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 
1. Discontinued from DX-2930-03 after enrollment for any reason. 
2. If rolling over from DX-2930-03, presence of important safety concerns that would preclude 
participation in this study.  
3. Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as acquired 
angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE Type III), idiopathic 
angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.

exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to screening.  
5. Exposure to angioten sin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to study 
screening  or any newly initiated or dose modification of estrogen -containing medications 
with systemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal  replacement therapy) 3 
months prior to the screening visit. 
6.  Unwilling to discontinue use of long-term prophylactic therapy for HAE (C1- INH, 
attenuated androgens, or anti- fibrinolytics) within 3 weeks after starting DX -2930 treatment.  
7. Any of the following liver function test abnormali ties: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3x 
upper limit of normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x upper limit of normal, or 
total bilirubin > 2x upper limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of 
Gilbert’s Syndrome).

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
Test Product; Dose; and Mode of Administration:  
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative- free so lution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% Polysorbate 80. Each open-label vial contains a nominal concentration of 150 mg DX-2930 active ingredient in 1  mL solution. 
For each 300 mg dose of DX -2930, each subj ect will receive a total of 2 mL ( 2 vials) , which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Self-Administration  Option: Investigational product can  be self -administered  without supervision 
(parental  supervision required  for adolescent  subject)  after subjects receive  appropriate training  
by the investigator or designee and their understanding is confirmed. Subjects are allowed to 
initiate self -administration  after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study site and may 
continue to self -administer all subsequent doses (see Study Activities Schedule) . 
Duration of Treatment:  
All subjects will receive open -label DX -2930 during a 350 day treatment period. The number of 
doses that rollover subjects receive during this period  will vary by subject but will not exceed 26 
doses. The last dose of open -label DX -2930 administered to these subjects may be given at the 
Day 350 study visit. Non-rollover subjects will receive 300 mg DX-2930 every 2 weeks for a 
total of 26 doses, with the first dose administered on Day 0 and the final dose administered at the 
Day 350 study visit. 
There will be a ±4 -day window around each study visit. There will be a minimum of 10 days 
between any two doses. Excluding the interval between the first and second open- label doses for 
rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 days between any two doses. Subjects will be monitored at the study site through 1 hour post-dose for scheduled study site visits.  No 
monitoring of vital signs will be performed for  subjects who elect to self -administer  away from 
the investigational site . 
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:  
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX-2930-03 or undergo screening assessments (non -rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non-rollover subjects 
must occur within 4 weeks prior to the first open-label dose. Eligible subje cts will be enrolled 
and undergo a 350 day treatment period. At the conclusion of the 350 day treatment period, 
subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks.  
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:  
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the study:  
• Long-term prophylaxis for HAE (e.g., use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or anti-
fibrinolytics) once LTP is discontinued ( within 3 weeks following the first dose of DX-
2930).  
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
• Initiat ing or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with systemic absorption 
 
Page 9 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy)  3 months prior to study 
screening . 
• Use of androgens (e.g., stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methyltestosterone, and 
testosterone ) for non-HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation  
during the first three weeks . 
• Any other investigational drug or device.  
The use of short- term prophylactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated.  
Short- term (pre-procedure) prophylaxis is defined as use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema 
complications from medically indicated procedures.  
Management of Acute Attacks:  
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the i nvestigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapies that the investigator deems as 
medically appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therapy but not as a 
long-term prophylactic therapy. Administration  of DX-2930 and study procedures will continue 
without alteration to the protocol-s pecified study schedule, even if  the subject has symptoms of 
an HAE attack th e day of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack.   
The administration of DX-2930 can also be re- scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum 
timeframe between doses are met based on patient preference or physician discretion.  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will include the following:  
• Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI). SAEs and AESI will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.  
• Vital signs, including sitting or supine blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body 
temperature, and respiratory rate (RR)  
• Physical examination 
• Clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis) 
• 12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured  and monitored during this study. 
Hypersensitivity reactions and events of disordered coagulation will be considered AESI.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments:  
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of plasma DX -2930 concentrations. 
Pharmacodyn amic (PD) Assessments:  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of DX -2930 through 
biomarker assays.  
Immunogenicity Assessments:  
Blood samples will be collected to assay for the presence of anti -drug antibodies, including 
evaluation of neutralizing antibodies (if any confirmed positive anti-drug antibodies are 
detected).

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
C1-INH, C1q and C4 Assessments:  
Samples for C1-INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment, 
unless already collected as part of protocol DX-2930-02 or DX-2930-03.  
Quality of Life Assessments:  
Quality of life (QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL), EuroQoL 5-Dimensional 5- Level Measure (EQ-5D-5L), Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI- GH), Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey (SF-12). 
DX-2930 Injection Report and Self -Administration and Subcutaneous  Injection Survey  
An injection report of the subject’s experience with self-administration and S C injection will be 
completed by the subject after all doses of DX -2930. 
 
In addition, assessment survey  of subject experience with SC and self -administration injections 
of DX -2930 w ill be completed by the subject approximately every 6 months . 
Collection of HAE Attack Data:  
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study will be done in accordance with the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Study s ite personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site. 
Study site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying symptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to provide.  The patient (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting attacks to the site.  
At screening, HAE attack history will be collected for non-rollover subjects. Information collecte d will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, 
predominant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy use and history of LTP (including duration of LTP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency of attacks while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (year of confirmation, how many years after onset of symptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject was misdiagnosed).  
During the study, subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify and report details to the study site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack. This includes the first attack experienced by rollover subjects following their first open -label dose.  In the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by a family member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by the subject, memory aids may be provided to assist in tracking any HAE attacks experienced , but its use is 
not mandatory.  
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:  
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced . 
 
Page 11 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
• Description of sympto ms experienced, including location(s) . 
• Impact on activity (work, school, social interactions) and whether any assistance or 
medical intervention was required, including hospitalizations, additional laboratory tests or emergency department visits. 
• Any medic ations used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter). 
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms. 
Study s ite personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as  
necessary to document the attack, as described in HAARP.  
Study site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately every 7 days following the first dose of open- label DX -2930 to solicit for any HAE attacks not already reported.  Site check-ins 
will continue until the subject has received their second open-label dose. 
During each study visit, study site  personnel will solicit for any new HAE attack information that 
was not already provided to the site. 
In this study, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs.   All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, 
or causal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  Any AE 
reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event.  For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or 
physician designee will review the event within 24 hours of initial notification and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack.   For all non- serious 
AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or physician designee will review the 
event within 3 days of initial notification and, in accordance with HAAR P, evaluate if it 
represented a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee 
may contact the subject to receive additional information.   Any subject-reported attack not 
confirmed by the investigator or physician desig nee must have an alternate AE diagnosis 
recorded.  All subject -reported and i nvestigator/ physician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
Emergency department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital admissions 
will be captured. 
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or geni tourinary region. 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat 
 
Page 12 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, p alate, uvula, or larynx . 
Despite the presence of these symptoms, the investigator or physician designee may still clinically determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongly refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by symptoms that are not consistent with an HAE attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typical time course of an HAE attack, or there is a likely alternate etiology for the event (e.g., the subje ct’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household).  
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new symptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.  
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
A formal interim analysis will be conducted  at least 35 subjects have completed 12 months of 
consecutive exposure to DX -2930 across the combined DX -2930- 03 and DX -2930-04 studies, 
and only after database lock of the DX-2930-03 study.  Subsequent interim analyses may be 
conducted to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory reporting as required.   
 An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safety data for the DX-2930-03 study. While 
an independent DSMB is not currently planned for this study, summary safety data from DX-
2930-04 may be reviewed by the DSMB established for the DX-2930-03 study as part of the 
collection of safety information available on DX-2930.  
Individual Stopping Rules:  
Dosing for any individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that subject’s 
well-being. The i nvestigator has the ability to contact and consult with the Medical Monitor on 
such matters. Subjects will continue t o be followed through the completion of all scheduled non-
dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study.  
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Safety Measures:  
• AEs including SAEs and AESI 
• Clinical Laboratory testing (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis) 
• Vitals signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oral body temperature and respiratory rate 
• Physical Examination  
• 12-lead ECG  
Efficacy Endpoints: 
• Time to first HAE attack for rollover subjects (based upon time from f irst open label study 
dose until first HAE attack)  
• Number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period  
 
Page 13 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
• Number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period  
• Number of moderate or severe HAE  attacks during the treatment period 
• Number of high-morbidity HAE attacks during the treatment period ; a high -morbidity HAE 
attack is defined as any attack that has at least one of the following characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except h ospitalization for observation < 24 hours), 
hemodynamically significant (systolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hydration, or associated with syncope or near -syncope) or laryngeal. 
 
Additional Measures:  
• Anti-drug antibody development 
• Pharmacokinetics (P K)  
• Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects 
• Quality of Life Assessments  
• DX-2930 Injection Report  
• DX-2930 Self -administration and Subcutaneous Injection Survey  
Analysis Populations:  
• The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any study drug after entering 
the DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to open- label DX -2930).    
 
• The Rollover Safety Population is the subset of subjects who participated in the DX-2930-03 
study and received any study drug after entering the DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to 
open- label DX -2930).  
 
• The Non-rollover Safety Population is the subset of subjects who entered the DX-2930-04 study directly and received any study drug after entering the DX -2930-04 study (i.e., any 
exposure to open -label DX -2930).    
Sample Size Determination:  
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on any statistical considerations.  This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of open -label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in DX-2930-03 and individuals who were 
not otherwise able to participate in DX -2930-03. 
Statistical Methodology: 
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE a ttack  will be analyzed using the Rollover Safety 
Population. 
 
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (days) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -2930 to the date and time of the first investigator-
confirmed HAE at tack after the first open -label dose.  Subjects who discontinue the study prior 
to experiencing their first on -study investigator -confirmed HAE attack will be censored at the 
date and time of study discontinuation.  Time to the first investigator -confirmed  HAE attack will 
 
Page 14 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods.  
 Multivariate and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be employed to examine the impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack, inc luding but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering DX -2930-03, the 
treatment group in DX-2930-03, the time since the last dose given in DX-2930-03, the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during DX-2930-03. Results of this exploratory analysis will be summarized.   
 
Number of Investigator-confirmed HAE Attacks 
 The number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 through Day 350) expressed as a monthly HAE attack rate, will be analyzed using each analysis 
population.  The monthly rate of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period will be 
calculated for each subject as the number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks occurring 
during the treatment period divided by the number of days the subject contributed to the treatment period multiplied by 28 days.    The baseline investigator -confirmed monthly HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator-confirmed monthly HAE attacks occurring during the pretreatment period for rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non -rollover subjects divided by the 
number of days the subject contributed to the pretreatment period for rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non-rollovers multiplied by 28 days.  The baseline, treatment period, and treatment period change from baseline in the investigator-confirmed HAE attack rate will be summarized for each analysis population. The summary will include the total number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks reported during each period and subject-time in months that each subject contributed to each period. Figures wi ll be created for 
each analysis population plotting the on-study investigator- confirmed HAE attacks reported 
during the treatment period relative to Day 0 for each subject.  Similar summary tables will be presented for the following efficacy endpoints for each analysis 
population: 
• Number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.  
• Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period. 
• Number of high-morbidity investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high-morbidity HAE attack is defined as any attack that has at least one of the following characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation < 24 hours), hemodynamically significant (systolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hydration, or 
associated with syncope or near -syncope) or laryngeal.

Safety Analysis: 
Adverse Events 
 Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open- label DX -2930 in this study, or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment.  
 
The analyses described in this section will be ba sed on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevity.    Related AEs are AEs classified as related to study drug by the investigator.  Severe AEs are AEs classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) by the investigator. 
 The number and percentage of subjects with any AE, any related AE, any SAE, any related SAE, any severe AE , and any related severe AE as well as the total number of events for each category 
will be summarized.  The number of deaths due to an AE, hospitalization due to an AE and study discontinuation due to an AE will be summarized.   The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be summarized by SOC, and PT. This tabulation will be repeated for rel ated AEs, SAEs, related 
SAEs, severe AEs, and related severe AEs.  
 Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study are hypersensitivity reactions and disordered coagulation (hypercoagulability events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) for each AESI will be performed using the study data. 
The number and percentage 
of subjects with an AESI, as well as the total number of AESIs, will be summarized by SOC and PT. 
Separate summary tables will be created for each AESI and for those events with the SMQs classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and related severe.  A listing detailing the PT within the SMQ will be provided.  
Laboratory Test Results, Vital Signs, and Electrocardiography Results  
 Baseline is defined as th e last non-missing value prior to the first exposure to DX-2930. For 
rollover subjects previously exposed to DX-2930, baseline is the last non-missing value prior to first exposure to study drug in the DX-2930-03 study.          Actual values and change fr om baseline in clinical laboratory test results and vital signs will be 
summarized by study visit.   
Laboratory test results will be classified according to the reference ranges and clinical significance as determined by the investigator. Vital sign values will be classified according to clinical significance as determined by the investigator. The number of subjects with a non -
missing result, and the number and percentage of subjects within each category will be 
summarized by study visit.

NOTE:  Shaded columns represent scheduled in-site visits for all subjects. Non-shaded columns indicate potential subject -elected off -site activity and/or self -administration dosing.  
NOTE :  “( )”s indicate activities that may occur as applicable (ie, activities for rollover subjects)  
1. Screening visit is for non-rollover subjects only.  Screening visit can occur up to 28 days prior to first open-label dose. 
2. Study site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately every 7 days following the first dose of open-label DX-2930 to solicit for any HAE attacks not already 
 reported.  Site check-in with rollover subjects will continue until the subject receives their second open label dose.  
3. Visit 28 is a site check -in call for all rollover and non-rollover subjects.  
4. Subjects who terminate from the study early will undergo (if possible) all of the assessments and procedures at Visit 29, their final study visit  
5. Rollover subjects must sign informed consent for DX -2930-04 after Day 168 of study DX-2930-03 and no later than the final DX-2930-03 Day 182 treatment period study 
 visit.  
6. For rollover subjects Day 182 of the DX-2930-03 study is also Day 0 of the DX-2930-04 study and informed consent may be completed on this visit, if not already provided.  
7. Screened non-rollover subjects (adults and adolescents) who are on LTP with C1- INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until Day 8 (or Day 15) such that 
 subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1-INH.  For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti -fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), a similar 
 tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by an additional week as long as androgen or anti -fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within 3 weeks of 
 receiving the first dose of DX-2930. 
8. For rollover subjects, the timing of Dose 2 for will vary by subject based on when their first HAE attack occurs following Dose 1.  Following the first reported and 
 investigator -confirmed attack, subjects will begin receiving regular SC administrations of 300 mg DX -2930 every 2 weeks.  
9. A minimum of 10 days between the first and second open-label doses is required. If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window around a 
 scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that  scheduled visit has already occurred. If that scheduled visit has already occurred, or if 
 the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled visit, this visit will not replace any scheduled visit and will thus  represent an 
 acceptable, extra study visit (i.e., an unscheduled visit). Regardless, at the visit in which the second open-label dose of DX -2930 is administered, the subject will undergo pre -
 dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the site), clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody. Vital 
 signs will be obtained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with all study visits, informa tion will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.  
10. All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be 
 allowed to self -administer DX -2930 after completing appropriate training by the investigator or designee and confirming their understanding. Subjects are a llowed to initiate

 self-administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study si te and may elect to self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site 
 (during scheduled study site visits; shaded columns).  
11. Subjects may self -administer DX -2930 at home or other agreed upon location (during optional off-site self -administration visits; non -shaded columns). Site personnel will call 
 subjects after the planned self-administration to ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have  been appropriately 
 documented. 
12. Samples for C1- INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment unless already collected as part of protocol DX-2930-02 or DX-2930-03.   
13. The pregnancy test will only be conducted in females of childbearing potential.  Tests performed on Day 0 must be urine -based to confirm eligibility prior to first dose.  Tests 
 performed at screening and on indicated visits can be serum or urine -based.  
14. There is a recommended ± 15 minute window for all vital signs. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing. Monitoring of vital signs will not be 
 performed for subjects who elect to self- administer away from the investigative site at optional off-site visits (indicated non-shaded columns). Height and weight will be 
 collected at the Screening visit only.  
15. Physical examinations will be conducted for all rollover and non- rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule and in accordance with standards at the site.  In 
 addition to the physical examinations specified in the study activities schedule, an additional physical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the  site) will be 
 conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open- label dose, at whatever study visit  that occurs.  
16. Clinical laboratory testing will include Hematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis (urinalysis does not need to be done as part of the clinical laboratory 
 testing at Visits 14, 17, 20, and 23). Clinical laboratory testing will  be conducted for all rollover and non-rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In 
 addition to the testing specified in the study activities schedule, additional testing will be conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open-label 
 dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.  
17. Historical HAE attack information will be collected at screening. During the study, subjects (or caregivers) are instructed t o report details of the attack to the study site within 
 72 hours of the onset of the attack. During study visits, study site personnel will solicit for any new HAE attack information that has not already been reported to the site.  
18. Quality of life data will be obtained using the EQ-5D-5L, SF -12, AE -QoL, HADS, a nd WPAI -GH.  
19. Collect subject’s injection reports of their experience with DX -2930 self-administration and subcutaneous administration for all doses.  
20.  Collect subject’s injection surveys of their experience with DX -2930 self-administration and subcutaneous injection for indicated visits.  
21. PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody PD samples will be drawn for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In addition to the samples 
 specified in the study activities schedule, an additional PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody sample will be drawn for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second 
 open-label do se, at w hatever study visit that occurs

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 DX-2930 
DX-2930 is a fully human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for prophylactic treatment of angioedema 
attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), a serious and life- threatening disease.  
1.2 Hereditary Angioedema  
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life -threatening disease caused by mutations in the 
C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) gene, resulting in deficiency or dysfunction of C1- INH protein. HAE 
manifests clinically as unpredict able, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema 
of the face, larynx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw, 2008). Swelling may last 
up to five or more days; most patients suffer multiple attacks per year. HAE is an orphan disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates range from 1 per 10,000 to 1 per 150,000 persons, with many authors agr eeing that 1  per 50,000 is likely the 
closest estimate (Bygum, 2009; Goring et al., 1998; Lei et al., 2011; Nordenfelt et al., 2014; 
Roche et al., 2005).  
Swelling in the larynx can obstruct the airways and cause death from asphyxiation ( Bork et al., 
2012; Bork et al., 2000 ). Approximately 50% of all HAE patients will experience a laryngeal 
attack in their lifetime, and there is no way to predict which patients are at risk of a laryngeal 
attack (Bork et al., 2003 ; Bork et al., 2006).  
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  and severe pain; 
intestinal symptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may lead to unnecessary surgery (Zuraw, 2008).  
Approximately 85% of patients have Type I HAE, characterized by very low production of functionally normal C1- INH protein, while the remaining approximately 15% of patients have 
Type II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionally impaired C1- INH (Zuraw, 
2008). In patients with Types I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein generation results in excess bradykinin release from high -molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and vascular leak 
mediated by bradykinin binding to the B2 receptor (B2- R) on the surface of endothelial cells 
(Zuraw, 2008). Clinical suspicion of Types I and II HAE can be confirmed by available blood 
tests. In addition to abnormali ties in C1 -INH level and function, plasma C4 levels are often  
reduced in blood from most patients. 
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX -2930 
Plasma kallikrein plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks (Davis, 2006; Kaplan 
and Joseph, 2010). In normal physiology, C1- INH regulates the activity of plasma kallikrein  as 
well as a variety of other proteases, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor XIIa. Plasma 
kallikrein regulates the release of bradykinin from HMWK. Due to a deficiency of C1- INH in 
HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity occurs and leads to the excessive generation of 
bradykinin. Bradykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic HAE symptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain ( Craig et al., 2012; Zuraw et al., 
 
Page 34 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
2013). Intervening at the level of bradykinin production with a plasma kallikrein inhibitor 
therefore represents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy for HAE. Indeed, the importance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated through the observed effectiveness of Kalbitor
® (ecallantide), a peptide that specifically targets plasma kallikrein, 
which was approved by the FD A for the treatment of acute HAE attacks ( Kalbitor® Package 
Insert, 2015).  
DX-2930 is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X-ray 
crystallography of DX-2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX-2930 binding to the active site of kallikrein (Kenniston et al., 2014). 
1.4 Safety Rationale for DX-2930 
Safety data from the Phase 1a clinical study, a first -in-human study with DX-2930 in healthy 
subjects did not identify any safety concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX-2930 were well-tolerated. There were no dose- limiting toxicities, serious adverse e vents, or any other safety 
concerns identified.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX-2930-01) and Phase 1b (DX-2930-02) 
clinical stud ies in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity studies support a wide 
safety margin. The mean C
max for human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 
was approximately 27 µ g/ mL . As comparison, a mean C max of 744 µ g/ mL was observed 
following dosing of monkeys with 50 mg/kg DX-2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekly for 6 months  
resulting in a safety margin of approximately 28- fold. No toxicologically significant findings 
were observed in these treated animals or in any other nonclinical toxicity study to date for  
systemically administered DX -2930. 
Safety data is also available from the Phase 1b study (DX-2930- 02), a multiple -ascending dose 
study in HAE patients. In this study, two doses of DX-2930 up to 400 mg administered 14 days apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose-limiting toxicities, serious adverse events in any 
DX-2930 treated subjects, or any other safety concerns identified in this study of HAE patients. Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study found that the drug exposure following two administrations of DX-2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially less than that 
attained and evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity studies. 
For additional detail regarding the safety rationale for DX -2930, please refer to the DX -2930 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.5 DX-2930 Non-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology 
For more detail regarding the nonclinical findings, please refer to the DX-2930 Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data 
The clinical development program to date for DX-2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of DX-2930, including one completed Phase 1a single-ascending 
 
Page 35 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
dose study in healthy subjects and a Phase 1b multiple- ascending dose study in HAE patients. 
These studies are summarized in the following sections.  
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects (DX -2930 -01) 
DX-2930-01 was a Phase 1a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy 
subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX-2930. Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active study drug within one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing cohort, 6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo.  
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study and were randomized. The treatment groups were well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX -2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) across all cohorts.  
Based on the safety analysis, a single administration of DX-2930 was well tolerated up to doses 
of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity. There were no deaths, SAEs, or subject discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the study. Furthermore, there was no significant imbalance between placebo and DX-2930 for any particular treatment- emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly reported TEAE was headache, which occurred at a rate of 25% for both DX-2930 and placebo. 
The PK profile demonstrated linear, dose -dependent drug exposure with a mean half- life of 
approximately 17 to 21 days across dose groups. Results from two exploratory biomarker assays 
provide evidence for an important pharmacodynamic effect of DX-2930 in humans.  
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study in healthy subjects, please refer to 
the DX-2930 Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.6.2 Multiple -Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX -2930-02) 
DX-2930-02 was a Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled , multiple ascending-
dose study in patients with HAE to evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK of SC DX-2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study drug or placebo within 
one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 400 mg (nominal 6 subjects per cohort). Each subject received 2 doses of study drug separated by 14 days.  
A total of 37 subjects were randomized and treated with DX-2930 or placebo. One subject in the 
400 mg dose group received a single dose of DX-2930 and, following several unsuccessful attempts to schedule their second dose, was replaced. This subject returned for a single follow-up visit before being lost to follow -up for reasons not related to the study. Routine C1- INH testing 
revealed that one other subject did not have HAE Type I or II, despite a historical lab test 
indicating otherwise.   
Subject demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity and BMI. There were slightly more females in the DX -2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 53.8%).  
 
Page 36 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
The most common AEs reported were HAE attacks, injection site pain, and headache. The rates 
were not appreciably higher in the DX-2930 subjects compared to placebo. Two subjects were reported to have 3 related severe TEAEs. One of these was a DX -2930 subject (30 mg) with 
injection site pain lasting 1 minute and one was a DX-2930 subject (400 mg) with worsening headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats. 
No safety signals were identified for vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 
or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX -2930 was well tolerated in this study with 
no evidence of dose-limiting toxicity at doses up to 400 mg. 
A total of 3 out of 92 post-dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), were 
confirmed to be anti-drug antibody- positive.  No samples were positive for neutralizing activity.  
The pharmacokinetic analysis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300 and 400 mg doses showed drug levels in HAE subjects were dose -dependent and exhibited a prolonged half- life of 
approximately 2 weeks, typical of a human monoclonal antibody. C
max drug levels increased with 
increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with values obtained in healthy subjects in study DX-2930-01. 
A Western blot assay showed pre- dose baseline levels of mean 2 -chain HMWK in unactivated 
plasma collected from HAE patients was approximately 50%. A statistically significant reduction 
in 2-chain HMWK levels was observed on study days 8 and 22 in the 300 and 400 mg dose groups compared to pre-dose levels, and approached levels similar to that observed in healthy subjects. This outcome demonstrated the pharmacodynamic activity of DX-2930 and its ability to effectively normalize the instability of HAE plasma in this assay.  
Primary efficacy analyses were based on subjects in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and placebo dose groups who reported having at least 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry (0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX-2930, 15 of 16 subjects met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these criteria.  
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo group, 
0.33 attacks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per week in the 400 mg group and 0.49 
attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre- specified, primary 
efficacy interval of 6 weeks (from days 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of notable drug exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted for baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300  mg group and 
0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in the placebo group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX-2930 group ( P < 0.0001) 
and an 88% reduction vs placebo for 400 mg DX-2930 ( P = 0.005). During this primary efficacy 
interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P = 0.026) and 82% of subjects in the 400 mg 
group ( P = 0.03) were attack -free compared with 27% of su bjects in the placebo group. 
The data from this study demonstrated proof of concept of the ability of DX-2930 to prevent acute attacks of HAE. A statistically significant finding of HAE attack prevention by DX-2930 was observed. DX- 2930 was well tolerated in HAE subjects up to 400 mg. Drug exposure 
appeared to be dose -proportional and consistent with the results obtained in healthy subjects in

study DX-2930- 01. Pharmacodynamic effect assays provided evidence that DX -2930 has a direct 
effect on plasma kallik rein activity in patient plasma.  
For additional detail regarding the multiple dose, clinical study in HAE subjects, please refer to 
the DX-2930 Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.7 Rationale for Open- Label Extension Study DX -2930-04 
The open- label DX -2930 extension st udy will be preceded by the initiation of a pivotal, multi-
center, double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled parallel-arm study (DX-2930-03) 
evaluating the efficacy of DX-2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Type 
I or Type II HAE.  Further information on the DX-2930-03 study design can be found in Appendix 5. 
Subjects who complete the DX-2930-03 treatment period will be offered the option of rolling 
into the open-label extension study, DX-2930-04.  In addition, a limited  number of individuals 
with HAE Type I or Type II who were not enrolled in DX-2930-03 (up to 100) will be also 
enrolled.  The rationale for this open -label extension study is to evaluate the long -term safety of repeated 
subcutaneous treatment with DX -2930 and the long- term efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks .  For subjec ts rolling over from DX-2930-03 who were randomized to one of the 
active study arms, the total duration of exposure across both studies will cover 18 months.  For 
rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX-2930-03, and for non- rollover subjects, the total 
duration of exposure will cover 12 months.  Combined, the overall exposure between 
DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 will provide a sizable dataset to evaluate D X-2930 as a life-long, 
chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.   
This study seeks to evaluate the outer bounds of DX-2930 dosing frequency (possibly beyond 
2 to 4 weeks) by assessing the duration of time between  a rollover subject’ s first op en-label dose 
and t heir first reported HAE attack .  In addition, characteristics of all HAE attack s will be 
reported and compared to the subject’s historical baseline (for non- rollo ver subjects) or attack 
history based on attacks reported in the  DX-2930-03 study (for rollover subjects ). 
For non-rollover subjects, the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching from a long-term prevention therapy (eg, C1 -INH, anti-fibrinolytics , androgens) to DX -2930 dosing, 
while evaluating breakthrough attack characteristics compared to historical baseline both prior to 
and during co -administration  with their LTP therapy regimen  and while receiving DX-2930 
alone.  
For all subjects, the  study will also assess immunogenicity of chronically administere d DX-2930, 
PK and PD, subject health -related quality of life  (QoL), subject experience with self-
administration and ease of SC administration  with DX-2930.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
3.1.1 Overview  
DX-2930-04 is an open- label, long term safety and efficacy extension study of DX-2930-03, to 
evaluate the investigational medicinal product ( IMP), DX-2930, in preventing acute angioedema 
attacks in patients with Type I and Type II HAE. There are two types of subjects who will be 
enrolled into this study: 
• Subjects who rollover from the DX-2930-03 study  
• Subjects who are non- rollover (i.e., were not participants in DX -2930-03)  
Rollover S ubjects  
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period at Day 182 of the 
DX-2930-03 study and consent to enter DX-2930-04.  Subjects who discontinue from DX-2930-03 after enrollment are not eligible to en roll in DX -2930-04.   
Subjects should be asked about their interest in the DX -2930-04 study after enrollment into 
DX-2930-03 to anticipate enrollment and preparedness for DX-2930-04.  Willing subjects must 
sign informed consent for DX-2930-04 after Day 168  of study DX-2930-03 and no later than the 
final DX-2930-03 Day 182 treatment period study visit.   
The first DX -2930-04 visit for rollover subjects (Day 0) will occur on the same day as the 
DX-2930-03 Day 182 study visit. Rollover subjects will complete a ll DX -2930-03 final study 
assessments (Day 182) at which time they will be discharged from that study. No assessments 
conducted between the DX-2930-03 Day 182 study visit and the first DX-2930-04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final DX -2930- 03 assessments on Day 182 will be used as the 
pre-dose results for Day 0 of DX-2930-04. 
All subjects, caregivers, investigators and study s ite personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX-2930-03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of the DX-2930-04 study. 
Non-rollover subjects  
At least 50 subjects (up to a maximum of 100) who were not participants in the DX -2930-03 
study will be permitted to enroll if they meet the eligibility requirements . Subjects who screen 
fail out of DX-2930-03 for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run-in 
period must wait until enrollment for the double- blind study has ended before they can screen for 
DX-2930-04. The Sponsor may ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX-2930-03. Subjec ts who are still in the run-in period for DX-2930-03 when enrollment for 
that study closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP  who screen fail out of DX-2930-03 due to an  
inability to wash -out of their LTP , may screen for DX -2930-04 following discussion with the 
Sponsor medical monitor.

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
Screening Period:  
Rollover subjects 
There is no screening period for rollover subjects. 
 
Non-rollover subjects   
Non-rollover subjects  must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects  (adults and 
adolescents)  who are on LTP with C1 -INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day 15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti- fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid) ; a 
similar ta pering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by an additional 
week as long as androgen or anti-fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within  3 weeks of receiving the 
first dose of DX -2930.   
 
Treatment Period:  
Rollover Subjects 
Following informed consent and pre- dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open- label dose of  DX-2930 administered subcutaneously ( SC) on Day 0. Subjects will not 
receive any additional DX -2930 doses until their first reported and investigator confirmed HAE 
attack.  As such, the total number of doses within the 350 day treatment period will vary by 
rollover subject.  
The duration of time between the first open-label dose and first reported HAE attack will vary by rollover subject.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study Activities Schedule, for the entire duration of the study.  However, until a rollover subjec t reports their first HAE attack, only 
scheduled study visits where the following tests and assessments are performed must be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory testing, physical 
examination, 12- Lead ECG, QoL, PK, PD and anti-drug antibody sample collection.  All other 
scheduled study visits may be conducted via sit e check -in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.  See  Study Activities Schedule for which 
visits must be conducted at the study site . 
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they will present to the investigative site 
for their second open-label dose of DX-2930 as quickly as subject and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be admi nistered within the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled 
study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
already occurred , the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study visit .   
In the event that the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ±4 day window 
around a scheduled visit, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra study visit (i.e., this visit will not replace any scheduled visit).  
Regardless of the study day, at the visit in which the second open- label dose of DX-2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre- dose assessments for vital signs, physical

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
examination, clinical laboratory testing, and blood sampling for PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody 
assessments. Vital signs will be obtained at 1 hour post-dosing. As with all study visits, 
information will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data. 
Non-rollover Subjects  
Once all screening assessments hav e been completed and eligibility confirmed, non- rollover 
subjects will arrive at the study site and, following pre- dose assessments, receive an open -label 
dose of 300 mg DX-2930 administered SC on Day 0.  Non-rollover subjects will continue to receive SC administrations of open- label 300 mg DX-2930 every 2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period.  A total of 26 doses will be administered with the last dose administered at the Day 350 study visit. 
All Subjects:  
For all subjects, subsequent doses after the second dose require a minimum of 10 days and 
maximum of 18  days between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ± 4 day 
window around study visits.  
After the second DX-2930 dose is given either within the study window (±4 days) or an 
acceptable extra study visit, the 3rd dose must be administered at the next pre- defined study visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.  
Regardless of when a subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 1 0 days 
between their f irst open -label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their second 
open- label dose, subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -label DX-
2930 every 2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment period. The treatme nt period will 
last 350 days from the date of the first open-label dose. The number of doses administered during 
this period will vary by subject based on the date of each subject’s second dose, but will not exceed 26 doses. The Day 350 study visit is the last visit at which a dose may be administered . 
Self-Administration  
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self -
administer treatment . Subjects must complete appropriate training by the investigator or designee 
and have their understanding of the procedures confirmed by the investigator or designee. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration after rece iving the first 2 doses of DX-2930 at 
the study site. Once initiated, subjects may self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the 
investigational site (when visits are scheduled study site visits) or the subject’s home or other 
agreed upon location ( when the study permits off-site dosing ). See Schedule of Activities for 
details. Adolescent subjects self -administering DX-2930 will be supervised by a parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver. Alternatively, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training , will be allowed to administer the investigational product to  an adolescent without study  
site personnel  supervision. Site personnel will call subjects after the planned self -administration 
to ensure the administration occurred, to collect A Es, concomitant medications, and to ensure all 
attacks have been appropriately documented.

Follow- up Period  
After completion of the 350 day tre atment peri od, all subjects will undergo safety evaluations 
during an 8-week follow-up period.  Figure 1 shows a schematic of the open -label extension 
study.

Modifications to Open -Label Dosing  
If at any time an important dose- related safety signal is identified either from this study or 
DX-2930-03, the Sponsor may decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not yet 
completed the treatment period, and any subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label 
dose and/or frequency.  
In addition, based on the results of the DX -2930-03 study, the Sponsor may switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency.

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
3.1.2 Stopping Rules  
3.1.2.1 Study Level Stopping Rules  
Safety data, including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularly throughout the duration of 
the study. If any potential safety signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, or from any safety findings from the DX-2930-03 study, or followin g DSMB review,  the Sponsor 
may take actions as deemed appropriate, including suspending dosing in the study, while the potential risk is evaluated and a course of action has been determined. 
3.1.2.2 Individual Stopping Rules  
Dosing for any individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or DX-2930- related, clinically significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator or DSMB recommendation, warrants discontinuation from further 
dosing for that subject’s well-being. The investigator has the ability to contact and consult with 
the Medical Monitor on such matters. Subjects will continue to be followed through the 
completion of all scheduled non-dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study. 
3.1.3 Follow- up for Subjects Meeting Stopping Criteria  
Subjects that develop either an SAE or other toxicity considered clinically relevant (AE, 
laboratory, physical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be carefully monitored until resolution, which may include the following: 
• Additional clinical laboratory tests and/or other clinical investigations  
• Additional visits or extended duration of follow-up 
• Obtaining a specialist consultation  
 
3.2 Rationale for Open- Label Extension Dose Selection  
The dose sel ected for the open-label extension (300 mg every 2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pivotal, double- blind DX -2930- 03 trial. If at any time an 
important dose- related safety signal is identified either from this study or DX -2930-03, the 
Sponsor may decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not yet completed the treatment 
period, and any subsequent subjects, to receive a different open- label DX-2930 dose and/or 
frequency. 
Additionally, based on the efficacy results of the DX-2930-03 study, the Sponsor may switch to 
a different dose and/or frequency. 
3.3 Individual Subject Dosing and Follow -Up 
All subjects will receive open -label DX-2930 during a 350 day treatment period.  The number of 
doses that rollover subjects receive during this period will vary by subject but will not exceed 26 
doses.  The last dose of open- label DX-2930 administered to these subjects may be given at the 
Day 350 study visit .  Non -rollover subjects will rec eive DX-2930 every 2 weeks for a total of 26 
doses, with the first dose administered on Day 0 and the final dose administered at the Day 350 
study visit. 
 
Page 44 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
There will be a ±4 day window around each study visit. There will be a minimum of 10 days 
between any two doses. Excluding the time interval between the first and second open- label 
doses for rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 days between any two doses. Subjects will be monitored at the study site through 1 hour post- dose.  
All subjects (adole scent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training by the investigator or design ee and  
confirming their understanding. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration after 
receiving the first 2 doses of DX-2930 at the study site. Once initiated, subjects may continue to self-administer subsequent doses of DX-2930. Subjects who elect to self -administer 
investigational product will be provided the necessary  supplies (see Section 5.7 and Section  
6.15.1).  
 
3.4 Study Duration for Individual Subjects  
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX-2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non -rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non-rollover subjects 
must occur within 4 weeks prior to the first open-label dose. Eligible subje cts will be enrolled 
and undergo a 350 day treatment period. At the conclusion of the 350 day treatment period, subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks.

4. STUDY POPULATION SEL ECTION  
4.1 Study Population  
The study is expected to enroll subjects from t he DX-2930-03 study, as well as at least  50 (up to 
a maximum of 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in DX-2930-03.  The total 
enrollment is expected to be approximately 150, but not more than 250 HAE Type I or II subjects.  Subjects will be 12 years of age or older who experience at least 1 attack per 12  weeks. 
HAE diagnosis will be confirmed through documented clinical history and diagnostic testing conducted either during screening or during participation in study DX-2930-02 or DX-2930-03. 
The subject population includes subjects who are 12 to 17 years old. Like adults, children with 
HAE can suffer from recurrent and debilitating attacks. Symptoms may present very early in childhood, and upper airway angioedema has been reported in HAE patie nts as young as the age 
of 3 ( Bork et al., 2003 ). In one case series of 49 pediatric HAE patients, 23  had suffered at least 
one episode of airway angioedema by the age of 18 ( Farkas, 2010). An important unmet medical 
need exists among children with HAE, especially adolescents, since the disease commonly worsens after puberty ( Bennett and Craig, 2015 ; Zuraw, 2008).  The study will aim to enroll at 
least 15 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 1 2 to 17 
years old who roll over from the DX-2930-03 study.  
4.2 Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening.  
2. Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Type I or II) based on all of the following: 
• Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompanying urticaria). 
• Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX-2930 study) that 
confirm HAE Type I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1- INH level 40 -50% of the normal level may 
be enrolled if they also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history or believed by the investigator 
to be confounded by LPT use.  
• At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema symptoms 
≤ 30 years, a family history consis tent with HAE Type I or II, or C1q within normal 
range. 
3. A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1 attack per 12 weeks.  
4. Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form.  Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver has provided informed consent, are willing and able to read, understand and sign an assent form.

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
5. Males and females who are fertile and sexually active must adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study as follows: 
• Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended to use 
highly effective forms of contraception from the screening period through 30 days after 
the final study visit.  This includes stable doses (for 3 months prior to study screening ) of 
combined estrogen and progestin-containing hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra -uterine device (IUD, all types) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing systems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner 
has had a vasectomy must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable contraception. 2) Use of a male cond om with or without spermicide or cervical cap, 
diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) are  not 
considered highly effective. 
• Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal for 
at least 12 months do not require contraception during the study. 
• Males, including males who are surgically sterile (post vasectomy), with female partners of childbearing potenti al must agree to be abstinent or else use a medically acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study visit.  
4.3 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 
1. Discontinued from DX-2930-03 after enrollment for any reason. 
2. If rolling over from DX -2930-03, presence of important safety concerns that would preclude 
participation in this study.  
3. Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as acquired 
angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE Type III), idiopathic angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.  
4. Dosing with an investigational drug (not including DX-2930 or other HAE therapies ) or 
exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior screening.  
5. Exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to screening or any newly initiated or dose modification of estrogen -containing medications 
with systemic absorpti on (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy) 3 
months prior to the screening visit. 
6. Unwilling to discontinue use of long-term prophylactic therapy for HAE (C1-INH, attenuated androgens, or anti- fibrinolytics) within 3 weeks after starting DX-2930 treatment.

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
7. Any of the following liver function test abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >  3x 
upper limit of normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x upper limit of normal, or 
total bilirubin > 2x upper limit of norm al (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of 
Gilbert’s Syndrome).  
8. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. 
9. Subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, may compromise their safety or compliance, preclude successful conduct of the study, or interfere 
with interpretation of the results (e.g., history of substance abuse or dependence, a significant pre-existing illness or other major comorbidity that the investigator considers may confound 
the interpretation of study results).

5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)  
For detailed information regarding open- label DX-2930 administration, refer to the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative-free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90  mM sodium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open label vial contains a nominal concentration of 150 mg DX-2930 active ingred ient in 1  mL solution. 
For each 300 mg dose of DX-2930, each subject will receive a total of 2 mL (2 vials) , which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Self-Administration  
All s ubjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training by the investig ator or designee 
and demonstrating the comprehension to self -administer. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -
administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study site. Once initiated, 
subjects may continue to self- administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site 
(when visits are scheduled study site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study permits off- site dosing). See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent  
subjects self -administering investigational product will be supervised by a parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver. Alternatively, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training , will be allowed to administer DX -2930 to an adolescent without study site personnel 
supervision. Site personnel will call subjects after the planned self -administration to ensure the 
administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately documented.  Throughout the study, study site personnel will document information in the subject’s medical record and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self -administration and SC 
administration of DX-2930. 
5.2 Dosing and Follow- Up Scheme  
Details of subject dosing  and follow-up are outlined in Section 3.1.1 and included in the Study 
Activities Schedule, Appendix 1.  
Rollover subjects will receive their first open label SC dose of DX-2930 on Day 0.  Subjects will 
not receive any additional DX-2930 doses until their first reported HAE attack.  The second dose 
of DX-2930 may be administered at an unscheduled visit if it is outside of the accepted ±4 day 
window around a scheduled visit. Following this attack subjects will receive open label SC doses 
of DX-2930 every 2 weeks until the end of the treatment period. Subsequent dosing after Dose 2 
requires a minimum of 10 days and a maximum of 18 days between administrations. 
 
Page 49 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10 days between their first open -label dose and  their second open-label dose. Following their 
second dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -label 
300 mg DX -2930 every 2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment period per the 
scheduled dosing in the Study Activities Schedule. The treatment period will last 350 days from 
the date of the first open-label dose. The number of doses administered during this period will vary by subject based on the date of each subject’s second dose, but will not exceed 26  doses. 
The Day 350 study visit is the last visit at which a dose may be administered.  
Non-rollover subjects will receive their first open -label dose SC dose of DX-2930 on Day 0 and 
will continue to receive  SC administrations of open- label DX-2930 every 2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period.  A total of 26 doses will be administered with the last dose 
administered at the Day 350 study visit. 
After completion of the 350 day treatment period, all subjects will undergo safety evaluations during an 8-week follow-up period. 
5.3 Method of Identifying Subjects  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned a 
unique site-based identification number. 
5.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
For subjects not rolling over from DX-2930- 03, reasonable efforts will be made to determine all 
relevant treatmen ts received by the subject from 4 weeks prior to screening through the final 
study visit . For subjects rolling over from DX -2930-03, concomitant therapy use will be carried 
forward from that study and will continue to be collected through the final study visit.  
All information on prior and concomitant therapy (including all prescription/non-prescription 
medications, herbal medications and vitamin supplements) must be recorded on the subject’s eCRF and should include the name of the procedure or drug and duration of the treatment (start and stop dates). Concomitant treatments (non- pharmacological treatments) include any surgical 
or diagnostic procedures. 
5.4.1 Allow ed Therapies  
The following therapies are allowed during the study: 
• Therapies for co -existing conditions, including those for acute attacks of HAE, as described 
in Section 5.4.1.1 are permitted if not excluded in Section 5.4.2. The use of short- term 
prophylactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically indicated.  Short- term (pre-
procedure) prophylaxis is defined as use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema complic ations from 
medically indicated procedures.  
• Therapies to treat any AEs the subject experiences during the study are permitted.

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
5.4.1.1 Management of HAE Attacks  
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the i nvestigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapies that the investigator deems as 
medically appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therapy but not as a 
LTP therapy. Administration of DX -2930 and study procedures will continue w ithout alteration 
to the protocol- specified study schedule, even if the subject has symptoms of an HAE attack the 
day of DX- 2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack . The administration 
of DX -2930 can also be re- scheduled as long as t he minimum and maximum timeframe between 
doses are met based on patient preference or physician discretion.  
 
5.4.2 Excluded Concomitant Therapies  
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the study: 
• Long-term prophylaxis for HAE (e.g., use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or 
anti-fibrinolytics) once LTP is discontinued (within 3 weeks following first dose of 
DX-2930). 
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
• Initiat ing or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with systemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy)  3 months prior to the 
screening visit . 
• Use of androgens (e.g., stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methyltestosterone, testosterone) 
for non-HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation  during the first 
3 weeks. 
• Any other investigational drug or device. 
 
5.5 Restrictions  
5.5.1 Medical Interventions  
Medical interventions deemed necessary by the investigator for the health and w ell-being of the 
subject will not be excluded during this study. 
5.5.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
There are no restrictions on fluid and food intake. Subjects may continue their usual dietary 
regimens.  
5.5.3 Activity  
There are no activity restrictions. Subjects may continue their usual activity regimens.  
5.6 Treatment Compliance  
All doses of open- label DX-2930 administered at the investigational site will be under the direct 
supervision of the investigator or qualified study site personnel designated by the i nvestigator.  
 
Page 51 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at 
the study site. Once initiated, subjects may continue to self- administer subsequent doses of 
DX-2930 at the investigational site (when visits are schedule d study site visits) or the subject’s 
home or other agreed upon location (when the study permits off-site dosing). See Schedule of 
Activities for details. For all subjects, subsequent doses after the second dose require a minimum 
of 10 days and maximum of 18 days between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 day window around study visits.  
For rollover subjects, after the second DX-2930 dose is given either within the study window 
(±4 days) or an acceptable extra study visit, the 3
rd dose must be administered at the next pre-
defined study visit according to the schedule of assessments.  
5.7 Packaging and Labeling  
The open- label DX-2930 will be supplied by the Sponsor and prepackaged in a study kit for 
investigational studies. Each study kit will contain 1 vial of investigational product.  Both the 
vials and carton (kit) will be appropriately labeled according to local regulations and bear the unique study drug kit number. The investigative site will also be provided with ancillary supplies including syringes, needles, and alcohol wipes. The site has the option of using needles of a different gauge to aid subject comfort with each SC injection. Subjects who elect to self -
administer investigational product will be provided the following supplies as applicable: 
• 1 to 2 dose(s) supply of investigational product 
• Ancillary supplies, including syringes, needles, alcohol pads, a temperature monitoring device, and a container for sharps disposal 
• Transport container for investigational product 
• Subject accountability form to record investigational product storage conditions and 
administration details  
All used and unused vials should be returned to the study kit cartons/boxes and transported to the site for drug accountability.  Written instructions on DX -2930 handling and self-administration 
procedures will be provided to trained subjects prior to initiating self-administration.  Refer to 
the Pharmacy Manual for additional details on DX-2930 and its administration. 
 
5.8 Storage and Accountabilit y 
All DX-2930 will be shipped refrigerated to the study site and must be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC/36ºF 
to 46ºF in the carton and protected from light. Storage must be in a securely locked area, 
accessible to authorized persons only, until needed for dose preparation. See Section 5.7 and 
Section 6.15.1 for details.  
 
5.9 Investigational Medicinal Product Retention at Study Site  
The investigator (or designee) is responsible for maintaining accurate accountability records of 
DX-2930 throughout the clinical study. All DX-2930 received at the site must be inventoried and 
accounted for in an accountability log provided by the Sponsor. All dispensing and 
accountability records will be available for Sponsor review.  Drug accountability will be verified 
during on- site monitoring visits.

6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Please refer to the Study Activities Schedule, Appendix 1. 
6.1 Informed Consent  
The ICF must be executed prior to performing any study related activities and must be approved 
by the reviewing institutional review board (IRB),  research ethics board (REB) or independent 
ethics committee (IEC). Subjects may withdraw consent at any time. Participation in the study may be terminated at any time without the subject’s consent as determined by the investigator. 
Subjects who are not rolling over from the double-blind DX-2930-03 study will provide informed consent at Screening. Subjects who are rolling over from the double-blind DX-2930-03 study will provide consent after Day 168 of study DX-2930-03 and no later than the final DX-2930-03 Day 182 study visit. Upon completion of the final assessments, the subjects will be discharged from the double- blind study and will start participation in the OLE study and receive 
their first open -label dose.  
6.2 Eligibility Review  
The investigator or qualified study site personnel will confirm that all Inclusion and Exclusion 
criteria have been met.  
6.3 Demographics and Medical History   
Demographics: date of birth (alternately age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be collected for legal reasons), sex,  race and ethnicity (where locally permitted) and medical history will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from DX -2930-03 and will 
be recorded on the source document and eCRF. Medical history will capture the subject’s current medical status (current disease processes), past medical status (past disease processes), history of surgery, allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling over from DX-2930-03, these data will be carried forward from that study.  
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection  
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study will be done in accordance with the HAE Att ack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Study s ite personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site. 
Study site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying symptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to provide.  The patient (and caregiver ) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.  
At screening, HAE attack history will be collec ted for non-rollover subjects. Information 
collected will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, predominant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy use and history of LTP (including  duration of LTP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency of attacks

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (year of 
confirmation, how many years after onset of symptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject was misdiagnosed).  
During the study, subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify and report details to the study site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack. This includes the first attack experienced by rollover subjects followi ng their first open- label dose.  In the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by a family member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by the subject, memo ry aids can  be provided to assist in tracking any HAE attacks experienced.  
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an attack:  
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced  
• Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s) 
• Impact on activity (work, school, social interactions) and whether any assistance or 
medical intervention was required, including hospitalizations, additional laboratory tests, or emergency department visits 
• Any medi cations used to treat the attack  (both prescription and over the counter) 
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms 
Study s ite personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary to document the attack, as described in HAARP.  
For rollover subjects, study site personnel  will contact rollover subjects approximately every 
7 days following the first dose of open- label until the subject has received their second open 
label dose.  This is to insure accurate reporting  for any HAE attacks not already reported by the 
subject as required within 72 hours.  During each study visit, study site  personnel will solicit for 
any new HAE attack information that was not already provided to the site.  
In this study, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs.   All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, 
or causal relationship to DX-2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  Any AE 
reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or 
physician designee will review the event within 24 hours of initial notification and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack.   For all non- serious 
AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or physician designee will review the 
event within 3  days of initial notification and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it 
represented a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee 
may contact the subject to receive additional information.   Any subject-reported attack not 
confirmed by the investigator or physician designee must have an alternate AE diagnosis 
 
Page 55 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
recorded.  All subject -reported and investigator / physician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
Emergency department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital admissions 
will be captured. 
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary region 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swa llowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx 
 
Despite the presence of these symptoms, the investigator or physician designee may still 
clinically determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongly refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by symptoms that are not consistent with an HAE attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typical time course of an HAE attack, or there is a likely alternate etiology for the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household).  
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new symptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms. 
6.5 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed by the investigator or his/her qualified designee according  to the 
Study Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1) unless the subject has elected to self -administer for that 
visit. Routine vital sign assessments will be taken with the subject in the sitting or supine 
position after 5 minutes at rest and will include body temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and respiratory rate (RR). BP should be determined using the same arm and the same equipment for each assessment.  For subjects who rollover from DX -2930-03, vital signs 
taken during the f inal study visit in DX -2930-03 will serve as the Day 0 pre-dose vital signs in 
this study and will not be duplicated. 
6.6 Physical Examination  
A physical examination including height, weight and calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI) will 
be performed by the inv estigator or his/her qualified designee according to the Study Activities 
Schedule ( Appendix 1). The physical examination will be performed in accor dance with 
standards at the site.  
 
 
Page 56 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
For subjects who rollover from DX-2930-03, the physical exam taken during the final study visit 
in DX-2930- 03 will serve as the Day 0 pre-dose physical exam in this study and will not be 
duplicated. 
6.7 Electrocardiography ( ECG)  
A standard 12-lead ECG (single recording) will be performed according to the Study Activities 
Schedule ( Appendix 1). The date and time of each  ECG and its results will be documented in the 
source documents and eCRF. Electrocardiograms will be sent to a central reading vendor for assessment.  For subjects who rollover from DX-2930-03, the ECG taken during the final study visit in DX -2930-03 will serve as the Day 0 pre-dose ECG in this study and will not be 
duplicated. 
6.8 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.8.1 Laboratory Parameters 
Laboratory testing will be performed according to the Study Activities Schedule (Appendix 1).  
Laboratory testing includes general safety parameters (hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, and 
serum chemistry), pregnancy tests (in females of childbearing potential), C1-INH functional assay, C4 assay, C1q assay, PK sampling, PD sampling, and plasma anti-drug antibody testing. All laboratory tests will be performed using established and validated methods.  
When multiple sample collection types are performed at the same assessment time p oint, the 
samples will be drawn in the following order (depending on what sample types are to be 
collected at that time point): laboratory safety samples (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry), C1 -INH, C4, C1q, PK, anti-drug antibodies , PD. Aliquots from the PK, PD and anti-
drug antibody samples may be retained as back- up for additional parameter testing if necessary. 
Subjects will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. The total blood draw for each rollover subject will be approxima tely 269.8 mL. The total blood draw for each non roll-
over subject will be approximately 283 mL. For subjects who rollover from DX-2930-03, testing 
performed during the final study visit in DX-2930- 03 will serve as the Day 0 pre- dose laboratory 
testing in this study and will not be duplicated.

Urinalysis does not need to be done as part of the clinical laboratory testing at Visits 14, 17, 20, 
and 23. 
6.8.1.5 Pregnancy Test  
Pregnancy tests will be either serum or urine  based.  
6.8.1.6 C1-INH Functional Assay  
Results of a C1 -INH functional assay are required for eligibility assessment. Samples will be 
drawn at the Screening visit unless they were previously drawn in study DX-2930-02 or 
DX-2930-03. Results of the C1-INH functional assay from DX -2930-02 or DX-2930-03 may be 
used to confirm diagnosis in this study. Subjects may be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history or believed by the investigator to be confounded by recent LTP use. 
6.8.1.7 C4 Assay  
Results of a C4 assay may be required for eligibility assessment.  The C4 sample will be drawn at the same time as the C1 -INH sample is drawn during the Screening visit unless previously 
drawn in study DX-2930-02 or DX-2930-03.  Results of the C4 assay from DX-2930-02 or DX-2930-03 may be used to confirm diagnosis in this study.  Subjects may be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history or believed by the investigator to be confounded by recent 
LTP use.  
6.8.1.8 C1q Assay  
Results of a C1q assay may be required for eligibility assessment. Any subject who requires C1-INH and C4 assay results for diagnostic confirmation in this study will have C1q assay 
results obtained as well.  The C1q sample will be drawn at the same time as the C1 and C4 sample is drawn during the Screening visit.  
6.8.1.9 PK Sample Collection  
As outlined in Section 6.9 . 
6.8.1.10 PD Sample Collection

designated and/or approved by the study investigator. Details for the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples for all laboratory determinations will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
 
Page 59 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
Biological material will be stored and secured in a manner that assures that unauthorized access 
is prohibited and the samples are not lost, allowed to deteriorate, or accidentally or illegally destroyed. 
6.9 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for the measurement of plasma DX -2930 concentration will be obtained as 
specified in the Study Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1). 
6.10 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
To evaluate the PD effects of DX -2930 upon plasma kallikrein activity, blood samples will be 
obtained as specified in the Study Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1). 
6.11 Plasma Anti -Drug Antibody Testing  
Plasma samples for testing for formation of antibodies to DX-2930 will be obtained as specified 
in the Study Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1). 
6.12 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
The Sponsor representatives and i nvestigator at the site conducting the trial will review and 
evaluate prior (4 weeks prior to st udy screening) and concomitant medication usage on an 
ongoing basis. For subjects not rolling over from DX-2930-03, all prescription, over- the-counter 
medications, herbals, and supplements that are being taken or have been taken by subjects from the time o f screening through the duration of the study will be regarded as concomitant 
medications and must be documented on the source document and eCRF following informed consent.  For subjects rolling over from DX-2930-03, concomitant therapy use will be carried  
forward from that study and will continue to be collected through the duration of the study.  
6.13 Investigational Medicinal Product Treatment  
Instructions for safe handling of DX -2930, preparation of each subcutaneous dose and 
administration of DX-2930, are p rovided in the Pharmacy Manual. Preparation and dispensing of 
DX-2930 will be handled by qualified study sit e personnel or by subjects who are self -
administering after receiving appropriate training by the i nvestigator  or designee  at the study site. 
The requirements for maintaining DX -2930 accountability are provided in Section  6.15.1(for 
subjects self -administering) and Section 5.7 and Section 5.8 of this protocol. 
6.14 Quality of Life Assessments  
Quality of life (QoL ) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality of Life 
Questionnaire ( AE-QoL), EuroQoL 5-Dimensional 5- Level Measure (EQ-5D-5L), Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI- GH),  Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and  12 Item Short Form Survey (SF-12). See  Study 
Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1). For subjects who rollover from DX-2930-03, quality of life 
assessments obtained during the final study visit in DX-2930- 03 will serve as the Day 0 pre-dose 
quality of life assessments in th is study and will not be duplicated.

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
6.14.1 Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE -QoL)  
The AE -QoL is a self -administered, symptom -specific tool developed and validated to assess 
quality of life (QoL) impairment in recurrent angioedema patients (Weller et al.  2012 ). The AE -
QoL consists of 17 questions covering four domains/dimensions (functioning, fatigue/mood, 
fear/shame, nutrition). Each of the 17 items has a five- point Likert -type response scale ranging 
from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Of ten). The AE- QoL is scored to produce a score for each domain and 
a total score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger impairment. It takes 5 minutes to complete the AE -QoL.  
6.14.2 EuroQoL 5 -Diminsional 5 -Level Measure ( EQ-5D-5L) 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered standardized measure of health status comprised of a 
descriptive system and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive system consists of five health related quality of life dimensions (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activit ies, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is rated on a 5- point response scale 
(5 levels) indicating severity of problems, where 1 is “no problems” and 5 is “extreme 
problems”. The EQ- 5D VAS is a measure of overall self -rated health sta tus on a 20- cm vertical 
VAS with endpoints labelled “the best health you can imagine” and “the worst health you can imagine”. The VAS ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better overall health. 
6.14.3 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI -GH)  
Questionnaire  
The WPAI -GH is a 6 -item instrument assessing work and activity impairment due to health 
problems during the past 7 days. The instrument elicits four main scores in relation to general 
health specifically: absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one's health in 
the past seven days), presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced while at work in the past seven days because of one's health), overall work productivity loss (an overall impairment  estimate that is a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity 
impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activities because of one's health in the past 
seven days ) (Reilly et al.  1993).  
6.14.4 Hospital Anxiety and D epression Scale (HADS)  
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self -assessment scale to detect states of 
depression, anxiety and emotional distress amongst patients who were being treated for a variety 
of clinical problems ( Zigmond and Snaith 1983 ). The scale has a total of 14 items. Seven of the 
items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.  The responses are scored on a scale of 0 –3 
(3 indicates higher symptom frequencies). Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0–7, mild 8–10, moderate 11–14, and severe 15 –21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher 
scores indicating more distress. This scale ref lects how a patient has been feeling during the past 
week.  
 
6.14.5 12 Item Short Form v2 Health Survey (SF-12v2) 
The SF-12v2 Health Survey is a reliable and valid generic measure of functional health and well-
being. The SF-12v2 consists of 12 questions, all selected from the SF -36 Health Survey ( Ware  et 
al. 1996). The SF-12v2 yields eight health domains (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain,

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, and m ental 
health summary measures. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) can be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. The standard form of the instrument asks patients to reply to questions according to how they have felt over the last 4 weeks.  
6.15 DX-2930 Injection Report and Self -Administration and Subcutaneous  Injection 
Survey  
Assessments of subject experience with self -administration and SC injections of DX-2930 will 
be conducted. 6.15.1 DX-2930 Injection Report 
The investigator or designee will train subjects who elect to self -administer DX -2930 on the 
following: 
• Transportation and recommended storage conditions of investigational product from the 
study site to the home location. 
• Maintenance of accurate records regarding each administration of investigational product including supply identification (ie, lot/kit number), date and time of injection, injection 
site location, infusion time, and if applicable, any reason the self-administration  could not 
be completed as instructed.  
• Retention of all used and unused vials of investigational product for drug accountability 
purposes.
  
After receiving appropriate training and demonstrating their understanding of self-administration, subjects are allowed to self -administer DX -2930 after receiving the first 2 doses 
of DX -2930 at the study site (administered by study personnel). For those s ubjects who choose to 
self-administer or have a parent/legal guardian/caregiver administer DX -2930, subjects must 
complete an assessment of their experience with self -administration  and subcutaneous injection 
for each dose received . Study personnel will do cument the subject’s responses in the subjects’ 
medical record and eCRF.  
6.15.2 DX-2930 Self- administration and Subcutaneous Injection Survey  
Subjects will complete an assessment on  their overall experience with self -administration and 
experience with receiving SC injections of DX-2930 approximately every 6 months  during the 
study. For subjects who have previously received LTP with C1 -INH products via IV 
administration, they will be asked to indicate the preferred route for medication administration. Study personnel will document the subject’s responses in the subjects’ medical record and eCRF. 
In addition, investigators will be asked to indicate their preference (SC, IV, or no preference) on 
the route to administer medications to prevent angioedema attacks.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
6.16 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events will be collected from signing of the informed consent through the last study 
visit.  
6.16.1 Definitions  
6.16.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject whether or not it appears to have a causal relationship with the treatment administered.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or participation in a clinic al study, whether or not directly related to the medicinal product or study 
participation.  
• AEs may be new events or may be pre-existing conditions that have become aggravated or 
have worsened in severity or frequency during the course of the study. 
• AEs may  be clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory 
tests, or other diagnostic investigation (e.g., laboratory results, x-ray findings). 
Laboratory abnormalities generally are not considered AEs unless they are associated w ith 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinically significant laboratory 
abnormality that is independent from a known underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-2930 interruption or discontinuation, will in 
itself, be considered an AE. Laboratory or diagnostic testing abnormalities that reflect or are part of a known underlying medical condition are not, in themselves, AEs; rather, the underlying medical condition leading to th e abnormalities would be reported as the AE.  
Pregnancy is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of the study, the investigator must notify the Sponsor according to the procedures provided in Section 6.16.5.2. 
6.16.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalization; Note: Does not 
include hospitalization for observation with release within 24 hours. A scheduled hospitalization for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened during participation in the study does not meet this criterion. Pre- planned hospitalizations for an elective 
medical/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion. 
 
Page 63 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
 
6.16.1.3 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a 
product. The dosing for this study will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and an overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study, an overdose of DX-2930 is considered a dose that is two -fold higher than the intended dose for the subject. 
6.16.1.4 Planned Hospitalization  
A hospitalization planned by the subject prior to the first dose of open- label DX-2930 is 
considered a therapeu tic intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as 
medical history. If the planned hospitalization or procedure is executed as planned, the record in the subject’s medical history is considered complete. However, if the event/condition worsens during the trial, it must be reported as an AE. 
6.16.1.5 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)  
An AE is treatment- emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open -label DX-2930 
through the final follow-up visit or, in the event that onset time precedes first DX-2930 
administration, the AE increases in severity during the open- label treatment period.  
For rollover subjects, any adverse event that started during the subject’s participation in 
DX-2930-03 and was ongoing at the time of the first open -label dose in DX -2930-04 will not be 
counted as an AE in DX-2930-04 unless that event has worsened in severity or frequency following the first open -label dose.  Adverse events that started during subject participation in 
DX-2930-03, resolved fo llowing the first open -label dose in DX -2930-04, and then subsequently 
reappeared in DX-2930-04 will be counted as a new TEAE in DX-2930-04. 
6.16.1.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study. 
Investigators will report all AESI to the Sponsor , regardless of causality, using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting.  The following describe the AESI and the criteria for 
reporting AESI.  H
YPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS  
As hypersensitivity reactions have been observed for monoclonal antibodies as a class, these 
events are considered AESI for this study. Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with hypersensitivity reactions, regardless of causality, within 24 hours from the time of study drug administration. Investigators will report hypersensitivity reactions that occur after 24 hours, only if the reactions are suspect ed to be related to study drug.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION  
Bleeding AESI 
Although aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro  
phenomenon, as a precautionary measure in evaluating the safety of DX-2930, bleeding events 
will be reported as AESI for this study. Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event of bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and when temporally reasonable, with any reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly indicative of bleeding. 
Hypercoagulable AESI 
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and symptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent with a thrombotic or embolic etiology.  
6.16.2 Monitoring  
6.16.2.1 Monitoring of Adverse Events 
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow-up visit. 
• Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by the investigator or a qualified designee for 
evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence of AEs 
will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  The presence or absence of specific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.  
• Subjects having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory tests, as determined by the investigator. 
• AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow- up results must be recorded in the eCRF as 
well as in the subject's source documentation. Follow-up laboratory results should be filed 
with the subject's source documentation. 
 For any SAEs or AEs that requ ire the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests will be repeated as clinically appropriate, until final resolution or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all scheduled visits.  
6.16.2.2 Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments 
All safety laboratory assessments will be performed at a central laboratory. The clinical laboratory values will be reported to the i nvestigator who will review them for clinical 
signifi cance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AEs.

6.16.3 Assessment of Adverse Events 
6.16.3.1 Assessment of Severity  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction ); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  
In this study, the severity of AEs will be assessed according to Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National Institutes of Health: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 2) and the 
Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric Toxicity Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National Institutes of Health: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3). For abnormalities not specifically found in the Toxicity Tables, the 
following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severity:  
• GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention/therapy required  
• GRADE 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
• GRADE 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospitalizations possible  
• GRADE 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme  limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable  
 
Any treatment-emergent ECG abnormality that is considered by the i nvestigator as clinically 
significant a nd requiring intervention/therapy will be assessed as a severe AE.  
6.16.3.2 Assessment of Causality  
A medically qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of DX-2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available information, and may include consideration of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre-existing conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environme ntal or genetic factors.  
• The temporal association between DX-2930 exposure and onset of the AE. 
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of 
DX-2930. 
• The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping use of DX-2930 (dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.  
 The causal relationship between DX-2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories: 
 
Page 66 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
Not Related:  Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:  
• Temporal relationship is lacking (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of DX-2930 ); or 
• Other causative factors more likely explain the event (e.g., a pre -existing 
condition, other concomitant treatments). 
Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Related include:  
• There is a positive temporal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time frame following administration of DX-2930); or 
• The AE  is more likely explained by administration of DX-2930 than by another 
cause (i.e., the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of 
DX-2930 or the class of DX-2930).  
6.16.3.3 Assessment of Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined by the investigator, with discussion 
with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.  
6.16.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Laboratory abnormalities generally are not considered AEs unless they are associated  with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality that is independent from a known underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-2930 interru ption or discontinuation, will be 
considered an AE. 
When laboratory abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMID Pediatric Toxicity Tables (Appendix 3) will be used to assess severity. 
Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lowe r limit of normal (LLN) of 
laboratory ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of the laboratory that performs the assays, the values provided by the laboratory will be used for assignment of severity grade. Clinical significance of  individual laboratory AEs will be determined by the 
investigator with input from the Medical Monitor as needed.  
Following is an exception to defining clinically significant, abnormal laboratory values as AEs: 
• APTT prolongation in the absence of any assoc iated bleeding or other evidence of clinical 
relevance will not be considered a clinically significant laboratory abnormality or AE. In the 
appropriate physiologic setting, such as IV heparin therapy, aPTT can be used to monitor bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro  phenomenon. Although plasma kallikrein 
drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay, plasma kallikrein-driven coagulation does not appear to have hemostatic or other physiologically important functions in vivo . It is well 
documented that, in humans, deficiency of factor XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgi cal 
procedures ( Renne and Gruber, 2012) . Despite the lack of clinical effect, deficiency of either 
protein is associated w ith marked prolongation of the aPTT.

6.16.5 Reporting Investigator Safety Observations to the Sponsor 
6.16.5.1 Reporting Non- serious Adverse Events  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or causal relationship to DX-2930, will be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF. In this study all HAE attacks reported by the subject, regardless of 
whether or not they are confirmed by the i nvestigator, will be captured as AEs.  
6.16.5.2 Reporting Pregnancies  
If a female subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant du ring the course of 
the study, the investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department using the Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event. The i nvestigator must obtain consent to collect pregna ncy information (including the 
status of the newborn, if applicable). 
If some of the information required for completion of the Pregnancy Reporting Form is 
unavailable at the time of the initial report, follow -up reports will be completed and submitted 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new information. The i nvestigator is required to 
follow the pregnancy through delivery. The outcome of the pregnancy and the status of the newborn (if applicable) will be reported on the Pregnancy Reporting Form within  24 hours of 
becoming aware.  
6.16.5.3 Safety Observations Requiring Expedited Reporting by the Investigator to 
the Sponsor  
Any occurrence of the following events or outcomes in a subject in the trial must be reported expeditiously by the i nvestigator or qualified d esignee to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department:  
• SAE  
• AESI  
• Overdose 
• Cancer  
 The investigator is to report any expedited safety observations from the list above to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
Any SAE reported to the Sponsor Pharmacovigilance Department using the SAE Reporting 
Form in the EDC system is to be recorded in the eCRF, as well as in the subject's source documentation along with any actions taken. If all required information on the form is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up information will be completed in the EDC 
system.  
The investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the subjects 
are still participating in the study. SAE resolution is defined as: 
• Resolved with or without residual effects.  
 
Page 68 of 151

• A return to baseline for a pre-existing condition. 
• Laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilized.  
• The investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event. 
• Fatal outcome—if an autopsy is performed; the autopsy report is requested to be provided to 
the sponsor as soon as it is available.  
 
6.16.5.4 Expedited Reporting by the Sponsor to a Regulatory Health Authority

is both serious and unexpected, or any finding that suggests a significant risk for subjects. The investigator will promptly inform his / her IRB/REB/IEC of the notification and insert the 
notification in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder in accordance with local regulations.  
6.17 Subject Withdrawal  
The investigator may withdraw a subject from DX-2930 treatment for any of the following 
reasons:  
• In the opinion of the i nvestigator, the subject is unable to comply with the requirements of 
the protocol for satisfactory completion or interpretation of study results (including use of prohibitive medications) , 
 
Page 69 of 151

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
• A serious or intolerable AE occurs,  
• A clinically significant change in a laboratory parameter occurs,  
• The Sponsor or investigator terminates the study, or 
• The subject requests to be discontinued from the study. 
 
Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all scheduled visits, unless the subject requests to be discontinued from the study. 
6.18 Appropriateness of Measurements  
This is a Phase 3 open -label extension study that is designed to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of DX -2930 in prophylactic therapy for angioedema attacks in subjects with HAE. 
DX-2930 is a recombinant, fully human IgG1, kappa light chain, monoclonal antibody. The 
open- label, non-controlled study design is a standard approach for extension studies that follow 
double-blind pivotal trials. Measures employed in this protocol are standard measures routinely used for the evaluation of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of an investigational product.  Measures employed for rollover subjects between the first and second open -label doses are 
appropriate to characterize the outer bounds of dosing frequency for DX-2930.

treatment at every dosing visit as outlined in the Study Activities Schedule. 
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they will present to the investigative site 
for their second open-label dose of DX-2930 as quickly as subject and site schedules allow.  This 
treatment visit may be counted as a scheduled study visit, or as an acceptable extra study visit.  For details on determining whether the second dose is counted as a scheduled or extra study visit, 
refer to Section 3.1.1.  Regardless of wh en the second dose is administered, the following tests 
and assessments will be conducted pre-dose on the day it is administered:

9. DATA ANALYSIS / STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General  Considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
North Carolina, USA). 
For categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects within each category (with a 
category for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values will be presented. Where applicable, estimates from statistical model of least squares means, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals for least squares means will be provided. Time- to-event data will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estimates of the 25th, 50th 
(median), and 75th percentiles with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals , as well as 
percentage of censored observations. Plots of the Kaplan -Meier curves and supporting data 
listings detailing each subject’s contribution to the analysis will be provided.  
Formal hypothesis testing will not be performed.  Any hypothesis testing will be exploratory in nature and resulting p- values will be considered descriptive.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on any 
statistical considerations.  This study is designed  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of open -label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in DX-2930-03 (rollover subjects) and 
individuals who were not otherwise able to participate in DX-2930-03 ( non-rollover subjects) . 
9.3 Method of Assigning Study Subjects to Treatment  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned a 
unique site-based identification number. 
9.4 Analysis Populations  
9.4.1 Safety Population 
The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any study drug after entering the 
DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to open- label DX -2930).   Unless otherwise specified, 
summary tabulations conducted with the Safety Population will be presented by the subject’s 
study entry type (rollover or non-rollover) and overall. 
9.4.2 Rollover Safety Population  
The Rollover Safety Population is the subset of subjects who participated in the DX-2930-03 
study and received any study drug after entering the DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to open- label DX -2930). Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations conducted with the 
Rollover Safety Population will be presented by the subject’s prior treatment group from the DX-2930-03 study (DX-2930 300 mg every 2 weeks, DX-2930 300 mg every 4 weeks, DX-2930 150 mg every 4 weeks, and Placebo).

The Non-rollover Safety Population is the subset of subjects who entered the DX-2930-04 study 
directly and received any study drug after entering the DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to open- label DX -2930).  Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations conducted with the 
Non-rollover Safety Population will be presented by subject’s prior type of LTP therapy prior to 
study entry (C1-INH, Androgens, Anti-fibrinolytics, and Not on LTP). 
9.5 Population Description and Exposure  
9.5.1 Subject Disposition  
The numbers of subjects treated with study drug, completed the study and discontinued 
prematurely by reason will be summarized for each analysis population. 
9.5.2 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline and demographic variables will be summarized for each analysis population.  
9.5.3 Medical History  
Medical history will be coded using Medical Dictionary for R egulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
and summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each analysis 
population. 
9.5.4 Treatment Exposure and Compliance  
Treatment compliance and the extent of exposure to study drug will be described by the 
percentage of planned doses received by the subject, total number of doses received by the subject, and the number and percentage of subjects that received at least 80% of planned doses, summarized for each analysis population.  
9.5.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Con
comitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD) .  The number and percentage of subjects with prior or concomitant medications will be 
summarized by therapeutic class and preferred term for each analysis population.  A separate, 
similar table will be provided for the subset of concomitant medications  classified as rescue 
medications.  
9.6 Analysis of Efficacy  
9.6.1 Time to the First Investigator -confirmed HAE Attack  
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack will be analyzed using the Rollover Safety Population. 
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack (days) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -2930 to the date and time of the first investigator-
confirmed HAE attack after the first open -label dose.  Subjects who discontinue the study prior 
to experienci ng their first on -study investigator -confirmed HAE attack will be censored at the 
 
Page 93 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
date and time of study discontinuation.  Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack will 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods. 
Multivariate and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be employed to 
examine the impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering DX -2930-03, the 
treatment group in DX-2930-03, the time since the last dose given in DX-2930-03, the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during DX-2930-03. Results of this exploratory analysis will be summarized.   
9.6.2 Number of Investigator- confirmed HAE Attacks  
The number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 through 
Day 350) expressed  as a monthly HAE attack rate, will be analyzed using each analysis 
population. 
The treatment period investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the treatment period 
divided by the number of days the subject contributed to the treatment period multiplied by 28 days.   
The baseline investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject as the 
number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the pretreatment period for 
rollover subjects or historical report ing period for non-rollover subjects divided by the number of 
days the subject contributed to the pretreatment period for rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non-rollovers multiplied by 28 days. 
The baseline, treatment period, and treatment period change from baseline in the investigator-
confirmed HAE attack rate will be summarized for each analysis population. The summary will include the total number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks reported during each period and subject- time in mon ths that each subject contributed to each period. Figures will be created for 
each analysis population plotting the on-study investigator- confirmed HAE attacks reported 
during the treatment period relative to Day 0 for each subject. 
In addition, the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month (defined as 28 days) 
will be summarized descriptively by month (per 28 day interval) for each analysis population. The summary will include the number, change from baseline, and percent change from baseline of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks. Investigator-confirmed HAE attacks will be grouped into 28-day intervals using the start date of the HAE attack. The date of the first exposure to study drug in this study will be used as the start of the first interv al and end of the interval will be the 
date of first exposure to study drug in this study plus 28 days. Each successive interval will start the last day of the prior interval plus 1 day and end 28 days later.  
Similar summary tables will be presented for the following efficacy endpoints for each analysis 
population: 
• Number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.  
 
Page 94 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 95 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
• Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period. 
• Number of high-morbidity investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high-morbidity HAE attack is defined as any attack that has at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation < 24 
hours), hemodynamically significant (systolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hydration, or associated with syncope or near -syncope) or laryngeal. 
 
9.7 Analysis of Safety  
9.7.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary.  Separate summaries will be 
presented for each analysis population.  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open- label DX -2930 in this study, or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment. For AEs with partial onset times, non -missing date parts will be used to determine if 
the AE is treatment -emergent or not.  If a determin ation cannot be made using the non-missing 
date parts as to when the AE occurred relative to study drug administration, then the AE will be classified as treatment -emergent.   
The analyses described in this section will be based on treatment -emergent AEs; plainly referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevity.    Related AEs are AEs classified as related to study drug by the investigator.  Severe AEs are AEs classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) by the investigator.  
 For this analysis, AEs will be classified to one of three analysis periods:  
• Pretreatment Period AEs will include AEs starting at or after informed consent to those 
starting before the first exposure to open- label DX -2930 in this study (AEs starting prior to 
treatment on D ay 0).  This analysis period is only applicable for the Non-rollover Safety 
Population in this study.  
• Treatment Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the first exposure to open -label 
DX-2930 in this study to those starting before or at the subject’s last visit date during the 
treatment period in this study (AEs starting at or after treatment on Day 0 to the Day 350 
visit).  
• Follow-up Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the subject’s last visit date of 
the treatment period in  this study (AEs starting after the Day 350 visit).  
 
Page 95 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 96 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
For AEs with partial onset times, non -missing date parts will be used to determine if the AE falls 
within the period. If a determination cannot be made using the non- missing date parts as to if the 
AE fa lls within the period, the AE will be conservatively counted as a treatment-period AE.  
 
The number and percentage of subjects with any AE, any related AE, any SAE, any related SAE,  any severe AE,  and any related severe AE will as well as the total number of events for each 
category will be summarized  for each analysis period .  The number of deaths due to an AE, 
hospitalization due to an AE and study discontinuation due to an AE will be summarized for each analysis period .  
 The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be summarized by SOC, and PT for each analysis period. This tabulation will be repeated for related AEs, SAEs, related SAEs, severe AEs, and related severe AEs for treatment period and follo w-up period AEs.  
 The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be summarized for treatment period AEs only. This tabulation will be repeated for related AEs and serious AEs for treatment period AEs.  
 All AEs will be provided in subject listings. Listings will be presented separately for each 
analysis period.  In addition, subject listings of AEs causing discontinuation of study medication, AEs leading to death, SAEs, related AEs, severe AEs, and AEs of special  interest (AESIs) will 
be produced.   Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study are hypersensitivity reactions and disordered coagulation (hypercoagulability events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQ) for each AESI will be performed using the study data. 
The number and percentage 
of subjects with an AESI, as well as the total number of AESIs, will be summarized by SOC and PT 
for each analysis period. Separate summary tables will be created for each AESI and for those 
events with the SMQs classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and related severe.  A 
listing detailing the PT within the SMQ will be provided.  
9.7.2 Laboratory Test Results 
Laboratory test results will be summarized using the Safety Population. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value prior to the first exposure to DX- 2930. For rollover 
subjects previously exposed to DX-2930, baseline is the last non-missing value prior to first exposure 
to study drug in the DX-2930-03 study.         
Actual values and change from baseline clinical laboratory tests will be summarized by study 
visit. If more than one laboratory result is reported per study visit per parameter, the last non-missing 
result will be selected for analysis   
Laboratory test result s will be classified according to the reference ranges and clinical significance as 
determined by the investigator. The number of subjects with a non-missing result, and the number 
and percentage of subjects with a clinically significant result less than the lower limit of normal, non-
clinically significant result less than the lower limit of normal, within the normal range, non-
 
Page 96 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 97 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
clinically significant result more than the upper limit of normal, and clinically significant result more 
than the upper limit of normal will be summarized by study visit. If more than one laboratory result is 
reported per study visit per parameter, the result yielding the most severe classification will be 
selected for analysis.  
Categorical laboratory test results (urinalysis excluding pH) will be summarized by study visit. If more than one laboratory result is reported per study visit per parameter, the result yielding the most severe classification will be selected for analysis.  
 Subjects with clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results will be listed.  This listing will 
include all results of the laboratory parameter that was abnormal and determined to be clinically 
significant by the investigator for a subject across study visit to identify any trends.  
9.7.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be summarized using the Safety Population. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value prior to the first exposure to DX- 2930. For rollover 
subjects previously exposed to DX-2930, baseline is the last non-missing value prior to first exposure 
to study drug in the DX-2930-03 study. 
 
Actual values and changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by study visit and 
study time point. All vital sign data will be presented in subject listings.  
 
Vital sign values will be classified according to clinical significance as determined by the 
investigator. The number of subjects with a non-missing result, and the number and percentage of subjects with a non-clinically significant result and clinically significant result will be summarized  by 
study visit and study time point. If more than one vital sign result is reported per study visit and study time point per parameter, the result yielding the most severe classification will be selected for 
analysis.  
Subjects with clinically significant vital sign values will be listed.  This listing will include all results 
of the vital sign parameter that was determined by the investigator to be clinically significant for a 
subject across study time points to identify any trends.
 
9.7.4 Electrocardiography  
Electrocardiography results will be summarized using the Safety Population. 
 The number and percentage of subjects with normal, abnormal not clinically significant, and abnormal clinically significant ECG results, or ECG no performed, will be summarized by  study 
visit. Subjects with clinically significant ECG results will be listed.  This listing will include all results for a subject across study time points to identify any trends. 
9.8 Other Analyses  
Additional analyses of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodyna mic (PD) data will be described 
in a separate PK/PD report.  
Additional analysis of quality of life (QoL) data will be described in a separate QoL report.

9.8.1 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data 
Plasma concentrations of DX -2930 will be summarized by nominal PK sampling time using the 
Safety Population.  
9.8.2 Analysis of Pharmacodynamic Data 
Plasma kallikrein activity will be summarized by nominal PD sampling time using the Safety 
Population. 
9.8.3 Analysis of Immunogenicity Data  
The number and percentage of positive antibodies will be summarized by study visit and overall 
using the Safety Population.  
9.8.4 Analysis of Quality of Life Assessments  
Quality of life assessments will be summarized using the Safety Population.  
 
The number and percentage of subjects at each level of the E Q-5D-5L dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) will be summarized by study 
visit. In addition, the VAS score for the subject’s self -rated health will be summarized by study 
visit.   
 The responses to the SF-12 for each item will be tabulated by study visit using the Safety Population.  In addition, Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) will be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indic ates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of 
health.  Responses to the HADS for each item will be tabulated by study visit. In addition, continuous and categorical (0 -7: normal , 8-10: mild , 11-14: moderate, 15 -21: severe ) total scores based on 
the items related to depression and anxiety, will be summarized by study visit.  Each item in the 
questionnaire is scored from 0 -3, with total scores between 0-21 for either depression or anxiety.  
Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) will also be presented.  Total score for the entire scale range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.  Responses to the WPAI -GH for each item will be summarized by study visit.  In addition, four 
main scores in relation to general health will be summarized by study visit. Scores will be 
calculated as absenteeism (percentage work time missed due to health), presenteeism (percent 
impairment while working due to health), work productivity loss ( percent overall w ork 
impairment due to health) , and activity impairment (percent activity impairment due to health).  
The scores are percentages with higher values indicating  greater percentage impairment.   Only 
respondents who report being full- time or part-time employed provide data for absenteeism, 
presenteeism, and overall work productivity loss.  All respondents provide data for activity impairment.    
 Responses to the AE -QoL for each item will be tabulated by study visit.  In addition, the domain 
scores (functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, nutrition) and total score will be summarized by 
 
Page 98 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 99 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
study visit. Each item in the questionnaire is scored from 0 -4, with domain and total scores 
calculated using a linear transformation to a 0 -100 scale.  
 
9.9 Statistical/Analytic Considerations 
9.9.1 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
A formal interim analysis will be conducted when at least 35 subjects have completed 12 months 
of consecutive exposure to DX-2930 across the combined DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 studies, 
and only after database lock of the DX-2930-03 study.  Subsequent interim analyses may be conducted to support  administrative decisions and/or regulatory reporting as required.   
 An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safety data for the DX-2930-03 study. While 
an independent DSMB is not currently planned for this study, summary safety data from DX-2930-04 may be reviewed by the DSMB established for the DX -2930-03 study as part of the 
collection of safety information available on DX-2930.  
9.9.2 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed.  Any statistical testing will be 
considered exploratory. 
9.9.3 Handling of Missing Data  
All ava ilable data will be included in the analysis.  No imputation of missing data will be 
performed. 9.9.4 Adjustment for Covariates 
The impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE attack  will 
be explored to identify and assess the importance of potential prognostic factors. 9.9.5 Multicenter Studies  
Data from all study sites that participate in this protocol will be combined so that an adequate 
number of subjects will be available for analysis.  
9.9.6 Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses are planned for the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the 
treatment period and adverse events using the Safety Population.  
The following subgroups will be used: 
• Age Group (<18, 18 to <40, 40 to <65, ≥65 years) 
• Sex (Male, Female)  
• Race Group (White, Other)  
• Weight Group (<50, 50 to <75, 75 to <100, ≥100 kg) 
 
Page 99 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 100 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
• BMI Group (<18.5, 18.5 to <25, 25 to <30, ≥30 kg/m2) 
• Baseline HAE Attack Rate (1 to <2, 2 to <3, ≥3 attacks/month) 
• HAE Type (Type I, Type II, Unspecified) 
• Geographic Region (US, Canada, Jordan, Europe) 
• DX-2930 Administration Type (Health Care Provider, Self -administration) 
 
9.9.7 Sensitivity Analyses  
The following sensitivity analyses will be performed on the number of investigator-confirmed 
HAE attacks during the treatment period for each analysis population to evaluate the robustness of the results. Data summaries will parallel those described for th e number of investigator-
confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period efficacy endpoint.   
1. The analysis will be repeated counting HAE attacks occurring on Day 14 after administration 
of study drug through Day 350, instead of Day 0 to Day 350.  For this analysis, the period of 
analysis would be a subset of the treatment period, defined as Day 14 to Day 350. 
2. The analysis will be repeated counting HAE attacks occurring on Day 7 after administration 
of study drug through Day 350, instead of Day 0 to Day 350. For this analysis, the period of 
analysis would be a subset of the treatment period, defined as Day 7 to Day 350. 
3. The analysis will be repeated using all subject reported HAE attacks instead  of limiting the 
analysis to those attacks that were investigat or-confirmed.

be documented in a letter from the IRB/REB/IEC. The investigator must provide notification to 
the IRB/REB/IEC of th e completion, termination or discontinuation of the study. 
10.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The procedures set out in this clinical study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and 
the investigator abide by the principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on GCP, applicable local regulatory requirements, and the Declaration of Helsinki (Version 2008). The clinical study also will be carried out in keeping with national and local legal requirements [in accordance with Un ited States Investigational New Drug (IND) 
regulations (21 CFR 56)].
 
10.3 Subject Information and Consent  
Before each subject is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. As part of this 
procedure, the investigator must explain orally and in writing the nature, duration, and purpose of the study, and the action of the drug in such a manner that the study subject is aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or AEs that may occur. The study subject should be informed that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. He/she will receive all information that is required by federal regulations and ICH guidelines. Subjects who are under the age of 18 (or lower if age of consent is less than 18 in a specific country) and whose legal guardian or caretaker has provided written informed consent will provide their assent to participate. The investigator or designee will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/REB/IEC -approved 
informed consent form prior to the start of the study. 
10.4 Subject Confidentiality  
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be specified on study 
documents by their subject number, initial or birth date (if allowed based on local data protection regulations), not by name. Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the signed informed consent document) must be maintained in confidence by the investigator. 
The investigator agrees not to use or disclose protected health information other than as 
permitted or required by the subject authorization or as required by law. 
10.5 Study Monitoring  
The Sponsor (or designee) will conduct a study initiation visit to verify the qualifications of the 
investigator, inspect the facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures 
for ensuring adequate  and correct documentation. 
The investigator must prepare and maintain adequate and accurate records of all observations 
and other data pertinent to the clinical study for each study participant. Frequent communication between the clinical site and the Spo nsor is essential to ensure that the safety of the study is 
monitored adequately. The i nvestigator will make all appropriate safety assessments on an 
ongoing basis. The Medical Monitor may review safety information as it becomes available throughout the st udy.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored with respect to GCP and SOPs for 
compliance with applicable government regulations. The Study Monitor will be an authorized individual designated by the Sponsor. The Study Monitor will have access t o all records 
necessary to ensure integrity of the data and will periodically review the progress of the study with the investigator.  
10.6 Case Report Forms and Study Records 
The investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data re ported to 
the Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of all data changes. The investigator or designee will cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) 
for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit. 
Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to  identify any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the clinical sites by means of 
electronic or manual queries. 
The investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents 
(medical rec ords, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection forms, 
etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject receiving 
randomized study drug. 
The investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contra ct designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors, and the IRB/REB/IEC to have direct access to all documents pertaining to 
the study. 
A Trial Master File will be maintained by the Sponsor (or designee). All documents and other 
materials that pertai n to the conduct of the trial quality of the data, and compliance with GCPs 
will be collected in the Trial Master File.  
10.7 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safety data for the DX -2930-03 study. While 
an independent DSMB is not currently planned for this study, summary safety data from DX-2930-04 may be reviewed by the DSMB established for the DX -2930-03 study as part of the 
collectio n of safety information available on DX-2930.  
The DSMB will adhere to a prospectively determined Charter, which will be written by the Sponsor and approved by the DSMB. The Charter will define the responsibilities of the DSMB and Sponsor, the number and timing of the DSMB meetings, the conduct of the meetings, and the data sets to be reviewed by the DSMB.  Further details regarding the DSMB can be found in 
the DSMB charter.

10.8 Protocol Violations/Deviations 
The investigator will be instructed not to deviate f rom the protocol, except where necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. Should other unexpected circumstances 
arise that will require deviation from protocol- specific procedures, the investigator should 
contact their Sponsor representative to discuss the appropriate course of action.  
The investigator should document all protocol deviations/violations in the subject’s eCRF and 
source documents or the Investigator Site File if appropriate . In the event of a significant 
deviation/violation, the investigator should notify the Sponsor representative. Significant 
deviations/violations include, but are not limited to those that increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study assessments. The investigator will promptly 
report all changes in research activity and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others to his or her IRB/REB/IEC.  
10.9 Premature Closure of the Study  
If the Sponsor, investigator, or regulatory authorities discover conditions arising during the study which indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacceptable patient risk, the study may be terminated overall or at a specific site after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and the investigator(s). In addition, a decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the investigational product may be made at any time. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study  or site include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in 
the study 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent global regulations 
• Submission of knowingly false information from the study site to the Sponsor or other pertinent regulatory authorities  
• Insufficient adherence by the investigator to protocol requirements 
 
10.10 Access to Source Documentation and On -Site Audits  
Regulatory agencies may request access to  all study records, including source documents, for 
inspection and copying, in keeping with country regulations. The investigator should 
immediately notify the Sponsor representative of any announced or unannounced regulatory agency inspections. An auditing inspection may also be conducted by the Sponsor representative or designee. Any aspect of the trial may be subject to audit by the Sponsor and/or inspection by regulatory authorities or the IRB/REB/IEC. Such audits/inspections may take place at the Spons or’s site(s), the CRO, or at the clinical sites, including laboratories, pharmacies and any 
other facilities used for the study.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
The investigator will be responsible for the accuracy of the data entered in the eCRF. The 
investigator will permit the design ated Sponsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have 
direct access to the source documents to verify data represented in the eCRF.  
10.11 Data Generation and Analysis 
This study will be performed in accordance with regulatory requirements outlined in Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 54, 21 CFR Part 56, 21 CFR Part  312 
and 21 CFR Part 11 as well as the ICH GCP E6 Guidelines. The study monitors will meet with 
the investigators and staff shortly before the start of the trial to rev iew the procedures for study 
conduct and documentation. During the study, the monitors will visit the sites to verify record keeping and adherence to the protocol. For this study, eCRFs will be used. The monitors will conduct 100% source document verification by comparing the eCRFs with the source documents to ensure accuracy and consistency. Edit check programs, other forms of electronic validation, manual listings and a query process will be executed to verify the accuracy of the database. The EDC system will maintain a full audit trail of electronic data changes. Access to all source 
documentation will be made available for monitoring and audit purposes. 
10.12 Retention of Data  
All source documents (e.g., informed consent forms, laboratory reports, progress not es, medical 
histories, physical and diagnostic findings, diagnosis and pharmacy records, and DX-2930 
dispensing/disposition records) that support data in the eCRFs of each study subject must be retained in the files of the responsible i nvestigator.  
According to ICH guidelines, essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the DX-2930. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable legal requirements. 
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates or for any other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility. The Sponsor representative must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new cu stodian, prior to the transfer. 
10.13 Financial Disclosure  
The investigator is required to disclose any financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year 
after, whereby the outcome of the study could be influenced by the value of the compensation for conducting the study, or other payments the investigator received from the Sponsor. The following information is collected: any significant payments from the Sponsor or subsidiaries such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, retainer for ongoing consultation or honoraria; any proprietary interest in investigational product; any 
significant equity interest in the Sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 CFR 54 2(b) (1998).

NOTE:  Shaded columns represent scheduled in-site visits for all subjects. Non -shaded columns indicate potential subject-elected off -site activity and/or self -administration dosing. 
NOTE :  “( )”s indicate activities that may occur as applicable (ie, activities for rollover subjects)
13. Screening visit is for non -rollover subjects only.  Screening visit can occur up to 28 days prior to first open -label dose.
14. Study site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately every 7 days following the first dose of open -label DX -2930 to solicit for any HAE attacks not already
reported.  Site check-in with rollover subjects will continue until the subject receives their second open label dose.
15. Visit 28 is a site check -in call for all rollover and non-rollover subjects.
16. Subjects who terminate from the study early will undergo (if possible) all of the assessments and procedures at Visit 29, their final study visit
17. Rollover subjects must sign inform ed consent for DX -2930 -04 after Day 168 of study DX -2930 -03 and no later than the final DX-2930 -03 Day 182 treatment period study
visit.
18. For rollover subjects Day 182 of the DX -2930 -03 study is also Day 0 of the DX- 2930 -04 study and informed consent may b e completed on this visit, if not already provided.
19. Screened non -rollover subjects (adults and adolescents) who are on LTP with C1 INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until Da y 8 (or Day 15) such that
subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1 INH.  For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti-fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), a similar
tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by an additional week as long as androgen or anti -fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within 3 weeks of
receiving the first dose of DX -2930.
20. For rollover subjects, the timing of Dose 2 for will vary by subject based on when their first HAE attack occurs following Do se 1.  Following the first reported and
investigator
-confirmed attack, subjects will begin receiving regular SC administrations of 300 mg DX -2930 every 2 weeks.
21. A minimum of 10 days between the first and second open -label doses is required. If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window around a
scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that scheduled visit has already occurred. If that scheduled visit has already occurred, or if
the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled visit, this visit will not replace any scheduled visit and will thus represent an
acceptable, extra study visit (i.e., an unscheduled visit). Regardless, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX- 2930 is administered, the subject will undergo pre -
dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the site), clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody. Vital
signs will be obtained at 1 hour post -
dosing. As with all study visits, information will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.
22. All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be
allowed to self -administer DX -2930 after completing appropriate training by the investigator or designee and confirming their understanding. Subjects are allowed to initiate
self-administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX
-2930 at the study site and may elect to self -administer subsequent doses of DX-2930 at the investigational site
(during scheduled study site visits; shaded columns).
23. Subjects may self-administer DX -2930 at home or other agreed upon location (during optional off-
site self -administration visits; non -shaded columns). Site personnel will call
subjects after the planned self -administration to ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately
documented.
24. Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at s creening for eligibility assessment unless already collected as part of protocol DX -2930 -02 or DX -2930 -03.
25. The pregnancy test will only be conducted in females of childbearing potential.  Tests performed on Day 0 must be urine -based to confirm eligibilit y prior to first dose.  Tests
performed at screening and on indicated visits can be serum or urine -based.
26. There is a recommended ± 15 minute window for all vital signs. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing. Monitoring of vi tal signs will not be
performed for subjects who elect to self -administer away from the investigative site at optional off -site visits (indicated non -shaded columns). Height and weight will be
collected at the Screening visit only.
Page 112 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL Page 113
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX- 2930 -04 27 June 2016
27. Physical examinations will be conducted for all rollover and non- rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule and in accordance with standards at the site.  In
addition to the physical examinations specified in the study activities schedule, an additional phys ical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the site) will be
conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.
28. Clinical laboratory testing will include Hematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis (urinalysis does not need to be done as part of the clinical laboratory
testing at Visits 14, 17, 20, and 23). Clinical laboratory testing will be conducted for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In
addition to the testing specified in the study activities schedule, additional testing will be conducted for rollover subject s prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label
dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.
29. Historical HAE attack information will be collected at screening. During the study, subjects (or caregivers) are instructed t o report details of the attack to the study site within
72 hours of the onset of the attack. During study visits, stu dy site personnel will solicit for any new HAE attack information that has not already been reported to the site.
30. Quality of life data will be obtained using the EQ -5D-5L, SF -12, AE -QoL, HADS, and WPAI-GH.
31. Collect subject’s injection reports of their exper ience with DX -2930 self-
administration and subcutaneous administration for all doses.
32. Collect subject’s injection surveys of their experience with DX-2930 self-administration and subcutaneous injection for indicated visits.
33. PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody PD samples will be drawn for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In addition to the samples
specified in the study activities schedule, an additional PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody sample will be drawn for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second
open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.

DRAFT
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and 
should not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
When selecting a toxicity table, 
the following are some of the items that must be taken into 
consideration:  
•The population being studied
oDoes the clinical trial eval
uate healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease
or condition?
•The stage of test article devel
opment
oIs the clinical tr ial a Pha
se I, II, III or IV?
•The type of  test article
oDoes the clinical trial eval
uate a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?
•The prior human and preclinical ex
perience with the test article
oAre there any specific findings t
hat require adjustment of  the toxicity table?
Single site clinical trials
 evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal 
values  at the single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal 
values when evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
Please confer with the DMID
 protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when 
selecting or developing a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

DISEASES (DMID) PEDIATRIC  TOXICIT Y TABLES  
NOVEMBER  2007 
DRAFT  
 1  
 
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and should 
not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, 
the following are some of the items that must be taken into consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluat
e healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease or 
condition?  
• The stage of test article dev elopment  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I  (is 
it for the fisrt time in human subjects?) , II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluat
e a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical ex
perience with the  test article  
o Are there any specific findings that 
require adjustment of  the toxicity table?  
o Has it been approved for this indic
ation in adult population?  
  
Single site clinical trials 
evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal values  at the 
single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal values when 
evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID
 protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when selecting 
or developing a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate 
grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in activity - 
some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospitalizations possible  
GRADE 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, significant 
assistance  required; significant medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospitalization or hospice care probable  
GRADE 5                              Death  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE- THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event dee
med by the clinician to be serious or life -threatening  should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening include, 
but are not limited to:  seizures, coma, tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acut e psychosis, severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commo
nly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’s Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have been adapted for 
use by the Div isi on  of Microbi ology  an d Infectiou s Di seases (DMID) an d m odified to 
better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 •  
For parameters not in
cluded in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to the 
“Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally 
grouped by body system.  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use
 of these tables for specified criteria.

HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
   
 
1 PURPOSE 
This document applies to clinical trials that involve investigator adjudication/assessment of 
angioedema attacks. The purpose of this document is to provide a definition of an HA E 
attack and to define a standardized set of procedures for the reporting and assessment of events reported by subjects to determine whether those events are true HAE attacks.  
2 DEFINITION OF AN ATT ACK  
To be confirmed as an HAE attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an attack in at least one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary region 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx 
Despite the presence of these symptoms, the inv estigator may still determine clinically that 
the event did not represent an HAE attack if there are features that strongly refute such a 
diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by symptoms that are not consistent with an attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typical time course of an attack (e.g., greater than 7 days), or there is a likely alternate etiology  for 
the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from their previous attack, the new symptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.  
Attack resolution is defined as the subject no longer having symptoms of the attack. Prodromal symptoms by themselves are not considered an attack. Patient report of use of acute HAE attack treatment for an attack by itself is not confirmation 
that an attack occurred.  
3 REPORTING AND ASSESSMENT OF ATTACK DATA  
At screening for applicable clinical trials, subject HAE attack history will be collected by the 
site for entry into the clinical database. Information collected will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, predominant location(s), average duration, acute attack therapy use, and history of long- term prophylaxis.  
During the relevant study periods, as defined in the applicable study protocol, subjects (or caregivers, for subjects < 18 years old) will be instructed to c ontact the site within 72  hours 
of the start of symptoms of an attack. In the situation that a subject is incapacitated and is

unable to contact the site, a family member or other individual with detailed knowledge of 
the event can provide the information. If desired by the subject, m emory aids may be 
provided to assist in tracking any HAE attacks subject ’s experience. Any tools or devices the 
subject uses to track this information are not intended to serve as source documents for the study.  
Site personnel will review the information provided by the subject or caregiver and solicit 
additional information as necessary to document the attack.  Information documented by the site will be considered source for the study.  
A designated individual at the site (the collector) will contact the subject or caregiver on a 
regular basis as defined in the study protocol, regardless of whether or not the subject has 
reported any attacks, in order to solicit for any attacks that may have occurred but were not reported. In addition, during each study visit, site personnel will solicit for any new attack information that was not provided through previous contact with the subject or caregiver . 
The Investigator or designee (the assessor) will review the attack information  and evaluate if 
the event represents a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee may contact the subject to receive additional information.  
3.1 Subject-Reported Symptoms 
Subjects and caregivers can use any exi sting methods by which they track information about 
their attacks , or, if requested, memory aids can be provided by the study site. However, 
subjects (or a caregiver) will need to track attacks in such a way as to be able to contact the study site as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours (3 full days) after the first symptoms appear, to report the information. 
3.1.1  Attack Information  
The following information should be provided by the subject (or caregiver) at the time they 
are reporting an attack to the site: 
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced  
• Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s) 
• Impact on activity and whether any assistance or medical intervention was required , 
including hospitalizations or emergency department visits  
• Any medications used to treat the attack  
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms  
Subjects do not have to wait for their symptoms to completely resolve to report an attack. 
Information about ongoing symptoms can be obtained by the site during the check- in call 
and/ or at a scheduled study visit. Subjects should not withhold or delay any treatment they would normally receive to treat their attack in order contact the site.

3.1.2  Worsening Symptoms  
The site may request the subject call them back if they experience worsening symptoms 
and/ or new symptoms for a reported attack. Otherwise, the new information will be captured during the next check -in call or scheduled study visit. Subjects may contact the site on their 
own to provide information about any worsening symptoms. 
3.1.3  Subject Training  
During screening, site personnel will train subjects on identifying symptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to provide.  The 
patient will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting attacks to the site.  Sites will assess the subject’s compliance with the reporting requirements throughout the study and may retrain the subject if necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the data provided to the site. 
3.1.4  Reporting Multiple Attacks  
If a subject experiences symptoms they attribute to more than one unique attack they can 
report this as multiple attacks to the site.  Based on the definition o f an attack as stated in 
Section  2, it will be the determination of the investigator or designee as to whether events 
reported as being separate are confirmed as separate attacks or not.  
3.1.5  Caregiver Report  
During screening, site personnel will train subject caregivers (if applicable)  on identifying 
symptoms of an attack, the requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to  provide.  The caregiver will confirm their understanding of what is required of 
them for reporting attacks to the site.  Sites will assess the caregiver’s compliance with the 
reporting requirements throughout the study and may retrain the caregiver if necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the data provided to the site.  
3.1.6  Subject Contact with Sites  
Site personnel will establish a recommended method and time window for each subject to contact the site to report any symptoms of an attack. Sites will establish a primary contact person and, if possible, a back-up person, with contact information. Back- up plans, including 
call backs and/ or use of back -up contacts, should be established in case the subject is unable 
to reach someone at the site.  
3.2 Site Contact with the Subject 
Sites will establish a reco mmended day and time window for check -in calls between  study 
visits. The date and time for check-ins can be modified based on when the last contact with the subject was made, as outlined in the study protocol. When the site is contacted by a subject reporting symptoms of an attack the site should make sure they have the ability to record the information provided in a complete and accurate way. Back -up plans should be

HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
established in case the subject misses a call from the site. A study schedule for each subject’s 
on-site visits will be provided to the subject by the site.  
3.2.1  Review of subject report of symptoms  
During contact with the subject, whether subject- initiated or a regular check -in, site 
personnel should ask the subject to provide them information about new or ongoing HAE attacks experienced.  
The site will try to obtain all information necessary to document the attack completely. Missing information may impact the assessment of any attack  and should be avoided 
whenever possible. 
3.2.2  Documenting a Reported Attack  
Complete and accurate documentation of each repor ted attack is important to making an 
Investigator assessment of the attack. The site should document the following information 
about each attack reported by the subject or caregiver :  
•Date and time of contact with the subject
•Date and time the subject firs t experienced symptoms
•Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s)
•Impact on activity and whether any assistance was required
•If the attack has resolved or is ongoing.  If the attack has resolved, the date and time the
subject was no longer experiencing any symptoms of the attack
•Names of any medications used to treat the attack including HAE acute therapy or othernon-HAE treatments
•If hospitalization occurred
•If a trip to the emergency department occurred
Additional probing questions about what the subject experienced to determine:  
•If the subject only experienced prodromal symptoms
•If  the subject experienced anything different than their typical attack
•If there were any possible alternative etiologies of the symptoms. For example, a viralgastroenteritis outbreak in the household could explain abdominal symptoms
The overall severity of the subject’s attack will be determined by the site using the following 
definitions: 
- Mild: Transient or mild discomfort  
- Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance needed  
- Severe: Marked limitation in activity, assistance required

HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
The site will also document the date and time of investigator or designee review, the official 
designation of the event as an attack or not, and if applicable, the reason why an event is not considered an attack.  
All reported attacks will be entered by si te personnel into the electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). 
3.2.3  Site Training  
Site personnel responsible for collecting attack information about subject HAE attacks will 
need to pass a “Collector” training assessment covering the following: 
•definition of an HAE attack
•requirements of subjects and caretakers for reporting attacks
•reporting worsening symptoms and multiple attacks
•information to be collected from subjects and caregivers as well as the additional probing
questions to gather context for the attack information provided
•assessment of attack severity
•entry of the attack data into the eCRF
•reporting HAE attacks as adverse events
•requirements for Investigator assessment of attacks
Trainings will be conducted prior to sites screening subjects.  Trainings will be documented 
in the Trial Master File. Investigators and designees will be trained on these procedures as 
well and must pass an “Assessor” training in order to officially assess attacks for this study. 
All responsible persons involved in the collection of information from subjects or assessing attacks must be listed on FDA Form 1572. 
3.3 HAE attacks as Adverse Events  
At the time of each contact and scheduled study visit, site personnel will ask if the subject 
experienced any adverse events or changes to the medications they are taking.  
HAE attacks will be captured as AEs .  All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or causal 
relationship to study drug, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. 
Any AE reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious  adverse event must be reported to 
Dyax using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event.  For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE attacks, the Principal 
Investigator or physician designee will r eview the event within 24 hours of initial notification 
and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack.  
For all non- serious AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the Principal Investigator or 
physician designee will review  the event within 3 days of initial notification and, in 
accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the Investigator or designee may contact the subject for additional

HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
information. Any subject-reported attack not confirmed by the Investigator must have an 
alternate AE diagnosis recorded.  All subject- reported and Investigator -confirmed HAE 
attacks will be recorded in the eCRF . 
4 INVESTIGATOR ATTACK ASSESSMENT 
The Principal Investigator for a stud y site may identify a physician designee to assess patient 
symptom information and make attack determinations. Sites should be limited to two individuals responsible for assessing attacks, one of them being the Principal Investigator. Assessors must be exp erienced with HAE and familiar with the study subject’s disease 
history.  
The assessor must review the information and determine whether the event is an actual attack 
or not. If needed, the assessor can contact the subject and/or caregiver to clarify infor mation 
or ask for any additional detail. The determination will be documented along with the date and time the determination was made. Any event deemed not an attack must be accompanied by an explanation and alternative diagnosis by the assessor.  
When rev iewing subject information, the assessor will follow the definitions of an attack as 
outlined in these procedures and, taking all available information about the event into 
consideration, will determine if it is a confirmed attack. The assessment of the attack is the Investigator or designee’s own, and not the opinion of the subject, the subject’s caregiver or any other site personnel. Assessors may consult with one another about a particular subject’s attack but only one assessor makes the documented determination. It is possible for both the Principal Investigator and physician designee to assess different attacks for the same subject.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX- 2930 -04 27 June 2016
Appendix 5 Summary of Pivotal Study of DX -2930 in HAE Subjects
The proposed pivotal clinical study  (DX -2930- 03) is entitled “HEL P StudyTM: A Multicenter, 
Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Efficacy  and Safety  Study  to Evaluate DX -2930 
For Long -Term Prophy laxis Against Acute Attacks of Hereditary  Angioedema (HAE).” This 
study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm study  
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in pat ients with Ty pe 
I or T ype II HAE. The double -blind study  is planned to be followed by  the study  described in the 
present protocol, an open -label extension (OLE) study (DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of study  DX-2930- 03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to evaluate the safet y of repeated SC administrations of 
DX-2930. The tertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic effects of chronically  
administered DX -2930; to assess the immunogenic ity of chronically  administered DX -2930; to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of chronically  administered DX -
2930; and to evaluate the effect 
of DX -2930 upon qualit y of life assessments.
Subjects aged 12 years and over with a documented diagnosis of Type I or Type II HAE who 
experience at least 1 attack per 4 weeks will be eligible for the study . Up to 120 subjects are 
planned for enrollment across approximately  60 sites in the United States, Canada, Ital y, 
German y, United Kingdom and Jordan.
Following informed consent, subjects will undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who are on 
long-term prophy lactic therapy  for HAE are required to undergo a minimum 2 week washout 
period prior to the start of the run -in period.  Subjects who are either not on long -term 
prophy lactic therapy  for HAE, or have completed the required washout period will enter a run -in 
period of 4 weeks to determine the baseline HAE attack rate. The run -in period may  be extended 
to 8 weeks if the minimum baseline attack rate is not achieved in t he first 4 weeks. HAE subjects 
will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) administrations of DX -2930 
or placebo in a double -blind fashion.  Subjects who are randomized to DX -2930 will be assigned 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  4 weeks or 
150 mg every  4 weeks.  Each subject will undergo a treatment period consisting of 13 doses of 
blinded study  drug, for a period of 26 weeks from the date of first dose on Day  0 through Day  
182
Subject s may  consent to rollover into the OLE study  (present protocol DX -
2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the mean rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks 
observed in each DX -2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the efficacy  
assessment period (Day  14 through Day  182).

Figure 2:Overview of the Design of Pivotal Study DX-2930-03
Dose Rationale for Double -Blind, Pivotal Study  DX-2930 -03
The dose rationale is based on the pharmacod ynamic bioactivity, PK, safety, and efficacy of DX -
2930 from the Phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical studies. Together, these attributes provide 
the rationale for the selected doses and regimens to achieve drug levels likely  to prevent a 
majority  of HAE attacks. Based on these considerations, 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  4 
weeks, and 150 mg every 4 weeks were identified as the dosing regimens for evaluation,
The 3 proposed dose -regimen combinations provide a 6 -fold range of steady -state trough 
concentrations and leverage both the biomarker and efficacy  data generated in study  DX-2930-
02. Evaluation of the DX- 2930 plasma concentrations at the time of attacks reported b y DX -
2930 treated subjects in DX-2930-02 suggests that the 3 planned dosing regimens will provide a 
meaningful range of clinical response while avoiding non- therapeutic or super -therapeutic doses 
and regimens

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Study Design:
Study  DX-2930-04 is an open -label, long term safety  and efficacy  extension study  of Study  DX-
2930- 03, to evaluate the investigational medicinal product (IMP), DX -2930, in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Type II HAE. There are two ty pes of subjects 
who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from Study DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not participant s in Study DX-
2930- 03) 
Rollover Subjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  182 of 
Study DX-2930- 03 and consent to enter Study DX-2930- 04.  Subjects who discontinue from 
Study DX-2930- 03 after enrollment are not eligible to enroll in Study DX-2930 -04.  
Subjects should be asked about their interest in Study DX-2930- 04 study  after enrollment into 
Study DX-
2930- 03 to anticipate enrollment and preparedness for Study DX-2930-04. Willing 
subjects must sign informed consent for Study DX-
2930-04 on or after Day  168 of Study DX-
2930-
03.  
Subjects who are eligible to roll over into Study DX-2930- 04 but elect not to, may  not enroll in 
Study DX-
2930- 04 at a later time. The first Study DX-2930-
04 visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as the Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study DX
-2930 -03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharged from that study. No asse ssments conducted between the Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 
study  visit and the first Study DX-2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated. Results of the final 
Study DX-2930- 03 assessments on Day  182 will be used as the pre -dose results for Day  0 of 
Study DX-2930-04.
All subjects, caregivers, investigators and study site personnel will remain blinded to the Study
DX-2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of Study DX-
2930- 04.
Non-rollover subjects
At least 50 subjects ( to approximately 100) who were not participants in Study DX-2930- 03 will 
be permitted to enroll if they  meet the eligibility  requirements. Subjects who screen fail out of 
Study DX-2930-03 for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run- in period 
must wait until enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for Study
DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Study DX-2930- 03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Study DX-2930-03 w hen 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study
DX
-2930- 03 due to an inability  to wash- out of their L TP, may  screen for Study DX-2930-
04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Screening Period:
Rollover Subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover Subjects
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose. Screened non- rollover subjects (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1-INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH. For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (e g, danazol) or anti-fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexamic acid), a 
similar tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged b y an additional 
week , if medically  indicated, as long as androgen or anti -fibrinol ytic therapy  is stopped within 3 
weeks after receiving the first dose of DX-2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC) on Day  0.  Subjects will 
not receive an y additional DX -2930 doses until their first reported, and investigator-confirmed, 
HAE attack.  As such, the total number of doses within the treatment period will vary  by rollover 
subject.
The duration of time between the first open -label dose and first reported HAE attack will vary  by 
rollover subject.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study  Activities Schedule for the entire 
duration of the study .  However, until a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack, onl y 
scheduled stud y visits where the following tests and assessments are performed must be 
conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory  testing, phy sical 
examination, 12- Lead ECG, QoL , PK, PD and anti -drug antibody  sample collection. All other 
scheduled study visits may be conducted via site check -in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy
, and HAE attack data.  See Study  Activities Schedule for which 
visits must be conducted at the study  site.
Once a r ollover subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -2930 as quickly  as subject and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day  window around a scheduled 
study  visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit (ie, an 
unscheduled visit).  Similarly , if the second dose is administered outside of the accepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit, the day  of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra 
unscheduled stud y visit, (ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit).
Regardless of the s tudy day, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX -2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, phy sical 
examination, clinical laboratory  testing, blood sampling for PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody . 
Vital signs will be obtained at 1 hour post- dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be 
collected on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 9

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 10 
days between their first open -label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their second 
open -label dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -
label 300 mg DX- 2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining dur ation of the treatment period per the 
scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedule. The treatment period will last 364 day s from 
the date of the first open -label dose. The number of doses administered during this period will 
vary by subject based on t he date of each subject’s second dose, but will not exceed 26 doses. 
The Day  350 study  visit is the last visit at which a dose may  be administered. 
Non-rollover Subjects
Once all screening assessments have been completed and eligibility  confirmed, non-rollover 
subjects will arrive at the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open- label 
dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered SC on Day 0. Non- rollover subjects will continue to 
receive SC administrations of open- label 300 mg DX -2930 e very 2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period per the scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedule. A 
total of 26 doses will be administered with the last dose administered at the Day  350 study  visit.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the e xception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 10 
days and maximum of 18 day s between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 
day window around study  visits.
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the 
opinion of the investigator requires medical intervention, standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- 2930 and study  procedures will continue wit hout alteration to the protocol 
study  activities schedule, even if a subject receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema 
attack on the day  of a scheduled dose of study  drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study  
visit.
Self Administration
All subj ects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment. Subjects must complete appropriate training b y the invest igator or designee 
and understanding of the training must be confirmed by  the investigator or designee. Subjects are 
allowed to initiate self- administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon location after 
receiving the first 2 doses of DX- 2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  self-
administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled 
study  site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study  permits off -
site dosing) . See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self -administering 
investigational product will be supervised by  a parent/legal guardian/caregiver. Alternatively , a 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 10
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training, will be allowed to 
administer DX -2930 to an adolescent without study  site personnel supervision. Site personnel 
will call subjects within approximately  3 day s of t he planned off -site self- administrations to 
ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, co ncom itant medications, and to ensure all 
attacks have been appropriately documented.
Throughout the stud y, study  site personnel will document information in source documents (ie, 
the subject’s medical record) and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience wi th self-
administration and SC administration of DX -2930.
Follow -up Period
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 4-
week follow -up period.
Modifications to Open -Label Dosing
If, at an y time, an important dose -related safety signal is identified either from this study  or 
Study DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et 
completed the treatment period, and an y subsequent subjects, to recei ve a different open
-label 
DX-2930 dose and/or frequency .
In addition, based on the results of Study DX-2930 -03, the Sponsor may  switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency . 
Study Population:
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from Study DX-2930-03, as well as at least 50 ( to 
approximately 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in Study DX-2930- 03. The total 
enrollment is expected to be at least 150 but not more than 250 HAE Ty pe I or II subjects. 
Subjects will be 12 y ears of age or older who experience at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE 
diagnosis will be confirmed through documented clinical history  and diagnostic testing 
conducted either during screening or during prior participation in Study DX-2930- 02 or Study
DX-2930- 03.  The study  will aim to enroll at least 15 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, 
inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 12 to 17 years old 
who are expected to roll over from 
Study DX-2930-
03.
Criteria for Inclusion:
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening. 
2.Documented diagnosis of HAE (Ty pe I or II)  based on all of the following:
Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or muc osal, 
nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompan ying urticaria).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX -2930 study ) that 
confirm HAE T ype I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal level may  
be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may  be 
retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or believed by  the in vestigator 
to be confounded b y recent L TP use.

the interpretation of study  results).
Test Product; Dose; and Mode of Administration:
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate 
dibasic dihy drate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of 150 mg DX -2930 
active ingredient in 1 mL solution.
For each 300 mg dose of DX -2930, each subject will receive a total of 2 mL (2 vials), which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL  SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh 
or abdomen.
Self-Administration Option: Investigational product canbeself-administered without supervision
(parental supervision required foradolescent subjects) after subjects receive appropriate training
bytheinvestigator ordesignee andtheir understanding isconfirmed. Subjects are allowed to 
initiate offsite self-administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study  site 
and may  continue to self -administer all subsequent doses (see Study  Activities Schedule).
Duration of Treatment:
All subjects will receive open -label DX -2930 during a 364 day treatment period. The number of 
doses that rollover subjects receive during this period will vary b y subject but will not exceed 26 
doses. The last dose of open -label DX -2930 administered to these subjects may  be given at the 
Day 350 study  visit. Non -rollover subjects will receive 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks for a 
total of 26 doses, with the first dose administered on Day  0 and the final dose administered at the 
Day 350 st udy visit.
There will be a ±4 -day window around each study visit. There will be a minimum of 10 day s 
between an y two doses. Excluding the interval between the first and second open -label doses for 
rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 day s betwe en any  two doses. Subjects will be 
monitored at the study  site through 1 hour post -dose for scheduled study  site visits.  No 
monitoring of vital signs will be performed for subjects who elect to self -administer away  from 
the investigational site .

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within 4 weeks prior to the fi rst open- label dose. Eligible subjects will be enrolled 
and undergo a 364 day  treatment period. At the conclusion of the treatment period, subjects will 
be followed for an additional 4 weeks. 
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:
Use of the following treatm ents will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or anti-
fibrinoly tics) once LTP is discontinued (within 3 weeks following the first dose of DX -
2930). 
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
•Initiating or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 months prior to study  
screening.
•Use of androgens (eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxan drolone, methy ltestosterone, and 
testosterone) for non- HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation 
during the first three weeks.
•Any other investigational drug or device.
The use of short -term prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated.  
Short -term (pre -procedure) proph ylaxis is defined as use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema 
complications from medically  indicated procedures.
Management of Acute Attacks:
Acute HAE attacks during the stud y are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapies that the investigator deems as 
medically  appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
long-term prophy lactic the rapy. Administration of DX -2930 and stud y procedures will continue 
without alteration to the protocol- specified study  schedule, even if the subject has s ymptoms of 
an HAE attack the day  of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack.   
The administration of DX -2930 can also be re -scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum 
timeframe between doses are met based on subject preference or ph ysician discretion.
Safety Assessments:
Safety  assessments will include the following:
•Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special 
interest (AESI). SAEs and AESI  will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.
•Vital signs, including sitting or supine blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body  
temperature, and respiratory  rate (RR)
•Physical examination
•Clinical laboratory  testing (hematology , serum chemistry , coagulation, and urinaly sis)
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 14
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
•12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Hypersensitivity  reactions and events of disordered coagulation will be considered AESI.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of plasma DX -2930 concentrations.
Pharmac odynamic (PD) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacod ynamic effects of DX -2930 through 
biomarker assay s.
Immunogenicity Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to assay  for the presence of anti- drug antibodies, including 
evaluation of neutralizing antibodies (if an y confirmed positive anti- drug antibodies are 
detected).
C1-INH, C1q and C4 Assessments:
Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assay s will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment, 
unless alread y collected as part of protocol DX -2930 -02 or DX -2930-03. 
Quality of Life Assessments:
Quality  of life (QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire (AE -QoL), EuroQoL 5- Dimensional 5 -Level Measure (EQ -5D-5L), Work 
Productivity  and Activit y Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI -GH), Hospital 
Anxiety  and Depression Scale (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey  (SF-12).
DX-2930 Injection Report and Self -Administration and Subcutaneous Injection Survey
An injecti on report of the subject’s experience with self -administration and SC injection will be 
completed b y the subject after all doses of DX -2930.
In addition, assessment survey  of subject experience with SC and self -administration injections 
of DX -2930 will be completed by  the subject as indicated in the Study Activities Schedule.
Collection of HAE Attack Data:
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP). Study  site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their s ite.
Study  site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identify ing s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide. The 
subject (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average severit y, 
predomi nant attack location(s ), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy  use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks 
while receiving LTP). If available, information will also be collecte d on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 15
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack. This includes the first attack experienced by  
rollover subjects following their first open- label dose. I n the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by  a famil y 
member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by  the subject, 
memory  aids may  be provided to assist in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced, but their use is 
not mandatory .
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced.
Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s).
Impact on activit y (work, school, social interactions) and whether an y assistance or 
medical intervention was required, including hospitalizations, additional laboratory  tests 
or emergency  department visits .
Any medi cations used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter) .
If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms.
Study  site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information a s 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Study  site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately  every  7 day s following the first 
dose of open- label DX -2930 to solicit for any  HAE attacks not already  reported.  Site check- ins 
will continue until the subject has received their second open -label dose.
During each study visit, study site personnel will solicit for any  new HAE attack information that 
was not alread y provided to the site.
In this stud y, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity , 
or causal relationship to DX -
2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Any AE 
reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Rep orting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event. For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or 
physician designee will review the event within 24 hours of initial notification and, in 
accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack. For all non- serious 
AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or ph ysician designee will review the 
event within 3 day s of initial notification and, in accordance with HAA RP, evaluate if it 
represented a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee 
may contact the subject to receive additional information. Any subject -reported attack not 
confirmed b y the investigator or ph ysician desi gnee must have an alternate AE diagnosis 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 16
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
recorded.  All subject- reported and investigator/ phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will 
be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital admissions 
will be captured.
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have sy mptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region.
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea.
•Lary ngeal angioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx.
Despite the presence of these s ymptoms, the investigator or phy sician designee may still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well bey ond the 
typical time course of an HAE attack, or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’ s abdominal s ymptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s sy mptoms.
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Interim anal yses may  be conducted to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory  
reporting when a reasonable number ofsubjects have completed 12 months of consecutive 
exposure to DX- 2930 across the combined DX -2930 -03 and DX -2930- 04 studies, and only  after 
database lock of Study  DX-2930-03. 
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide 
ongoin g, independent review and assessment of the safet y data for Study DX-2930- 03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study , summary  safety  data from Study DX-
2930- 04 may  be reviewed by  the Study  DX-2930-03 DSMB as part of the collectio n of safet y 
information available on DX -
2930. 
Individual Stopping Rules:
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non-serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that subject’s 
well-being. The investigator has the ability  to contact and consult with the Medical Monitor on 
such matters. Subjects will continue to be followed through the completion of all scheduled non -
dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study .

Sample Size Determination:
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open- label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03 and individuals who 
were not otherwise able to participate in Study  DX-2930-
03.
Statistical Methodology:
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack will be anal yzed using the Rollover Safet y 
Population.
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (day s) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -2930 to the date and time of the first investigator-
confirmed HAE attack after the first open -label dose.  Subjects who discontinue the study  prior 
to experiencing their first on- study investigator -confirmed HAE attack will be censored at the 
date and time of stud y discontinuation.  Time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE attack will 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods.
Multivariate and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be employ ed to 
examine the impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE 
attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering Study  DX-2930- 03, the 
treatment group in Study  DX-2930- 03, the time since the last dose given in Study  DX-2930-03, 
the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during Study  DX
-2930- 03. Results of 
this exploratory  anal ysis will be summarized.  
Number of Investigator -confirmed HAE Attacks
The number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day  0 through 
Day 364) e xpressed as a monthly  HAE attack rate, will be anal yzed using each analy sis 
population.
The monthly  rate of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during th e treatment period will be 
calculated for each subject as the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks occurring 
during the treatment period divided by  the number of day s the subject contributed to the 
treatment period multiplied by  28 day s.  
The bas eline investigator -confirmed monthl y HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator- confirmed monthly  HAE attacks occurring during the pretreatment 
period for rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non -rollover subjects divided by  the 
number of day s the subject contributed to the pretreatment period for rollover subjects or 
historical reporting period for non -rollovers multiplied by  28 day s.
The baseline, treatment period, and treatment period change from ba seline in the investigator-
confirmed HAE attack rate will be summarized for each anal ysis population. The summary  will 
include the total number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks reported during each period and 
subject -time in months that each subject contributed to each period. Figures will be created for

each anal ysis population plotting the on -study  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks reported 
during the treatment period relative to Day  0 for each subject.
Similar summary  tables will be presented for the following efficacy  endpoints for each anal ysis 
population:
•Number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.
•Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period.
•Number of high- morbidity  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high -morbidity  HAE attack is defined as any  attack that has at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation < 24 
hours), hemod ynamicall y significant (s ystolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hy dration, or 
associated with s yncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal.
Safety Analysis:
Adverse Events
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severit y or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. 
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator. Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.
The number and percentage of subjects with an y AE, any related AE, an y SAE, any related SAE, 
any severe AE, and any  related severe AE as well as the total number of events for each category  
will be summarized.  The number of deaths due to an AE, hospitalization due to an AE and stud y 
discontinuation due to an AE will be summarized. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total num ber of AEs, will be 
summarized by  SOC, and PT. This tabulation will be repeated for related AEs, SAEs, related 
SAEs, severe AEs, and related severe AEs. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study  are h ypersensitivity reactions and 
disordere d coagulation (hy percoagulability  events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQ) for each AESI  will be performed using the study  data. The number and percentage 
of subjects with an AESI, as well as the total number of AESIs, will be summar ized by  SOC and PT. 
Separate summary  tables will be created for each AESI  and for those events with the SMQs 
classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and related severe.  A listing detailing the 
PT within the SMQ will be provided.

Laborator y Test Results, Vital Signs, and Electrocardiograph y Results
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first exposure to DX- 2930. For 
rollover subjects previously  exposed to DX -2930, baseline is the last non- missing value prior to 
first exposure to study  drug in Study  DX-2930- 03.      
  
Actual values and change from baseline in clinical laboratory  test results and vital signs will be 
summarized by  study  visit. 
Laboratory  test results will be classified according to the reference ranges and clinical 
significance as determined by  the investigator. Vital sign values will be classified according to 
clinical significance as determined b y the investigator. The number of subjects with a non -
missing result, and the number and percentage of subjects within each category  will be 
summarized by  study  visit.  
The number and percentage of subjects with normal, abnormal not clinically  significant, and 
abnormal clinicall y significant ECG results, or ECG no tperformed, will be summarized by  study  
visit.

1. Screening visit is for non -rollover subjects only.  Screening visit can occur up to 28 days prior to first open -label dose.
2. Study site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately every 7 days following the first dose of open -label DX -2930 to solicit for any HAE attacks 
not already reported.  Site check -in with rollover subjects will continue un til the subject receives their second open label dose.
3. Visit 28 is a site check -in call for all rollover and non -rollover subjects.
4. Subjects who terminate from the study early will undergo (if possible) all of the assessments and procedures at Visi t 29, the final study visit.
5. Rollover subjects must sign informed consent for Study DX -2930- 04 on or after Day 168 of Study DX -2930- 03.
6. For rollover subjects Day 182 of Study DX -2930- 03 is also Day 0 of Study DX -2930- 04 and informed consent may be completed on this visit, if not already 
provided.
7. Screened non -rollover subjects (adults and adolescents) who are on LTP w ith C1 -INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP unt il Day 8 (or Day 
15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4)
doses of C1 -INH.  For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) or anti -fibrinolytics (e g,

tranexamic acid), a similar tapering schedule is recommended. How ever, the taper can be prolonged by an additional week as long as androgen or anti -
fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within 3 weeks of receiving the first dose of DX -2930.
8. For rollover subjects, the timing of Dose 2 for will vary by subject based on when their first HAE attack occurs following Do se 1.  Follow ing the first 
reported and investigator -confirmed attack, subjects will begin receiving regular SC administrations of 300 mg DX- 2930 every 2 w eeks.
9. A minimum of 10 days between the first and second open -label doses is required. If the second dose is to be administered w ithin t he accepted ±4 day 
window  around a scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that scheduled visit has already occur red. If that 
scheduled vis it has already occurred, or if the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled visit, this visit 
will not replace any scheduled visit and will thus represent an acceptable, extra study visit (ie, an unscheduled visit). Regardless, at the visit in which the 
second open -label dose of DX -2930 is administered , the subject w ill undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination (performed in 
accordance w ith standards at the site), clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, and anti- drug antibody. Vital signs will be ob tained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with 
all study visits, information will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data. 
10. All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a physical a nd mental capability of learning and w illing to be 
trained) may be allow ed to self -administer DX -2930 after completing appropriate training by the investigator or designee and confirming their 
understanding. Su bjects are allow ed to initiate home self -administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study site and may elect to self -
administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (during scheduled study site visits; shaded columns). 
11. Subjects may self -administer DX- 2930 at home or other agreed upon location (during optional off -site self -administration visits; non -shaded columns). Site 
personnel will call subjects w ithin approximately 3 days of the planned self -administration to ensure the administration occurred , to collect AEs, 
concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately documented.
12. Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment unless already collected as part of Study DX -2930- 02 or 
Study DX- 2930- 03.  
13. The pregnancy test will only be conducted in females of childbearing potential.  Tests performed on Day 0 must be urine -based to confirm eligibility prior to 
first dose. Tests performed at screening and on indicated visits can be serum or urine -based.
14. There is a recommended ± 15 min ute window for all vital signs. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing. Monitoring of vital 
signs will not be performed for subjects who elect to self -administer away from the investigative site at optional off- site visits (indicated non -shaded

(performed in accordance wit h standards at the site) will be conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at 
whatever study visit that occurs.  Height will be collected at the Screening visit only. 
16. Clinical laboratory testing will include Hematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis (urinalysis does not need to be done as p art of the 
clinical laboratory testing at Visits 14, 17, 20, and 23). Clinical laboratory testing will be conducted for all rollover and non -rollove r subjects according to

prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at w hatever study visit that occurs.
17. Historical HAE attack information will be collected at screening. During the study, subjects (or caregivers) are instructed t o report details of the attack to the 
study site within 72 hours of the onset of the attack. Dur ing study visits, study site personnel w ill solicit for any new HAE attack information that has not 
already been reported to the site.
18. Quality of life data will be obtained using the EQ -5D-5L, SF -12, AE -QoL, HADS, and WPAI -GH.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 DX-2930
DX-2930 is a full y human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds specificall y to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for proph ylactic treatment of angioedema 
attacks in patients with hereditary  angioedema (HAE), a serious and life -threatening disease.
1.2 Here ditary Angioedema
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life- threatening disease caused by  mutations in the 
C1-inhibitor (C1- INH) gene, resulting in deficiency  or dy sfunction of C1 -INH protein. HAE 
manifests clinically  as unpredictable, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema 
of the face, lary nx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw, 2008
).Swelling may  last 
up to five or more day s; most patients suffer multiple attacks per y ear. HAE is an orphan 
disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates range from 1 per 
10,000 to 1 per 150,000 persons, with many  authors agreeing that 1 per50,000 is likely  the 
closest estimate (Bygum, 2009; Goring et al., 1998 ; Lei et al., 2011 ; Nordenfelt et al., 2014 ; 
Roche et al., 2005). 
Swelling in the lary nx can obstruct the airway s and cause death from asphyxiation (Bork et al., 
2000; Bork et al., 2012) . Approximately  50% of all patients with HAE will experience a 
laryngeal attack in their lifetime, and there is no way  to predict which patients ar e at risk of a 
laryngeal attack (Bork et al., 2003 ; Bork et al., 2006 )
. 
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ,and severe pain; 
intestinal sy mptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may  lead to unnecessary  surgery  
(Zuraw, 2008 ). 
Approximately  85% of patients with HAE have Ty pe I HAE, characterized by  very  low 
production of functionally  normal C1 -INH protein, while the remaining approximately  15% of 
patients with HAE have Ty pe II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionall y 
impaired C1 -INH (Zuraw, 2008) . In patients with Ty pes I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma 
kallikrein generation results in excess brady kinin release from high -molecular weight kininog en 
(HMWK) and vascular leak mediated b y brad ykinin binding to the B2 receptor (B2 -R) on the 
surface of endothelial cells (Zuraw, 2008
). Clinical suspi cion of Ty pes I and II HAE can be 
confirmed b y available blood tests. In addition to abnormalities in C1- INH level and function, 
plasma C4 levels are often reduced in blood from most patients with HAE .
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX-2930
Plasma kallikrein play s a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks (Davis, 2006; Kaplan 
and Joseph, 2010). In normal phy siology , C1-INH regulates the activity  of plasma kallikrein as 
well as a variet y of other proteases, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor XIIa. Plasma 
kallikrein regulates the release of bradykinin from HMWK. Due to a deficiency of C1 -INH in 
HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity occurs and leads to the excessive generation of 
bradykinin. Brad ykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
HAE sy mptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain ( Craig et al., 2012; Zuraw et al., 
2013) . Intervening at the level of bradykinin production with a plasma kallikrein inhibitor 
therefore rep resents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy  for HAE. I ndeed, the 
importance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated through the observed 
effectiveness of Kalbitor®(ecallantide), a peptide that specificall y targets plasm a kallikrein, 
which was approved b y the FDA for the treatment of acute HAE attacks ( Kalbitor®, 2015). 
DX-2930 is a highly  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X -ray 
crystallograph y of DX- 2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX -2930 binding to 
the active site of kallikrein (Kenniston et al., 2014 )
.
1.4 Safety Rationale for DX -2930
Safety  data from the Phase 1a clinical study , a first -in-human study  with DX -2930 in health y 
subjects ,did not identify  any safet y concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX- 2930 were well -
tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, o r any  other safet y 
concerns identified.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX-
2930- 01) and Phase 1b (DX -2930- 02) 
clinical stud ies 
in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity  studies support a wide 
safet y margin. The mean C maxfor human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Day s 1 and 15 
was approximately  27g/mL. As comparison, a mean C maxof 744 g/mL was observed 
following dosing of monkey s with 50 mg/kg DX -2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekl y for 6 months
resulting in a safet ymargin of approximately  28-fold. No toxicologically  significant findings 
were observed in these treated animals or in any  other nonclinical toxicity  study  to date for
systemicall y administered DX -2930.
Safety  data is also available from the Phase 1b study (DX-2930- 02), a multiple -ascending dose 
study  in patients with HAE . In this study , two doses of DX
-2930 up to 400 mg administered 14 
days apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events in 
any DX-2930 treated subj ects, or an y other safet y concerns identified in this study  of patients 
with HAE . Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study  found that the drug exposure following two 
administrations of DX- 2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially  less than that 
attained and evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity  studies.

Investigator’s Brochure .

Brochure .
1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data
The clinical development program to date for DX -2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of DX -2930, including one completed Phase 1a single -ascending 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 38
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
dose study  in healthy  subjects and a Phase 1b multiple -ascending dose study  in patients with 
HAE . These studies are summarized in the following sections.
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects (DX -2930-01)
DX-2930- 01 was a Pha se 1a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in health y 
subjects to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active stud y drug within one of t he 
following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing cohort, 
6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo. 
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study  and were randomized. Th e treatment groups were 
well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX- 2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) across 
all cohorts.
Based on the safety  anal ysis, a si ngle administration of DX -2930 was well tolerated up to doses 
of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose
-limiting toxicity . There were no deaths, SAEs, or subject 
discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the stud y. Furthermore, there was no 
significa nt imbalance between placebo and DX -2930 for any  particular treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly  reported TEAE was headache, which occurred at a 
rate of 25% for both DX -2930 and placebo.
The PK profile demonstrated linear, dose -
dependent drug exposure with a mean half- life of 
approximately  17 to 21 day s across dose groups. Results from two exploratory  biomarker assay s 
provide evidence for an important pharmacod ynamic effect of DX -2930 in humans. 
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study  in healthy  subjects, please refer to 
the DX- 2930 Investigator’s Brochure .
1.6.2 Multiple -Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX-2930-02)
DX
-2930- 02 was a Phase 1b randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple ascending -
dose study  in patients with HAE to evaluate safet y, tolerability , and PK of SC DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study  drug or placebo within 
one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 400 mg (nominal 6 
subjects per cohort). Each subject received 2 doses of study  drug separated by  14 day s. 
A total of 37 subjects were randomized and treated with DX-2930 or placebo. One subject in the 
400 mg dose group received a single dose of DX- 2930 and, following several unsuccessful 
attempts to schedule their second dose, was replaced. This subject returned for a single follow -up 
visit before being lost to follow- up for reasons not related to the study . Routi ne C1- INH testing 
revealed that one other subject did not have HAE Ty pe I or II, despite a historical lab test 
indicating otherwise.
Subject demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity  and BMI . There were 
slightly  more females in the DX -2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 53.8%).

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
The most common AEs reported were HAE attacks, injection site pain, and headache. The rates 
were not appreciabl y higher in the DX -2930 subjects compared to placebo. Two subjects were 
reported to hav e 3 related severe TEAEs. One of these was a DX- 2930 subject (30 mg) with 
injection site pain lasting 1 minute and one was a DX-2930 subject (400 mg) with worsening 
headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats.
No safet y signals were identified for vital sig ns, phy sical examinations, clinical laboratory  tests, 
or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX- 2930 was well tolerated in this study  with 
no evidence of dose -limiting toxicity  at doses up to 400 mg.
A total of 3 out of 92 post -dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), were 
confirmed to be anti- drug antibod y-positive. No samples were positive for neutralizing activit y.
The pharmacokinetic analy sis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300 , and 400 mg doses showed drug 
levels in HAE subjects were dose -dependent and exhibited a prolonged half -life of 
approximately  2 weeks, ty pical of a human monoclonal antibody . Cmaxdrug levels increased with 
increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with values o btained in health y 
subjects in S tudy DX-2930 -
01.
A Western blot assay  showed pre -dose baseline levels of mean 2-chain HMWK in unactivated 
plasma collected from patients with HAE was approximately  50%. A statistically  significant 
reduction in 2 -chain HMWK levels was observe d on study  days 8 and 22 in the 300 and 400 mg 
dose groups compared to pre-dose levels, and approached levels similar to that observed in 
healthy  subjects. This outcome demonstrated the pharmacody namic activit y of DX- 2930 and its 
ability  to effectivel y nor malize the instability  of HAE plasma in this assay . 
Primary  efficacy  anal yses were based on subjects in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and placebo dose 
groups who reported having at least 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry  
(0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX -2930, 15 of 16 subjects 
met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these criteria. 
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo group, 
0.33 att acks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per week in the 400 mg group and 0.49 
attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre -specified, primary  
efficacy  interval of 6 weeks (from day s 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of not able drug 
exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted for baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300 mg group and 
0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in the placebo 
group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX -2930 group ( P< 0.0001) 
and an 88% reduction vs placebo for 400 mg DX-2930 ( P= 0.005). During this primary  efficacy  
interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P= 0.026) and 82% of subjects in the 400 mg 
group ( P= 0.03) were attack- free compared with 27% of subjects in the placebo group.
The data from this study  demonstrated proof of concept of the abilit y of DX- 2930 to prevent 
acute attacks of HAE. A statistically  significant finding of HAE attack prevention by  DX-2930 
was observed. DX -2930 was well tolerated in HAE subjects up to 400 mg. Drug exposure 
appeared to be dose -proportional and consistent with the results obtained in healthy  subjects in

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Study DX-2930- 01. Pharmacody namic effect assay s provided evidence that DX -2930 has a 
direc t effect on plasma kallikrein activity  in patient plasma.
For additional detail regarding Study  DX-2930-02 , please refer to the DX-2930 I nvestigator’s 
Brochure .
1.7 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Study DX-2930-04
The open
-label DX -2930 extension study  will be preceded by  the initiation of a pivotal, multi-
center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm stud y (Study  DX-2930- 03) 
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attac ks in patients with Ty pe 
I or T ype II HAE.  Further information on Study  DX-2930-03 design can be found in 
Appendix 
5.
Subjects who complete the Study  DX-2930-
03 treatment period will be offered the option of 
rolling into the open -label extension study , Study DX-2930-04.  In addition, a limited number of 
individuals with HAE Type I or Ty pe II who were not enrolled in Study  
DX-2930- 03 (up to 
approximately 100) will be also enrolled. 
The rationale for this open -label extension study  is to evaluate the long -term safet y of repeated 
subcutaneous treatment with DX -2930 and the long -term efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks .  For subjec ts rolling over from DX -2930-
03who were randomized to one of the 
active study  arms, the total duration of exposure across both studies will cover 18 months.  For 
rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX -2930 -03, and for non -
rollover subjects, the total 
duration of exposure will cover 12 months.  Combined, the overall exposure between Study  
DX-2930- 03 and 
Study  DX-2930-04 will provide a sizable dataset to evaluate DX -2930 as a life -
long, chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.  
This study  seeks to evaluate the outer bounds of DX-
2930 dosing frequency (possibly  beyond 
2to 4 weeks) by  assessing the duration of time between a rollover subject ’s first open- label dose 
and t heir first reported HAE attack .  In addition, characteristics of all HAE attack s will be 
reported and compared to the subject’s historical baseline (for non
-rollover subjects) or attack
history  based on attacks reported in Study  DX-2930 -
03 (for rollover subjects ).
For non -rollover subjects, t he study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of switching from a 
long-term prevention therapy  (eg, C1-INH, anti-fibrinoly tics, androgens) to DX -
2930 dosing, 
while evaluating breakthrough attack characteristics compared to historical baseline both prior to 
and during co -administration  with their L TP therapy  regimen and while receiving DX -2930 
alone .
For all subjects, the study  will also assess immu nogenicity  of chronically  administered DX -2930, 
PKand PD, subject health -related quality  of life (QoL), subject experience with self -
administration, and ease of SC administration with DX
-2930.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
3.1.1 Overview
Study  DX-2930-04 is an open -label, long term safety  and efficacy  extension study  of DX -2930-
03, to evaluate the investigational medicinal product ( IMP)
, DX-2930, in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Type II HAE. There are two ty pes of subjects 
who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from 
Study  DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not participants in Study  DX-2930- 03) 
Rollover S ubjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  182 of 
Study  DX-2930-03 and consent to enter Study  DX-2930-04.  Subjects who discontinue from
Study  DX-2930-03 after enrollment are not eligible to enroll in Study  DX
-2930 -04.  
Subjects should be asked about their interest in Study  DX-2930-04 after enrollment into Study  
DX
-2930-03 to anticipate enrollment and preparedness for Study  DX-2930 -04.  
Willing subjects 
must sign informed consent for Study  DX-2930- 04on or after Day  168 of St
udy DX-2930-03.  
Subjects who are eligible to roll over into Study  DX-2930-04 but elect not to, may
 not enroll in 
Study  DX-2930-04 at a later time .The first 
Study DX -2930-
04visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study  DX-2930 -
03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharge d from that study . No assessments conducted between Study DX-
2930- 03 Day  182 
study  visit and the first Study  DX-2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final 
DX
-2930- 03 assessments on Day  182 will be used as the pre- dose results for Day  0of Study  
DX
-2930-04.
All subjects, caregivers, investigators and study  site personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX-
2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of Study  DX-2930
-04.
Non-rollover subjects
At least 50 subjects ( to approximately 100) who were not participants in Study  DX-2930-03 will 
be permitted to enroll if they  meet the eligibility  requirements. Subjects who screen fail out of 
Study  DX-2930-03 for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run- in period 
must wait until e nrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for Study  
DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Study  DX
-2930-03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Study DX-2930- 03 when 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study
DX-2930- 03 due to aninability  to wash-out of their L TP, may  screen for Study  DX-
2930-04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Screening Per iod:
Rollover subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose.  Screened no n-rollover subjects (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1 -INH therapy  for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) or anti -fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexamic acid) ;a 
similar ta pering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged b y an additional 
week ,if medically  indicated ,aslong as androgen or anti -fibrinol ytic therapy  is stopped within 3 
weeks of receiving the first dose of DX -2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of DX-2930 administered subcutaneously  (SC)on Day  0. Subjects w ill not 
receive an y additional DX-2930 doses until their first reported and investigator confirmed HAE 
attack.  As such, the total number of doses within the treatment period will vary  by rollover 
subject.
The duration of time between the first open -label dose and first reported HAE attack will vary  by 
rollover subject.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study  Activities Schedule, for the 
entire duration of the study.  However, until a rollover subjec t reports their first HAE attack, onl y 
scheduled stud y visits where the following tests and assessments are performed must be 
conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory  testing, phy sical 
examination, 12- Lead ECG, Q oL, PK, P D and anti -drug antibody  sample collection.  All other 
scheduled study visits may be conducted via sit e check
-in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy , and HAE attack data .  See Study  Activities Schedule for which 
visits must be conducted at the study site .
Once a rollover 
subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -2930 as quickly  as subject and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be admi nistered within the accepted ± 4 day  window around a scheduled 
study  visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit .If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred ,the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit .  
In the event 
that the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ±4 day  window 
around a scheduled visit, the day  of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra study  visit 
(ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 44
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Regardle ss of the study  day, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX-2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, phy sical 
examination, clinical laboratory  testing, and blood sampling for PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody . 
Vital signs will be obtained at 1 hour post- dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be 
collected on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data.
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 10 
days between their first open- label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their second 
open -label dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -
label DX -2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment period per the 
scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedule. The treatment period will last 364days from 
the date of the first open -
label dose. The number of doses administered during this period will 
vary by subject based on the date of each subject’s second dose, but will not exceed 26 doses. 
The Day  350 study  visit is the last visit at which a dose may  be administered.
Non-rollover Subjects
Once all screening assessments have been completed and eligibility  confirmed, non -rollover 
subjects will arrive at the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open- label 
dose of 300 mg DX-2930 administered SC on Day 0 .  Non- rollover subjects will continue to 
receive SC administrations of open- label 300 mg DX-2930 every  2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period per the scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedule .  A 
total o f 26 doses will be administered with the last dose administered at the Day  350 study  visit.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 1 0 
days and maximum of 18 days between administrations, a nd should fall within the accepted ± 4 
day window around study  visits. 
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study  visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the 
opinion of the investigator requires medical intervention, standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject ’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- 2930 and study  procedures will continue without alteration to the protocol 
study  activities schedule, even if a subject receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema 
attack on the day  of a scheduled dose of study  drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study  
visit.
Self-Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment . Subjects must complete appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and have their understanding of the procedures confirmed b y the investigator or designee. 
Subjects are allow ed to initiate self- administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 45

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX-2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects 
may self-administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (whe n visits are 
scheduled stud y site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location ( when the study  
permits off -site dosing ).See theSchedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self-
administering DX-2930 will be supervised b y a paren t/legal guardian/caregiver. Alternativel y, a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver ,after completing appropriate training ,will be allowed to 
administer the investigational product to an adolescent without study site personnel supervision.
Site personnel will ca ll subjects within approximately  3 day s ofthe planned off-site self -
administration
sto ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, 
and to ensure all attacks have been appropriatel y documented .  Throughout the study , study  site 
personnel will document information in source documents (ie, the subject’s medical record) and 
eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC administration of DX -
2930.
Follow -up Period
After comple tion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 4-
week follow -up period. Figure 1shows a schematic of the open- label extension study .

Modifications to Open -Label Dosing
If,at an y time ,an important dose -related safety signal is identified either from this study  or 
Study  DX-2930-03, the Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et 
completed the treatment period, an d any subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label 
dose and/or frequency .
In addition, b ased on the results of Study  DX-2930 -03, the Sponsor may  switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency .
3.1.2 Stopping Rules
3.1.2.1 Study Level Stopping Rules
Safety  data, including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration of 
the study . If any  potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, or 
from an y safet y findings from Study  DX-2930-03, or following DS MB review, the Sponsor may  
take actions as deemed appropriate, including suspending dosing in the study , while the potential 
risk is evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
3.1.2.2 Individual Stopping Rules
Dosing for an y individual subject will be d iscontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-
2930- related SAE (or DX
-2930- related, clinically  significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator or DSMB recommendation , warrants discontinuation from further 
dosing for that subject’s well- being. 
The investigator has the ability  to contact and consult with 
the Medical Monitor on such matters. Subjects will continue to be followed through the 
completion of all scheduled non- dosing visits, unless they  request to be discontinued from the 
study .
3.1.3 Follow -up for Subjects Meeting Stopping Criteria
Subjects that develop either an SAE or other toxicity considered clinically relevant (AE, 
laboratory , phy sical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be carefully monitored until 
resolution, which may  include the following:
•Additional clinical laboratory  tests and/or other clinical investigations
•Additional visits or extended duration of follow -up
•Obtaining a specialist consultatio n
3.2 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Dose Selection
The dose selected for the open- label extension (300 mg every  2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pivotal, double
-blind DX -2930-
03study . If at an y time an 
important dose -related safety  signal is identified either from this study  or Study  DX-2930-03, the 
Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et completed the treatment 
period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label DX-2930 dose and/or 
frequency .
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 47
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Additionally , based on the efficacy results of Study  DX-2930-03, the Sponsor may switch to a 
different dose and/or frequency .
3.3 Individual Subject Dosing and Follow -Up
All subjects will receive open -label DX -2930 during 
a 364daytreatment period.  The number of 
doses that rollover subjects receive during this period will vary b y subject but will not exceed 26 
doses .  The last dose of open -label DX -2930 administered to these subjects may  be given at the 
Day 350 study  visit .  Non -rollove r subjects will receive DX
-2930 every  2 weeks for a total of 26 
doses, with the first dose administered on Day  0 and the final dose administered at the Day  350 
study  visit.
There will be a ± 4day window around each study visit. There will be a minimum of 10 days 
between an y two doses. Excluding the time interval between the first and second open -label 
doses for rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 days between any  two doses. Subjects 
will be monitored at the study  site through 1 hour post -dose.
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment after completing appropriate training by  the investigator or designee and
confirming their understanding. Subjects are allowed to initiate self-administration at the 
subject’s 
home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX-
2930 at the 
study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  continue to self -administer subsequent doses of DX-
2930. Subjects who elect to self -administer investigational product will be provided the 
necessary supplies (see Section 5.7 and Section 6.15.1 ).
3.4 Study Duration for Individual Subjects
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from Study  DX-2930 -03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within 4 weeks prior to the first open -label dose. Eligible subjects will be enrolled 
and undergo a 364 daytreatment period. At the conclusion of the treatment period, subjects will 
be followed for an additional 
4weeks .

4. STUDY POPULATION SEL ECTION
4.1 Study Population
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from Study DX -2930-03, as well as at least 50 (to 
approximately 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in Study  DX-2930-03.  The total
enrollment is 
expected to be at least 150, but not more than 250 HAE T ype I or II subjects.  
Subjects will be 12 y ears of age or older who experience at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE 
diagnosis will be confirmed through documented clinical history  and diagnostic testing 
conducted either during screen ing or during participation in S tudy DX-2930
-02 or S tudy DX-
2930-
03.
The subject population includes subjects who are 12 to 17 y ears old. L ike adults, children with 
HAE can suffer from recurrent and debilitating attacks. Sy mptoms may  present very  early in 
childhood, and upper airway  angioedema has been reported in patients with HAE as young as the 
age of 3 (Bork et al., 2003 ). In one case series of 49 pediatric patients with HAE , 23 had suffered 
at least one episode of airway  angi oedema by  the age of 18 (Farkas, 2010) . An important unmet 
medical need exists among children with HAE, especiall y adolescents, since the disease 
commonly  worsens after puberty  (Bennett and Craig, 2015 ; Zuraw, 2008) .  The study  will aim to 
enroll at least 15 
subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 12 
to 17 y ears old who are expected to roll over from Study  DX-2930-03.
4.2 Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening. 
2.Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Ty pe I or II) based on all of the following:
Documented clinical history  consiste nt with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompan ying urticaria).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX
-2930 study ) that 
confirm HAE T ype I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal level may  
be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may  be 
retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or believed by  the i nvest igator 
to be confounded b y LTP use. 
At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema s ymptoms 
≤30 years, a family  history  consistent with HAE Ty pe I or II, or C1q within normal 
range.
3.A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at le ast 1 attack per 12 weeks.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 49
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
4.Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form.  Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver has 
provided informed consent, are willing and abl e to read, understand and sign an assent form.
5.Males and females who are fertile and sexually  active must adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study  as follows:
Females *of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended to use 
highl y effective forms of contraception from the screening period through 30 days after 
the final study  visit .  This includes stable doses (for 3 months prior to study  screening) of 
combined estrogen and progestin -containing hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra- uterine device (IUD, all ty pes) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing s ystems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner 
has had a vasectom y must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable 
contraception. 2) Use of a male condom with or without spermicide or cervical cap, 
diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) arenot 
considered highl y effective.
Females of non- childbearing potential, defined as surgically  sterile (status post 
hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post- menopausal for 
at least 12 months do n
ot require contraception during the stud y.
Males, including males who are surgicall y sterile (post vasectom y), with female partners 
of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medicall y acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study  
visit. 
*NOTE:  Female rollover subjects (those who previously  participated in Study  DX-2930-
03) of childbearing potential may  continue to use the birth control method used during 
Study  DX-2930-03.
4.3 Exclusi on Criteria
Subjects who meet an y of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:
1.Discontinued from Study DX -
2930-03 after enrollment for an y reason.
2.If rolling over from Study  DX-2930-
03, presence of important safet y concerns that would 
preclud e participation in this study .
3.Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as acquired 
angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1 -INH (also known as HAE T ype III), idiopathic 
angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urt icaria.

4.Dosing with an investigational drug (not including DX-2930 or other HAE therapies )or 
exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior screening.
5.Exposure to angiotensin -converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to 
screening or any  newly  initiated or dose modification of estrogen -containing medications 
with sy stemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 
months prior to the screening visit .
6.Unwilling to discontinue use of long- term proph ylactic therap y for HAE (C1 -INH, attenuated 
androgens, or anti -fibrinoly tics) within 3 weeks 
after starting DX-2930 treatment .
7.Any of the following liver function test abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3x 
upper limit of norm al, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x upper limit of normal, or 
total bilirubin > 2x upper limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of 
Gilbert’s Sy ndrome).
8.Pregnancy  or breastfeeding.
9.Subject has an y condition that, in the opinion of the i nvestigator or Sponsor, may  
compromise their safety  or compliance, preclude successful conduct of the study , or interfere 
with interpretation of the results (eg, history  of substance abuse or dependence, a significant 
pre-existing illness or other major comorbidit y that the investigator considers may  confound 
the interpretation of study  results).

5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)
For detailed information regarding open- label DX-2930 (lanadelumab) administration, refer to 
the Pharmacy  Manual.
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate
dibasic dihy drate , 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM s
odium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of 150 mg DX -2930 
active ingredient in 1 mL solution .
For each 300 mg dose of DX -2930, each subject will receive a total of 2 mL (2 vials) , which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL  SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh 
or abdomen.
Self-Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of le arning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to 
self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and demonstrating the comprehension to self- administer. Subjects are allowed to initiate self-
administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first 2 
doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  continue to self -administer 
subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled study  site 
visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the stud y permits off -site 
dosing). See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self -administering 
investigational product will be supervised by  a parent/legal gu ardian/caregiver. Alternatively , a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver ,after completing appropriate training ,will be allowed to 
administer DX -2930 to an adolescent without study  site personnel supervision. Site personnel 
will call subjects within approximate ly 3 day s of the planned off -site self -administration sto 
ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all
attacks have been appropriately  documented .
Throughout the stud y, study  site personnel will document information in the subject’s medical 
record and e CRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC 
administration of DX -2930.
5.2 Dosing and Follow -Up Scheme
Details of subject dosing and follow- up are outlined in Section 3.1.1 and includ ed in the Study  
Activities Schedule, Table 1. 
Rollover subjects will receive their first open label SC dose of DX-2930 on Day  0.  Subjects will 
not receive an y additional DX-2930 doses until their first reported HAE attack. The second dose 
of DX
-2930 may be administered at an unscheduled visit if it is outside of the accepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit . Following this attack subjects will receive open label SC doses 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 52
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
of DX-2930 every  2weeks until the end of the treatment period. Subsequent dos ing after Dose 2 
requires a minimum of 10 day s and a maximum of 18 day s between administrations.
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their first open- label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -label 
300mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the trea tment period per the 
scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedule. The treatment period will last 364daysfrom 
the date of the first open -label dose. The number of doses administered during this period will 
vary by subject based on the date of each s ubject’s second dose, but will not exceed 26 doses. 
The Day  350 study  visit is the last visit at which a dose may  be administered. 
Non-rollover 
subjects will receive their first open- label dose SC dose of DX -2930 on Day  0 and 
will continue to receive SC a dministrations of open- label 
DX-2930 every  2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period.  A total of 26 
doses will be administered with the last dose 
administered at the Day  350 study  visit.
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 4-
week follow -up period.
5.3 Method of Identifying Subjects
Subjects meeting all eligibility
 criteria will be enrolled in the study  and sequentially  assigned a 
unique site -based identification number.
5.4 Prior and Concomi tant Therapy
For subjects not rolling over from Study  DX-2930-03, reasonable efforts will be made to 
determine all relevant treatmen ts received b
y the subject from 4 weeks prior to screening through 
the final study  visit . For subjects rolling over from Study DX-
2930-03, concomitant therapy  use 
will be carried forward from that study and will continue to be collected through the final study  
visit. 
All information on prior and 
concomitant therap y (including all prescription/non -prescription 
medications, herb al medications and vitamin supplements) must be recorded on the subject’s 
eCRF and should include the name of the procedure or drug and duration of the treatment (start 
and stop dates). Concomitant treatments (non- pharmacological treatments) include any  surgical 
or diagnostic procedures.
5.4.1 Allowed Therapies
The following therapies are allowed during the study :
•Therapies for co -existing conditions, including those for acute attacks of HAE, as described 
in Section 5.4.1.1 are permitted if not excluded in Section 5.4.2. The use of short -term 
prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated.  Short- term

procedure) proph ylaxis is defined as use of C1-INH to avoid angioedema complications from 
medically  indicated procedures.
•Therapi es to treat an y AEs the subject experiences during the stud y are permitted.
5.4.1.1 Management of HAE Attacks
Acute HAE attacks during the stud y are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therap ies that the investigator deems as 
medically  appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
LTP therapy . Administration of DX -2930 and study  procedures will continue without alteration 
to the protocol -specified study  schedule, even if the subject has s ymptoms of an HAE attack the 
day of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack . The administration 
of DX -2930 can also be re -scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum timeframe between 
doses are met based on patient preference or phy sician discretion.
5.4.2 Excluded Concomitant Therapies
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or 
anti-fibrinol ytics)once LTP is discontinued ( within 
3 weeks following first dose of 
DX-2930).
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
•Initiat ing or changing the dose of estrogen- containing medications with sy stemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy )3 months prior to the 
screening visit .
•Use of androgens 
(eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methy ltestosterone, testosterone) for 
non-HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation during the first 
3weeks .
•Any other investigational drug or device.

5.6 Treatment Compliance
All doses of open- label DX-2930 administered at the investigational site will be under the direct 
supervision of the investigator or qualified study  site personnel designated by  the i nvestigator.
Subjects 
are allowed to initiate self- administration at the subject’s home or other agreed u pon 
location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects 
may continue to self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when 
visits are scheduled study  site visits) or the subject’s hom e or other agreed upon location (when 
the study  permits offsite dosing ). Site personnel will call subjects within approximately  3 da ys of
the planned off -
site self- administrations to ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, 
concomitant medicatio ns, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriatel y documented. See 
Schedule of Activities for details. For all subjects, subsequent doses after the second dose require 
a minimum of 10 day s and maximum of 18 day s between administrations, and should fall within 
the accepted ±4 day  window around study  visits. 
For rollover subjects, after the second DX- 2930 dose is given either within the study  window 
(±4days) or an acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -
defined stu dy visit according to the schedule of assessments.
5.7 Packaging and Labeling
The open- label DX-2930 will be supplied by  the Sponsor and prepackaged in a study  kitfor 
investigational studies . Each study  kit will contain 1vial of investigational product.  Both the 
vials and carton (kit) will be appropriatel y labeled according to local regulations and bear the 
unique study  drug kit number. The investigative site will provide ancillary  supplies including 
syringes, needles, and alcohol wipes to subjects. The site has the option of using needles of a 
different gauge to aid subject comfort with each SC injection. Subjects who elect to self -

study  will provide consent 
on or after Day  168 of S tudy DX-2930-03. Upon completion of the 
final assessments, the subjects will be discharged from the double -blind study  and will start 
participation in the OLE study  and receive their first open -label dose.
6.2
Eligibility Review
The investigator or qualified study  site personnel will confirm tha t all I nclusion and Exclusion 
criteria have been met.
6.3 Demographics and Medical History
Demographics: date of birth (alternately  age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be 
collected for legal reasons), sex, race ,and ethnicity  (where locall y permitted) and medical 
history  will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from Study  DX-2930-
03and 
will be recorded on the source document and eCRF. Medical history  will capture the subject’s 
current medical status (current disease proces ses), past medical status (past disease processes), 
history  of surgery , allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling over from Study  
DX-2930-
03, these data will be carried forward from that study . 
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection
The colle ction, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  S tudy site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site.
Study site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
subject (and caregiver ) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non
-rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average severit y, 
predominant attack location(s ), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy  use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 57
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack . This includes the first attack experienced by  
rollover subjects following their first open-label dose.  In the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by  a family 
member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by  the subject,
memory  aids may be provided to assist in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced, but their use is 
not mandatory .
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
•Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
•Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
•Impact on activit y (work, school, social interactions) and whether an y assista nce or medical 
intervention was required, including hospitalizations
, additional laboratory  tests, or 
emergency  department visits
•Any medications used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter)
•If the attack resolved, date and time the su bject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms
Study sitepersonnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Study site personnel will contact rollover subjects approxim ately  every  7days following the first 
dose of open- label until the subject has received their second open label dose.  This is to insure 
accurate reporting for any  HAE attacks not already  reported by the subject as required within 72 
hours .  During each study  visit , study  site personnel will solicit for any  new HAE attack 
information that was not alread y provided to the site.
In this stud y, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity , 
or causal relationship to DX-2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Any AE 
reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event. For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or 
physician designee will review the event within 24 hours of initial notification and, in 
accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack. For all non- serious 
AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or phy sician designee will review the 
event within 3 day s of initial notification and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it 
represented a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee 
may contact the subject to receive additional information. Any subject -reported attack not 
confirmed b y the investigator or phy sician designee must have an alternate AE diagnosis 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 58
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
recorded.  All subject- reported and investigator / phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will 
be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital admissions 
will be captured.
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have sy mptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea
•Lary ngeal a ngioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx
Despite the presence of these s ymptoms, the investigator or ph ysician designee may  still 
clinically  determine t hat the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well b eyond the 
typical time course of an HAE attack, or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’s abdominal s ymptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct f rom the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s sy mptoms.
6.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs prior to dosing and at 1 hour post -dosing 
(±15 min) will be assessed by  the 
investigator or his/her qualified de signee according to the Study  Activities Schedule ( Table 1) 
unless the subject has elected to self -administer off-site for t hat visit .
Routine vital sign 
assessments will be taken with the subject in the sitting or supine position after 5 minutes at rest 
and will include body  temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and respiratory  rate 
(RR). BP should be determined using the same arm and the same equipment for each assessment.  
For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-
2930- 03, vital signs taken dur ing the final study  visit 
in Study  DX-2930-03 will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose vital signs in this study  and will not be 
duplicated.   
6.6 Physical Examination
A phy sical examination including height, weight ,and calculation of Bod y Mass I ndex (BMI) 
will be performed b y the investigator or his/her qualified designee according to the Study  
Activities Schedule ( Table 1). The ph ysical examination will be performed in accordance with 
standards at the site .

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 63
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
assessments obtained during the final stud y visit in Study  DX-2930- 03 will serve as the Day  0 
pre-dose quality  of life assessments in this study  and will not be duplicated.
6.14.1 Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE- QoL)
The AE- QoL is a self -administered, symptom -specific tool developed and validated to assess 
quality  of life (QoL) impair
ment in patients with recurrent angioedema ( Weller et al., 2012 ). The 
AE-
QoL consists of 17 questions covering four domains/dimensions (functioning, fatigue/mood, 
fear/shame, nutrition). Each of the 17 items has a five -point L ikert-type response scale ranging 
from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The AE -QoL is scored to produce a score for each domain and 
a total score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger impairment. I t takes 5 
minutes to complete the AE -QoL.
6.14.2 EuroQoL 5 -Dime nsional 5 -Level Measure (EQ-5D-5L)
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered standardized measure of health status comprised of a 
descriptive s ystem and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive s ystem con sists of five 
health related quality  of life dimensions (ie, mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety /depression). Each dimension is rated on a 5 -point response scale (5 levels) indicating 
severit y of problems, where 1 is “no problems” and 5 is “extreme problems”. The EQ -5D VAS is 
a measure of overall self -rated health status on a 20 -cm vertical VAS with endpoints labelled 
“the best health you can imagine” and “the worst health y ou can imagine”. The VAS ranges from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better overall health.
6.14.3 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI- GH)
Questionnaire
The WPAI -GH is a 6- item instrument assessing work and activity  impairment due to health 
problems during the past 7 day s. The instrument elicits four main scores in relation to general 
health specifically : absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one's health in 
the past seven day s), presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced while at work in 
the past seven day s because of one's health), overall work productivity  loss (an overall 
impairment estimate that is a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity  
impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activities because of one's heal th in the past 
seven day s) (Reilly  et al., 1993). Adolescent subjects should complete the WPAI  questionna ire 
and use the term “school” instead of “work” when filling out this questionnaire.  These data will 
be anal yzed separatel y.
6.14.4 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
The Hospital Anxiety  and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-assessment scale to detect states of 
depression, anxiety ,and emotional distress amongst patients who were being treated for a variet y 
of clinical problems ( Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). The scale has a total of 14 items. Seven of the 
items relate to anxiety  and seven relate to depression.  The responses are scored on a scale of 0 –3 
(3 indicates higher s ymptom frequencies). Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0–7, mild 8 –10, moderate 11 –14, 
and severe 15–21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher 
scores indicating more distress. This scale reflects how a subject has been feeling during the past 
week.

6.14.5 12 Item Short Form v2 Health Survey (SF -12v2)
The SF -12v2 Health Survey  is a reliable and valid generic measure of functional health and well -
being. The SF -12v2 consists of 12 questions, all selected from the SF -36 Health Survey  (Ware et 
al., 1996 ). The SF -12v2 y ields eight health domains (vitality , phy sical f unctioning, bodily  pain, 
general health perceptions, phy sical role functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental 
health summary  measures. Phy sical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) can be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score 
indicates the lowest level of health measured b y the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of 
health. The standard form of the instrument asks subject s to reply  to questions according to how 
they have felt over the last 4 weeks.
6.15 DX-2930 Injection Report and Self-Administration and S ubcutaneous Injection 
Survey
Assessments of subject experience with self- administration and SC injections of DX -2930 will 
be conducted.
6.15.1 DX-2930 Injection Report
The investigator or de signee will train 
subjects who elect to self- administer DX -2930 on the 
following :
•Transportation and recommended storage conditions of investigational product from the 
study  site to the offsite location.
•Maintenance of accurate records regarding each administration of investigational product 
including supply  identification (ie, lot/kit number), date and time of injection, injection site 
location, infusion time, and if applicable, any reason the self-admini stration could not be 
completed as instructed.
•Retention of all used and unused vials of investigational product for drug accountability  
purposes.
After receiving appropriate training and demonstrating their understanding of self -
administration, subjects are allowed to self -administer DX -2930 after receiving the first 2 doses 
of DX -2930 at the study  site (administered by  study  personnel). For those subjects who choose to 
self-administer or have a parent/legal guardian/caregiver administer DX- 2930, subjects must 
complete an assessment of their experience with self- administration and subcutaneous injection
for each dose received . Study  personnel will document the subject’s responses in the subjects’ 
medical record and eCRF.
6.15.2 DX-2930 Self -administration and Sub cutaneous Injection Survey
Subjects will complete an assessment on their overall experience with self -
administration and 
experience with receiving SC injections of DX -2930 according to the Study  Activities Schedule
during the stud y. For subjects who have p reviously received LTP with C1 -INH products via IV
administration, they  will be asked to indicate the preferred route for medication administration. 
Study  personnel will document the subject’s responses in the subjects ’medical record and eCRF. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 65

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Inaddition, investigators will be asked to indicate their preference (SC, IV, or no preference) on 
the route to administer medications to prevent angioedema attacks.
6.16 Adverse Event Reporting
Adverse events will be collected from signing of the informed conse nt through the last study  
visit.
6.16.1 Definitions
6.16.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject whether or not it appears to 
have a causal relationship with the treatment administered. 
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
participation in a clinical study , whether or not directly  related to the medicinal product or study  
participa tion.
•AEs may be new events or may  be pre -existing conditions that have become aggravated or 
have worsened in severity or frequency  during the course of the stud y.
•AEs may  be clinicall y significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory  
tests, or other diagnostic investigation (eg, laboratory  results, x -ray findings).
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significa nt laboratory  
abnormality  that is independent from a known underly ing medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-2930 interruption or discontinuation, will in 
itself, be considered an AE. Laboratory  or diagnostic t esting abnormalities that reflect or are part 
of a known underly ing medical condition are not, in themselves, AEs; rather, the underl ying 
medical condition leading to the abnormalities would be reported as the AE.
Pregnancy  is not an AE; however, if a fema le subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of 
the study , the i nvestigator must notify  the Sponsor according to the procedures provided in 
Section 6.16.5.2.
6.16.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
A SAE is any  adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any  
of the following 
outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that might 
have caused death if it were more seve re.
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Note: Does not 
include hospitalization for observation with release within 24 hours. A scheduled 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 66
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
hospitalization for a pre- existing condition that has not worsened during p articipation in the 
study  does not meet this criterion. Pre -planned hospitalizations for an elective 
medical/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion.
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
•Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
•Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may  jeopardize the subject or may  
require intervention to prevent one of the ou tcomes listed in the definition above.
6.16.1.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a 
product. The dosing for this study  will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and an 
overdose is not anti cipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study , an overdose of 
DX-2930 is considered a dose that is two -fold higher than the intended dose for the subject.
6.16.1.4 Planned Hospitalization
A hospitalization planned by  the subject prior to the first dose of open- label DX-2930 is 
considered a therapeutic intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as 
medical history . If the planned hospitalization or procedure is executed as planned, the record in 
the subject’s medical history  isconsidered complete. However, if the event/condition worsens 
during the trial, it must be reported as an AE.
6.16.1.5 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)
An AE is treatment -emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open- label DX-
2930
through the final follow -up visit or, in the event that onset time precedes first DX
-2930 
administration, the AE increases in severit y during the open- label treatment period.
For rollover subjects, an y adverse event that started during the subject’s participation in Study  
DX-2930-03 and was ongoing at the time of the first open- label dose in Study  DX-2930-
04will 
not be counted as an AE in Study  DX-2930-04 unless that event has worsened in severit y or 
frequency  following the first open-label dose.  Adverse events that started during subject 
participation in Study  DX-2930-03, resolved following the first open
-label dose in Study  DX-
2930-04
, and then subseque ntly reappeared in Study  DX-2930-04 will be counted as a new 
TEAE in 
Study  DX-2930-04 .
6.16.1.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Investigators will report all AESI  to the Sponsor , regardless of causality , using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting. The following describe the AESI and the criteria for 
reporting AESI. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 67
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS
As hy persensitivity  reactions have been observed for monoclonal antibodies as a class, these 
events are considered AESI  for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with hy persensitivity  
reactions, regardless of causality , within 24 hours from the time of study drug administration. 
Investigators will report hy persensitivity  reactions that occur after 24 hours, only ifthe reactions 
are suspect ed to be related to study drug.
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION
Bleeding AESI
Although aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro
phenomenon, as a precautionary  measure in evaluating the safet y of DX-2930 , bleeding events 
will be reported as AESI for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event of 
bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and when 
temporally  reasonable, with any  reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly  indicative 
of bleeding.
Hypercoagulable AESI
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent wit h a thrombotic or embolic etiology . 
6.16.2 Monitoring
6.16.2.1 Monitoring of Adverse Events
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow- up visit.
•Subjects will be questioned and/or ex amined b y the investigator or a qualified designee for 
evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence of AEs 
will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  The presence 
or absence of sp ecific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.
•Subjects having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory  tests, as determined by  the i nvestigator.
•AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow -up resul ts must be recorded in the eCRF as 
well as in the subject's source documentation. Follow -up laboratory  results should be filed 
with the subject's source documentation.
For an y SAEs or AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant c linical 
assessments and laboratory  tests will be repeated as clinically  appropriate, until final resolution 
or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all 
scheduled visits.

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
6.16.2.2 Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments
All safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed at a central laboratory . The clinical 
laboratory  values will be reported to the investigator who will review them for clinical 
significance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AE s.
6.16.3 Assessment of Adverse Events
6.16.3.1 Assessment of Severity
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe m yocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of relatively  minor 
medical significance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usuall y associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.
In this stud y, the severity of AEs will be assessed according to Division of Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National 
Institutes of Health: National I nstitute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 1 , 
Appendix 2 ) and the Division of Microbiology  and I nfectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric 
Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National I nstitutes of Health: National Institute of 
Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3 ). For abnormalities not specifically  found in the 
Toxicity  Tables, the following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severit y:
•GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention/therap y required
•GRADE 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity  -some assistance may  be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy  required
•GRADE 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity , some assistance usuall y required; medical 
intervention/therap y requ ired, hospitalizations possible 
•GRADE 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme limitation in activity , significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention/therap y required, hospitalization or hospice care probable
Any treatment -emergent ECG abnormalit y that is considered b y the investigator as clinicall y 
significant and requiring intervention/therap y will be assessed as a severe AE.
All HAE attacks will be captured as AEs and assessed with DMID & HAE Attack Assessment 
and Reporting Procedures (HAARP) criteria.
6.16.3.2 Assessment of Causality
A medicall y qualified investigator must assess the relationship of an y AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of DX-
2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available 
information, and may include c onsideration of the following factors:
•Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre -existing 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors.
•The temporal association between DX-2930 exposure and onset of the AE.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 69
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
•Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity  of 
DX-2930.
•The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping use of DX-2930
(dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.
The causal relationship between DX-2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories:
Not Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:
Temporal relationsh ip is lacking (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of 
DX-2930); or
Other causative factors more likely  explain the event (eg, a pre -existing condition, 
other concomitant treatments).
Related:   Factors consist ent with an assessment of Related include:
There is a positive temporal relationship (eg, the event occurred within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX-2930); or
The AE is more likel y explained by administration of DX-2930 than b y another 
cause (ie, the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of 
DX-
2930 or the class of DX-2930).
6.16.3.3 Assessment of Clinical Significance
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined b y the investigator, with discussion 
with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.
6.16.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant labor atory  
abnormality  that is independent from a known underly ing medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-2930 interruption or discontinuation, will be 
considered an AE.
When laboratory  abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity  Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMID Pediatric Toxicity Tables ( Appendix 3 ) will be used to assess severit y. 
Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lower limit of normal (LLN) of 
laboratory  ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of the laboratory  
that performs the assay s, the values provided by  the laboratory  will be used for assignment of 
severit y grade. Clinical significance of individual laboratory  AEs wil l be determined by  the 
investigator with input from the Medical Monitor as needed. 
Following is an exception to defining clinically  significant, abnormal laboratory values as AEs:
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 70
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
APTT prolongation in the absence of an y associated bleeding or other eviden ce of clinical 
relevance will not be considered a clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  or AE. In the 
appropriate ph ysiologic setting, such as IV heparin therapy , aPTT can be used to monitor 
bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT prolongation due to 
plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro phenomenon. Although plasma kallikrein 
drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay , plasma kallikrein -driven coagulation does not 
appear to have hemostatic or other ph ysiologically  important functions in vivo . It is well 
documented that, in humans, deficiency  of factor XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma 
kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgical 
procedures ( Renne and Gruber, 2012 ). Despite the lack of clinical effect, defi ciency  of either 
protein is associated with marked prolongation of the aPTT. 
6.16.5 Reporting Investigator Safety Observations to the Sponsor
6.16.5.1 Reporting Non -serious Adverse Events
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or causal relationship to DX-2930 , will be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF. In this study  all HAE attacks reported b y the subject, regardless of 
whether or not they  are confirmed by  the investigator, will be captured as AEs.
6.16.5.2 Reporting Pregnancies
If a female subject or the female part ner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the course of 
the study , the 
investigator must report the pregnancy  to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department using the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within 24hours of becoming aware of the 
event. The i nvestiga tor must obtain consent to collect pregnancy  information (including the 
status of the newborn, if applicable).
If some of the information required for completion of the Pregnancy  Reporting Form is 
unavailable at the time of the initial report, follow- up re ports will be completed and submitted 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new information. The investigator is required to 
follow the pregnancy  through delivery . The outcome of the pregnancy  and the status of the 
newborn (if applicable) will be report ed on the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within 24 hours of 
becoming aware.
6.16.5.3 Safety Observations Requiring Expedited Reporting by the Investigator to 
the Sponsor
Any occurrence of the following events or outcomes in a subject in the trial must be reported 
expedit iously  by the investigator or qualified designee to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department:
•SAE
•AESI
•Overdose
•Cancer
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 71
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
The investigator is to report any  expedited safet y observations from the list above to the Sponsor
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event.
Any SAE reported to the Sponsor Pharmacovigilance Department using the SAE Reporting 
Form in the EDC s ystem is to be recorded in the eCRF, as well as in the subject's source 
documentation along with any  actions taken. If all required information on the form is not 
available at the time of the initial report, follow -up information will be completed in the EDC 
system.
The investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the subjects 
are still participating in the study . SAE resolution is defined as:
•Resolved with or without residual effects.
•A return to baseline for a pre -existing condition.
•Laboratory  values have returned to baseline or stabilized.
•The investigator does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event.
•Fatal outcome —if an autopsy  is performed; the autopsy  report is requested to be provided to 
the S ponsor as soon as it is available.
6.16.5.4 Expedited Reporting by the Sponsor to a Regulatory Health Authority
The Sponsor or designee will report relevant safety  information to concerned health authorities 
in accordance with local laws and regulations.
6.16.5.5 Safety Contact Information
24-Hour Global Safety Contact: Pharmacovigilance Department
Email :
Telephone (US) 
6.16.5.6 Safety Notifications by the Sponsor to the Investigator
Investigators will receive prompt notification of any adverse experience related to DX-
2930 that 
is both serious and unexpected, or an y finding that suggests a significant risk for subjects. The 
investigator will promptly inform his / her IRB/REB/IEC of the notification and insert the 
notification in the I nvestigator’s Regulatory  Binder in accor dance with local regulations. 
6.17 Subject Withdrawal
The investigator may  withdraw a subject from DX -2930 treatment for any  of the following 
reasons:
•In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is unable to comply with the requirements of 
the protocol for satisfactory  completion or interpretation of study  results (including use of 
prohibitive medications)
,
•A serious or intolerable AE occurs,

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 72
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
•A clinically  significant change in a laboratory  parameter occurs,
•The Sponsor or i nvestigator terminates the study , or
•The subject requests to be discontinued from the study .
Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all scheduled visits , unless the 
subject requests to be discontinued from the stud y.
6.18 Appropriateness of Measurements
This is a Phase 3 open- label extension study  that is designed to evaluate the long -term safet y and 
efficacy  of DX -2930 in prophy lactic therapy  for angioedema attacks in subjects with HAE. 
DX-2930 is a recombinant, fully  human IgG1, kappa light chain, monoclonal antibody . The 
open -label, non -controlled study  design is a standard approach for extension studies that follow 
double -blind pivotal trials. Measures employ ed in this protocol are standard measures routinel y 
used for the evaluation of the efficacy , safet y and tolerabil ity of an investigational product.  
Measures employ ed for rollover subjects between the first and second open -label doses are 
appropriate to characterize the outer bounds of dosing frequency  for DX -2930.

7.4 Dose 2 of DX-2930 for Rollover Subjects
The duration of time between Dose 1 and Dose 2 will vary by subject based on when their first 
HAE attack occurs following Dose 1.  As a result, rollover subjects may  not receive DX-2930
treatment at every dosing visit as outlined in the Study  Activities Schedule.
Once a rollov er subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of 
DX-2930 as quickly  as subject and site schedules allow.  This 
treatment visit may  be counted as a scheduled study  visit, or as an acce ptable extra study  visit.  
For details on determining whether the second dose is counted as a scheduled or extra study  visit, 
refer to Section 3.1.1.  Regardless of when the second dose is administered, the following tests 
and assessments will be conducted pre-dose on the day  it is administered :

9.1 General Considerations
All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS®Version 9.3 or higher (SAS I nstitute, Cary , 
North Carolina, USA).
For categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects within each category  (with a 
category  for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous 
variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standa rd deviation (SD), minimum, and 
maximum values will be presented. Where applicable, estimates from statistical model of least 
squares means, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals for least squares means will be 
provided. Time -to-event data will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estimates of the 25th, 50th 
(median), and 75th percentiles with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals, as well as 
percentage of censored observations. Plots of the Kaplan -Meier curves and supporting data 
listings detai ling each subject’s contribution to the anal ysis will be provided. 
Formal h ypothesis testing will not be performed.  Any hypothesis testing will be exploratory  in 
nature and resulting p -values will be considered descriptive.
9.2 Sample Size Determination
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open- label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03 (rollover subjects) 
and individuals who were not otherwise able to participate in Study  DX-2930 -
03 (non- rollover 
subjects) .

2930-04 and received any  study  drug after entering Study  DX-2930-04 (ie, any  exposure to 
open -label DX -2930).  Unless otherwise specified, summary  tabulations conducted with the 
Non-rollover Safet y Population will be presented by subject’s prior t ype of LTP therapy  prior to 
study  entry  (C1-INH, androgens, a nti-fibrinol ytics, and not on L TP).
9.5 Population Description and Exposure
9.5.1 Subject Disposition
The numbers of subjects treated with stud y drug, completed the study and discontin ued 
prematurel y by reason will be summarized for each anal ysis population.
9.5.2 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Baseline and demographic variables will be summarized for each anal ysis population.
9.5.3 Medical History
Medical history  will be coded using Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
and summarized by  system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each analy sis 
population.
9.5.4
Treatment Exposure and Compliance
Treatment compliance and the extent of exposure to study drug will be described by  the 
percentage of planned doses received b y the subject, total number of doses received b y the 
subject, and the number and percentage of subjects that received at least 80% of planned doses, 
summarized for ea ch analy sis population.

Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary  
(WHO-DD) .  The number and percentage of subjects with prior or concomitant medications will be 
summarized by therapeutic class and preferred term for each analysis population.  A separate, 
similar table will be provided for the subset of concomitant medications classified as rescue 
medications.
9.6 Analysis of Efficacy
9.6.1 Time to the First Investigator -confirmed HAE At tack
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack will be anal yzed using the Rollover Safet y 
Population.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 97
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (day s) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -2930 to the date and time of the first investigator-
confirmed HAE attack after the first open -label dose.  Subjects who discontinue the study  prior 
to experiencing their first on- study  investigator -confirmed HAE attack will be censored at the 
date and time of stud y discontinuation.  Time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE attack will 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods.
Multivariate and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be employed to 
examine the impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE 
attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering Study  DX-2930-
03, the 
treatment group in Study  DX-2930-03, the time since the last dose given in Study  DX-2930-03, 
the time since t he last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during Study  DX-2930- 03 
. Results of 
this exploratory  anal ysis will be summarized.  
9.6.2 Number of Investigator
-confirmed HAE Attacks
The number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day  0 through 
Day 364) expressed as a monthly  HAE attack rate, will be anal yzed using each analy sis 
population.
The treatment period investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the treatment period 
divided by  the number of day s the subject contributed to the treatment period multiplied by  28 
days.  
The baseline investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject as the 
number of investigat or-confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the pretreatment period for 
rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non- rollover subjects divided by  the number of 
days the subject contributed to the pretreatment period for rollover subjects or histo rical 
reporting period for non -rollovers multiplied by  28 day s.
The baseline, treatment period, and treatment period change from baseline in the investigator -
confirmed HAE attack rate will be summarized for each anal ysis population. The summary  will 
includ e the total number of investigator -
confirmed HAE attacks reported during each period and 
subject -time in months that each subject contributed to each period. Figures will be created for 
each anal ysis population plotting the on -study  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks reported 
during the treatment period relative to Day  0 for each subject.
In addition, the number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks per month (defined as 28 day s) 
will be summarized descriptively  by month (per 28 day  interval) for each analy sis population. 
The summary  will include the number, change from baseline, and percent change from baseline 
of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks. Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks will be grouped into 
28-day intervals using the start date of the HAE atta ck. The date of the first exposure to study  
drug in this study  will be used as the start of the first interval and end of the interval will be the 
date of first exposure to study  drug in this study  plus 28 day s. Each successive interval will start 
the last day of the prior interval plus 1 day  and end 28 day s later.

Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Similar summary  tables will be presented for the following efficacy  endpoints for each anal ysis 
population:
•Number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.
•Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period.
•Number of high- morbidity  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high -morbidity  HAE attack is defined as any  attack that ha s at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation < 24 
hours), hemod ynamicall y significant (s ystolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hy dration, or 
associated with s yncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal.
9.7 Analysis of Safety
9.7.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary .  Separate summaries will be 
presented for each anal ysis population.
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. For AEs with partial onset ti mes, non- missing date parts will be used to determine if 
the AE is treatment- emergent or not.  If a determination cannot be made using the non -missing 
date parts as to when the AE occurred relative to study  drug administration, then the AE will be 
classifi ed as treatment -
emergent.
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator.  Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.
For this anal ysis, AEs will be classified to one of two analysis periods:
•Treatment Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the first exposure to open -label
DX-2930 in this study  to those starting before or at the subject’s last visit date during the 
treatment period in this study  (AEs starting at or after treatment on Day  0 to the Day  364
visit). 
Follow -up Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the subject’s last visit date of the 
treatment period in this study  (AEs starting after the Day  364 visit). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 99
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
For AEs with partial onset times, non-missing date parts will be used to determine if the AE falls 
withi n the period. If a determination cannot be made using the non -missing date parts as to if the 
AE falls within the period, the AE will be conservatively  counted as a treatment- period AE. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an y AE, any related AE, an y SAE, an y related SAE,  
any severe AE,  and any  related severe AE will as well as the total number of events for each 
category  will be summarized for each anal ysis period .  The number of deaths due to an AE, 
hospitalization due to an AE and study  disconti nuation due to an AE will be summarized for 
each anal ysis period . 
The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be 
summarized by  SOC, and PT for each anal ysis period. This tabulation will be repeated for 
relate d AEs, SAEs, related SAEs, severe AEs, and related severe AEs for treatment pe riod and 
follow -up period AEs. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be 
summarized for treatment period AEs only . This tabul ation will be repeated for related AEs and 
serious AEs for treatment period AEs. 
All AEs will be provided in subject listings. L istings will be presented separatel y for each 
analysis period.  In addition, subject listings of AEs causing discontinuation of study  medication, 
AEs leading to death, SAEs, related AEs, severe AEs, and AEs of special inte rest (AESIs) will 
be produced. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study  are h ypersensitivity reactions and 
disordered coagulation (hy percoagulab ility events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQ) for each AESI  will be performed using the study  data. The number and percentage 
of subjects with an AESI, as well as the total number of AESIs, will be summarized by SOC and PT
for each analy sis period. Separate summary tables will be created for each AESI  and for those 
events with the SMQs classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and related severe.  A 
listing detailing the PT within the SMQ will be provided.
9.7.2 Laboratory T est Results
Laboratory  test results will be summarized using the Safety Population.
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value prior to the first exposure to DX -
2930. For rollover 
subjects previously exposed to DX -2930, baseline is the last non -miss ing value prior to first exposure 
to study drug in Study  DX-2930-03.        
Actual values and change from baseline clinical laboratory  tests will be summarized by  study  
visit. If more than one laboratory result is reported per study visit per parameter, t he last non- missing 
result will be selected for analysis .
Laboratory  test results will be classified according to the reference ranges and clinical significance as 
determined by  the investigator. The number of subjects with a non -missing result, and the nu mber 
and percentage of subjects with a clinically significant result less than the lower limit of normal, non -
clinically  significant result less than the lower limit of normal, within the normal range, non -

clinically  significant result more than the upper limit of normal, and clinically significant result more 
than the upper limit of normal will be summarized by study visit. If more than one laboratory result is 
reported per study visit per parameter, the result yielding the most severe classification will be 
selected for analysis. 
Categorical laboratory  test results (urinalysis excluding pH) will be summarized by  study  visit. I f 
more than one laboratory result is reported per study  visit per parameter, the result y ielding the 
most severe classification wil l be selected for analy sis. 
Subjects with clinically  significant abnormal laboratory test results will be listed.  This listing 
will include all results of the laboratory parameter that was abnormal and determined to be 
clinically  significant b y the inves tigator for a subject across study  visit to identify  any trends.
9.7.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be summarized using the Safety Population.
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first exposure to DX- 2930. For 
rollover subjects previou sly exposed to DX -2930, baseline is the last non- missing value prior to 
first exposure to study  drug in 
Study  DX-2930-03.
Actual values and changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by  study  visit and 
study  time point. All vital sign data wil l bepresented in subject listings.
Vital sign values will be classified according to clinical significance as determined by the 
investigator. The number of subjects with a non -missing result, and the number and percentage of 
subjects with a non -clinically significant result and clinically significant result will be summarized by 
study  visit and study  time point. If more than one vital sign result is reported per study visit and study 
time point per parameter, the result yielding the most severe classificat ion will be selected for 
analy sis. 
Subjects with clinically significant vital sign values will be listed.  This listing will include all results 
of the vital sign parameter that was determined by the investigator to be clinically significant for a 
subject across study  time points to identify  any trends.

the items related to depression and anxiety , will be summarized by  study  visit.  Each item in the 
questionnaire is scored from 0
-3, with total sc ores between 0- 21 for either depression or anxiety . 
Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) will also be presented.  Total score for the entire 
scale range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.
Responses to the WPAI -GH for ea ch item will be summarized by  study  visit.  I n addition, four 
main scores in relation to general health will be summarized by  study  visit. Scores will be 
calculated as absenteeism (percentage work time missed due to health), presenteeism ( percent 
impairmen t while working due to health
), 
work productivity  loss ( percent overall work 
impairment due to health ), and activit y impairment (percent activity  impairment due to health ).  
The scores are percentages with higher values indicating greater percentage impair ment.  Only  
respondents who report being full- time or part -time employ ed provide data for absenteeism, 
presenteeism, and overall work productivity  loss.  All respondents provide data for activity  
impairment.

Responses to the AE -QoL for each item will be tabulated by  study  visit.  In addition, the domain 
scores (functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, nutrition) and total score will be summarized by  
study  visit. Each item in the questionnaire is scored from 0- 4, with domain and total scores 
calculated usin g a linear transformation to a 0 -100 sc ale.
9.9 Statistical/Analytic Considerations
9.9.1 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Interim anal yses may  be conducted to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory  
reporting when a reasonable number ofsubjects have completed 12 months of consecutive 
exposure to DX- 2930 across the combined DX -2930 -03 and DX -2930- 04 studies, and only  after 
database lock of Study  DX-2930-03. 
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide 
ongoing , independent review and assessment of the safet y data for Study  DX-
2930-03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study ,summary  safety  data from Study  DX-
2930-04 may be reviewed by  theDSMB established for Study  DX-2930- 03 as part of the 
collection of safety
 information available on DX -2930.
9.9.2 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity
No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed.  An y statistical testing will be 
considered exploratory .
9.9.3 Handling of Missing Data
All available data w ill be included in the anal ysis.  No imputation of missing data will be 
performed.
9.9.4 Adjustment for Covariates
The impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE attack will 
be explored to identify  and assess the importance of potential prognostic factors.
9.9.5 Multicenter Studies
Data from all study  sites that participate in this protocol will be combined so that an adequate 
number of subjects will be available for analy sis.
9.9.6 Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup anal yses are planned for the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the 
treatment period and adverse events using the Safety  Population. The following subgroups will 
be used:
•Age Group (<18, 18 to <40, 40 to <65, ≥65 years)
•Sex (Male, Female)
•Race Group (White, Other)
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 103
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
•Weight Group (<50, 50 to <75, 75 to <100, ≥100 kg)
•BMI Group (<18.5, 18.5 to <25, 25 to <30, ≥30 kg/m2)
•Baseline HAE Attack Rate (1 to <2, 2 to <3, ≥3 attacks/month)
•HAE T ype (T ype I, T ype II, Unspecifi ed)
•Geographic Region (US, Canada, Jordan, Europe)
•DX-2930 Administration Ty pe (Health Care Provider, Self -administration)
9.9.7 Sensitivity Analyses
The following sensitivity anal yses will be performed on the number of investigator -confirmed 
HAE attacks during the treatment period for each anal ysis population to evaluate the robustness 
of the results. Data summaries will parallel those described for th e number of investigator-
confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period efficacy  endpoint.  
1.The analysis will be repeated counting HAE attacks occurring on Day  14 after administration 
of study  drug through Day 364, instead of Day  0 to Day  364.  For thi s analy sis, the period of 
analysis would be a subset of the treatment period, defined as Day  14 to Day  364.
2.The anal ysis will be repeated counting HAE attacks occurring on Day  7 after administration 
of study  drug through Day  364
, instead of Day  0 to Day  364. For this anal ysis, the period of 
analysis would be a subset of the treatment period, defined as Day  7 to Day 364.
3.The anal ysis will be repeated using all subject reported HAE attacks instead of limiting the 
analysis to those attacks that were investigat or
-confirmed.

10.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The procedures set out in this clinical study  protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and 
the investigator abide b y the principles of the International Conference on Harmo nisation (ICH) 
guidelines on GCP, applicable local regulatory  requirements, and the Declaration of Helsinki 
(Version 2008). The clinical study  also will be carried out in keeping with national and local 
legal requirements [in accordance with United States Investigational New Drug (IND) 
regulations (21 CFR 56)].
10.3 Subject Information and Consent
Before each subject is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
according to the regulatory  and legal requirements of the participatin g country . As part of this 
procedure, the i nvestigator must explain orally  and in writing the nature, duration, and purpose 
of the study , and the action of the drug in such a manner that the study  subject is aware of the 
potential risks, inconveniences, or AEs that may  occur. The study  subject should be informed 
that he/she is free to withdraw from the study  at any  time. He/she will receive all information 
that is required b y federal regulations and ICH guidelines. Subjects who are under the age of 18 
(or lower if age of consent is less than 18 in a specific country) and whose legal guardian or 
caretaker has provided written informed consent will provide their assent to participate. The
investigator or designee will provide the Sponsor with a cop y of the IRB /REB/IEC -approved 
informed consent form prior to the start of the study .
10.4 Subject Confidentiality
The anon ymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be specified on study  
documents by  their subject number, initial or birth date (if al lowed based on local data protection 
regulations), not by  name. Documents that identify the subject (eg, the signed informed consent 
document) must be maintained in confidence b y the investigator.
The investigator agrees not to use or disclose protected he alth information other than as 
permitted or required b y the subject authorization or as required b y law.
10.5 Study Monitoring
The Sponsor (or designee) will conduct a stud y initiation visit to verify the qualifications of the 
investigator, inspect the facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures 
for ensuring adequate and correct documentation.
The investigator must prepare and maintain adequate and accurate records of all observations 
and other data pertinent to the clinical study  for each study  participant. Frequent communication 
between the clinical site and the Sponsor is essential to ensure that 
the safety  of the stud y is 
monitored adequatel y. The investigator will make all appropriate safet y assessments on an 
ongoing basis. The Medical Monitor may  review safet y information as it becomes available 
throughout the stud y.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 106
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
All aspects of the stud y will be carefully  monitored with respect to GCP and SOPs for 
compliance with applicable government regulations. The Study  Monitor will be an authorized 
individual designated b y the Sponsor. The Study  Monitor will have access to all records 
necessary  to ensure integrity  of the data and will periodicall y review the progress of the stud y 
with the i nvestigator.
10.6 Case Report Forms and Study Records
The investigator will ensure the accuracy , completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to 
the Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure 
completeness, accuracy , reliability , and consistency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of 
all data changes. The investigator or designee will cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) 
for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy  and completeness of the data 
capture s ystem at each scheduled monitoring visit.
Electronic consistency  checks and manual review will be used to identify  any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the clinical sites by  means of 
electronic or manual queries.
The investigator or desi gnee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study  documents 
(medical records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection forms, 
etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject receiving 
randomized study  drug.
The investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory  
authority  inspectors, and the I RB/REB/IEC to have direct access to all documents pertaining to 
the study .
A Trial Master File will be maint ained b y the Sponsor (or designee). All documents and other 
materials that pertain to the conduct of the trial quality  of the data, and compliance with GCPs 
will be collected in the Trial Master File.
10.7 Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide 
ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safet y data for Study  DX-2930-
03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study , summary  safety  data from Study  DX-
2930-04 may bereviewed by  theDSMB established for 
Study  DX-2930- 03 as part of the 
collection of safety
 information available on DX -2930. 
The DSMB will adhere to a prospectively determined Charter, which will be written b y the 
Sponsor and approved b y the DSMB. The Cha rter will define the responsibilities of the DSMB 
and Sponsor, the number and timing of the DSMB meetings, the conduct of the meetings, and 
the data sets to be reviewed by  the DSMB. Further details regarding the DSMB can be found in 
the DSMB charter.

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
10.8 Prot ocol Violations/Deviations
The investigator will be instructed not to deviate from the protocol, except where necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study  participants. Should other unexpected circumstances 
arise that will require deviation from pro tocol -specific procedures, the investigator should 
contact their Sponsor representative to discuss the appropriate course of action. 
The investigator should document all protocol deviations/violations in the subject’s eCRF and 
source documents or the Inve stigator Site File if appropriate. In the event of a significant 
deviation/violation, the i nvestigator should notify the Sponsor representative. Significant 
deviations/violations include, but are not limited to those that increase the health risk to the 
subject, or confound interpretation of primary  study  assessments. The investigator will promp tly 
report all changes in research activity  and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human 
subjects or others to his or her IRB/REB/IEC.
10.9 Premature Closure of the Study
If the Sponsor, investigator, or regulatory  authorities discover conditions ari sing during the stud y 
which indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacceptable subject risk, 
the study  may  be terminated overall or at a specific site after appropriate consultation between 
the Sponsor and the investigator(s). In addition, a decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend 
or discontinue development of the investigational product may  be made at any  time. Conditions 
that may  warrant termination of the study  or site include, but are not limited to, the following:
•The discovery  of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study
•Failure of the investigator to comply  with pertinent global regulations
•Submission of knowingly  false information from the study  site to the Sponsor or other 
pertinent regulatory  authorities
•Insufficient adherence b y the investigator to protocol requirements
10.10 Access to Source Documentation and On -Site Audits
Regulatory  agencies may request access to all study  records, including source documents, for 
inspec tion and cop ying, in keeping with country  regulations. The investigator should 
immediately  notify  the Sponsor representative of any  announced or unannounced regulatory  
agency  inspections. An auditing inspection may  also be conducted b y the Sponsor representative 
or designee. An y aspect of the trial may  be subject to audit by  the Sponsor and/or inspection by  
regulatory  authorities or the I RB/REB/IEC. Such audits/inspections may  take place at the 
Sponsor’s site(s), the CRO, or at the clinical sites, including
laboratories, pharmacies and an y 
other facilities used for the study . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 108
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
The investigator will be responsible for the accuracy  of the data entered in the eCRF. The 
investigator will permit the designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory  bodies to have
direct access to the source documents to verify  data represented in the eCRF.
10.11 Data Generation and Analysis
This study  will be performed in accordance with regulatory  requirements outlined in Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) 21CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 54, 21 CFR Part 56, 21 CFR Part312 
and 21 CFR Part 11 as well as the I CH GCP E6 Guidelines. The study  monitors will meet with 
the investigators and staff shortly  before the start of the trial to review the procedures for study  
conduct and documentation. Du ring the study , the monitors will visit the sites to verify  record 
keeping and adherence to the protocol. For this study , eCRFs will be used. The monitors will 
conduct 100% source document verification by  comparing the eCRFs with the source documents 
to ensure accuracy  and consistency . Edit check programs, other forms of electronic validation, 
manual listings and a query  process will be executed to verify  the accuracy  of the database. The 
EDC sy stem will maintain a full audit trail of electronic data change s. Access to all source 
documentation will be made available for monitoring and audit purposes.
10.12 Retention of Data
All source documents (eg, informed consent forms, laboratory  reports, progress notes, medical 
histories, phy sical and diagnostic findings, diagnosis and pharmacy  records, and DX-2930
dispensing/disposition records) that support data in the eCRFs of each st udy subject must be 
retained in the files of the responsible investigator.
According to ICH guidelines, essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an I CH region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an I CH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the DX-
2930. However, these documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by  the applicable legal requirements.
If the responsible i nvestigator retires, relocates or for any  other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keeping the study  records, custody must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The Sponsor representative must be notified in writing of the name and 
address of the new custodian, prior to the transfer.
10.13 Financial Disclosure
The investigator is required to disclose an y financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year 
after, whereb y the out come of the study  could be influenced by  the value of the compensation for 
conducting the study , or other pay ments the investigator received from the Sponsor. The 
following information is collected: an y significant payments from the Sponsor or subsidiaries
such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, retainer for 
ongoing consultation or honoraria; an y proprietary interest in investigational product; any 
significant equity  interest in the Sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 CFR 54 2(b) ( 1998).

The study was expanded to allow  subjects to self -administer d oses of DX -2930 
without supervision after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study site.  
Subjects must be considered suitable candidates; receive training; confirm 
understanding; and record specific information regarding subcutaneous 
administra tion and experience w ith self -administration.  Subjects w ho elect to self -
administer investigational product will be provided w ith supplies and be instructed 
on investigational product transport, storage, treatment compliance, and retention 
of all used and unused product vials for drug accountability purposes. Written 
instructions on DX -2930 handling and self -administration procedures w ill be 
provided to trained subjects prior to initiating self- administration.   Vital signs will

Since no data on embryo -fetal development toxicity are available for DX -2930, 
the clinical trial facilitation group’s (CTFG) provided recommendations related to 
contraception and pregnancy testing.  The inclusion criterion for contraception 
requirements was modified to emphasize the use of highly effective contraceptive 
measures and details for allowances (including stable estrogen doses) during 
treatme nt and until the end of relevant systemic exposure for w omen of 
childbearing potential. It was also clarified that the use of a male condom with or 
without spermicide or cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide or a 
combination (double- barrier methods) is not considered highly effective.  
Additional pregnancy tests (urine or serum) were also added for monitoring of 
pregnancy during treatment.Synopsis Criteria for 
Inclusion, Section 4.2
Management of acute attacks was clarified to indicate that a dministration of the 
investigational product and study procedures will continue without alteration to 
the protocol -specified study schedule, even if the subject has HAE symptoms or 
receives treatment for an HAE attack.Synopsis, Management of 
Acute Attacks , Section

DIVISION OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS 
DISEASES (DMID) ADULT TOXICITY TABLE  
NOVEMBER 2007  
DRAFT
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and 
should not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of the items that must be taken into 
consideration:  
•The population being studied
oDoes the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects ,
 subject s with a particular disease
or condition?
•The stage of test article development
oIs the clinical tr ial a Phase I, II, III or IV?
•The type of  test article
oDoes the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vacci
ne or  other biologic agent?
•The prior human and preclinical experience with the
 test article
oAre there any specific findings that require adjustment 
of the toxicity table?
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy 
subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal 
values  at the single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal 
values when evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when 
selecting or developing a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no m edical intervent
ion/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in 
activity - some assistance may be needed; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually requ ired; medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospitalizations possible 
GRADE 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, 
significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice 
care probable  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE -THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by the clinician
 to be serious or life -threatening should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening 
include, but are not limited to:  seizures, coma , tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acute psychosis, 
severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’ s 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), a
nd World Health Organization (WHO)) have 
been adapted for use by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 
(DMID) and modified to better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 
•  For parameters not included in t
he following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to 
the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 
• Criteria are generally grouped by
 body system.  
 
• Some protocols may have additiona
l protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.

DRAFT  
 1  
 
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and should 
not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of 
the items that must be taken into consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects , subj
ects with a particular disease or 
condition?  
• The stage of test article dev elopment  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I  (is it for the fisrt t
ime in human subjects?) , II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vaccine 
or other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical experience with the  test a
rticle  
o Are there any specific findings that require adjustment of  the 
toxicity table?  
o Has it been approved for this indication in adult populatio
n? 
  
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy subjec
ts should conform to the laboratory normal values  at the 
single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal values when 
evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DM
ID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when selecting 
or developing a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate 
grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in activity - 
some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospitalizations possible  
GRADE 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, significant 
assistance  required; significant medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospitalization or hospice care probable  
GRADE 5                              Death  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE- THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by the c
linician to be serious or life -threatening  should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening include, 
but are not limited to:  seizures, coma, tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acut e psychosis, severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxic
ity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’s Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have been adapted for 
use by the Div isi on  of Microbi ology  an d Infectiou s Di seases (DMID) an d m odified to 
better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 •  
For parameters not included in the 
following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to the 
“Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally grouped by b
ody system.  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these ta
bles for specified criteria.

1 PURPOSE 
This document applies to clinical trials that involve investigator adjudication/assessment of 
angioedema attacks. The purpose of this document is to provide a definition of an HA E 
attack and to define a standardized set of procedures for the reporting and assessment of events reported by subjects to determine whether those events are true HAE attacks.  
2 DEFINITION OF AN ATT ACK  
To be confirmed as an HAE attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an attack in at least one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary region 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx 
Despite the presence of these symptoms, the inv estigator may still determine clinically that 
the event did not represent an HAE attack if there are features that strongly refute such a 
diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by symptoms that are not consistent with an attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typical time course of an attack (e.g., greater than 7 days), or there is a likely alternate etiology  for 
the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from their previous attack, the new symptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.  
Attack resolution is defined as the subject no longer having symptoms of the attack. Prodromal symptoms by themselves are not considered an attack. Patient report of use of acute HAE attack treatment for an attack by itself is not confirmation 
that an attack occurred.  
3 REPORTING AND ASSESSMENT OF ATTACK DATA  
At screening for applicable clinical trials, subject HAE attack history will be collected by the 
site for entry into the clinical database. Information collected will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, predominant location(s), average duration, acute attack therapy use, and history of long- term prophylaxis.  
During the relevant study periods, as defined in the applicable study protocol, subjects (or caregivers, for subjects < 18 years old) will be instructed to c ontact the site within 72  hours 
of the start of symptoms of an attack. In the situation that a subject is incapacitated and is 
Confidential  Page 3 of 8 Dyax Corp.  
Page 147
DX-2930   
HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
   
 
unable to contact the site, a family member or other individual with detailed knowledge of 
the event can provide the information. If desired by the subject, m emory aids may be 
provided to assist in tracking any HAE attacks subject ’s experience. Any tools or devices the 
subject uses to track this information are not intended to serve as source documents for the study.  
Site personnel will review the information provided by the subject or caregiver and solicit 
additional information as necessary to document the attack.  Information documented by the site will be considered source for the study.  
A designated individual at the site (the collector) will contact the subject or caregiver on a 
regular basis as defined in the study protocol, regardless of whether or not the subject has 
reported any attacks, in order to solicit for any attacks that may have occurred but were not reported. In addition, during each study visit, site personnel will solicit for any new attack information that was not provided through previous contact with the subject or caregiver . 
The Investigator or designee (the assessor) will review the attack information  and evaluate if 
the event represents a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee may contact the subject to receive additional information.  
3.1 Subject-Reported Symptoms 
Subjects and caregivers can use any exi sting methods by which they track information about 
their attacks , or, if requested, memory aids can be provided by the study site. However, 
subjects (or a caregiver) will need to track attacks in such a way as to be able to contact the study site as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours (3 full days) after the first symptoms appear, to report the information. 
3.1.1  Attack Information  
The following information should be provided by the subject (or caregiver) at the time they 
are reporting an attack to the site: 
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced  
• Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s) 
• Impact on activity and whether any assistance or medical intervention was required , 
including hospitalizations or emergency department visits  
• Any medications used to treat the attack  
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms  
Subjects do not have to wait for their symptoms to completely resolve to report an attack. 
Information about ongoing symptoms can be obtained by the site during the check- in call 
and/ or at a scheduled study visit. Subjects should not withhold or delay any treatment they would normally receive to treat their attack in order contact the site.

HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
   
 
3.1.2  Worsening Symptoms  
The site may request the subject call them back if they experience worsening symptoms 
and/ or new symptoms for a reported attack. Otherwise, the new information will be captured during the next check -in call or scheduled study visit. Subjects may contact the site on their 
own to provide information about any worsening symptoms. 
3.1.3  Subject Training  
During screening, site personnel will train subjects on identifying symptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to provide.  The 
patient will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting attacks to the site.  Sites will assess the subject’s compliance with the reporting requirements throughout the study and may retrain the subject if necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the data provided to the site. 
3.1.4  Reporting Multiple Attacks  
If a subject experiences symptoms they attribute to more than one unique attack they can 
report this as multiple attacks to the site.  Based on the definition o f an attack as stated in 
Section  2, it will be the determination of the investigator or designee as to whether events 
reported as being separate are confirmed as separate attacks or not.  
3.1.5  Caregiver Report  
During screening, site personnel will train subject caregivers (if applicable)  on identifying 
symptoms of an attack, the requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to  provide.  The caregiver will confirm their understanding of what is required of 
them for reporting attacks to the site.  Sites will assess the caregiver’s compliance with the 
reporting requirements throughout the study and may retrain the caregiver if necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the data provided to the site.  
3.1.6  Subject Contact with Sites  
Site personnel will establish a recommended method and time window for each subject to contact the site to report any symptoms of an attack. Sites will establish a primary contact person and, if possible, a back-up person, with contact information. Back- up plans, including 
call backs and/ or use of back -up contacts, should be established in case the subject is unable 
to reach someone at the site.  
3.2 Site Contact with the Subject 
Sites will establish a reco mmended day and time window for check -in calls between  study 
visits. The date and time for check-ins can be modified based on when the last contact with the subject was made, as outlined in the study protocol. When the site is contacted by a subject reporting symptoms of an attack the site should make sure they have the ability to record the information provided in a complete and accurate way. Back -up plans should be 
Confidential  Page 5 of 8 Dyax Corp.  
Page 149
DX-2930 
HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
established in case the subject misses a call from the site. A study schedule for each subject’s 
on-site visits will be provided to the subject by the site.  
3.2.1  Review of subject report of symptoms  
During contact with the subject, whether subject- initiated or a regular check -in, site 
personnel should ask the subject to provide them information about new or ongoing HAE attacks experienced.  
The site will try to obtain all information necessary to document the attack completely. Missing information may impact the assessment of any attack  and should be avoided 
whenever possible. 
3.2.2  Documenting a Reported Attack  
Complete and accurate documentation of each repor ted attack is important to making an 
Investigator assessment of the attack. The site should document the following information 
about each attack reported by the subject or caregiver :  
•Date and time of contact with the subject
•Date and time the subject firs t experienced symptoms
•Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s)
•Impact on activity and whether any assistance was required
•If the attack has resolved or is ongoing.  If the attack has resolved, the date and time the
subject was no longer experiencing any symptoms of the attack
•Names of any medications used to treat the attack including HAE acute therapy or othernon-HAE treatments
•If hospitalization occurred
•If a trip to the emergency department occurred
Additional probing questions about what the subject experienced to determine:  
•If the subject only experienced prodromal symptoms
•If  the subject experienced anything different than their typical attack
•If there were any possible alternative etiologies of the symptoms. For example, a viralgastroenteritis outbreak in the household could explain abdominal symptoms
The overall severity of the subject’s attack will be determined by the site using the following 
definitions: 
- Mild: Transient or mild discomfort  
- Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance needed  
- Severe: Marked limitation in activity, assistance required  
Confidential  Page 6 of 8 Dyax Corp.  
Page 150
DX-2930 
HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
The site will also document the date and time of investigator or designee review, the official 
designation of the event as an attack or not, and if applicable, the reason why an event is not considered an attack.  
All reported attacks will be entered by si te personnel into the electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). 
3.2.3  Site Training  
Site personnel responsible for collecting attack information about subject HAE attacks will 
need to pass a “Collector” training assessment covering the following: 
•definition of an HAE attack
•requirements of subjects and caretakers for reporting attacks
•reporting worsening symptoms and multiple attacks
•information to be collected from subjects and caregivers as well as the additional probing
questions to gather context for the attack information provided
•assessment of attack severity
•entry of the attack data into the eCRF
•reporting HAE attacks as adverse events
•requirements for Investigator assessment of attacks
Trainings will be conducted prior to sites screening subjects.  Trainings will be documented 
in the Trial Master File. Investigators and designees will be trained on these procedures as 
well and must pass an “Assessor” training in order to officially assess attacks for this study. 
All responsible persons involved in the collection of information from subjects or assessing attacks must be listed on FDA Form 1572. 
3.3 HAE attacks as Adverse Events  
At the time of each contact and scheduled study visit, site personnel will ask if the subject 
experienced any adverse events or changes to the medications they are taking.  
HAE attacks will be captured as AEs .  All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or causal 
relationship to study drug, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. 
Any AE reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious  adverse event must be reported to 
Dyax using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event.  For all serious adverse events that are reported as HAE attacks, the Principal 
Investigator or physician designee will r eview the event within 24 hours of initial notification 
and, in accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack.  
For all non- serious AEs that are reported as HAE attacks, the Principal Investigator or 
physician designee will review  the event within 3 days of initial notification and, in 
accordance with HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the Investigator or designee may contact the subject for additional 
Confidential  Page 7 of 8 Dyax Corp.  
Page 151
DX-2930 
HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP)  14 September  2015  
information. Any subject-reported attack not confirmed by the Investigator must have an 
alternate AE diagnosis recorded.  All subject- reported and Investigator -confirmed HAE 
attacks will be recorded in the eCRF . 
4 INVESTIGATOR ATTACK ASSESSMENT 
The Principal Investigator for a stud y site may identify a physician designee to assess patient 
symptom information and make attack determinations. Sites should be limited to two individuals responsible for assessing attacks, one of them being the Principal Investigator. Assessors must be exp erienced with HAE and familiar with the study subject’s disease 
history.  
The assessor must review the information and determine whether the event is an actual attack 
or not. If needed, the assessor can contact the subject and/or caregiver to clarify infor mation 
or ask for any additional detail. The determination will be documented along with the date and time the determination was made. Any event deemed not an attack must be accompanied by an explanation and alternative diagnosis by the assessor.  
When rev iewing subject information, the assessor will follow the definitions of an attack as 
outlined in these procedures and, taking all available information about the event into 
consideration, will determine if it is a confirmed attack. The assessment of the attack is the Investigator or designee’s own, and not the opinion of the subject, the subject’s caregiver or any other site personnel. Assessors may consult with one another about a particular subject’s attack but only one assessor makes the documented determination. It is possible for both the Principal Investigator and physician designee to assess different attacks for the same subject.

APPENDIX 5 Summary of Pivotal Study DX-2930-03 in Subjects with HAE
The proposed pivotal clinical study  (Study  DX-2930 -03) is entitled “HELP StudyTM: A 
Multicenter, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo
-Controlled Efficacy  and Safety  Study  to 
Evaluate DX -2930 For Long -Term Prophy laxis Against Acute Attacks of Hereditary  
Angioe dema (HAE).” This study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled parallel -arm study  evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I or Ty pe II HAE. The double -blind study  is plan
ned to 
be followed b y the stud y described in the present protocol, an open -label extension (OLE) study
(DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of S tudy DX-
2930- 03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in 
preventing HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to e valuate the safet y of repeated SC 
administrations of DX- 2930. The tertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic effects 
of chronically  administered DX -2930; to assess the immunogenicit y of chronically administered 
DX-2930; to evaluate the pharmac okinetics of chronically  administered DX -2930; and to 
evaluate the effect of DX -2930 upon quality  of life assessments.
Subjects aged 12 years and over with a documented diagnosis of Type I or Type II HAE who 
experience at least 1 attack per 4 weeks will be eligible for the study . Up to 120 subjects are 
planned for enrollment across approximately  60 sites in the United States, Canada, Ital y, 
German y, United Kingdom and Jordan.
Following informed consent, subjects will undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who are on 
long-term prophy lactic therapy  for HAE are required to undergo a minimum 2 week washout 
period prior to the start of the run -in period.  Subjects who are either not on long -term 
prophy lactic therapy  for HAE, or have completed the required washout period will enter a run -in 
period of 4 weeks to determine the baseline HAE attack rate. The run -in period may  be extended 
to 8 weeks if the minimum baseline attack rate is not achieved in the first 4 weeks. HAE subjects 
will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) administrations of DX
-2930 
or placebo in a double -blind fashion.  Subjects who are randomized to DX -2930 will be assigned 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  4 weeks or 
150 mg every  4 weeks.  Each subject will undergo a treatment period consisting of 13 doses of 
blinded study  drug, for a period of 26 weeks from the date of first dose on Day  0 through Day  
182
Subjects may  consent to rollover into the OLE study (present protocol D X-2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks 
observed in each DX -2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the ef ficacy  
assessment period (Day  0through Day  182).

Figure 2Overview of the Design of Pivotal Study DX-2930-03
Dose Rationale for Double -Blind, Pivotal Study  DX-2930-03
The dose rationale is based on the pharmacod ynamic bioactivity, PK, safety, and efficacy of DX -
2930 from the Phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical studies. Together, these attributes provide 
the rationale for the selected doses and regimens to achieve drug levels likely  to prevent a 
majority  of HAE attacks. Based on these considerations, 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  4 
weeks, and 150 mg every 4 weeks were identified as the dosing regimens for evaluation,
The 3 proposed dose -regimen combin ations provide a 6
-fold range of steady -state trough 
concentrations and leverage both the biomarker and efficacy  data generated in S tudy DX-2930-
02.  Evaluation of the DX- 2930 plasma concentrations at the time of attacks reported b y DX -
2930 treated subject s in DX -2930-
02 suggests that the 3 planned dosing regimens will provide a 
meaningful range of clinical response while avoiding non- therapeutic or super -therapeutic doses 
and regimens .

A brief exit interview has been added to obtain information about subjects’ 
overall experience with DX -2930 studies and any changes in signs and 
symptoms during the between -attack period and related changes to subject 
health.Section 6, Table 1, Table 2
The treatment period has been extended from 12 to 30 months to 
accommodate the additional changes to the study described above. Entire protocol, Table1, 
Table 2, Section 7
Table 2 has been added to present the schedule of assessments to be 
performed from Day 365 through Day 952. To reduce site burden, the 
frequency of required on- site visits in the second year has been reduced 
relative to the first year.  Key refinements represented in Table 2 include:
The frequency of on -site visits has been decrease d so that subjects are 
only required to come to the clinic once every 2 months (instead of once 
a month or once every third visit, as appropriate for each subject)
The requirement that each attack be confirmed by the investigator within 72 
hours for non -serious AE attacks has been expanded to 7calendar days. 
(Note: This refers only to confirmation of attacks, notreporting of SAEs or 
AEs.)   ECGs will be assessed through Day 364, at the end of the study, and 
when clinically required.Table 2
For purposes of internal consistency , Table 1 also reflects the updated 
requirement that each attack be confirmed by the investigator within 7 
calendar days for non- serious AE attacks.Table 1
A clarification note has been added to Inclusion Criteria 2 to ensure proper 
documentation occurs for subjects previously treated with C1 -INH:
“It is understood that C1 -INH therapy may alter the lab results of C1 -INH and 
investigator's discretion in collaboration with Medical Monitor is advised for 
proper documentation of eligibility.”Synopsis , Table 1, Section
4.2, Section 6.8.1.6
Potential modifications to open -label dosing have been expanded to include 
the following: “In addition, an individual subject’s dose may be modified 
based on a benefit -risk assessment and recommendation from the treating 
physician. Consultation with and ap proval by the Sponsor's Medical Monitor
is required.”Synopsis , Section 3.1.1
The following subgroup analysis has been added to the statistical section for Section 9.9.6

Study Design:
Study  DX-2930- 04 is an open -label, long -term safety  and efficacy  extension study  of Study  
DX-2930-03, to evaluate the investigational medicinal product (IMP), DX- 2930, in preventing 
acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Ty pe II HAE. There are two types of 
subjects who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from Study DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not participant s in Study DX-
2930- 03) 
Rollover Subjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  182 of 
Study DX-2930- 03 and consent to enter Study DX-2930- 04.  Subjects who discontinue from 
Study DX-2930- 03 after enrollment are not eligible to enroll in Study DX-2930 -04.  
Subjects should be asked about their interest in Study DX-
2930- 04 study  after enrollment into 
Study DX-2930- 03 to anticipate enrollment and preparedness for Study DX-2930-04. 
Willing 
subjects must sign info rmed consent for Study DX-2930- 04 on or after Day  168 of Study
DX-2930-03.  
Subjects who are eligible to roll over into Study DX-
2930- 04 but elect not to, may  not enroll in 
Study DX-2930- 04 at a later time. The first Study DX-
2930- 04 visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as the Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study DX
-2930 -03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharged from that study. No assessments conducted be tween the Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 
study  visit and the first Study DX-2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated. Results of the final 
Study DX-2930- 03 assessments on Day  182 will be used as the pre -dose results for Day  0 of 
Study DX-2930-
04.
All subjects, caregivers, investigators and study  site personnel will remain blinded to the Study
DX-
2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of Study DX-2930- 04.
Non-rollover subjects
At least 50 subjects (to approximately  100) who were not participants in Study DX-2930- 03 will 
be permitted to enroll if they  meet the eligibility  requirements. Subjects who screen fail out of 
Study DX-2930-03 for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run- in period 
must wait until enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for Study
DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 8
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Study DX-2930- 03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Stud yDX-2930- 03 when 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study  
DX-2930- 03 due to an inability  to wash- out of their L TP, may  screen for Study DX-2930-04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.
Screening Period:
Rollover Subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover Subjects
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose. Screened non- rollover subjects (adults an d 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1-INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH. ( It is 
understood that C1- INH therap y ma y alter the lab results of C1 -INH asses sments; therefore, the 
investigator's discretion in collaboration with Medical Monitor is advised for proper 
documentation of eligibility ). For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) or anti-
fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexamic acid), a similar ta pering schedule is recommended. However, the 
taper can be prolonged by  an additional week, if medically  indicated, as long as androgen or anti -
fibrinoly tic therapy  is stopped within 3 weeks after receiving the first dose of DX-2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC) on Day  0. Subjects will 
not receive an y additional DX -2930 doses until their first reported, and investigator-confirmed 
HAE attack. As such, the total number of doses within the treatment period will vary  by rollover 
subject.
The duration of time between the first open -label dose and first reported HAE attack will vary  by 
rollover subj ect.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study Activities Schedules ( Table 1 
andTable 2) for the entire duration of the stud y.  However, until a rollover subject reports their 
first HAE attack, onl y scheduled study visits where the following tests a nd assessments are 
performed must be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  
testing, ph ysical examination, 12 -Lead ECG, QoL, PK, PD, and anti- drug antibody  sample 
collection. All other scheduled study  visits may  be cond ucted via site check -in calls to collect 
information on adverse events, concomitant therapy , and HAE attack data.  See Study  Activities 
Schedules ( Table 1 andTable 2 ) for which visits must be conducted at the study  site.
Once a rollover subject reports th eir first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -2930 as quickly  as subject and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day  window around a scheduled 
study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit (ie, an 
unscheduled visit).  Similarly , if the second dose is administ ered outside of the accepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit, the day  of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 9
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
unscheduled stud y visit, (ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit). 
Regardless of the stud y day, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX -2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, phy sical 
examination, clinical laboratory  testing, blood sampling for PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody . 
Vital signs will be obtained at 1 hour post- dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be 
collected on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data. 
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their f irst open -label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second open- label dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of 
open -label 300 mg DX-2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment per iod 
per the scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedules. The treatment period will last up to 
924 day s from the date of the first open-label dose. The number of doses administered during 
this period will vary  by subject based on the date of each sub ject’s second dose, but will not 
exceed 66 doses. The Day  910 study  visit is the last visit at which a dose may  be administered. 
Non-rollover Subjects
Once all screening assessments have been completed and eligibility  confirmed, non -rollover 
subjects will arrive at the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open- label 
dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered SC on Day 0. Non- rollover subjects will continue to 
receive SC administrations of open- label 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period per the scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedules.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 
10days and maximum of 18 day s between administration s and should fall within the accepted 
±4 day  window around study  visits.
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study  visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the 
opinion of the investigator requires medical intervention, standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- 2930 and study  procedures will continue without alteration to the protocol 
study  activities schedules, even if a subject receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema 
attack on the day  of a scheduled dose of stu dy drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study  
visit.
Self Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed t o self -
administer treatment. Subjects must complete appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and understanding of the training must be confirmed by the investigator or designee. Subjects are 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 10
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
allowed to initiate self- administration at the subjec t’s home, or other agreed upon location after 
receiving the first 2 doses of DX- 2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  self-
administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled 
study  site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study  permits off -
site dosing). See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self- administering 
investigational product will be supervised by  a parent/legal guardian/caregiver. Alterna tively , a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training, will be allowed to 
administer DX -2930 to an adolescent without study  site personnel supervision. Site personnel 
will call subjects within approximately  3 day s after the planned off -site self
-administrations to 
ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all 
attacks have been appropriately documented.
Throughout the stud y, study  site personnel will document information in source d ocuments (ie, 
the subject’s medical record) and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-
administration and SC administration of DX -2930.
Subjects may  be offered the opportunity  to utilize a prefilled s yringe (if available) for self -
administration of DX -2930.
Follow -up Period
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 
4-week follow -up period.
Modifications to Open -Label Dosing
If, at an y time, a dose -related safety  signal is identified either fr om this study  or Study
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to modify  the open -label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency . 
In addition, an individual subject’s dose may be modified based on a benefit -risk assessment and 
recommendati on from the treating phy sician. Consultation with and approval by  the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor is required.
In addition, based on the results of Study DX-2930 -03, the Sponsor may  switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency . 
Study Population:
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from Study DX-2930- 03, as well as at least 50 (to 
approximately  100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in Study DX-2930- 03. The total 
enrollment is expected to be at least 150 but not more than 250 HAE Ty pe I or II subjects. 
Subjects will be 12 y ears of age or older who experience at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE 
diagnosis will be confirmed through documented clinical history  and diagnostic testing 
conducted either during screening or during prior participation in Study DX-2930- 02 or Study
DX-2930- 03. The study  will aim to enroll at least 15 subjects who are 12 to 17 y ears of age, 
inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 12 to 17 y ears old who are expected to roll over from 
Study DX-2930-
03.
Criteria for Inclusion:
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening.

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
2.Documented diagnosis of HAE (Ty pe I or II)  based on all of the following:
Documented clinical history  consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompan ying urticaria).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX -2930 study ) that 
confirm HAE T ype I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal l evel. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal level may  
be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may  be 
retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or believed by  the investigator 
to be confounded b y recent L TP use. (I t is understood that C1 -INH therap y may alter 
the lab results of C1 -INH assessments; therefore, the investigator's discretion in 
collaboration with Medical Monitor is advised for proper documentation of 
eligibility ).
At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema s ymptoms 
≤30 years, a family  history  consistent with HAE Ty pe I or II, or C1q within normal 
range .
3.A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1 attack per 12 weeks.
4.Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form. Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver has 
provided informed consent, are willing and able to read, understand and sign an assent form.
5.Males and females who are fertile and sexually  active must adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study  as follows:
Females* of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent, or it is recommended to 
use highl y effective forms of c ontraception from screening through 30 days after the final 
study  visit. This includes stable doses (for 3 months prior to study  screening) of 
combined estrogen and progestin -containing hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra- uterine device (IUD, all ty pes) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing s ystems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner 
has had a vasectom y must agree to use one additional form of medically  acceptable 
contraception. 2) Use of a male condom with or without spermicide or cervical cap, 
diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) are not 
considered highl y effective.
Females of non- childbearing potential, defined as surgically  sterile (status post 
hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post
-menopausal for 
at least 12 months do not require contraception during the stud y.
Males, including m ales who are surgicall y sterile (post vasectom y), with female partners 
of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medicall y acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study  
visit.

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Test Product; Dose; and Mode of Administration:
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial componen ts: 30 mM sodium phosphate 
dibasic dihy drate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 
0.01% Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of 150 mg 
DX-2930 active ingredient in 1 mL solution OR 300 mg DX -2930 ac tive ingredient in 2 mL  
solution.
For each 300 mg dose of DX -2930, each subject will receive a total of 2 mL, which will be 
administered in a single 2 -mL SC injection. 
The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.
Self-Administration Op tion: I nvestigational product can be self- administered without supervision 
(parental supervision required for adolescent subjects) after subjects receive appropriate training 
by the investigator or designee and their understanding is confirmed. Subjects ar e allowed to 
initiate offsite self -administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX
-2930 at the study  site 
and may  continue to self -administer all subsequent doses (see Study  Activities Schedules).
Duration of Treatment:
All subjects will receive open -label DX -2930 during a treatment period of up to 924 day s. 
The last dose of open -label DX -2930 administered to rollover subjects may  be given at the Day  
910 study  visit. Non -rollover subjects will receive 300 mg DX -2930 ever y 2 weeks for up to 
66 doses, with the first dose administered on Day  0 and the final dose administered at the Day  
910 study  visit.
There will be a ± 4-day window around each study  visit. There will be a minimum of 10 day s 
between an y two doses. Excluding the interval between the first and second open -label doses for 
rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 day s between any  two doses. Subjects will be 
monitored at the study  site through 1 hour post -dose for scheduled study  site visits.  No 
monitorin g of vital signs will be performed for subjects who elect to self -administer away  from 
the investigational site .
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening asse ssments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within 4 weeks prior to the first open -label dose. Eligible subjects will be enrolled 
and undergo a treatment period of up to 924 day s. At the conclusion of the tre atment period, 
subjects will be followed for an additional 4 weeks. 
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1 -INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or anti -
fibrinoly tics) once LTP is discontinued (within 3 weeks following the first dose of 
DX-2930). 
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 14
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•Initiating or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption 
(such as ora l contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 months prior to study  
screening.
•Use of androgens (eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methy ltestosterone, and 
testosterone) for non- HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation 
during the first three weeks.
•Any other investigational drug or device.
The use of short -term prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated. 
Short -term (pre -procedure) proph ylaxis is defined as the use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema 
complications from medically  indicated procedures.
Management of Acute Attacks:
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including the use of acute attack therapies that the investig ator deems as 
medically  appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
long-term prophy lactic therapy . Administration of DX -2930 and stud y procedures will continue 
without alteration to the protocol- specified study  schedule, even if the subject has s ymptoms of 
an HAE attack the day  of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack. 
The administration of DX -2930 can also be re -scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum 
timeframe between doses are me t based on subject preference or phy sician discretion.
Safety Assessments:
Safety  assessments will include the following:
•Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special 
interest (AESI). SAEs and AESI  will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.
•Vital signs, including sitting or supine blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body  
temperature, and respiratory  rate (RR)

C1-INH, C4, an d C1q and Exploratory Biomarker Assessments:
Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assay s will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment, 
unless alread y collected as part of protocol DX -2930 -02 or DX -2930- 03. C1 -INH, C1q, C4 and 
exploratory  biomarkers will be measured throughout the study  and at the end of the study  to 
evaluate the effect of DX -2930 on these biomarkers of disease activity .
Quality of Life Assessments:
Quality  of life (QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality  of L ife 
Questionnaire (AE -QoL), EuroQoL 5- Dimensional 5 -Level Measure (EQ -5D-5L), Work 
Productivity  and Activit y Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI -GH), Hospital 
Anxiety  and Depression Scale (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey  (SF-12), the 
Angioe dema Control Test (AECT), the Global Impression of Treatment Response, and 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM- 9). Additionally , subjects will 
complete a brief exit interview to obtain data on the subjects’ experience in the DX -2930 s tudies.
DX-2930 Injection Report and Self -Administration and Subcutaneous Injection Survey
An injection report of the subject’s experience with self -administration and SC injection will be 
completed b y the subject after all doses of DX -2930.
In addition, an assessment survey  of the subject experience with SC and self -administration 
injections of DX -2930, and the prefilled s yringe (if utilized), will be completed b y the subject as 
indicated in the Study  Activities Schedules.
Collection of HAE Attack Data:
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP). Study  site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site.
Study  site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide. The 
subject (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average severit y, 
predom inant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy  use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks 
while receiving LTP). If available, information will also be collect ed on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack. This includes the first attack experienced by  
rollover subjects following their first open-label dose. In the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by a famil y 
member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by  the subject, 
memory  aids may  be provided to assist in tracking any HAE attacks experienced, but their use is 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 16
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
not mandatory . 
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced.
Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s).
Impact on activit y (work, school, social interactions) and whether an y assis tance or 
medical intervention was required, including hospitalizations, additional laboratory  tests 
or emergency  department visits.
Any medications used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter).
If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms.
Study  site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary  to document the attack as described in HAARP.
Study  site personnel will contact rollover subjects approx imately  every  7 day s following the first 
dose of open- label DX -2930 to solicit for any  HAE attacks not already  reported.  Site check- ins 
will continue until the subject has received their second open -label dose.
During each stud y visit, study site personne l will solicit for any  new attack information that was 
not alread y provided to the site.
In this stud y, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity , 
or causal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded on the AE page o f the eCRF. Any AE 
reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event.
In addition to reporting AEs and SAEs as described above, the investigator or ph ysician designee 
is also required to evaluate each attack within 7 calendar day s and evaluate if it represents a 
confirmed HAE attack in accordance with HAARP. I f necessary  forthe evaluation, the 
investigator or designee may  contact the subject to receive additional information. Any subject -
reported attack not confirmed by  the investigator or phy sician designee must have an alternate 
AE diagnosis recorded.  All subject- reporte d and investigator/ ph ysician designee -confirmed 
HAE attacks will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital admissions 
will be captured.
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have sy mptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations: 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 17
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region.
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea.
•Lary ngeal angioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx.
Despite the presence of these s ymptoms, the investigator or phy sician designee may still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well bey ond the 
typical time course of an HAE attack, or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’s abdominal s ymptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s sy mptoms.
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Interim anal yses may  be conducted when a reasonable number ofsubjects have completed at 
least 12 months of consecutive exposure to DX- 2930 across the combined DX -2930- 03 and 
DX-2930- 04 studies, and only  after database lock of Study  DX-2930-03. Interim anal yses may  
be performed to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory  reporting.
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide 
ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safet y data f or Study DX-2930- 03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study , summary  safety  data from Study  DX-
2930- 04 may  be reviewed by  the Study  DX-2930
-03 DSMB as part of the collection of safet y 
information available on DX -2930. 
Individual Stopping Rules:
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non-serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator, warrants discontinuation fr om further dosing for that subject’s 
well-being. The investigator has the ability  to contact and consult with the Medical Monitor on 
such matters. Subjects will continue to be followed through the completion of all scheduled non -
dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study .

Sample Size Determination:
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open- label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03 and individuals who 
were not otherwise able to participate in Study  DX-2930-03.
Statistical Methodology: 
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack will be anal yzed using the Rollover Safet y 
Population.
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (day s) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -2930 to the date and time of the first investigator-
confirmed HAE attack after the first open- label dose.  Subjects who discontinue the study  prior 
to experiencing their first on- study  investigator -confirmed HAE attack will be censored at the 
date and time of stud y discontinuation.  Time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE attack wi ll 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods.
Multivariate and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be employed to 
examine the impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE 
attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering Study  DX-2930- 03, the 
treatment group in Study  DX-2930- 03, the time since the last dose given in Study  DX-2930-03, 
the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during Study  DX-2930-03. Results of 
this exploratory  anal ysis will be summarized.  
Number of Investigator -confirmed HAE Attacks
The number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day  0 through 
Day 924) expressed as a monthly  HAE attack rate, will be anal yzed using each analy sis 
population.
The monthly  rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period will be 
calculated for each subject as the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks occurring 
during the treatment period divided by the number of day s the subject contributed to the 
treatment period multiplied by  28 day s.  
The baseline investigator -confirmed monthl y HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator- confirmed monthly  HAE attacks occurring during the pretreatment 
period for rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non -rollover subjects divided by  the 
number of day s the subject contributed to the pretreatment period for rollover subjects or 
historical reporting period fo r non -rollovers multiplied by  28 day s.
The baseline, treatment period, and treatment period change from baseline in the investigator -
confirmed HAE attack rate will be summarized for each anal ysis population. The summary  will 
include the total number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks reported during each period and 
subject -time in months that each subject contributed to each period. Figures will be created for 
each anal ysis population plotting the on -study  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks reported 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 20

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
during the treatment period relative to Day  0 for each subject.
Similar summary  tables will be presented for the following efficacy  endpoints for each anal ysis 
population:
•Number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.
•Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period.
•Number of high- morbidity  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high -morbidity  HAE attack is defined as any  attack that ha s at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation 
< 24 hours), hemod ynamically  significant (s ystolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV 
hydration, or associated with sy ncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal.
Safety Analysis:
Adverse Events
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severit y or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. 
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator. Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.
The number and percentage of subjects with an y AE, any related AE, an y SAE, any related SAE, 
any severe AE, an y related severe AE, and an y investigator -reported AESI, as well as the total 
number of events for each category  will be summarized.  The number of deaths due to an AE, 
hospitalization due to an AE and study  discontinuation due to an AE will be summarized. 
The number and percentage of subjects wit h an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be 
summarized by  SOC, and PT. This tabulation will be repeated for related AEs, SAEs, related 
SAEs, severe AEs, and related severe AEs. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study  are h yperse nsitivity  reactions and 
disordered coagulation (hy percoagulability  events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQ) for each AESI  will be performed using the study  data. The number and percentage 
of subjects with an AESI, as well as the tota l number of AESIs, will be summarized by SOC and PT. 
Separate summary  tables will be created for each AESI  and for those events with the SMQs 
classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and related severe.  A listing detailing the 
PT within th e SMQ will be provided.

a Screening visit is for non -rollover subjects only.  Screening visit can occur up to 28 days prior to first open -label dose.
b Study site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately every 7 days following the first dose of open -label DX -2930 to solicit for any 
HAE attacks not already reported.  Site check -in with rollover subjects w ill continue until the subject receives their second open label dose.
c Rollover subjects must sign informed consent for Study DX -2930- 04 on or after Day 168 of Study DX -2930- 03.  Day 182 of Study DX -2930- 03 
is also Day 0 of Study DX
-2930 -04, and informed consent may be completed on this visit, if not already provided.
d Screened non -rollover subjects (adults and adolescents) who are on LTP w ith C1 -INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until Day 
8 (or Day 15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1 -INH. For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) o r anti -
fibrinolytics (eg, tranexamic acid), a similar tapering schedule is recommended. How ever, the taper can be prolonged by an ad ditional week as 
long as androgen or anti -fibrinolytic therapy is stopped w ithin 3 weeks of receiving the first dose of DX-2 930. Since C1 -INH therapy may alter 
the lab results of C1 -INH assessments, the investigator's discretion in collaboration with Medical Monitor is advised for proper documentation of 
eligibility.
e Doses are administered every 14 ± 4 days. All subjects (ado lescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a physical and 
mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allow ed to self -administer DX -2930 after (1) completing appropriate training by 
the investigator or desi gnee, (2) confirming their understanding, and (3) receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study site. Subjects are then 
allow ed to initiate home self- administration and may elect to self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational s ite. Subjects 
who receive a new product format (ie, a single vial or a PFS) w ill receive additional training in how to self -administer with that format.
f Site personnel will call subjects within approximately 3 days after the planned self -administration t o ensure the administration occurred, to collect 
AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately documented.
g Rollover subjects w ill not receive Dose 2 until they have experienced the first reported, investigator -confirmed attack. In addition, a minimum of 
10 days is required between Dose 1 and Dose 2. If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window  around a scheduled 
study visit, this treatment visit w ill represent that scheduled visit unless that scheduled visit has already occurred. If that scheduled visit has 
already occurred, or if the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ± 4 day window  around a scheduled visit , this visit will not 
replace any scheduled visit and w ill thus represent an acceptable, extra study visit (ie, an unscheduled visit). Regardless, at the visit in which the 
second open -label dose of DX -2930 is administered, the subject w ill undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination 
(performed i n accordance with standards at the site), clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, biomarkers and anti -drug antibody. Vital signs will be 
obtained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with all study visits, information will be collected on adverse events, concomitant the rapy, and HAE attack 
data. Follow ing Dose 2, subjects will begin regular administrations every 2 w eeks.
h For rollover subjects, demography data from DX -2930- 03 w ill be re -entered for DX- 2930- 04. How ever, m edical history reported in the DX2930 -
03 study will notbe re -entered into the CRF for DX -2930- 04; only new medical history data w ill be entered.
i The pregnancy test will only be conducted in females of childbearing potential.  Tests performed on Day 0 must be urine -based to confirm 
eligibility prior to first dose. Tests performed at screening and on indicated visits could be serum or urine -based.

j There is a recommended ± 15 minute window for all vital signs. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing. 
Monitoring of vital signs will not be performed for subjects who elect to self -administer away from the investigative site at optional off -site visits 
(indicated non -shaded columns).
k Physical examinations, including weight, will be conducted for all rollover and non -rollove r subjects according to the study activities schedule 
and in accordance with standards at the site.  In addition to the physical examinations specified in the study activities sch edule, an additional 
physical examination (performed in accordance with stand ards at the site) will be conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of 
their second open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.  Height will be collected at the Screening visit only.
l Clinical laboratory testing will include Hematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis (urinalysis does notneed to be done as part of 
the clinical laboratory testing at Visits 14, 17, 20, and 23). Clinical laboratory testing will be conducted for all rollover and non -rollover subjects 
according to the study activities schedule. In addition to the testing specified in the study activities schedule, additional t esting will be conducted 
for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at w hatever study visit that occurs.
m In addition to the timepoints shown, ECG is to be performed when clinically indicated.
n Historical HAE attack information will be collected at screening for non -rollover subjects. 
During the study, subjects (or caregivers) are instructed to report details of the attack to the study site within 72 hours o f the onset of the attack. 
During study visits, study site personnel will solicit for any new  HAE attack information that has not already been reported to the site. Study site 
personnel will utilize the HAARP guidelines in order to confirm the HAE attack within 7 days. 
o PK, PD, biomarker, and anti- drug antibody samples will be draw n for all rollover and non -rollover subjects at the visits shown. An additional 
sample will be drawn for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.
p Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assays will be collected at screening for eligibility. In addition, C1 -INH, C4, C1q, and other biomarkers will be 
collected at Visit 14, and Visit 27, as applicable. Samples need not be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment if t hey were already 
collected as part of Study DX -2930- 02 or Study DX -2930- 03.

NOTE: Although the first visit shown on this Schedule is at Day 378, this schedule covers the entire period follow ing the end of the previous schedule . Certain 
assessments should be collected continuously throughout the study (for example, AEs) are collected continuously throughou t the study.
a Visit 68 is a site check -in call for all rollover and non -rollover subjects.
b Subjects who terminate from the study early will undergo (if possible) all of the assessments and procedures at Visit 69, the final study visit.
c Doses are administered every 14 ± 4 days.
d All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a physical and mental capability of learning and willing 
to be trained) may self -administer DX -2930 at all visits following the tr aining described in Table 1. Subjects who receive a new product format (ie, 
a single vial or a PFS) will receive additional training in how to self -administer with that format. Subjects may administer at home or other agreed 
upon location (during off -site self-administration visits; non -shaded columns). Subjects can opt to be seen in clinic for this visit.
e Physical examinations, including weight, will be conducted for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule and 
inaccordance with standards at the site. 
f The pregnancy test will only be conducted in females of childbearing potential. Tests performed at screening and indicated visits could be serum or 
urine -based.
g There is a recommended ± 15 -minute window for all vital signs. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing. 
Monitoring of vital signs will not be performed for subjects who elect to self -administer away from the investigative site at optional off -site visits 
(indicated non -shaded columns).
h During the study, subjects (or caregivers) are instructed to report details of the attack to the study site within 72 hours o f the onset of the attack. 
During study visits, study site personnel will solicit for any new  HAE attack information t hat has not already been reported to the site. Study site 
personnel will utilize the HAARP guidelines in order to confirm the HAE attack within 7 days.
i Clinical laboratory testing will include Hematology, Coagulation ,Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis (uri nalysis is performed as part of the clinical 
laboratory testing at Visits 42, 54, 66, 69).
j Biomarker samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assays will be collected at Visits 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 67, and 69.
k Site personnel will call subjects within approximate ly 3 days after the planned self -administration to ensure the administration occurred, to collect 
AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately documented.
l Collect subject's injection reports of their experience with DX-2930 self -administration, subcutaneous administration, and prefilled syringe (if 
relevant) for all doses.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 DX-2930
DX-2930 is a fully  human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody  that binds specificall y to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for proph ylactic treatment of angioedema 
attacks in patients with hereditary  angioedema (HAE), a serious and life -threatening disease.
1.2 Hereditary Angioedema
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life- threatening disease caused by  mutations in the 
C1-inhibitor (C1- INH) gene, resulting in deficiency  or dy sfunction of C1 -INH protein. HAE 
manifests clinically  as unpredictable, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema 
of the face, lary nx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw 2008). Swelling may last 
up to five or more day s; most patients suffer multiple attacks per y ear. HAE is an orphan 
disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates range from 1 per 
10,000 to 1 per 150,000 persons, with many  authors agreeing that 1 per50,000 is likely  the 
closest estimate ( Bygum 2009 ; Goring et al. 1998 ; Lei et al. 2011 ; Nordenfelt et al. 2014; Roche 
et al. 2005). 
Swelling in the lary nx can obstruct the airways and cause death from asphyxiation ( Bork et al. 
2000; Bork et al. 2012 ). Approximately  50% of all patients with HAE will experience a 
laryngeal attack in their lifetime, and there is no way  to predict which patients are at risk of a 
laryngeal attack ( Bork et al. 2003 ; Bork et al. 2006 ). 
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe pain; 
intestinal sy mptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may lead to unnecessary  surgery  (Zuraw 
2008). 
Approximately  85% of patients with HAE have Ty pe I HAE, characterized by  very  low 
production of fu nctionally  normal C1 -INH protein, while the remaining approximately  15% of 
patients with HAE have Ty pe II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionall y 
impaired C1 -INH ( Zuraw 2008 ). In patients with Ty pes I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma 
kallikrein generation results in excess brady kinin release from high -molecular weight 2- chain 
kininogen (HMWK) and vascular leak mediated by brad ykinin bi nding to the B2 receptor (B2 -
R) 
on the surface of endothelial cells ( Zuraw 2008 ). Clinical suspicion of Ty pes I and II HAE can 
be confirmed b y availabl e blood tests. I n addition to abnormalities in C1 -INH level and function, 
plasma C4 levels are often reduced in blood from most patients with HAE.
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX-2930
Plasma kallikrein play s a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks ( Davis 2006; Kaplan 
and Joseph 2010). I n normal phy siology , C1-INH regulates the activity  of plasma kallikrein as 
well as a variet y of other proteases, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor XIIa. Plasma 
kallikrein regulates the release of brad ykinin from HM WK. Due to a deficiency  of C1 -INH in 
HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity occurs and leads to the excessive generation of 
bradykinin. Brad ykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 38

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
HAE sy mptoms of localized sw elling, inflammation, and pain ( Craig et al. 2012; Zuraw et al. 
2013). Intervening at the level of brad ykinin production with a plasma kallikrein inhibitor 
therefore represents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy  for HAE. I ndeed, the 
importance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated through the observed 
effectiveness of Kalbitor®(ecallantide), a peptide that specificall y targets plasma kallikrein, 
which was approved b y the FDA for the treatment of acute HA E attacks ( Kalbitor®2015). 
DX-2930 is a highly  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X -ray 
crystallograph y of DX- 2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX -2930 binding to 
the active site of kallikrein ( Kenniston et al. 2014 ).
1.4 Safety Rationale for DX -2930
Safety  data from the Phase 1a clinical study , a first -in-human study  with DX -2930 in health y 
subjects, did not identify  any safet y concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX- 2930 were well -
tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, or any  other safet y 
concerns identified.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX -2930- 01) and Phase 1b (DX -2930- 02) 
clinical studies in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity  studies support a wide 
safet y margin. The mean C maxfor human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Day s 1 and 15 
was approximately  27 g/mL . As comparison, a mean C maxof 744 g/ mL was observed 
following dosing of monkey s with 50 mg/kg DX -2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekl y for 6 months 
resulting in a safet y margin of approximately  28-fold. No toxicologically  significant findings 
were observed in these treated animals or in any  other nonclinical toxicity  study  to date for 
systemicall y administered DX -2930.
Safety  data is also available from the Phase 1b study  (DX -2930- 02), a multiple -ascending dose 
study  in patients with HAE . In this study , two doses of DX-
2930 up to 400 mg administered 
14days apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events 
in any  DX-2930 treated subje cts, or an y other safety concerns identified in this study  of patients 
with HAE . Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study  found that the drug exposure following two 
administrations of DX- 2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially  less than that 
attained and evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity  studies.

Brochure .
1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data
The clinical development program to date for DX -2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of DX -2930, including one completed Phase 1a single -ascending 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 39
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
dose study  in healthy  subjects and a Phase 1b multiple -ascending dose study  in patients with 
HAE. These studies are summarized in the following sections.
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects (DX -2930-01)
DX-2930-01 was a Phas e 1a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in health y 
subjects to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX -
2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active stud y drug within one of th e 
following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing cohort, 
6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo. 
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study  and were randomized. The treatment groups were 
well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX- 2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) across 
all cohorts.
Based on the safety  anal ysis, a sin gle administration of DX -2930 was well tolerated up to doses 
of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose
-limiting toxicity . There were no deaths, SAEs, or subject 
discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the stud y. Furthermore, there was no 
significant imbalance between placebo and DX -2930 for any  particular treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly  reported TEAE was headache, which occurred at a 
rate of 25% for both DX -2930 and placebo.
The PK profile demonstrated linear, dose-dependent drug exposure with a mean half- life of 
approximately  17 to 21 day s across dose groups. Results from two exploratory  biomarker assay s 
provide evidence for an important pharmacod ynamic effect of DX -2930 in humans. 
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study  in healthy  subjects, please refer to 
the DX- 2930 Investigator’s Brochure .
1.6.2 Multiple -Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX
-2930-02)
DX-2930- 02 was a Phase 1b randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple ascending -
dose study  in patients with HAE to evaluate safet y, tolerability , and PK of SC DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study  drug or placebo within 
one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 400 mg (nominal 6 
subjects per cohort). Each subject received 2 doses of study  drug separated by  14 day s. 
A total of 37 subjects were randomized and treated with DX-2930 or placebo. One subject in the 
400 mg dose group received a single dose of DX- 2930 and, following several unsuccessful 
attempts to schedule their second dose, was replaced. This subject returned for a single follow -up 
visit before being lost to follow- up for reasons not related to the study . Routi ne C1- INH testing 
revealed that one other subject did not have HAE Ty pe I or II, despite a historical lab test 
indicating otherwise.
Subject demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity  and BMI . There were 
slightly  more females in the DX -2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 53.8%).

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
The most common AEs reported were HAE attacks, injection site pain, and headache. The rates 
were not appreciabl y higher in the DX -2930 subjects compared to placebo. Two subjects were 
reported to hav e 3 related severe TEAEs. One of these was a DX- 2930 subject (30 mg) with 
injection site pain lasting 1 minute and one was a DX-2930 subject (400 mg) with worsening 
headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats.
No safet y signals were identified for vital sig ns, phy sical examinations, clinical laboratory  tests, 
or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX- 2930 was well tolerated in this study  with 
no evidence of dose -limiting toxicity  at doses up to 400 mg.
A total of 3 out of 92 post -dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), were 
confirmed to be anti- drug antibod y-positive. No samples were positive for neutralizing activit y.
The pharmacokinetic analy sis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300, and 400 mg doses showed drug 
levels in HAE subjects were dose -dependent and exhibited a prolonged half -life of 
approximately  2 weeks, ty pical of a human monoclonal antibody . Cmaxdrug levels increased with 
increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with values obtained in health y 
subjects in Study  DX-2930 -01.
A Western blot assay  showed pre -
dose baseline levels of mean 2-chain HMWK in unactivated 
plasma collected from patients with HAE was approximately  50%. A statistically  significant 
reduction in 2 -chain HMWK levels was observe d on study  days 8 and 22 in the 300 and 400 mg 
dose groups compared to pre-dose levels, and approached levels similar to that observed in 
healthy  subjects. This outcome demonstrated the pharmacody namic activit y of DX- 2930 and its 
ability  to effectivel y nor malize the instability  of HAE plasma in this assay . 
Primary  efficacy  anal yses were based on subjects in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and placebo dose 
groups who reported having at least 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry  
(0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX -2930, 15 of 16 subjects 
met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these criteria. 
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo group, 
0.33 att acks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per week in the 400 mg group and 
0.49 attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre- specified, primary  
efficacy  interval of 6 weeks (from day s 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of not able drug 
exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted for baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300 mg group and 
0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in the placebo 
group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX -2930 group ( P< 0.0001) 
and an 88% reduction vs placebo for 400 mg DX-2930 ( P= 0.005). During this primary  efficacy  
interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P= 0.026) and 82% of subjects in the 400 mg 
group ( P= 0.03) were attack- free compared with 27% of subjects in the placebo group.
The data from this study  demonstrated proof of concept of the abilit y of DX- 2930 to prevent 
acute attacks of HAE. A statistically  significant finding of HAE attack prevention by  DX-2930 
was observed. DX -2930 was well tolerated in HAE subjects up to 400 mg. Drug exposure 
appeared to be dose -proportional and consistent with the results obtained in healthy  subjects in

Study  DX-2930- 01. Pharmacody namic effect assay s provided evidence that DX -2930 has a 
direc t effect on plasma kallikrein activity  in patient plasma.

Brochure .
1.7 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Study DX-2930 -04
The open- label DX -2930 extension study  will be preceded b y the initiation of a pivotal, multi -
center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm stud y (Study DX -2930- 03) 
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe 
I or T ype II HAE. Further information on Study  DX-2930- 03 design can be found in Appendix 
5.
Subjects who complete the Study  DX-2930- 03 treatment period will be offered the option of 
rolling into the open -label extension study , Study  DX-2930- 04.  In addition, a limited number of 
individuals with HAE Type I or Ty pe II who were not enrolled in Study  DX-2930- 03 (up to 
approximately 100) will be also enrolled. 
The rationale for this open -label extension study  is to evaluate the long -term safet y of repeated 
subcutaneous treatmen t with DX -2930 and the long -term efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks.  For subjects rolling over from DX-
2930- 03 who were randomized to one of the 
active study  arms, the total duration of exposure across both studies will cover 36 months.  For 
rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX- 2930 -03, and for non -rollover subjects, the total 
duration of exposure will cover 30 months.  Combined, the overall exposure between Study  
DX-
2930- 03 and Study  DX
-2930- 04 will provide a sizable dataset to evaluat e DX
-2930 as a life -
long, chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.  
This study  seeks to evaluate the outer bounds of DX -2930 dosing frequency (possibly  beyond 
2to 4 weeks) b y assessing the duration of time between a rollover subject’s first open -label dose 
and their first reported HAE attack.  In addition, characteristics of all HAE attacks will be 
reported and compared to the subject’s historical baseline (for non -rollover subjects) or attack 
history  based on attacks reported in Study  DX-
2930 -03 (for rollover subjects).
For non -rollover subjects, the study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of switching from a 
long-term prevention therapy  (eg, C1- INH, anti -fibrinoly tics, androgens) to DX -2930 dosing, 
while evaluating breakthrough attack c haracteristics compared to historical baseline both prior to 
and during co- administration  with their L TP therapy  regimen and while receiving DX -2930 
alone. 
For all subjects, the study will also assess immunogenicity  of chronically  administered DX -2930, 
PK and PD, biomarkers of angioedema disease state bioactivity , subject response to the pre -filled 
syringe (if available), subject response to rescue medications, subject health -related quality  of 
life (QoL), subject experience with self -administration, ease of SC administration with DX -2930 
subject treatment satisfaction, subjects’ and investigators’ global impression of treatment 
response, subject assessment of angioedema control, and an exit interview of subjects.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
3.1.1 Overview
Study  DX-2930- 04 is an open -label, long -term safety  and efficacy  extension study  of DX -2930-
03, to evaluate the investigational medicinal product ( IMP), DX- 2930, in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Type II HAE. There are two ty pes of subjects 
who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not pa rticipants in Study  DX-
2930- 03) 
Rollover Subjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  182 of 
Study  DX-2930- 03 and consent to enter Study  DX-2930- 04.  Subjects who discontinue from 
Study  DX-2930- 03 after en rollment are not eligible to enroll in Study  DX-2930 -04.  
Subjects should be asked about their interest in Study  DX-2930- 04 after enrollment into Study  
DX-2930- 03 to anticipate enrollment and preparedness for Study  DX-2930 -04.  Willing subjects 
must sign informed consent for Study  DX-2930- 04 on or after Day  168 of Study  DX-2930-
03.  
Subjects who are eligible to roll over into Study  DX-2930- 04 but elect not to, may  not enroll in 
Study  DX-
2930- 04 at a later time. The first Study DX -2930- 04 visit for rollove r subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as Study  DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study  DX-2930 -03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharged from that study. No assessments conducted be tween Study  DX-2930- 03 Day  182 
study  visit and the first Study  DX-
2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final 
DX-
2930- 03 assessments on Day  182 will be used as the pre- dose results for Day  0 of Study  
DX-2930-04.
All subjects, caregivers , investigators and study  site personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX-
2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of Study  DX-2930- 04.
Non-rollover subjects
At least 50 subjects (to approximately  100) who were not participants in Study  DX-2930- 03 wi ll 
be permitted to enroll if they  meet the eligibility  requirements. Subjects who screen fail out of 
Study  DX-2930-03 for not meeting the minimum attack requirements during the run- in period 
must wait until enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended b efore they  can screen for Study  
DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Study  DX-2930- 03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Stud y DX -2930- 03 when 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study  
DX-
2930- 03 due to an inability  to wash- out of their L TP, may  screen for Study  DX-
2930-04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Screening Period:
Rollover subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects 
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within 4 weeks prior to their first open -label dose.  Screened non- rollover subjects (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1-INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) or anti- fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexa mic acid); a 
similar tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged b y an additional 
week, if medically indicated, as long as androgen or anti -fibrinol ytic therapy  is stopped within 
3weeks of receiving the first dose of DX -2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of DX -2930 administered subcutaneously  (SC) on Day  0. Subjects will not 
receive an y additional DX -2930 doses until their first reported and investigator confirmed HAE 
attack.  As such, the total number of doses within the treatment period will vary  by rollover 
subject.
The duration of time between the first open -label dose and first reported HAE attack will vary  by 
rollover subject.  All rollover subjects must adhere to the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1
andTable 2), for the entire duration of the stud y.  However, until a rollover subject reports their 
first HAE attack, only scheduled study visits where the fol lowing tests and assessments are 
performed must be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  
testing, ph ysical examination, 12 -Lead ECG, QoL, PK, PD and anti- drug antibody  sample 
collection.  All other scheduled study  visits may  be conducted via site check -in calls to collect 
information on adverse events, concomitant therapy , and HAE attack data.  See Study  Activities 
Schedules ( Table 1andTable 2) for which visits must be conducted at the study  site.
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -2930 as quickly  as subject and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled 
study  visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit.  
In the event that the second dos e is to be administered outside of the accepted ±4 day  window 
around a scheduled visit, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra study  visit 
(ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 45
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Regardless of the stud y day, at the visi t in which the second open -label dose of DX -2930 is 
administered, the subject will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, phy sical 
examination, clinical laboratory  testing, and blood sampling for PK, PD, and anti -drug antibod y. 
Vital signs will be o btained at 1 hour post -dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be 
collected on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data.
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their first open -label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second open- label dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of 
open -label DX -2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment per iod per the 
scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2). The treatment period 
will last up to 924 day s from the date of the first open-label dose. The number of doses 
administered during this period will vary  by subject based on the date of each subject’s second 
dose, but will not exceed 66 doses. The Day  910 study  visit is the last visit at which a dose may  
be administered.
Non-rollover Subjects
Once all screening assessments have been completed and eligibility  confirmed, non -rollover 
subjects will arrive at the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open- label 
dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered SC on Day 0. Non- rollover subjects will continue to 
receive SC administrations of open- label 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period per the scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedules. Up 
to 66 doses will be administered with the last dose administered at the Day 910 study  visit.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 
10days and maximum of 18 day s between administrations, and should fall within the accepted 
±4 day  window around study  visits. 
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the
opinion of the investigator requires medical intervention, standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- 2930 and study  procedures will continue without al teration to the protocol 
Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ), even if a subject receives treatment for a 
breakthrough angioedema attack on the day of a scheduled dose of study  drug (if self -
administering) or scheduled study  visit.
Self-Adminis tration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment. Subjects must complete appropriate traini ng by  the investigator or designee 
and have their understanding of the procedures confirmed b y the investigator or designee.

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Subjects are allowed to initiate self- administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon 
location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects 
may self-administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are 
scheduled stud y site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study 
permits off -site dosing). 
Adolescent subjects self -administering DX -2930 will be supervised by  a parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver. Alternatively , a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate 
training, will be allowed to administer the investigational product to an adolescent without study  
site personnel supervision. 
Site personnel will call subject s within approximately  3 day s after the planned off -site self -
administrations to ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, 
and to ensure all attacks have been appropriatel y documented.  Throughout the study , study  site 
personnel will document information i n source documents (ie, the subject’s medical record) and 
eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC administration of 
DX-2930.
Follow -up Period
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluat ions during a 
4-week follow -up period.  Figure 1 shows a schematic of the open- label extension study .

Modifications to Open -Label Dosing
If, at an ytime, a dose -related safety  signal is identified either from this study  or Study
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to modify  the open -label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency . 
In addition, an individual subject’s dose may be modified based on a benefit -risk a ssessment and
recommendation from the treating ph ysician. Consultation with and approval by the Sponsor’s 
medical monitor is required.
In addition, based on the results of Study  DX-2930 -03, the Sponsor may  switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency .
3.1.2 Stopp ing Rules
3.1.2.1 Study Level Stopping Rules
Safety  data, including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration of 
the study . If any  potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, or 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 48
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
from an y safet y findings from Study  DX-2930- 03, or following DSMB review, the Sponsor may  
take actions as deemed appropriate, including suspending dosing in the study , while the potential 
risk is evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
3.1.2.2 Individual Stopping Rules
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator or DSMB recommendation, warrants discontinuation from further 
dosing for that subject’s well- being. The investigator has the ability  to contact and consult with 
the Medical Monitor on such matters. Subjects will continue to be followed through the 
completion of all scheduled non- dosing visits, unless th ey request to be discontinued from the 
study .
3.1.3 Follow -up for Subjects Meeting Stopping Criteria
Subjects that develop either an SAE or other toxicity considered clinically relevant (AE, 
laboratory , phy sical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be c arefully  monitored until 
resolution, which may  include the following:
•Additional clinical laboratory  tests and/or other clinical investigations
•Additional visits or extended duration of follow -up
•Obtaining a specialist consultation
3.2 Rationale for Open -Labe l Extension Dose Selection
The dose selected for the open- label extension (300 mg every  2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pivotal, double- blind DX -2930- 03 study . If at an y time an 
important dose -related safety  signal is identified either from this study  or Study  DX-2930- 03, the 
Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et completed the treatment 
period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label DX -2930 dose and/or 
frequency .
Additionally , based on the efficacy  results of Study  DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  switch to a 
different dose and/or frequency .
3.3 Individual Subject Dosing and Follow -Up
All subjects will receive open -label DX -2930 during a treatment period of up to 924 day s. The
number of doses that rollover subjects receive during this period will vary  by subject but will not 
exceed 66 doses. The last dose of open -label DX -2930 administered to these subjects may  be 
given at the Day  910 study  visit. Non-rollover subjects will rec eive DX -2930 every  2 weeks for 
up to 66 doses, with the first dose administered on Day  0 and the final dose administered at the 
Day 910 study  visit.
There will be a ±4 day  window around each study visit. There will be a minimum of 10 day s 
between an y two d oses. Excluding the time interval between the first and second open -label 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 49
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
doses for rollover subjects, there will be a maximum of 18 day s between any  two doses. Subjects 
will be monitored at the study  site through 1 hour post -dose.
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment after completing appropriate training by  the investigator or designee and 
confirming their understanding. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration at the 
subject’s home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the 
study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  continue to self -administe r subsequent doses of 
DX-2930. Subjects who elect to self -administer investigational product will be provided the 
necessary  supplies (see Section 5.7 and Section 6.15.1 ). Subjects who receive a new product 
format (ie, a single vial or a PFS) will receive a dditional training in how to self -administer with 
that format.
3.4 Study Duration for Individual Subjects
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from Study  DX-2930 -03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assess ments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within 4 weeks prior to the first open -label dose. Eligible subjects will be enrolled 
and undergo a treatment period of up to 924 day s. At the conclusion of the treatment period, 
subjects will be followed for an a dditional 4 weeks.

4. STUDY POPULATION SEL ECTION
4.1 Study Population
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from Study  DX-2930 -03, as well as at least 50 (to 
approximately 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in Study  DX-2930- 03.  The total 
enrollment is expected to be at least 150, but not more than 250 HAE Type I or II subjects.  
Subjects will be 12 y ears of age or older who experience at least 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE 
diagnosis will be confirmed through documented clinical history  and diagnostic t esting 
conducted either during screening or during participation in Study  DX-2930- 02 or Study  DX-
2930-03.
The subject population includes subjects who are 12 to 17 y ears old. L ike adults, children with 
HAE can suffer from recurrent and debilitating attacks . Symptoms may  present very  early in 
childhood, and upper airway  angioedema has been reported in patients with HAE as y oung as the 
age of 3 ( Bork et al. 2003 ).In one case series of 49 pediatric patients with HAE, 23 had suffered 
at least one episode of airway  angioedema b y the age of 18 ( Farkas 2010). An important unmet 
medical need exists among children with HAE, especiall y adolescents, since the disease 
commonly  worsens after puberty  (Bennett and Craig 2015 ; Zuraw 2008 ).  The study  will aim to 
enroll at least 15 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 
12to 17 y ears ol d who are expected to roll over from Study  DX-2930-03. 
4.2 Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening. 
2.Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Ty pe I or II) based on all of the following:
Documented clinical history  consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompan ying urticaria).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX- 2930 study ) that 
confirm HAE T ype I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal level may  
be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may  be 
retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or believed by  the investigator 
to be confounded b y LTP use. (It is understood that C1 -INH therap y may alter the lab 
results of C1- INH assessments; therefore, the investigator's discr etion in collaboration 
with Medical Monitor is advised for proper documentation of eligibility ).
At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema s ymptoms 
≤30 years, a family  history  consistent with HAE Ty pe I or II, or C1q within normal 
range.
3.A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1 attack per 12 weeks.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 51

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
4.Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form.  Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver has 
provided informed consent, are willing and able to read, understand and sign an assent form.
5.Males and females who are fertile and sexually  active must adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study  as follows:
Females* of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended to use 
highl y effective forms of contraception from the screening period through 30 days after 
the final study  visit.  This includes stable doses (for 3 months prior to study  screening) of 
combined estrogen and progestin -containing hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra- uterine device (IUD, all types) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing s ystems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner 
has had a vasectom y must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable 
contraception. 2) Use of a male condom with or without spermicide or cervical ca p, 
diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) are not 
considered highl y effective.
Females of non- childbearing potential, defined as surgically  sterile (status post 
hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post -menopausal for 
at least 12 months do not require contraception during the stud y.
Males, including males who are surgicall y sterile (post vasectom y), with female partners 
of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medicall y acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study  
visit. 
*NOTE:  Female rollover subjects (those who previously  participated in Study  DX-2930-
03) of childbearing potential may  continue to use the bi rth control method used during 
Study  DX-2930-03.
4.3 Exclusion Criteria
Subjects who meet an y of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:
1.Discontinued from Study DX -2930- 03 after enrollment for any  reason.
2.If rolling over from Study  DX-2930-03, presence of important safet y concerns that would 
preclude participation in this study .
3.Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as acquired 
angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1 -INH (also known as HAE T ype III), idiopathi c 
angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
4.Dosing with an investigational drug (not including DX -2930 or other HAE therapies) or 
exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior screening.
5.Exposure to angiotensin -converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to 
screening or an y newly initiated or dose modification of estrogen -containing medications 
with sy stemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 
months prior to the screening visit.
6.Unwilling to discontinue use of long -term proph ylactic therap y for HAE (C1 -INH, attenuated 
androgens, or anti -fibrinoly tics) within 3 weeks after starting DX- 2930 treatment.
7.Any of the following liver function test abnormalities: alanine aminotransf erase (ALT) > 3x 
upper limit of normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x upper limit of normal, or 
total bilirubin > 2x upper limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of 
Gilbert’s Sy ndrome).
8.Pregnancy  or breastfeeding.
9. Subject ha s any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, may 
compromise their safety  or compliance, preclude successful conduct of the study , or interfere 
with interpretation of the results (eg, history  of substance abuse or dependence, a significant 
pre-existing illness or other major comorbidit y that the investigator considers may confound 
the interpretation of study  results).

5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)
For detailed information regarding open- label DX -2930 (lanadelumab) adm inistration, refer to 
the Pharmacy  Manual.
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate 
dibasic dihy drate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of either 150 mg 
DX-2930 active ingredient in 1 mL solution or300 mg in 2 mL  solution.
For each 300 mg dose of DX -2930, each subject will receive a total of 2 mL, which will be 
administered in a single 2 mL  SC injection. The subject may  receive the dose as either 2 vials 
containing 150 mg in 1 mL  each, or 1 vial containing 300 mg in 2 mL . If available, subjects may  
receive a PFS instead of vial(s). The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Self-Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adul t) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to 
self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and demonstr ating the comprehension to self- administer. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -
administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first 2 
doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  continue to se lf-administer 
subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled study  site 
visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the stud y permits off -site 
dosing). See Stud y Activities Schedule ( Table 1)for de tails. Subjects who receive a new product 
format (ie, a single vial or a PFS) will receive additional training in how to self -administer with 
that format. Adolescent subjects self- administering investigational product will be supervised by  
a parent/legal g uardian/caregiver. Alternativel y, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after 
completing appropriate training, will be allowed to administer DX -2930 to an adolescent without 
study  site personnel supervision. Site personnel will call subjects within approximat ely 3 day s 
after the planned off -site self -administrations to ensure the administration occurred, to collect 
AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately  documented.
Throughout the stud y, study  site personnel will document information in the subject’s medical 
record and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC 
administration of DX -2930 and experience with the PFS, if applicable.
5.2 Dosing and Follow -Up Scheme
Details of subject dosing and follow- up are outlined in Section 3.1.1 and included in the 
Study Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2) .
Rollover subjects will receive their first open label SC dose of DX -2930 on Day  0.  Subjects will 
not receive an y additional DX -2930 doses until their f irst reported HAE attack.  The second dose 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 54
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
of DX -2930 may  be administered at an unscheduled visit if it is outside of the accepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit. Following this attack subjects will receive open label SC doses 
of DX -2930 every  2weeks until the end of the treatment period. Subsequent dosing after Dose 2 
requires a minimum of 10 day s and a maximum of 18 day s between administrations.
Regardless of when a rollover subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their first open- label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -label 
300mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment p eriod per the 
scheduled dosing in the Study Activities Schedules. The treatment period will last up to 924 day s 
from the date of the first open-label dose. The number of doses administered during this period 
will vary  by subject based on the date of each s ubject’s second dose, but will not exceed 66 
doses. The Day  910 study  visit is the last visit at which a dose may  be administered. 
Non-rollover subjects will receive their first open -label dose SC dose of DX -2930 on Day  0 and 
will continue to receive SC a dministrations of open- label DX -2930 every  2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period. Up to 66 doses will be administered with the last dose 
administered at the Day  910 study  visit.
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 
4-week follow -up period.
5.3 Method of Identifying Subjects
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study  and sequentially  assigned a 
unique site -based identification number.
5.4 Prior and Concomitant T herapy
For subjects not rolling over from Study  DX-2930-03, reasonable efforts will be made to 
determine all relevant treatments received b y the subject from 4 weeks prior to screening through 
the final study  visit. For subjects rolling over from Study  DX-2930- 03, concomitant therapy  use 
will be carried forward from that study  and will continue to be collected through the final study  
visit. 
All information on prior and concomitant therap y (including all prescription/non -prescription 
medications, herbal med ications and vitamin supplements) must be recorded on the subject’s 
eCRF and should include the name of the procedure or drug and duration of the treatment (start 
and stop dates). Concomitant treatments (non
-pharmacological treatments) include any  surgical
or diagnostic procedures.
5.4.1 Allowed Therapies
The following therapies are allowed during the study :
•Therapies for co -existing conditions, including those for acute attacks of HAE, as described 
in Section 5.4.1.1 are permitted if not excluded in Section 5.4.2. The use of short -term 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 55
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated.  Short- term (pre -
procedure) proph ylaxis is defined as use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema complications from 
medically  indicated procedures.
•Therapies to treat any AEs the subject experiences during the stud y are permitted.
5.4.1.1 Management of HAE Attacks
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapies that the investigator deems as 
medically  appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
LTP therap y. Administration of DX -2930 and study  procedures will continue without alteration 
to the protocol -specified study  schedule, eve n if the subject has s ymptoms of an HAE attack the 
day of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack. The administration 
of DX -2930 can also be re -scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum timeframe between 
doses are met based on patient preference or ph ysician discretion.
5.4.2 Excluded Concomitant Therapies
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or 
anti-fibrinoly tics) once LTP is discontinued (within 3 weeks following first dose of 
DX-2930).
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
•Initiating or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 months prior to the 
screening visit.
•Use of androgens (eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methy ltestosterone, testosterone) for 
non-HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation during the first 
3weeks.
•Any othe r investigational drug or device.
5.5 Restrictions
5.5.1 Medical Interventions
Medical interventions deemed necessary  by the investigator for the health and well -being of the 
subject will not be excluded during this study .
5.5.2 Fluid and Food Intake 
There are no restri ctions on fluid and food intake. Subjects may  continue their usual dietary  
regimens.
5.5.3 Activity
There are no activity  restrictions. Subjects may  continue their usual activity regimens.

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
5.6 Treatment Compliance
All doses of open- label DX -2930 administered at the investigational site will be under the direct 
supervision of the investigator or qualified stud y site personnel designated by  the investigator.
Subjects are allowed to initiate self- administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon 
location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects 
may continue to self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when 
visits are scheduled study  site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed up on location (when 
the study  permits offsite dosing). Site personnel will call subject s within approximately  3 day s 
after the planned off -site self -administrations to ensure the administration occurred, to collect 
AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately  documented. 
See Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2) for details. For all subjects, subsequent 
doses after the second dose require a minimum of 10 day s and maximum of 18 day s between 
administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 day  window around study  visits. 
For rollover subjects, after the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window 
(±4days) or an acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -
defined stud y visit according to the schedule of assessments.
5.7 Packaging and Labeling
The open- label DX -2930 will be supplied by  the Sponsor and prepackaged in a study  kit for 
investigational studies. Each study  kit will contain 1 vial (or pre -filled s yringe, if available) of 
investigational product. Both the vials and carton (kit) will be appropriately labeled according to 
local regulations and bear the unique study drug kit number. The investigative site will provide 
ancillary  supplies including s yringes, ne edles, and alcohol wipes to subjects. The site has the 
option of using needles of a different gauge to aid subject comfort with each SC injection. 
Subjects who elect to self -administer investigational product will be provided the following 
supplies as appl icable:
•1 to 2 dose(s) supply  of investigational product
•Ancillary  supplies, including s yringes, needles, alcohol pads, a temperature monitoring 
device, and a container for sharps disposal
•Subject accountability form to record investigational product storage conditions and 
administration details
All used and unused vials should be returned to the study  kit cartons/boxes and transported to the 
site for drug accountability .  Written instructions on DX -2930 handling and self -administration 
procedures will be provided to trained subjects prior to initiating self -administration.  Refer to 
the Pharmacy  Manual for additional details on DX -2930 and its administration.
5.8 Storage and Accountability
All DX- 2930 will be shipped refrigerated to the study  site and must be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC/36ºF 
to 46ºF in the carton and protected from light. Storage must be in a securel y locked area, 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 57
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
accessible to authorized persons only , until needed for dose preparation. See Section 5.7and 
Section 6.15.1 for details.
5.9 Investigational Medicinal Product Retention at Study Site
The investigator (or designee) is responsible for maintaining accurate accountability  records of 
DX-2930 throughout the clinical study . All DX- 2930 received at the site must be inventoried and 
accounted for in an a ccountability  log provided by  the Sponsor. All dispensing and 
accountability  records will be available for Sponsor review. Drug accountability  will be verified 
during on -site monitoring visits.
Upon the completion or termination of the study , and upon written authorization from the 
Sponsor, or its representative, all unused and/or partially  used DX -2930 should be returned or 
destroy ed at the investigational site, as specified by  Sponsor. It is the investigator’s responsibility  
to ensure that the Sponsor , or its representative, has provided written authorization that 
procedures for proper disposal of DX -2930 have been established, and that appropriate records 
of the disposal are documented and maintained. No unused DX -2930 may  be disposed until full y 
accounted for by  the Sponsor monitor (or designee).

6. STUDY PROCEDURES
Please refer to the Stud y Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ).
6.1 Informed Consent
The I CF must be executed prior to performing any study  related activities and must be approved 
by the reviewing institutional review board (I RB), research ethics board (REB), or independent 
ethics committee (IEC). Subjects may  withdraw consent at any  time. Participation in the study  
may be terminated at any time without the subject’s consent as determined by the investigator.
Subjects who are not rolling over from the double -blind DX -2930- 03 study will provide 
informed consent at Screening. Subjects who are rolling over from the double -blind DX -2930-03 
study  will provide consent on or after Day  168 of Study DX-2930- 03. Upon completion of the 
final assessments, the subjects will be discharged from the double -blind study  and will start 
participation in the OLE study  and receive their first open -label dose.
6.2 Eligibility Review
The investigator or qualified study site personnel will confirm that all I nclusion and Exclusion 
criteria have been met.
6.3 Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics: date of birth (alternately  age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be 
collected for legal reasons), sex, race , and ethnicity  (where locall y permitted) and medical 
history  will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from Study  DX-2930- 03 and 
will be recorded on the source document and eCRF. Medical history  will capture the subject’s 
current medica l status (current disease processes), past medical status (past disease processes), 
history  of surgery , allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling over from Study  
DX-2930- 03, these data will be carried forward from that study . 
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection
The collection, reporting, and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Study  site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enro lling subjects at their site.
Study  site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
subject (and caregiver) will confi rm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency ,average severit y, 
predominant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks

while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within 72 hours of the onset of an attack. This includes the first attack experienced by  
rollover subjects following their first open-label dose.  In the situation that a subject is 
incapacitated following an attack, this information can be provided to the site by a famil y 
member or other individual with detailed knowledge of the event. If desired by  the subject, 
memory  aids may  be provided to assist in tracking any HAE attacks experienced, but their use is 
not mandatory . 
Subjects (or ca regivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
•Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
•Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
•Impact on activit y (work, school, social interactio ns) and whether an y assistance or medical 
intervention was required, including hospitalizations, additional laboratory  tests, or 
emergency  department visits
•Any medications used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter)
•If the attack res olved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms
Study  site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Study  site personnel will contact rollover subjects approximately  every  7days following the first 
dose of open-
label until the subject has received their second open label dose.  This is to ensure 
accurate reporting for any  HAE attacks not already  reported by  the subject as required within 
72hours.  During each study  visit, study  site personnel will solicit for any  new HAE attack 
information that was not alread y provided to the site.
In this stud y, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity , 
or cau sal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Any AE 
reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of becoming a ware of the 
event. For all adverse events that are reported as HAE attacks, the investigator or phy sician 
designee will review the event within 7 day s of initial notification and, in accordance with 
HAARP, evaluate if it represented a confirmed HAE attack .If necessary  for the evaluation, the 
investigator or designee may  contact the subject to receive additional information. Any subject -
reported attack not confirmed by  the investigator or phy sician designee must have an alternate 
AE diagnosis recorded.  All subject -reported and investigator/ ph ysician designee -confirmed 
HAE attacks will be recorded in the eCRF.

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospital admissions 
will be captured.
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have sy mptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea
•Lary ngeal angioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx
Despite the presence of these s ymptoms, the investigator or phy sician designee may still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompa nied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well bey ond the 
typical time course of an HAE attack, or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’s abdominal s ymptoms are a ttributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s sy mptoms.
6.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs p rior to dosing and at 1 hour post -dosing (±15 min) will be assessed by  the 
investigator or his/her qualified designee according to the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1
and Table 2) unless the subject has elected to self- administer off -site for that visit. Routine vital 
sign assessments will be taken with the subject in the sitting or supine position after 5 minutes at 
rest and will include body  temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pre ssure (BP) and respiratory  rate 
(RR). BP should be determined using the same arm and the same equipment for each assessment.  
For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930- 03, vital signs taken during the final study  visit 
in Study  DX-2930-03 will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose vital signs in this study  and will not be 
duplicated.  
6.6 Physical Examination
A phy sical examination including height, weight, and calculation of Body  Mass I ndex (BMI) 
will be performed b y the investigator or his/her qualified designee ac cording to the Study  
Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ). The phy sical examination will be performed in 
accordance with standards at the site. 
For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930 -03, the phy sical exam taken during the final 
study  visit in Study  DX-2930 -03  will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose ph ysical exam in this study  
and will not be duplicated.  Weight should be collected at every  exam.

6.7 Electrocardiography (ECG)
A standard 12- lead ECG (single recording) will be performed according to the Study Activities 
Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2). The date and time of each ECG and its results will be 
documented in the source documents and eCRF. Electrocardiograms will be sent to a central 
reading vendor for assessment or will be assessed on site. For su bjects who rollover from Study  
DX-2930- 03, the ECG taken during the final study  visit in Study  DX-2930- 03 will serve as the 
Day 0 pre -dose ECG in this study  and will not be duplicated.
6.8 Clinical Laboratory Tests
6.8.1 Laboratory Parameters
Laboratory  testing will be performed according to the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and 
Table 2). 
Laboratory  testing includes general safety  parameters (hematology , coagulation, urinaly sis, and 
serum chemistry ), pregnancy  tests (in females of childbearing potential), PK s ampling, PD 
sampling, plasma anti- drug antibody  testing, and biomarker testing. All laboratory  tests will be 
performed using established and validated methods. 
When multiple sample collection ty pes are performed at the same assessment time point, the 
samples will be drawn in the following order (depending on what sample ty pes are to be 
collected at that time point): laboratory  safet y samples (hematology, coagulation, serum 
chemistry ), C1 -INH, C4, C1q, PK, anti- drug antibodies, PD, and biomarker samples. Aliquots 
from the samples may  be retained as back -up for additional parameter testing if necessary . 
Subjects will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. For subjects who rollover 
from Study  DX-2930- 03, testing performed during the final study  visit in Study  DX-2930-03 
will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose laboratory  testing in this study  and will not be duplicated.

EXPLORATORY BIOMARKERS
Samples for exploratory  biomarker measurement will be drawn during the study  according to the 
Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ).
C1-INH FUNCTIONAL ASSAY
Results of a C1- INH functional assay  are required for eligibility  assessment and will be assessed 
during the stud y according to the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2). 
Samples will be drawn at the Screening visit unless they  were previousl y drawn in Study  
DX-2930- 02 or Study  DX-
2930- 03. Results of the C1 -INH functional assay from DX -2930-02 
or Study  DX-2930- 03 may  be used to confirm diagnosis in this study . Subjects may  be retested if 
results are incongruent with clinical history  or believed by the investigator to be confounded by  
recent LTP use. Because C1-INH therap y ma y alter the lab results of C1 -INH assessments, the 
investigator's discretion in collaboration with Medical Monitor is advised for proper 
documentation of eligibility .
C4ASSAY
Results of a C4 assay  may  be required for eligibility  assessment and will be assessed during the 
study  according to the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2
). 
The C4 sample will be drawn at the same time as the C1- INH sample is drawn during th e 
Screening visit unless previously  drawn in Study  DX-
2930- 02 or Study  DX-2930- 03.  Results of 
the C4 assay  from DX -2930 -02 or Study  DX-2930 -03 may  be used to confirm diagnosis in this 
study .  Subjects may  be retested if results are incongruent with clinic al history  or believed by  the 
investigator to be confounded by  recent LTP use. 
C1Q ASSAY
Results of a C1q assay  may  be required for eligibility  assessment. An y subject who requires 
C1-INH and C4 assay results for diagnostic confirmation in this study  will have C1q assay  
results obtained as well. The C1q sample will be drawn at the same time as the C1 and C4 
sample is drawn during the Screening visit.

in the Study  Activities Schedules. Additional testing may  be required in patients who have 
positive ADA.
6.12 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
The Sponsor representatives and investigator at the site conducting the trial will review and 
evaluate prior (4 weeks prior to study  screening) and concomitant medication usage on an 
ongoing basis. For subjects not rolling over from Study  DX-2930- 03, all prescription, over -the-
counter medications, herbals, and supplements that are being taken or have been taken by  
subjects from 4 weeks prior to screening through the duration of the stud y will be regarded as 
concomitant medications and must be documented on the source document and e CRF following 
informed consent.  For subjects rolling over from Study  DX-2930- 03, concomitant therapy  use 
will be carried forward from that study  and will continue to be collected through the duration of 
the study . 
6.13 Investigational Medicinal Product Treatm ent
Instructions for safe handling of DX -2930, preparation of each subcutaneous dose and 
administration of DX -2930, are provided in the Pharmacy  Manual. Preparation and dispensing of 
DX-2930 will be handled by  qualified stud y site personnel or b y subjects who are self -
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 65
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
administering after receiving appropriate training by  the investigator or designee at the study  site. 
The requirements for maintaining DX -2930 accountability  are provided in Section 6.15.1 (for 
subjects self -administering) and Section 5.7and Section 5.8 of this protocol.
6.14 Quality of Life Assessments
Quality  of life ( QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire ( AE-QoL), EuroQoL 5- Dimensional 5 -Level Measure (EQ -5D-5L), Work 
Productivity  and Activit y Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI -GH), Hospital 
Anxiety  and Depression Scale (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey  (SF-12).See Study  
Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ). For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930-03, 
quality  of life asse ssments obtained during the final study  visit in Study  DX-2930- 03 will serve 
as the Day  0 pre -dose quality  of life assessments in this study  and will not be duplicated.
6.14.1 Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE- QoL)
The AE- QoL is a self -administered, symptom -specific tool developed and validated to assess 
quality  of life (QoL) impairment in patients with recurrent angioedema ( Weller et al. 2012 ). The 
AE-QoL consists of 17 questions covering 
four domains/dimensions (functioning, fatigue/mood, 
fear/shame, nutrition). Each of the 17 items has a five -point L ikert-type response scale ranging 
from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The AE -QoL is scored to produce a score for each domain and 
a total score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger impairment. I t takes 5 
minutes to complete the AE -QoL.
6.14.2 EuroQoL 5 -Dimensional 5- Level Measure (EQ -5D- 5L)
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered standardized measure of health status comprised of a 
descriptive s ystem and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive s ystem consists of five 
health related quality  of life dimensions (ie, mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety /depression). Each dimension is rated on a 5 -
point response scale (5 levels) indicating 
severit y of problems, where 1 is “no problems” and 5 is “extreme problems”. The EQ -5D VAS is 
a measure of overall self -rated health status on a 20 -cm vertical VAS with endpoints labelled 
“the best health you can imag ine” and “the worst health y ou can imagine”. The VAS ranges from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better overall health.
6.14.3 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI- GH) 
Questionnaire
The WPAI -GH is a 6- item instrument assessi ng work and activity  impairment due to health 
problems during the past 7 day s. The instrument elicits four main scores in relation to general 
health specifically : absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one's health in 
the past seven day s), presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced while at work in 
the past seven day s because of one's health), overall work productivity  loss (an overall 
impairment estimate that is a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity  
impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activities because of one's health in the past 
seven day s) (Reilly et al. 1993 ). Adolescent subjects should complete the WPAI  questionnaire 
and use the term “school” instead of “work” when filling out this questionnaire.  These data will 
be anal yzed separatel y.

Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
6.14.4 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
The Hos pital Anxiety  and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-assessment scale to detect states of 
depression, anxiety , and emotional distress amongst patients who were being treated for a variet y 
of clinical problems ( Zigmond and Snaith 1983). The scale has a total of 14 items. Seven of the 
items relate to anxiety  and seven relate to depression.  The responses are scored on a scale of 0 –3 
(3 indicates higher s ymptom frequencies). Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0–7, mild 8 –
10, moderate 11 –14, 
and severe 15–21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher 
scores indicating more distress. This scale reflects how a subject has been feeling during the past 
week.
6.14.5 12 Item Short Form v2 Health Survey (SF -12v2)
The SF -12v2 Health Survey  is a reliable and valid generic measure of functional health and well -
being. The SF -12v2 consists of 12 questions, all selected from the SF -36 Health Survey  (Ware et 
al. 1996 ). The SF -12v2 yields eight health domains (vitality , phy sical functioning, bodily  pain, 
general health percep tions, phy sical role functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental 
health summary  measures. Phy sical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) can be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score 
indic ates the lowest level of health measured b y the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of 
health. The standard form of the instrument asks subjects to reply to questions according to how 
they have felt over the last 4 weeks.
6.14.6 Angioedema Control Test (AE CT)
The Angioedema Control Test (AECT) is a patient reported outcome measure. The concept of 
the AECT is comparable to those of the well-established Asthma Control Test (ACT) and 
Urticaria Control Test (UCT) ( Nathan et al. 2004 ; Weller et al. 2014 ). The AECT could be used 
to assess control of angioedema among pa tients with recurrent angioedema (including hereditary  
angioedema) and to aid treatment decisions. The AECT consists of up to 10 questions. Each 
question has 5 answer options (verbal rating scale) that are scored from 0 to 4 points, which 
ultimately  compri se the total AECT score.
6.14.7 Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9)
The TSQM -9 is a validated 9
-item questionnaire developed to measure subjects’ satisfaction 
with their medication and includes three scale scores: effectiveness, convenien ce, and global 
satisfaction ( Bharmal et al. 2009 ). Scale scores for each of the 3 scales, as well as a combined 
score are ca lculated separatel y. Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores 
indicate greater treatment satisfaction. The TSQM -9 has been applied in clinical studies in 
several chronic conditions.
6.14.8 Global Impression of Treatment Response
The subjects’ and investigators’ global impression of treatment response will be assessed using a 
one-item question. The item will assess overall perception of treatment response. Assessment 
will be performed separately  by the subject and investigator. The subjects and investigators will 
be asked to think of “today ” while rating the question (or an appropriate translation, as 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 67
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
applicable): “Overall, how would y ou rate y our response to the study  medication?” There will be 
five response options; namely , poor; fair; good; very  good, excellent. 
6.14.9 Exit Interview
At the last follow-up visit, subjects will be asked about their overall experience with DX-2930 
studies and an y changes in signs and s ymptoms related to HAE and related impact on subjects 
health during the between -attack period in order to assess opportuni ties to improve the future 
studies. The exit interview will capture subject experience in general. These questions will ask 
about HAE control, changes pertaining to wellness between attacks, response to triggers, 
prodrome, and overall sense of vitality  or energy  level, or activity  level. 
6.15 DX-2930 Injection Report and Self -Administration and Subcutaneous Injection 
Survey
Assessments of subject experience with self -administration and SC injections of DX -2930 will 
be conducted.
6.15.1 DX-2930 Injection Report
The investigator or designee will train subjects who elect to self- administer DX -2930 on the 
following:
•Transportation and recommended storage conditions of investigational product from the 
study  site to the offsite location.
•Maintenance of accurate records regarding each administration of investigational product 
including supply  identification (ie, lot/kit number), date and time of injection, injection site 
location, infusion time, and if applicable, an y reason the self -administration could not be 
completed as in structed.
•Retention of all used and unused vials of investigational product for drug accountability  
purposes.
After receiving appropriate training and demonstrating their understanding of self -
administration, subjects are allowed to self -administer DX -2930 after receiving the first 2 doses 
of DX -2930 at the study  site (administered by  study  personnel). 
For those subjects who choose to self- administer or have a parent/legal guardian/caregiver 
administer DX -2930, subjects must complete an assessment of thei r experience with self -
administration and subcutaneous injection for each dose received. Study personnel will 
document the subject’s responses in the subjects’ medical record and eCRF.
6.15.2 DX-2930 Self -administration and Subcutaneous Injection Survey
Subjects will complete an assessment on their overall experience with self -administration and 
experience with receiving SC injections of DX -2930 according to the Study  Activities Schedules 
(Table 1and Table 2)during the study . Subjects who received a PFS will be asked to describe 
the overall experience using the PFS including aspects of administration. For subjects who have 
previously  received LTP with C1 -INH products via IV administration, they will be asked to 
indicate the preferred route for medication administ ration. Study  personnel will document the 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 68
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
subject’s responses in the subjects’ medical record and eCRF. In addition, investigators will be 
asked to indicate their preference (SC, IV, or no preference) on the route to administer 
medications to prevent angio edema attacks.
6.16 Adverse Event Reporting
Adverse events will be collected from signing of the informed consent through the last study  
visit.
6.16.1 Definitions
6.16.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject whether or not it appe ars to 
have a causal relationship with the treatment administered. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
participation in a clinical study , whether or not directly  related to the medicinal product or study  
participation.
•AEs may be new events or may  be pre -existing conditions that have become aggravated or 
have worsened in severity or frequency  during the course of the stud y.
•AEs may  be clinicall y significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory  
tests, or other diagnostic investigation (eg, laboratory  results, x -ray findings).
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless th ey are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant laboratory 
abnormality  that is independent from a known underly ing medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX -2930 interruption or discontinuation, will in 
itself, be considered an AE. Laboratory  or diagnostic testing abnormalities that reflect or are part 
of a known underly ing medical condition are not, in themselves, AEs; rather, the underl ying 
medical cond ition leading to the abnormalities would be reported as the AE.
Pregnancy  is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of 
the study , the investigator must notify  the Sponsor according to the procedures provided in 
Section 6.16.5.2.
6.16.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
A SAE is any  adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any  of the following 
outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that might 
have caused death if it were more severe.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 69
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Note: Does not 
include hospitalization for observation with releas e within 24 hours. A scheduled 
hospitalization for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened during participation in the 
study  does not meet this criterion. Pre -planned hospitalizations for an elective 
medical/surgical procedure or routine check -ups d o not meet this criterion.
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
•Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
•Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in dea th or hospitalization, but may  jeopardize the subject or may  
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above.
6.16.1.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a 
product. The dosing for this study  will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and an 
overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study , an overdose of 
DX-2930 is considered a dose that is two -fold higher than the intended dose for the subject.
6.16.1.4 Planned Hospitalization
A hospitalization planned by  the subject prior to the first dose of open- label DX -2930 is 
considered a therapeutic intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as 
medical history . If the planned hospitalization or procedure is executed as planned, the record in 
the subject’s medical history  is considered complete. However, if the event/condition worsens 
during the trial, it must be reported as an AE.
6.16.1.5 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)
An AE is treatment -emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open- label DX -2930 
through the final follow -up visit or, in the event that onset time precedes first DX
-2930 
administration, the AE increases in severit y during the open- label treatment period.
For rollover subjects, an y adverse event that started during the subject’s participation in Study  
DX-
2930-03 and was ongoing at the time of the first open- label dose in Study  DX-2930- 04 will 
not be counted as an AE in Study  DX-2930- 04 unless that event has worsened in severit y or 
frequency  following the first open-label dose.  Adverse events that started during subject 
participation in Study  DX-2930- 03, resolved following the first open- label dose in Study  DX-
2930- 04, and then subse quently  reappeared in Study  DX-2930-04 will be counted as a new 
TEAE in Study  DX-2930
-04.
6.16.1.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Investigators will report all AE SI to the Sponsor, regardless of causality , using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting. The following describe the AESI and the criteria for 
reporting AESI. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 70
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS
As hy persensitivity  reactions have been observed for monoc lonal antibodies as a class, these 
events are considered AESI  for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with hy persensitivity  
reactions, regardless of causality , within 24 hours from the time of study  drug administration. 
Investigators will report hy persensitivity  reactions that occur after 24 hours, only ifthe reactions 
are suspected to be related to study  drug.
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION
Bleeding AESI
Although aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro
phenomenon, as a precautionary  measure in evaluating the safet y of DX- 2930, bleeding events 
will be reported as AESI for this study . Investigators will report all diagnos es, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event of 
bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and when 
temporally  reasonable, with any  reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly  indicative 
of bleeding.
Hypercoagulable AESI
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent with a thrombotic or embolic etiology . 
6.16.2 Monitoring
6.16.2.1 Monitoring of Adverse Events
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow- up visit.
•Subjects will be questioned and/or examined b y the investigator or a qualified designee for 
evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence of AEs 
will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  The presence 
or absence of specific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.
•Subjec ts having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory  tests, as determined by  the investigator.
•AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow -up results must be recorded in the eCRF as 
well as in the subje ct's source documentation. Follow -up laboratory  results should be filed 
with the subject's source documentation.
For an y SAEs or AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory  tests will be repeat ed as clinically  appropriate, until final resolution 
or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all 
scheduled visits.

6.16.2.2 Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments
All safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed at a central laboratory . The clinical 
laboratory  values will be reported to the investigator who will review them for clinical 
significance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AEs.
6.16.3 Assessment of Adverse Events
6.16.3.1 Assessment of Severity
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe m yocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of relatively  minor 
medical signifi cance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usuall y associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.
In this stud y, the severity of AEs will be as sessed according to Division of Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National 
Institutes of Health: National I nstitute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 1 , 
Appen dix 2 ) and the Division of Microbiology  and I nfectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric 
Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National I nstitutes of Health: National Institute of 
Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3 ). For a bnormalities not specifically  found in the 
Toxicity  Tables, the following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severit y:
•GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention/therap y required
•GRADE 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity  -some assistance may  be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy  required
•GRADE 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity , some assistance usuall y required; medical 
intervention/therap y required, hospitalizations possible 
•GRADE 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme limitation in activity , significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention/therap y required, hospitalization or hospice care probable
Any treatment -emergent ECG abnormality  that is considered by  the inve stigator as clinicall y 
significant and requiring intervention/therap y will be assessed as a severe AE.
All HAE attacks will be captured as AEs and assessed with DMID & HAE Attack Assessment 
and Reporting Procedures (HAARP) criteria.
6.16.3.2 Assessment of Causality
A medicall y qualified investigator must assess the relationship of an y AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of DX -2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available 
information, and may  include consideration of the following factors:
•Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre -existing 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors.
•The temporal association between DX -2930 exposure and onset of th e AE.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 72
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•Whether the manifestations of the AE are co nsistent with known actions or toxicity  of 
DX-2930.
•The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping use of DX -2930 
(dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.
The causal relationship betw een DX- 2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories:
Not Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:
Temporal relationship is lacking (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of DX -2930); or
Other causative factors more likely  explain the event (eg, a pre -existing condition, 
other concomitant treatments).
Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Related include:
There is a positive temporal re lationship (eg, the event occurred within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX -2930); or
The AE is more likel y explained by administration of DX -2930 than b y another 
cause (ie, the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of 
DX-2930 or the class of DX -2930).
6.16.3.3 Assessment of Clinical Significance
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined b y the investigator, with discussion 
with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.
6.16.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant laboratory 
abnormality  that is independent from a known underlying medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX
-2930 interruption or discontinuation, will be 
considered an AE.
When laboratory  abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity  Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMI D Pediatric Toxicity  Tables ( Appendix 3 ) will be used to assess severit y. 
Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lower limit of normal (LLN) of 
laboratory  ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of the laborator y 
that performs the assay s, the values provided by  the laboratory  will be used for assignment of 
severit y grade. Clinical significance of individual laboratory  AEs will be determined by  the 
investigator with input from the Medical Monitor as needed. 
Following is an exception to defining clinically  significant, abnormal laboratory values as AEs:
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 73
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
APTT prolongation in the absence of an y associated bleeding or other evidence of clinical 
relevance will not be considered a clinically  significant laboratory  abnor mality  or AE. In the 
appropriate ph ysiologic setting, such as IV heparin therapy , aPTT can be used to monitor 
bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT prolongation due to 
plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro phenomenon. Although plasma kallikrein 
drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay , plasma kallikrein -driven coagulation does not 
appear to have hemostatic or other ph ysiologically  important functions in vivo . It is well 
documented that, in humans, deficiency of factor XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma 
kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgical 
procedures ( Renne and Gruber 2012 ). Despite the lack of clinical effect, deficiency  of either 
protein is associated with marked prolongation of the aPTT. 
6.16.5 Reporting Inv estigator Safety Observations to the Sponsor
6.16.5.1 Reporting Non -serious Adverse Events
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or causal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF. In this study  all HAE attacks reported b y the su bject, regardless of 
whether or not they  are confirmed by  the investigator, will be captured as AEs.
6.16.5.2 Reporting Pregnancies
If a female subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the course of 
the study , the investigator must report the pregnancy  to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department using the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event. The investigator must obtain consent to collect pregnancy  information (including the 
status of the newborn, if applicable).
If some of the information required for completion of the Pregnancy  Reporting Form is 
unavailable at the time of the initial report, follow-up reports will be completed and submitted 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new information. The investigator is required to 
follow the pregnancy  through delivery . The outcome of the pregnancy  and the status of the 
newborn (if applicable) will be reported on the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within 24 hours of 
becoming aware.
6.16.5.3 Safety Observations Req uiring Expedited Reporting by the Investigator to 
the Sponsor
Any occurrence of the following events or outcomes in a subject in the trial must be reported 
expeditiously  by the investigator or qualified designee to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Departmen
t:
•SAE
•AESI
•Overdose
•Cancer
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 74
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
The investigator is to report any expedited safet y observations from the list above to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event.
Any SAE reported to the Sponsor Pharmacovigilance Department using the SAE Reporting 
Form in the EDC s ystem is to be recorded in the eCRF, as well as in the subject's source 
documentation along with any  actions taken. If all required information on the form is not 
available at the time o f the initial report, follow -up information will be completed in the EDC 
system.
The investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the subjects 
are still participating in the study . SAE resolution is defined as:
•Resolved wi th or without residual effects.
•A return to baseline for a pre -existing condition.
•Laboratory  values have returned to baseline or stabilized.
•The investigator does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event.
•Fatal outcome —if an autopsy  isperformed; the autopsy  report is requested to be provided to 
the Sponsor as soon as it is available.
6.16.5.4 Expedited Reporting by the Sponsor to a Regulatory Health Authority
The Sponsor or designee will report relevant safety  information to concerned health authorities 
in accordance with local laws and regulations.
6.16.5.5 Safety Contact Information
24-Hour Global Safety Contact: Pharmacovigilance Department
Email:  
Telephone (US) 
6.16.5.6 Safety Notifications by the Sponsor to the Investig ator
Investigators will receive prompt notification of any  adverse experience related to DX -2930 that 
is both serious and unexpected, or an y finding that suggests a significant risk for subjects. The 
investigator will promptly inform his / her IRB/REB/IEC of the notification and insert the 
notification in the I nvestigator’s Regulatory  Binder in accordance with local regulations. 
6.17 Subject Withdrawal
The investigator may  withdraw a subject from DX- 2930 treatment for an y of the following 
reasons:
•In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is unable to comply  with the requirements of 
the protocol for satisfactory  completion or interpretation of study  results (including use of 
prohibitive medications),
•A serious or intolerable AE occurs,

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 75
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•A clinically  signifi cant change in a laboratory  parameter occurs,
•The Sponsor or investigator terminates the study , or
•The subject requests to be discontinued from the study .
Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all scheduled visits, unless the 
subject requests to be discontinued from the stud y.
6.18 Appropriateness of Measurements
This is a Phase 3 open- label extension study  that is designed to evaluate the long -term safet y and 
efficacy  of DX -2930 in prophy lactic therapy  for angioedema attacks in subjects w ith HAE. 
DX-2930 is a recombinant, fully  human IgG1, kappa light chain, monoclonal antibody . The 
open -label, non -controlled study  design is a standard approach for extension studies that follow 
double -blind pivotal trials. Measures employ ed in this protoco l are standard measures routinel y 
used for the evaluation of the efficacy , safet y and tolerability of an investigational product.  
Measures employ ed for rollover subjects between the first and second open -label doses are 
appropriate to characterize the out er bounds of dosing frequency  for DX -2930.

9. DATA ANALYSIS / STAT ISTICAL METHODS
9.1 General Considerations
All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS®Version 9.3 or higher (SAS I nstitute, Cary , 
North Carolina, USA).
For categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects within each category  (with a 
category  for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous 
variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and 
maximum values will be presented. Where applicable, estimates from statistical model of least 
squares means, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals for least squares means will be 
provided. T ime-to-event data will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estimates of the 25th, 50th 
(median), and 75th percentiles with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals, as well as 
percentage of censored observations. Plots of the Kaplan -Meier curves and supporting data 
listings detailing each subject’s contribution to the anal ysis will be provided. 
Formal h ypothesis testing will not be performed.  Any hypothesis testing will be exploratory  in 
nature and resulting p -values will be considered descriptive.
9.2 Samp le Size Determination
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open- label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03  (rollover subjects) 
and individuals who were not otherwise able to participate in Study  DX-2930 -03  (non- rollover 
subjects).
9.3 Method of Assigning Study Subjects to Treatment
Subjects meeting all eligibility  criteria will be enrolled in the study and sequentially  assigned a 
unique site -based identification number.
9.4 Analysis Populations
9.4.1 Safety Population
The Safet y Population will include all subjects who received an y stud y drug after entering Study 
DX-2930- 04 (ie, any  exposure to open- label DX -2930). Unless otherwise specified, summary  
tabulations conducted with the Safety  Population will be presented by  the subject’s study  entry  
type (rollover or non -rollover) and overall.
9.4.2 Rollover Safety Population
The Rollover Safet y Populat ion is the subset of subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03 
and received an y stud y drug after entering Stud y DX-2930- 04 (ie, any  exposure to open -label 
DX-2930). Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations conducted with the Rollover Safety  
Popu lation will be presented by  the subject’s prior treatment group from Study  DX-2930-03

DX-2930- 04 and received any  study  drug after entering Study  DX-2930- 04 (ie, any  exposure to 
open -label DX -2930).  Unless otherwise specified, summary  tabulations conducted with the 
Non-rollover Safet y Population will be presented by  subject’s prior t ype of LTP therap y prior to 
study  entry  (C1-INH, androgens, anti -fibrinol ytics, and not on L TP)..
9.5 Population Description and Exposure
9.5.1 Subject Disposition
The numbers of subjects treated with stud y drug, compl eted the study  and discontinued 
prematurel y by reason will be summarized for each anal ysis population.
9.5.2 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Baseline and demographic variables will be summarized for each anal ysis population.
9.5.3 Medical History
Medic al history  will be coded using Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
and summarized by  system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each analy sis 
population.
9.5.4 Treatment Exposure and Compliance
Treatment compliance and the extent of e xposure to study  drug will be described by  the 
percentage of planned doses received b y the subject, total number of doses received b y the 
subject, and the number and percentage of subjects that received at least 80% of planned doses, 
summarized for each an alysis population.
9.5.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary  
(WHO-DD) .  The number and percentage of subjects with prior or concomitant medications will be 
summarized by therapeutic class and preferred term for each analysis population.  A separate, 
similar table will be provided for the subset of concomitant medications classified as rescue 
medications.
9.6 Analysis of Efficacy
9.6.1 Time to the First Investigator -confirmed HAE Attack
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack will be anal yzed using the Rollover Safet y 
Population.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 104
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (day s) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -2930 to the date and time of the first investigator-
confirmed HAE attack after the first open -label dose.  Subjects who discontinue the study  prior 
to experiencing their first on- study  investigator -confirmed HAE attack will be censored at the 
date and time of stud y dis continuation.  Time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE attack will 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods.
Multivariate and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be employed to 
examine the impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE 
attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering Study  DX-2930- 03, the 
treatment group in Study  DX-
2930- 03, the time since the last dose given in Study  DX-2930-03, 
the time since the la st HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during Study  DX-
2930- 03. Results of 
this exploratory  anal ysis will be summarized.  
9.6.2 Number of Investigator- confirmed HAE Attacks
The number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day  0 through 
Day 924) expressed as a monthly  HAE attack rate, will be anal yzed using each analy sis 
population.
The treatment period investigator -
confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks oc curring during the treatment period 
divided by  the number of day s the subject contributed to the treatment period multiplied by  
28days.  
The baseline investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject as the 
number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the pretreatment period for 
rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non- rollover subjects divided by  the number of 
days the subject contributed to the pretreatment period for rollover subjects or histori cal 
reporting period for non -rollovers multiplied by  28 day s.
The baseline, treatment period, and treatment period change from baseline in the investigator -
confirmed HAE attack rate will be summarized for each anal ysis population. The summary  will 
include the total number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks reported during each period and 
subject -time in months that each subject contributed to each period. Figures will be created for 
each anal ysis population plotting the on -study  investigator -confirmed HA E attacks reported 
during the treatment period relative to Day  0 for each subject.
In addition, the number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks per month (defined as 28 day s) 
will be summarized descriptively  by month (per 28 day  interval) for each analy
sis population. 
The summary  will include the number, change from baseline, and percent change from baseline 
of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks. Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks will be grouped into 
28-day intervals using the start date of the HAE attack . The date of the first exposure to study  
drug in this study  will be used as the start of the first interval and end of the interval will be the 
date of first exposure to study  drug in this study  plus 28 day s. Each successive interval will start 
the last d ay of the prior interval plus 1 day  and end 28 day s later. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 105
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Similar summary  tables will be presented for the following efficacy  endpoints for each anal ysis 
population:
•Number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatm ent period.
•Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period.
•Number of high- morbidity  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high -morbidity  HAE attack is defined as any  attack that has at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation 
< 24 hours), hemod ynamically  significant (s ystolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV 
hydration, or associated with sy ncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal.
9.7 Analysis of Safety
9.7.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary .  Separate summaries will be 
presented for each anal ysis population.
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of o r following the first 
exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. For AEs with partial onset times, non- missing date parts will be used to determine if 
the AE is treatment- emergent or not.  If a determination cannot be made using the non -missing 
date parts as to when the AE occurred relative to study  drug administration, then the AE will be 
classified as treatment -emergent.
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator.  Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.
For this anal ysis, AEs will be classified to one of two anal ysis periods:
•Treatment Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the first exposure to open -label 
DX-2930 in this study  to those starting before or at the subject’s last visit date during the 
treatment period in this study  (AEs starting at or after treatment on Day  0 to the Day  924 
visit). 
•Follow -up Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the subject’s last visit date of 
the treatment period in this study  (AEs starting after the Day  924 visit). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 106
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
For AEs with partial onset times, non-missing date parts will be used to determine if the AE falls 
within the period. If a determination cannot b e made using the non -missing date parts as to if the 
AE falls within the period, the AE will be conservatively  counted as a treatment- period AE. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an y AE, any related AE, an y SAE, an y related SAE,  
any severe AE,  any  related severe AE, and an y investigator -reported AESI, as well as the total 
number of events for each category will be summarized for each anal ysis period.  The number of 
deaths due to an AE, hospitalization due to an AE and study  discontinuation due t o an AE will be 
summarized for each analy sis period. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be 
summarized by  SOC, and PT for each anal ysis period. This tabulation will be repeated for 
related AEs, SAEs, related SAEs, severe AEs, related severe AEs, and investigator
-reported 
AESI  for treatment period and follow -up period AEs. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be 
summarized by  PT for treatment period AEs onl y. This tabulation will be repeated for related 
AEs and serious AEs for treatment period AEs. 
All AEs will be provided in subject listings. L istings will be presented separatel y for each 
analysis period.  In addition, subject listings of AEs causing discontinuation of study medication, 
AEs leading to death, SAEs, related AEs, severe AEs, and AEs of special interest (AESIs) will 
be produced. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study  are h ypersensitivity reactions and 
disordered coagu lation (hy percoagulability  events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQ) for each AESI  will be performed using the study  data. The number and 
percentage of subjects with an AESI , as well as the total number of AESIs, will be summarized 
bySOC and PT for each anal ysis period. Separate summary  tables will be created for each AESI 
and for those events with the SMQs classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and 
related severe.  A listing detailing the PT within the SMQ will be p rovided.
9.7.2 Laboratory Test Results
Laboratory  test results will be summarized using the Safety Population.
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value prior to the first exposure to DX -2930. For rollover 
subjects previously exposed to DX -2930, baseline is the last non -missing value prior to first exposure 
to study  drug in Study  DX-2930-03.        
Actual values and change from baseline clinical laboratory  tests will be summarized by  study  
visit. If more than one laboratory result is reported per study visit per parameter, the last non -missing 
result will be selected for analysis .
Laboratory  test results wi ll be classified according to the reference ranges and clinical significance as 
determined by  the investigator. The number of subjects with a non -missing result, and the number 
and percentage of subjects with a clinically significant result less than the l ower limit of normal, non -
clinically  significant result less than the lower limit of normal, within the normal range, non -
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 107

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
clinically  significant result more than the upper limit of normal, and clinically significant result more 
than the upper limit of norm al will be summarized by study visit. If more than one laboratory result is 
reported per study visit per parameter, the result yielding the most severe classification will be 
selected for analysis. 
Categorical laboratory  test results (urinaly sis excluding pH) will be summarized by  study  visit. I f 
more than one laboratory result is reported per study  visit per parameter, the result y ielding the 
most severe classification will be selected for analy sis. 
Subjects with clinically  significant abnormal laborator y test results will be listed.  This listing 
will include all results of the laboratory parameter that was abnormal and determined to be 
clinically  significant b y the investigator for a subject across study  visit to identify  any trends.
9.7.3 Vital Signs
Vital s igns will be summarized using the Safety Population.
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first exposure to DX- 2930. For 
rollover subjects previously  exposed to DX -2930, baseline is the last non- missing value prior to 
first exposure to study  drug in Study  DX-2930-
03.
Actual values and changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by  study  visit and 
study  time point. All vital sign data will be presented in subject listings.
Vital sign values will be classified according t o clinical significance as determined by the 
investigator. The number of subjects with a non -missing result, and the number and percentage of 
subjects with a non -clinically significant result and clinically significant result will be summarized by 
study  visit and study  time point. If more than one vital sign result is reported per study visit and study 
time point per parameter, the result yielding the most severe classification will be selected for 
analy sis. 
Subjects with clinically significant vital sign values will be listed.  This listing will include all results 
of the vital sign parameter that was determined by the investigator to be clinically significant for a 
subject across study  time points to identify  any trends.
9.7.4 Electrocardiography
Electrocardiog raphy results will be summarized using the Safety  Population.
The number and percentage of subjects with normal, abnormal not clinically  significant, and 
abnormal clinicall y significant ECG results, or ECG no performed, will be summarized by stud y

computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score 
indicates the lowest level of health measured b y the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of 
health.
Responses to the HADS for each item will be tabulated by  study  visit. In addition, continuous 
and categorical (0 -7: normal, 8 -10: mild, 11 -14: moderate, 15 -21: severe) total scores based on 
the items related to depres
sion and anxiety, will be summarized by  study  visit.  Each item in the 
questionnaire is scored from 0- 3, with total scores between 0 -21 for either depression or anxiety .  
Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) will also be presented.  Total score for the entire 
scale range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.
Responses to the WPAI -GH for each item will be summarized by  study  visit. I n addition, four

The duration of HAE attacks treated with rescue medication will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics (n, median, 25% and 75% quartiles, and range) b y type of rescue medication 
and rescue medication- treated attack number. 
9.9 Statistical/Analytic Considerations
9.9.1 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Interim anal yses may  be conducted to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory  
reporting when a reasonable number of subjects have completed 12 months of consecutive 
exposure to DX- 2930 across the combined DX -2930 -03 and DX -2930- 04 studies, and only  after 
database lock of Study  DX-2930-03. 
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide an 
ongo ing, independent review and assessment of the safet y data for Stud y DX -2930- 03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study , summary  safety  data from Study  DX-
2930- 04 may  be reviewed by  the DSMB established for Study  DX-2930- 03 as par t of the 
collection of safety information available on DX -2930.
9.9.2 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity
No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed.  An y statistical testing will be 
considered exploratory .
9.9.3 Handling of Missing Data
All available data will be included in the anal ysis.  No imputation of missing data will be 
performed.
9.9.4 Adjustment for Covariates
The impact of baseline covariates on the time to the first investigator -confirmed HAE attack will 
be explored to identify  and assess the importance of potential prognostic factors.
9.9.5 Multicenter Studies
Data from all study  sites that participate in this protocol will be combined so that an adequate 
number of subjects will be available for analy sis.
9.9.6 Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup anal yses are planned for the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the 
treatment period and adverse events using the Safety  Population. The following subgroups will 
be used:
•Age Group (<18, 18 to <40, 40 to <65, ≥65 years)
•Sex (Male, Female)
•Race Group (White, Other)
•Weight Group (<50, 50 to <75, 75 to <100, ≥100 kg)
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 111
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•BMI Group (<18.5, 18.5 to <25, 25 to <30, ≥30 kg/m2)
•Baseline HAE Attack Rate (1 to <2, 2 to <3, ≥3 attacks/month)
•HAE T ype (T ype I, T ype II, Unspecifi ed)
•Geographic Region (US, Canada, Jordan, Europe)
•DX-2930 Administration Ty pe (Health Care Provider, Self -administration)
•History  of lary ngeal HAE attacks (history  of laryngeal attack, no history  of lary ngeal attack)
9.9.7 Sensitivity Analyses
The following sen sitivity anal yses will be performed on the number of investigator -confirmed 
HAE attacks during the treatment period for each anal ysis population to evaluate the robustness 
of the results. Data summaries will parallel those described for the number of inves tigator -
confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period efficacy  endpoint.  
1.The anal ysis will be repeated counting HAE attacks occurring on Day  14 after administration 
of study  drug through Day  924, instead of Day  0 to Day  924.  For this analy sis, the p eriod of 
analysis would be a subset of the treatment period, defined as Day  14 to Day  924.
2.The anal ysis will be repeated counting HAE attacks occurring on Day  28 after administration 
of study  drug through Day  924, instead of Day  0 to Day  924. For this anal ysis, the period of 
analysis would be a subset of the treatment period, defined as Day  28 to Day  924.
3.The anal ysis will be repeated using all subject reported HAE attacks instead of limiting the 
analysis to those attacks that were investigator -confirmed.

the investigator abide b y the principles of the International Conferenc e on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines on GCP, applicable local regulatory  requirements, and the Declaration of Helsinki 
(Version 2008). The clinical study  also will be carried out in keeping with national and local 
legal requirements [in accordance with Unit ed States I nvestigational New Drug (IND) 
regulations (21 CFR 56)].
10.3 Subject Information and Consent
Before each subject is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
according to the regulatory  and legal requirements of the pa rticipating country . As part of this 
procedure, the investigator must explain orally  and in writing the nature, duration, and purpose 
of the study , and the action of the drug in such a manner that the study  subject is aware of the 
potential risks, inconven iences, or AEs that may  occur. The study  subject should be informed 
that he/she is free to withdraw from the study  at any  time. He/she will receive all information 
that is required b y federal regulations and ICH guidelines. Subjects who are under the age o f 18 
(or lower if age of consent is less than 18 in a specific country ) and whose legal guardian or 
caretaker has provided written informed consent will provide their assent to participate. The 
investigator or designee will provide the Sponsor with a cop y of the IRB/REB/IEC -approved 
informed consent form prior to the start of the study .
10.4 Subject Confidentiality
The anon ymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be specified on study  
documents by  their subject number, initial or birth d ate (if allowed based on local data protection 
regulations), not by  name. Documents that identify the subject (eg, the signed informed consent 
document) must be maintained in confidence b y the investigator.
The investigator agrees not to use or disclose pr otected health information other than as 
permitted or required b y the subject authorization or as required b y law.
10.5 Study Monitoring
The Sponsor (or designee) will conduct a stud y initiation visit to verify the qualifications of the 
investigator, inspect the facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures 
for ensuring adequate and correct documentation.
The investigator must prepare and maintain adequate and accurate records of all observations 
and other data pertinent to the clinical study  for each study  participant. Frequent communication 
between the clinical site and the Sponsor is essential to ensure that the safety  of the stud y is 
monitored adequatel y. The investigator will make all appropriate safet y assessments on an 
ongoing basis. The Medical Monitor may  review safet y information as it becomes available 
throughout the stud y.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 114
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
All aspects of the stud y will be carefully  monitored with respect to GCP and SOPs for 
compliance with applicable government regulations. The Study  Monitor will be an authorized 
individual designated b y the Sponsor. The Study  Monitor will have access to all records 
necessary  to ensure integrity  of the data and will periodicall y review the progress of the stud y 
with the investigator.
10.6 Case Report Forms and Study Records
The investigator will ensure the accuracy , completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to 
the Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure 
completeness, accuracy , reliability , and consist ency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of 
all data changes. The investigator or designee will cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) 
for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy  and completeness of the data 
capture s ystem at each scheduled monitoring visit.
Electronic consistency  checks and manual review will be used to identify  any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the clinical sites by  means of 
electronic or manual queries.
The investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study  documents 
(medical records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection forms, 
etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for ea ch subject receiving 
randomized study  drug.
The investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory  
authority  inspectors, and the I RB/REB/IEC to have direct access to all documents pertaining to 
the study .
A Trial Mas ter File will be maintained b y the Sponsor (or designee). All documents and other 
materials that pertain to the conduct of the trial quality  of the data, and compliance with GCPs 
will be collected in the Trial Master File.
10.7 Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide 
ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safet y data for Stud y DX -2930- 03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study , summary  safety  data from S tudy DX-
2930- 04 may  be reviewed by  the DSMB established for Study  DX-2930- 03 as part of the 
collection of safety information available on DX -2930. 
The DSMB will adhere to a prospectively determined Charter, which will be written b y the 
Sponsor and approve d by the DSMB. The Charter will define the responsibilities of the DSMB 
and Sponsor, the number and timing of the DSMB meetings, the conduct of the meetings, and

10.8 Protocol Violations/Deviations
The investigator will be instructed not to deviate from the protocol, except where necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study  participants. Should other unexpected circumstances 
arise that will requ ire deviation from protocol -specific procedures, the investigator should 
contact their Sponsor representative to discuss the appropriate course of action. 
The investigator should document all protocol deviations/violations in the subject’s eCRF and 
source documents or the Investigator Site File if appropriate. In the event of a significant 
deviation/violation, the investigator should notify the Sponsor representative. Significant 
deviations/violations include, but are not limited to those that increase the health risk to the 
subject, or confound interpretation of primary  study  assessments. The investigator will promptly  
report all changes in research activity  and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human 
subjects or others to his or her IRB/REB/IE C.
10.9 Premature Closure of the Study
If the Sponsor, investigator, or regulatory  authorities discover conditions arising during the stud y 
which indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacceptable subject risk, 
the study  may  be ter minated overall or at a specific site after appropriate consultation between 
the Sponsor and the investigator(s). In addition, a decision on the part of the Sponsor to stop the 
study , or to suspend or discontinue development of the investigational product may be made at 
any time. Conditions that may  warrant termination of the study  or site include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
•The discovery  of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study
•Failure of the inv estigator to comply  with pertinent global regulations
•Submission of knowingly  false information from the study  site to the Sponsor or other 
pertinent regulatory  authorities
•Insufficient adherence b y the investigator to protocol requirements
10.10 Access to Sour ce Documentation and On -Site Audits
Regulatory  agencies may request access to all study  records, including source documents, for 
inspection and cop ying, in keeping with country  regulations. The investigator should 
immediately  notify  the Sponsor representat ive of any  announced or unannounced regulatory  
agency  inspections. An auditing inspection may  also be conducted b y the Sponsor representative 
or designee. An y aspect of the trial may  be subject to audit by  the Sponsor and/or inspection by  
regulatory  author ities or the I RB/REB/IEC. Such audits/inspections may  take place at the 
Sponsor’s site(s), the CRO, or at the clinical sites, including laboratories, pharmacies and an y 
other facilities used for the study . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 116
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
The investigator will be responsible for the accu racy of the data entered in the eCRF. The 
investigator will permit the designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory  bodies to have 
direct access to the source documents to verify  data represented in the eCRF.
10.11 Data Generation and Analysis
This study  will be performed in accordance with regulatory  requirements outlined in Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) 21CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 54, 21 CFR Part 56, 21 CFR Part312 
and 21 CFR Part 11 as well as the I CH GCP E6 Guidelines. The study  monitors will mee t with 
the investigators and staff shortly  before the start of the trial to review the procedures for study  
conduct and documentation. During the study , the monitors will visit the sites to verify  record 
keeping and adherence to the protocol. For this stud y, eCRFs will be used. The monitors will 
conduct 100% source document verification by  comparing the eCRFs with the source documents 
to ensure accuracy  and consistency . Edit check programs, other forms of electronic validation, 
manual listings and a query  process will be executed to verify  the accuracy  of the database. The 
EDC sy stem will maintain a full audit trail of electronic data changes. Access to all source 
documentation will be made available for monitoring and audit purposes.
10.12 Retention of Data
All source documents (eg, informed consent forms, laboratory  reports, progress notes, medical 
histories, phy sical and diagnostic findings, diagnosis and pharmacy  records, and DX -2930 
dispensing/disposition records) that support data in the eCRFs of each study subject must be 
retained in the files of the responsible investigator.
According to ICH guidelines, essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an I CH region and until there are no p ending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an I CH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the DX -2930. However, these documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by  the appl icable legal requirements.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates or for an y other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keeping the study  records, custody must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The Sponsor re presentative must be notified in writing of the name and 
address of the new custodian, prior to the transfer.
10.13 Financial Disclosure
The investigator is required to disclose an y financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year 
after, whereb y the outcome of the study  could be influenced by  the value of the compensation for 
conducting the study , or other pay ments the investigator received from the Sponsor. The 
following information is collected: an y significant payments from the Sponsor or subsidiaries 
such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, retainer for 
ongoing consultation or honoraria; an y proprietary interest in investigational product; any 
significant equity  interest in the Sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 CFR 54 2(b) ( 1998).

(Modified) (US National Institutes of Health; National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases)
DIVISION OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS 
DISEASES (DMID) ADULT TOXICITY TABLE  
NOVEMBER 2007  
DRAFT  
 
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and 
should not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of the items that must be taken into 
consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease 
or condition?  
• The stage of test article development  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I, II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical experience with the test article  
o Are there any specific findings that require adjustment of  the toxicity table?  
  
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal 
values  at the single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal 
values when evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when 
selecting or developing a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no m edical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in 
activity - some assistance may be needed; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually requ ired; medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospitalizations possible 
GRADE 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, 
significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice 
care probable  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE -THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by the clinician to be serious or life -threatening should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening 
include, but are not limited to:  seizures, coma , tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acute psychosis, 
severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’ s 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have 
been adapted for use by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 
(DMID) and modified to better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 
•  For parameters not included in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to 
the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally grouped by body system.  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.

DIVISION OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS 
DISEASES (DMID) PEDIATRIC  TOXICIT Y TABLES  
NOVEMBER  2007 
DRAFT  
  
 
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and should 
not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of the items that must be taken into consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease or 
condition?  
• The stage of test article dev elopment  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I  (is it for the fisrt time in human subjects?) , II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical experience with the  test article  
o Are there any specific findings that require adjustment of  the toxicity table?  
o Has it been approved for this indication in adult population?  
  
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal values  at the 
single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal values when 
evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when selecting 
or developing a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate 
grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in activity - 
some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospitalizations possible  
GRADE 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, significant 
assistance  required; significant medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospitalization or hospice care probable  
GRADE 5                              Death  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE- THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by the clinician to be serious or life -threatening  should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening include, 
but are not limited to:  seizures, coma, tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acut e psychosis, severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’s Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have been adapted for use by the Div isi on  of Microbi ology  an d Infectiou s Di seases (DMID) an d m odified to 
better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 •  
For parameters not included in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally grouped by body system.  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.  Shire CONFIDENTIAL

This do cume nt applies to clinical t rials that involve investigator a djudi cation/assessment of 
angioede maattac
ks. The pur pose ofthis do cument is to p rovide a definition of a n HAE 
attack a nd to def ineastandar diz
ed se t ofprocedure s fortherepor tin g and a ssessment of 
events repor
ted by subjects to d etermine whethe r t hose events are true HAE a ttacks.
2 DEF
INITION OF AN ATTACK
To be confirmed a s a n HAE a ttack, the event mu st ha ve sy mptoms or signs c onsist ent with 
an attack in at least one ofthefollowingl ocations:
•Peripheral angioed ema: cutan eous s welling invol ving an ext remity, the fa ce, neck, to rso, 
and/or genitou rinary regi
on
•Abdomin al angioed ema: a bdomin al pain, with or without abdomin al dist ention, naus ea, 
vomitin g, or di arrhea
•Laryngea l angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, di fficulty speaking, di fficulty s wallowing, throat 
tightening, or
swelling of the ton gue, palate, uvula, or larynx
Despite thepresence of the sesymptoms, the investigatorm aystill d etermine c linically tha t 
theevent did not re prese nt an HAE a tt ack if thereare features that strongly refute sucha 
diagnosis. For
example, the reported eve nt is accomp anied by s ymptoms th at arenot 
consist ent with an attack (e.g., ur tic
aria), the reported eve nt persists well beyond the typi cal 
time courseof an a ttack (e.g., g reat erthan 7 days), or thereis alikely a lternateetiology for 
theevent (e.g., the subject’s abdomin al symptoms are attributabletoa viral gastroent eritis 
outbreak in the household).
To be counted as a unique
attack distin ct from th ei r previous attack, the new s ymptoms must 
occur a t least 24 hour s after resolution of thepriorattac k’s symptoms.
Attack re solution is def i
ned a s the subject no lo nger having sy mptoms of theattack. 
Prodroma l symptoms bythemselves are not c onsid ered an a ttac k.
Patient report ofuseof ac uteHAE
attack tr eatment for an attack by itselfis not confirma tion 
that an attack occurred.

APPENDIX 5 Summary of Pivotal Study DX -2930- 03 in Subjects with HAE
The proposed pivotal clinical study  (Study  DX-2930 -03) is entitled “HELP Study®: A 
Multicenter, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo- Controlled Efficacy  and Safety  Study  to 
Evaluate DX -2930 For Long -Term Prophy laxis Against Acute Attacks of Hereditary  
Angioedema (HAE).” This study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, rando mized, placebo -
controlled parallel -arm study  evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I or Ty pe II HAE. The double -blind study  is planned to 
be followed b y the stud y described in the present protocol, an open -label extension (OLE) study  
(DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of Study  DX-2930- 03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in 
preventing HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to evaluate the safet y of repeated SC 
administrations of DX
-2930. The t ertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic effects 
of chronically  administered DX -2930; to assess the immunogenicit y of chronically administered 
DX-2930; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of chronically  administered DX -2930; and to 
evaluate the effect of DX- 2930 upon quality  of life assessments.
Subjects aged 12 years and over with a documented diagnosis of Type I or Type II HAE who 
experience at least 1 attack per 4 weeks will be eligible for the study . Up to 120 subjects are 
planned for enrollment across approximately  60 sites in the United States, Canada, Ital y, 
German y, United Kingdom and Jordan.
Following informed consent, subjects will undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who are on 
long-term prophy lactic therapy  for HAE are required to undergo a minimum 2 week washout 
period prior to the start of the run -in period.  Subjects who are either not on long -term 
prophy lactic therapy  for HAE, or have completed the required washout period will enter a run -in 
period of 4 weeks to determine the ba seline HAE attack rate. The run
-in period may  be extended 
to 8 weeks if the minimum baseline attack rate is not achieved in the first 4 weeks. HAE subjects 
will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) administrations of DX -2930 
or plac ebo in a double -blind fashion.  Subjects who are randomized to DX -2930 will be assigned 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  4 weeks or 
150 mg every  4 weeks.  Each subject will undergo a treatment period consisting of 13 doses of 
blinded study  drug, for a period of 26 weeks from the date of first dose on Day  0 through Day  
182.
Subjects may  consent to rollover into the OLE study  (present protocol DX -2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks 
observed in each DX -2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the efficacy  
assessment period (Day  0 through Day  182).

Figure 2Overview of the Design of Pivotal Study DX-2930-03
Dose Rationale for Double -Blind, Pivotal Study  DX-2930-03
The dose rationale is based on the pharmacod ynamic bioactivity , PK, safety , and efficacy  of DX -
2930 from the Phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical studies. Together, these attributes provide 
the rationale for the selected doses and regimens to achieve drug levels likely  to prevent a 
majority  of HAE atta cks. Based on these considerations, 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  
4weeks, and 150 mg every  4 weeks were identified as the dosing regimens for evaluation,
The 3 proposed dose -regimen combinations provide a 6 -fold range of steady -state trough 
concentra tions and leverage both the biomarker and efficacy  data generated in Study  
DX-2930-
02.  Evaluation of the DX- 2930 plasma concentrations at the time of attacks reported 
by DX-2930 treated subjects in DX -2930- 02 suggests that the 3 planned dosing regimens wi ll 
provide a meaningful range of clinical response while avoiding non -therapeutic or super -
therapeutic doses and regimens.

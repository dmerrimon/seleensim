 1 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
1.1.1  Premise  
Understanding and mitigating persistent inflammation and coagulation activation is 
central to improving the quality and quantity of life for cont emporary HIV -positive 
persons. HIV treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively and durably 
suppresses viral replication leading to improved survival and profound reductions in risk 
for AIDS, though excess clinical risk remains from non -AIDS -related end -organ 
diseases such as car diovascular disease (CVD). Findings from multiple epidemiologic 
studies have reported associations between inflammatory (e.g. interleukin -6 [IL-6]) and 
coagulation (e.g., D -dimer) biomarker levels  and risk for CVD and all -cause mortality, 
independent of traditional risk factors, HIV factors, and other biomarkers.  Furthermore, 
despite effective treatment with ART, IL -6 and D -dimer levels remain elevated when 
compared to uninfected persons, and pred ict both short - and long -term mortality over 8 
years of follow -up among treated HIV patients.  Currently, HIV -related alterations in 
coagulation biology that account for strong D -dimer clinical risk associations, including 
strategies to mitigate this risk,  remain poorly characterized.  
 
We propose a model where hypercoagulation contributes to disease risk , in part,  by 
amplifying inflammatory pathways, in addition to the direct effects of thrombogenesis.  
We hypothesize that increased generation of activated factor X (FXa) contributes to a 
systemic elevation in pro -inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g. interleukin -6 [IL-6]) among 
HIV positive patients.  This occurs, in part, via FXa activation of protease activated 
receptor 2 (PAR -2) on monocytes and tissue macro phages, which perpetuates innate 
inflammation. It is well established that inflammation up -regulates coagulation 
pathways, in part via tissue factor (TF) expression and alterations in key coagulation 
factors —we have shown that both mechanisms contribute to  HIV-related 
hypercoagulation. However, the notion that coagulation activity can itself amplify 
inflammatory pathways is a more recent, novel, and testable hypothesis for how low -
level hypercoagulation may contribute to excess disease risk among HIV patien ts. 
 
Expanding our understanding of these complex pathways is critical given somewhat 
inconsistent observations that: a) a number of hypercoagulable changes are present 
during chronic  HIV disease , while, b) clinically apparent clots do not account for most  of 
the long -term disease risk predicted by elevated D -dimer levels. The TACT ICAL -HIV 
trial is a critical step to advance this field, providing essential information on the 
underlying mechanisms and on candidate immunologic surrogate markers that will 
inform larger clinical trials of anticoagulant treatments for HIV positive patients.  
1.1.2  Scientific Background  
The Changing Spectrum of Morbidity and Mortality Among HIV Positive Patients:  
Antiretroviral therapy (ART)  effectively and durably suppresses HIV replica tion, leads to 
immune recovery (increasing CD4+ T -cell counts) and  prolonged life expectancy, and 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 2 has changed the spectrum of morbidity and mortality among HIV positive persons.2-8 
Among well -treated patients with levels of HIV RNA below the l imit of detection, non -
AIDS -related conditions are now a more common cause of morbidity and mor tality than 
AIDS.6, 9-11 The most relevant serious non -AIDS -related diseases in current clinical 
practice include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, liver disease, 
end-stage renal disease, bone disease and subclinical neurocognitive dysfunction. Of 
these, CVD and cancer constitute the vast majority  of clinical events.5, 10-13 
 
Reasons for  Persistent Inflammation in Persons with ART -treated HIV Infection :  
Chronic inflammation in HIV disease arises from high levels of immune activation. HIV 
treatment with ART reduces activation of the immune response, including levels of 
inflammatory cytokines, though most immunologic abnorma lities persist compared to 
HIV uninfected persons.14, 15 HIV infection is classically associated with T -cell activation, 
reflecting adaptive immunity, but recent data demonstrate that innate immune  activation 
also contributes to chronic inflammation.16-20 The precise mechanisms driving high level 
immune activation are not entirely clear, but appear to involve both a persistent anti -HIV 
response (even with HIV RNA at low levels) and a more generalized immune activation 
(e.g., cytokine r elease).15, 21-23 Specifically, innocent bystande r activation —in which the 
pro-inflammatory aspects of HIV infection non -specifically drive T -cell and monocyte 
activation —also contributes.22, 24, 25 Othe r factors unique to HIV disease that may 
contribute to excess inflammation include: a) HIV -mediated destruction of gut 
epithelium, leading to greater translocation of bacterial products, b) dysregulated 
inflammatory responses to co -pathogens (e.g., CMV), a nd c) irreversible damage to the 
adaptive immune system (including lymphatic tissues).26-31  Treatments that reduce 
persistent inflammation among ART -treated HIV posit ive patients are lacking, and 
represents  an area of extensive research.32 
 
Potential P athologic Consequences of HIV-related Hypercoagulation : 
We have demonstrated that hypercoagulation in HIV disease arises, in part, from 
increases in tissue f actor (TF) procoagulant activity and alterations in the composition of 
coagulation factors.33, 34 Potential mechanisms driving these changes include:  a) non -
specific innate inflamm ation,35, 36 b) non -specific response to viral infections (e.g., 
interferon gamma release),37, 38 and c) HIV specific damage, e.g., loss of mucosal 
integrity with microbial translocation and TF activation.39 The net -result is 
hypercoagulation; this concept is supported by data from our group and others showing 
that D -dimer levels remain elevated in treated HIV disease.14, 39-41  
Although HIV is associated with increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease, very 
few clinical events predicted by D -dimer l evels include large vessel thrombosis.42 One 
explanation provided by non -human primate data suggests that hypercoagulation may 
manifest in end -organ damage via microvascular clotting resulting in thrombotic 
microangiopathy.43 This hypothesis is supported by the well -recognized association 
between HIV and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).44 Another novel 
explanation entails our innovative aim 1 hypothesis, namely that hypercoagulation 
contributes to clinical r isk in treated HIV disease by up -regulating systemic 
inflammation, in part, via TF/VIIa and FXa activation of PAR -2 pathways ( Figure ).  
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 3 Recent data have established the 
interplay between coagulation and 
inflammation, including bi -
directional feedback .36 Protease 
activat ed receptors (PARs) play a 
central role in mediating this cross -
talk, as established in conditions 
like acute lung injury, sepsis and 
myocardial infarction.45, 46 PAR-1 is 
activated by various proteases, 
including FXa and thrombin, 
whereas PAR -2 is activated by the 
TF:FVIIa  complex, FXa, as well as 
other proteases47-50 In this 
proposal we use an experimental 
approach to test this hypothesis by blocking FXa  with low -dose edoxaban . 
 
Outcome s: IL-6 (and D -dimer)  Predict  Risk for  Non-AIDS  Defining Clinical Events :  
Excess risk for non -AIDS conditions is due to multiple factors, including a higher burden 
of traditional risk factors, but persistent inflammation despite ART is a key HIV-related 
risk factor . Recent data from a number of epidemiologic studies have shown t hat 
inflammatory biomarkers well validated in the aging and cardiovascular fields19, 51-54 are 
elevated with untreated and (to a lesser degree) treated HIV infection,14, 40, 55 and 
predict risk for CVD, cancer, and non -AIDS mortality.42, 56-61 Our group conducted a 
series of nested case -control and cohort studies  in collaboration with INSIGHT 
investigators , using data from 3 large HIV trials (SMART, ESPRIT, and SILCAAT), and 
determined that associations  for risk of  CVD, cancer, a composite of serious non -AIDS 
events, and all-cause mortal ity was most robust for levels of interleukin -6 (IL-6), as well 
as D-dimer ( Figure ).62-64 These associations are not attenuated by adjusting for HIV or 
traditional CVD risk factors,  are several -fold higher than reported in HIV -negative 
studies , and persist over a median of 5 .5 years of follow -up.  Importantly , these IL -6 and 
D-dimer asso ciations are independent of each other, making them  ideal candidate 
surrogate clinical risk 
marker s reflecting the 
potential harm from 
systemic inflammation 
and coagulation .42, 63, 65, 
66 An important 
implication is that any 
treatment candidate that 
down regulates both 
pathways (e.g., 
edoxaban) has 
significant potential for 
corresponding clinical 
benefit.  

 Protocol Version 2.0  
 4 1.2 Hypothesis and Objectives  
We hypothesize that increased generation of activated factor X (FXa) contributes to a 
systemic elevation in pro -inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g. IL -6) among HIV positive 
patients.  This occurs, in part, via FXa activation of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR -
2) on monocytes and tissue macrophages, which perpetuates innate inflammation .  We 
will test our hypothesis with an oral antagonist to FXa (edoxaban), and quantify the 
immunologic effects of PAR -2 inhibition on systemic i nflammation and monocyte 
activation.  We will  address the following specific objectives:  
 
 Primary Objective:  Evaluate the treatment effects of edoxaban  on systemic 
inflammation  
 
 Main  Secondary Objectives:   Evaluate the treatment effects of edoxaban on 
monocyte activation, tissue factor activity and coagulation.  
 
2 METHODOLOGY  
2.1 Trial Design  
The potential benefits of pharmacologic inhibition of FXa will be studied among HIV 
positive participants receiving ART with suppressed HIV viral load and a D -dimer > 100 
ng/mL.   The study design is  a cross -over placebo controlled randomized trial of 
edoxaban  30mg daily versus matched placebo (n=40  total participants ).  After screening 
and baseline visits, participants will be randomized to the sequence of drug 
adminis tration (i.e., edoxaban vs. placebo). The full visit sequence is listed below in 
Table 1.  After randomization, participants w ill start study medication #1 and follow -up 
for visits at months 1, 2, 3 and 4.  They w ill then stop study medication for 3 months , 
return for visits at months 7 and 8 (analogous to screening and baseline, respectively), 
then start study medication #2 and follow -up for visits at months 9, 10, 11, and 12.

This cross -over design will efficiently study short -term treatment effects among a 
smaller sample. The half -life o f edoxaban is approximately 6-10 hours and treatment 
related changes in biomarkers such as IL -6 and D -dimer is typically present within 1 -2 
months . Thus, the washout period of 3 months extends beyond potential post -treatment 
effects, prior to starting study medication #2.  
The treatment effect (i.e., c hanges from pre-treatment  levels) over 4 months will be 
assessed in measures of inflammation, immune activation, tissue factor (TF) activity 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 5 and coagulation .  For comparisons with placebo, e ach participant will then serve as his 
or her own control in this cross -over design.  
 
2.2 Study Population  
The target population  is HIV po sitive patients receiving effective ART treatment with 
viral suppression.  These participants are at low risk for AIDS progression, and low 
clinical event risk over the short term.  Health consequences in this population are 
largely due to non-AIDS definin g complications over the longer term, related to 
persistent inflammation and coagulation activity (e.g., CVD).  Participants must also not 
have co -morbid diseases known to be pro -inflammatory, or have current use of 
immune -modulatory or anti -coagulant drugs. Participants will be recruited from the 
HCMC HIV clinic, in Minneapolis, which provides care for 2000 HIV positive participants 
(>80% of whom are receiving ART with suppressed viral load).  
A D-dimer threshold of ≥100 ng/mL is used to improve the potenti al risk-benefit balan ce, 
by excluding those at the lowest clinical risk with little to no evi dence of coagulation 
activation.  This threshold corresponds approximately to the separation between the 1st 
(lowest) and 2nd quartile of D -dimer levels among ART -treated participants (n=3766) in 
our preliminary data ( see Figure of Kaplan Meier plots within scientific rationale above ).  
Participants with D -dimer levels in the 1st quartile had very low rates of clinical events 
during follow -up. This D -dimer threshold  enriches the target population with participants 
most likely to benefit while still studying the treatment effects over a wide range of 
coagulation activity.  Clinical lab measures of D -dimer will be used for screenin g only; 
outcome analyses will use D -dimer mea sures from the central  core lab.

2.3 Study Medication Intervention  
At baseline, p articipants will start blinded study medication, either edoxaban  or 
matching placebo at 3 0mg daily.  After 4 months they will stop study medication.  
Participants will remain off study drug between month 4 and month 8.  At the month 8 
visit, participants will again begin blinded study medication, corresponding to the 
comparison drug for that which was ta ken between baseline and month 4.  Thus, 
participants are randomized to either:  a) active study drug x4 months, washout (no 
drug), matched placebo x4 months, or b) matched placebo x4 months, washout (no 
drug), active study drug x4 months.  Double blinding  is maintained.  
Clinical labs, including HIV staging labs and coagulation measures, will be monitored  
prior to initiating each study medication and at 1 and 4 months after starting  each study 
medication (see Table 2  of study outcomes and visit schedule bel ow) 
2.3.1  Edoxaban  
Edoxaban is a competitive direct inhibitor of FXa , and will be used to test our central 
hypothesis that FXa activity (via PAR -2) contributes monocyte activa tion and systemic 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 7 inflammation.   Edoxaban exhibits >10,000 -fold selectivity for FXa rel ative to thrombin, 
which exhibits immunologic cross -talk via activation of PAR -1.  Edoxaban is currently 
FDA-approved for stroke prevention in patients with non -valvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF) and as treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). 
The recommended dose is 60mg orally once daily for both indications (NVAF and 
DVT/PE).  The dose should be reduced to 30mg once daily for patients with  an 
estimated  creatinine clea rance of 30 -50 mL/min .  Finally, for the NVAF indication the 
FDA recommended not using edoxaban among patients with a creatinine clearance >95 
mL/min due to decreased efficacy in the prevention of ischemic stroke; given this was 
not due to an increase risk  for bleeding complications, there is no upper limit in 
creatinine clearance as part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria for TACTICAL -HIV. 
In the TACTICAL -HIV study, study drug will be taken as one 30mg dose of edoxaban 
(or matching placebo) daily in the m orning (AM) , and only participants with a creatinine 
clearance >50 mL/min will be enrolled.  
Pharmacokinetic properties of edoxaban include rapid absorption with attainment of 
peak plasma concentration within 1 -2 hours, and a half -life of approximately 6 -10 
hours.67  Metabolites are formed la rgely via hydrolysis with only minor contribution from 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A.  There is little systemic accumulation of edoxaban at 10 
days after administration.67  Edoxaban can be administered with or without food, wi th 
little effect on bioavailability. Edoxaban is a substrate for the efflux transporter P -
glycoprotein (P -gp), and as a consequence serum levels may increase with concomitant 
admini stration of strong P -gp inhibit ors (e.g., verapamil, quinidine). Renal cleara nce 
likely involves active secretion .  
Risks associated with edoxaban use include bleeding.  Phase -3 clinical trial safety data 
arises from the ENGAGE AF -TIMI a nd Hokusai -VTE trials.68, 69 Major bleeding event, 
defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, was 1.6% with 
edoxaban 30mg daily among those with atrial fibrillation in ENGAGE AF -TIMI, and also 
1.6% among those receiving a higher dose of edoxaban at  60mg for clinical VTE.68-70 In 
addition, in Hokusai -VTE study populations the rate of any clinically relevant bleeding 
was 8.5% for edoxaban (c ompared to 10.3% for warfarin).   The most common side 
effects overall in these studie s were bleeding, rash, abnormal liver tests, and anemia.  
The greatest potential for drug interactions entails the potential need for dose reduction 
with concomitant use of  P-gp inhibitors.  Concomitant administration of platelet -
inhibitors or NSAIDs may also increase bleeding risk.   Edoxaban is not safe for use 
during pregnancy.  
Routine clinical lab monitoring of coagulation tests are not indicated during edoxaban 
use.  Anti -factor Xa assay increases proportionally to serum levels of edoxaban.  
INR/PT and aPTT increase with edoxaban use, but to a highly variable degree.  
Episodes of bleeding from direct FXa inhibitors such as edoxaban are managed 
clinically with supportive care and potential use of Prothrombin Concentrate Complex 
(PCC).  
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 8 2.3.2  Randomization and Blinding  
Eligible participants who consent to study procedures will be random ized 1:1 to the 
sequence that they receive edoxaban  or matching placebo. Treatment assignments will 
be generated using a permuted block randomization scheme. Sites will use a secure, 
on-line program to obtain trea tment assignments.  The program  will also v erify eligibility 
and the existence of key baseline data. Treatment assignments will be verified and 
recorded in a dataset blinded to view by site staff.   
A bottle ID number (BID) unique to each bottle will be assigned to participants, and 
used by study st aff to obtain the correct blinded study drug  (active or placebo). Site staff  
will not have access to the treatment assignment linked to each bottle number, and 
bottle numbers will not be assigned in sequence.  
Blinding will occur at 3 levels:  1) treatment assignment will be blinded, 2) interim data 
summaries will blinded to all but the unblinded statistician and 3) core lab oratory  staff 
will be blinded to treatment group. In the rare event that the blind must be broken, every 
effort will be made to minimize  the extent of the unblinding (for staff and participants) 
and an assessment of blinding will occur at the end of the study . 
The blind may be broken in cases of a clinical bleeding event, where reversal of anti -
coagulation is being considered —e.g., with p rothrombin concentrate complex (PCC) .  
Procedures will be established for the study coordinator to obtain the key/blind for a 
given participant from the dispensing pharmacy.  
2.3.3  Study Drug Production and Distribution   
Active edoxaban 3 0mg tablets and matching placebo will be provided  and distributed  by 
Daiichi Sankyo, Inc .  Study drug will be provided in prepackaged bottles that include a 
one-month supply  plus additional drug to facilitate a visit window of +/- 2 weeks  (n=42 ).  
Each bottle will have a unique bo ttle ID number, along with appropriate packaging, 
license and content information per regulations.  Clinical site pharmacy will receive and 
store study drug until dispensing to participants or site staff (who then dispense to 
participants) in the context o f study visits. One bottle will be dispensed at baseline, and 
one additional bottle at the 1 , 2, and 3 -month study visits.  No study drug will be 
dispensed or taken between month 4 and 8, but one bottle will again be dispensed at 
the 8, 9, 10 and 11 -month study visit.  
  
The clinical site will communicate directly with the Daiichi Sankyo study team 
representative to ship  drug to sites.  Daiichi -Sankyo  will provide the DCC with the key 
linking the BID (unique to each bottle) with whether the contents are active edoxaban or 
matching placebo.  The DCC will then instruct sites which bottle(s) to dispense to 
patients based on the BID. 
2.4 Outcomes  
Primary Outcome  
 IL-6 plasma levels:  the difference between treatment and control conditions in 
change  from pre-treatment to on -treatment values   
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 9  
Secondary Outcomes  
 Adherence  
 Tolerability and side e ffects  
 Bleeding episodes:  Major bleeding and those defined as BARC Type 2, 3, 4, 5  
 Monocyte a ctivation:  cellular phenotypes (e.g., CD14+/ CD16+) , monocyte 
microparticles (MMPs),  and plasma biomarkers (e.g., sCD14, sCD163, TNF -α, 
sTNFr -1) 
 Functional TF pro -coagulant activity:  TF -positive microparticle (MPTF), cell -
associated TF, and whole blood TF  pro-coagulant activity  
 Coagulation activity (e.g., D -dimer levels , thrombin -antithrombin complex [TAT] , and 
functional thrombin potential assay ) 
 Endothelial activation:  endothelial cell microparticles (EMPs)  
 T-cell activation and senescence  phenotypes  in blood  
 Explore the potential impact of edoxaban co -administered with ART on viral 
suppression and the anti -inflammatory treatment effect (via subgroup analyses 
defined by type/class of antiretroviral use)  
 
Important Exploratory Analyses  
 Determine if the  treatment effect from Edoxapan differs depending on pre -treatment 
FXa activity (estimated from computational modeling)  
 Estimate the potential effect of Edoxaban treatment on clinical event risk (e.g., 
serious non -AIDS events , CVD, mortality, etc. ), as pre dicted by IL -6 and D -dimer 
associations with clinical risk.  
2.4.1  Study Visit Schedule  
Participants will be screened and, i f eligibility criteria are met, will be randomized at the 
baseline visit  to start active study drug or matched placebo (blinded).  Randomization 
will occur within 60 days  of screening .  
After screening  and baseline visit s, participants will start edoxaban 30mg once every 
morning (or matched placebo) .  They will return for study visits at months 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
after which they will stop study medication.  At month 7 and 8 they will return for repeat 
laboratory and study visit procedures.  After the month 8 study visit is completed, 
participants will r esume blinded study medication (either edoxaban 30mg or placebo, 
whichever was not given from baseline to month 4), and then follow -up for study visit 
procedures at months 9, 10, 11 and 12.  The visit schedule i s outlined in the table 
below. Patients will be fasting for all blood draws (except screening).  
 
Toxicity labs and a clinical assessment  will be ascertained as part of  follow -up study 
visits.  If clinical labs (e.g., HIV RNA level, CD4 count, BMP, hepatic panel, and CBC) 
are available as part of rout ine clinical monitoring during the study visit window, these 
results may be used in place of repeating clinic labs at the study visit.  If new symptoms 
develop that may be related to study medications, the site study investigator  is to be 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 10 notified within 24  hours and a clinical determination is to be made whether additional 
toxicity labs and/or  adherence requires assessing .

2.4.2  Power and Sample Size Considerations  
The study employs a cross -over design, with participants serving as their own 
comparison.  To reduce variability in the primary outcome (log IL -6), we will average the 
2 pre -treatment measures ( i.e., screening and baseline  or months 7 and 8 ) as well as 
the 4 follow -up measures ( i.e., months 1, 2, 3, and 4 , or months 9, 10,  11, and 12 ). 
2.4.2.1  Primary outcome (IL -6) power and sample size  
We estimate that this cross -over design with n=40 participants will have 80% power at 
level alpha=0.05 to detect a treatment effect of 0.35 SD on log IL -6, corresponding to a 
23% relative differenc e in (non -log transformed) IL -6 levels between treatment 
conditions. In addition to the study and analysis structure described above, our 
simulation -based power calculation assumes a study attrition rate of 10% (i.e., 90% of 
subjects provide valid follow -up data). Measurements were simulated from the following 
random effects model:  𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘= 𝛽0+𝑏0𝑖+ 𝛽1𝑡𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑗∗𝑓𝑢𝑖𝑗+ 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘   , where 𝑡𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑗 is the 
treatment indicator and 𝑓𝑢𝑖𝑗 is the indicator that the measurement is a follow -up 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 11 measureme nt. 𝑏0𝑖 is an individual -specific random effect, and 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 is the residual, 
assumed independent of 𝑏0𝑖.  𝑏0𝑖 and 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 are assumed to be normally distributed with 
zero mean and variances chosen to simultaneously satisfy 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘)= 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑏0𝑖)+
 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘)=0.55, and 𝜌(𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘,𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑙)=𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑏0𝑖)
𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑏0𝑖)+𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘) = 0.4, respectively the cross -
sectional variance and longitudinal correlation of log IL -6 observ ed in data from the 
SMART study . 
2.4.2.2  Power for secondary objectives  and exploratory analyses  
Few pilot data are available to characterize the correlation between multiple 
measurements of monocyte activation and monocyte TF -activity.  However, preliminary 
data provide  variance estimates for some of these markers.71 We conducted a 
simulat ion similar to that described for the primary outcome above , varying the 
between -time correlation of markers from 0.1 (low) to 0.7 (high). Across all cases, the 
given sample size gave at least 80% power to detect a 0.35 SD effect size, which 
corresponds to 22%, 32%, 24%, and 10% relative reductions in CD14+/CD16+, TF+, 
sCD163, and sCD14, re spectively.  For D -dimer, our study will have approximately 80% 
power to detect a 26% difference in (non -log transformed) levels of this marker between 
treatment conditions. Though data are unavailable on TAT, it is anticipated that the 
between -measurement correlation is likely to be the same and hence a 0.35 SD effect 
will correspond to a difference of approximately 20 -30% on this marker.  
Our analysis is also well -powered to detect a difference in treatment effect by degree of 
continuous pre -treatment FXa a ctivity: we estimate >80% power to detect a 0.25 SD log 
IL-6 difference in treatment effect (~22% relative difference on original IL -6 scale) 
between groups differing by 1 SD in FXa activity . 
The effects on IL -6 and D -dimer that we are well -powered to dete ct with our given 
sample size (i.e., ~25% reductions) correspond to estimated reductions of ~37% in the 
risk for the composite outcome of serious non -AIDS event (CVD, cancer, liver or renal 
event) or death (see Scientific Background 1.1.2 ), when using a jo int model and 
assuming both biomarkers are reduced by the same amount.  If one marker changes 
more than the other, e.g., a 30% reduction in D -dimer levels with a minimal 5 -10% 
reduction in IL -6 levels, this would correspond to a predicted 20% reduction in event risk 
(again, see IL-6 and D -dimer data in Scientific Background 1.1.2 ). 
 
3 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  
3.1 Administration of Study Procedures  
Study  site coordinators  will be trained prior to study implementation and will perform all 
study visit procedures  during the conduct of the study .  The lead physician investigator 
will conduct clinical and drug toxicity assessments as indicated during the study.   
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 12 3.2 Categorization  of Bleeding Events  
All bleeding events will be categorized using the Bleeding Academic Research 
Consortium (BARC) definitions outlined below and in appendix B .  In addition a ‘major 
bleeding’ event will be de fined based on definitions established by the International 
Society  on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH).  
3.2.1  ISTH Definition of Major Bleeding  
Major bleeding in non -surgical patients are defined by the following criteria:  
 Fatal bleeding, and/or  
 Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, 
intraspi nal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra -articular or pericardial, or 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or  
 Bleeding causing a fall  in hemoglobin level of ≥2 g/dL , or leading to transfusion 
of ≥2 units of whole blood or red cells.  
3.2.2  Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) Definitions  
BARC definitions are reviewed in detail in Appendix B, but briefly entail:  
 Type 0  – No bleeding  
 Type 1  – Bleeding  that is not actionable or requiring healthcare evaluation  
 Type 2  – Overt bleeding beyond what would be expected for a clinical 
circumstance that requires healthcare evaluation but does not meet criteria for 
type 3, 4, or 5.  
 Type 3 – Overt bleeding with hemoglobin drop >3 g/dL, bleeding requiring 
transfusion, intracranial hemorrhage, or bleeding int o other designated body 
compartments (e.g., cardiac tamponade)  
 Type 4 – Bleeding related to cardiac surgery  
 Type 5 – Fatal bleeding  
 
3.3 Study Management  of Bleeding E vents  
The site investigator will review all bleeding events, of any grade or severity, as soo n as 
the study team becomes aware of the event.  At that time, the event will be categorized 
in terms of BARC or ISTH classification and a corresponding decision will be made with 
respect to continuation of study drug.  
 
Participants with BARC Type 1 and 2 adverse bleeding episodes will continue with the 
study drug, unless assessment by the study investigator or medical care provider 
indicates that continuing on study  drug would be associated with escalation of the 
bleeding event or other excess risk in the clinical context.  
 
Participants with BARC Type 3 or a ‘major b leeding’ event will have the study 
medication permanently discontinued.  Participants must be followed regularly (e.g., 
weekly) until resolution of the adverse event.  
 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 13 Any participant  planning to undergo a surgical procedure during the follow -up period 
should not be enrolled into the study.  If there is a need for a surgical procedure during 
the follow -up period, the study drug should be discontinued permanently.  It is important 
that the treating physician be made aware the participant may have been taking 
edoxaban (and oral FXa inhibitor).  
 
If any participant suffers a fatal bleed the blind for that participant will be broken.  If the 
participant were taking edoxaban at the time of th e event, the study will be temporarily 
stopped while the DSMB can review the event in the context of other clinical and safety 
information.  
 
Participants should be referred for acute medical evaluation with any overt clinical 
bleeding, bleeding consistent with BARC Type 2 or above,  or a major bleeding event.   
Study team investigators should immediately make the clinical treatment team aware 
that the study participant is potentially taking edoxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor; this should 
include a direct phone c all as well as documentation in the electronic health record.  
Clinical management will include standard of care along with cessation of study 
medication.   See APPENDIX C  for an approach to bleeding complications related to 
Factor Xa -inhibition with edoxab an.  NOTE:   Prothrombin concentrate complex (PCC ), 
such as K -Centra (i.e., replacement of factors II, VII, IX, and X),  may be effective in 
management of bleeding in the context of FXa inhibition, but there is no current antidote 
and dialysis is not effecti ve. 
 
3.4 Study Drug Cessation  
At baseline, participants will start blinded study medication consisting of edoxaban or 
matching placebo at 30mg every morning. No dose adjustment can be made during 
the study.  Tolerability, side effects, adverse events and clinical laboratory monitoring 
will be assessed at each study visit (via participant report and clinical labs), and at 
anytime during the study per the discretion of the clinical site investigator.   
 
If an ad verse event of grade ≥3 is assessed as related to study drug, study  medication 
should be stopped. If a grade 2 rash is persistent, study medication may also be 
stopped at the discretion of the site investigator.  Medication may also be stopped for 
grade <3  adverse events if the study investigator determines that the participant may be 
at risk for an escalation of the adverse event, persistent toxicity, or at risk in excess of 
what would be expected due to o ther contextual circumstances. If study medication was 
discontinued due to an adverse event of grade <3 that is not expected to recur, the 
study investigator may recommend re -initiating study medication.  
 
Any of the following will also result in stopping study medication  (see section 3.1.2) : 
i. Major bleeding  event  
ii. BARC Type 3 bleeding event   
iii. Any surgical procedure  with bleeding risk  
iv. Investigator or participant wishes to stop study medication  
 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 14 3.5 Adherence and Tolerability  
Adherence will be assessed via participant self -report and pill count (by study 
coordinator s) during each follow -up visit.  Tolerability will also be assessed via self -
report, with additional laboratory assessments performed for toxicity.  
 
3.6 Concomitant Medications and Antiretroviral Therapy  
Any antiretroviral medication and ART regimen may be used that is recommended as a 
potential option in the US DHHS guidelines on use of ART for adults with HIV 
infection.72  
 
Concomitant medications will be assessed at every study visit.  Medications 
contraindica ted for this study include those that may increase risk of bleeding and/or 
substantially increase the effective exposure or serum drug levels of edoxaban (e.g., 
substrates for P -gp). NOTE:   There are numerous medications that are substrates for P -
glycoprot ein (P -gp), and therefore have potential to influence edoxa ban levels (and 
vice-a-versa). Concomitant medications associated with potential drug -drug interactions 
that are anticipated to be modest/minimal will not necessarily be contra -indicated for this 
short-term study  (e.g., atorvastatin, digoxin) . 
3.6.1  Contraindicated concomitant medications for this study include : 
i. Aspirin (daily use  >3 days ) 
ii. Platelet inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel)  
iii. NSAIDs (daily use  >3 days ) 
iv. Fibrinolytic therapy  (within 1 month ) 
v. Verapamil  
vi. Quinidine  
vii. Amiodarone  
viii. Dronedarone  
ix. Ketaconazole and other azoles  
x. Erythromycin and other macrolides  
xi. Illicit drug use (e.g., cocaine)  
xii. Medications or drugs that may  be associated with unacceptable  increase 
risk to participants,  as determined by the study inves tigator.  
 
3.7 Data Collection  
All data will be entered into web -based case report forms and transferred to servers at 
the data coordinating center (DCC) at University of Minnesota School of Public Health 
using REDCap software.  Paper source documentation will also be kept in a secure, 
locked location at each clinical site.  Study coordinators  and/or other qualified research 
technicians will perform all blood draws and blood specimen processing.  
  
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 15 3.8 Blood Specimen Processing  
The blood specimen collection tubes and processing protocols are  outlined in the study 
laboratory manual.   Participants will be fasting for all study visit blood draws (optional for 
screening visit).  Plasma and serum specimens will need to be processed  from whole 
blood  within 1 hour  of collection.  Peripheral blood mon onuclear cell ( PBMC ) specimens 
will be processed locally at the University of Minnesota  and stored until analyzed by 
core immunology laboratory at the end of follow -up. 
3.9 Clinical Labs  
All clinical labs will be measured on fresh blood specimens the day of the study visit, at 
the HCMC clinical lab using CLIA approved standards .  D-dimer levels at screening will 
be assessed at HCMC using HemosIL D -Dimer HS, a latex -enhanced turbidimetric 
immunoassay, on the  ACL TOP automated analyzer (from Instrumentation Laboratory).  
Normal range for D -dimer levels using these methods are 0 -229 ng/mL.   Plasma HIV 
RNA level will be estimated using COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® HIV -1 Test, 
v2.0.    
 
The following clinical labs will be assessed to monitor for toxicity  per Table 2 above : 
i. Complete Blood Count (CBC, with platelet count and differential)  
ii. Basic Metabolic Panel (B MP) 
iii. Coagulation panel (INR/PT, aPTT, anti -FXa)  
iv. Hepatic Function panel (ALT, AS T, Total bilirubin)  
 
4  SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
4.1 Measures to reduce risk for adverse events  
Risks related to edoxaban are principally related to bleeding events .  To reduce this 
risk, p articipants will be counseled to avoid concomitant medications that may increase 
risk for bleeding and be made aware of potential signs/symptoms that may be 
associated with occult bleeding (e.g., dyspepsia, black stools, weakness, fatigue) . 
 
4.2 Adverse Event Definition s 
4.2.1  Adverse Event (AE):   
Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical research participant administered 
an investigational product , which may or may not have a causal relationship with 
the investigational product. As such, an AE can be an unfavorable or unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the product.  
 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 16 If a preexisting condition worsens post -enrollment (frequency increases and/or 
severity grade increases), it should be reported as an adverse event.  
 
A symptom check -list will be included in the CRF (detailed in the protocol 
implementation manual) that includes common symptoms or side effects typically 
related to edoxaban therapy.  
 
Appendix E provides a table of adverse events, with grading criteria, adopted 
from the DAIDS 2009 Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Advers e Events  
 
4.2.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE):   
Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
i. Death,  
ii. A life -threatening condition,  
iii. A congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
iv. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
v. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
vi. An important medical event that, based upon appropriate medi cal judgment, 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
4.2.3  Unanticipated Problem (UP) : 
Any event that is:  
i. Unexpected , AND  
ii. Related to study participation in this study , AND  
iii. Increase the ri sk of harm to the participant or others (or be an SAE)  
 
4.3 Documenting Adverse Events  and Unanticipated Problems  
All serious adverse events (SAE) and unanticipated problems (UP) , regardless of the 
assessed relationship with study drug, will be ascertained and recorded on study visit 
CRFs (through the online REDCAP interface).  
 
All new non-serious adverse events of grade ≥3 or deemed related to study drug  will be 
ascertained and recorded on study vi sit CRFs (through the online REDCAP  interface). 
Criteria for assigning a grade of severity  of adverse events  are summarized in 
Appendix E.   
 
NOTE:   adverse events based on laboratory criteria will only be 
ascertained/recorded if ≥ grade 3, and no adverse events will be 
ascertained/recorded based on CD4+ T -cell count criteria.  
 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 17 There are five severity grades that can be assigned to adverse events, which are 
defined as follows:  
i. Grade 1 = Mild  
ii. Grade 2 = Moderate  
iii. Grade 3 = Severe  
iv. Grade 4 = Potentially life -threatening  
v. Grade 5 = Death  
 
Addit ional information ascertained for each adverse event includes:  a) date of onset, b) 
relationshi p to study drug (see section 4. 3.1 below ), c) any action taken on study drug, 
and d) whether t he adverse event qualifies as an SAE (including the criteria fulfi lled).  
 
Source documentation (in addition to the CRF variables for AEs) will be collected by 
research coordinators at the clinical site  for all AEs of grade ≤3, SAEs or UPs.  
4.3.1  Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
For all adverse event s grade ≥3 , SAEs or UPs that occur after randomization , 
study investigator(s) will assess the potential relationship of the event to the 
study medication.  One of the following designations will be used:   
 
i. Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the 
study agent(s).  
 
ii. Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related 
to the study agent(s).  Alternative etiology, diagnosis or, explanation for the AE 
should be provided.  
 
4.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  and Unanticipated Problems  
The IRB (or Human Subjects Committee ) and the Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB, see section 5 below) will receive notification of all SAEs that are deemed 
protocol related , or a UP.  NOTE:  an adverse event (of any grade) that is unexpected , is 
reasonably believed to be related to study participation , and involves risk  to the 
participant  or others should be captured as a UP (per definition s above 4.2).   
 
The site will enter information about the SAE/UP event into the appropriate case report 
form (via REDCap reporting).  The data center  can generate a summary of individual, or 
a series of, AE events upon request from the site . 
 
Daiichi Sankyo  will receive notification of all SAEs and/or UPs  within 5  business days of 
learning of the  event .  Reporting of all SAE/UP events will be made to Daiichi Sankyo , 
the FDA (voluntary submission) and the NHLBI P rogram Official  using the same 
reporting information (FDA Form 3500 per below).  Specifically,  sites must:  
 
a) Inform local IRB per institutional guidelines and timelines  
b) fill out a n SAE/UP case report form, via REDCap  online reporting  
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 18 c) fill out an SAE/UP  Form provided by Daiichi Sankyo (APPENDIX F)   
d) email the completed to Daiichi Sankyo  representative  
e) voluntary reporting to FDA, via either submitting  MedWatch Form FDA 3500 or 
complete voluntary reporting online via FDA MedWatch (see below for link)  
 
FDA MedWatch  reporting forms may be found at:

4.5 Participant Withdrawal  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time at their request, as described in 
the consent.  All randomized participants  will be encouraged to complete a final study 
visit, including all v isit procedures . 
 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 19 5 Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a 
daily basis. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be formed with Dr. 
Wolfson as the un -blinded statistician; other members will not be part of the study team . 
Committee members will have experience with HIV/AIDS clinical research and 
thrombosis and anticoagulation therapy .  
5.1 Interim  Analysis  
Most of the primary blood and tissue outcomes will not be available until after visits are 
compl eted, as samples will be batch processed at our participating laboratory site. 
Hence, there will be no formal interim analyses for efficacy or futility related to the main 
study outcomes . 
5.2 Frequency and Content of Data and Safety Monitoring  
To ensure compl iance and data are reported correctly and completely, CRF data will be 
monitored monthly for completeness and compliance with the study protocol.  Queries 
for clarification or data completion will be  communicated from the data center to the 
clinical site .  
 
Prior to enrollment the DSMB will review the protocol and data analysis plan.  During 
the study the DSMB will meet at every 6 months, and on an ad -hoc bases as 
necessitated for adverse events . An initial DSMB meeting will be scheduled as soon as 
any of t he following occurs:  
i. Six months have elapsed since enrollment of the first patient  
ii. 50% of goal enrollment is achieved  
iii. 15 participants have completed 1st study drug period (i.e., 4 months)  
  
The data and safety monitoring report will include  data on : enroll ment (including 
progress), visit attendance, completeness of data, completeness and quality of 
specimen collection, baseline characteristics, adherence and discontinuation of 
medication, and side effects and adverse events.   
 
5.2.1  Safety Monitoring by DSMB Officers  
The PI will be informed of all SAEs  deemed protocol related, UPs, or significant 
bleeding events  as soon as they occur and will notify the DSMB for review within 7 
business days of notification.  The two clinicians (one HIV /Medicine  and one 
Hematology) on the DSMB will also serve as medical officers and will perform 
independent safety monitoring for the study.  Indepen dent safety monitoring will  
occur for any of the following:  
 SAE or UP deemed related  to protocol/study drug  
 Major ble eding event (ISTH definition in 3.2)  
 Bleeding event of BARC type ≥3 (definition in 3.2 and appendix B)  
 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 20 Independent safety monitoring will entail a review of a summary report of (de-identified) 
clinical data via email.  The DSMB will then determine whether the study should:  
a) continue and conduct the next scheduled DSMB meeting as planned, or  
b) continue but con duct an additional DSMB call to re -evaluate study safety, or  
c) temporarily stop enrollment, but continue foll ow-up of randomized participants, until 
an additional DSMB meeting can be performed, or  
d) provide more clinical information on the adverse event to properly inform a decision.  
 
As a result of this review a  determination will then be made whether:  a) cont inuing the 
study without change and without additional DSMB review (beyond scheduled meetings 
as planned), b) continue the study but conduct an additional DSMB meeting/call to re -
evaluate study safety, c) temporarily stop enrollment in the study , but conti nue follow -up 
of randomized participants,  until an additional DSMB meeting can be performed to re -
evaluate study safety and appropriateness to continue,  d) more clinical information  is 
needed on the adverse event to properly inform a decision.  
5.3 DSMB (Data a nd Safety Monitoring Board)  
The following individual(s) has/have accepted position(s) as part of the DSMB. Should 
there be any questions regarding the independence of the DSMB, it will be addressed 
and corr ected if necessary at that time.  Julian Wolfson ( lead statistician) will produce 
data reports and represent the protocol team as part of both open and closed sessions 
for the DSMB.   
 
 Biostatistician: Holly Janes , PhD  (hjanes@fhcrc.org ) 
 HIV/General Medicine: Matthew Freiberg, MD  
(matthew.s.freiberg@vanderbilt.edu ) 
 Hematology  Medicine: Sam Schulman, MD ( schulms@mcmaster.ca ) 
 Hematology Medicine: David Garcia, MD ( davidg99@uw.edu ) 
 
 
The DSMB will monitor progress of the study and safety of the intervention while the 
study is still blinded to the investigators. The frequency of the DSMB monitoring is 
listed above in 5.2.  As part of this responsibility, DSMB members must be satisfied that 
the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of the data submitted to them for review are 
sufficient for evaluation of the safety and welfare of study participants.   The DSMB will 
also asse ss the performance of the overall study operations and any other relevant 
issues as necessary.  
5.3.1  DSMB Conflict of Interest  and Protection of Confidentiality  
DSMB members  should have no direct involvement with the study investigators 
or intervention. Each DSMB member will sign a Conflict of Interest Statement 
which includes current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
companies (e.g., stockholder, con sultant), and any other relationship that could 
be perceived as a conflict of interest related to the study and / or associated with 
commercial interests pertinent to study objectives.  
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 21  
Data will be presented in a blinded manner during the open sessions o f the 
DSMB  that include the study PI . At DSMB meetings, data and discussion are 
confidential. Participant identities will not be known to the DSMB members.  
 
5.3.2  DSMB Responsibilities  
The DSMB Charter  provides a detailed list of the DSMB responsibilities. They 
include:  
 Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data 
safety and monitoring;  
 Recommend subject recruitment be initiated after receipt of a satisfactory 
protocol;  
 Evaluate the progress of the trial, accrual and retention , periodic assessments 
of data quality and timeliness , participant risk versus benefit, and other factors 
that can affect study outcome;  
 Evaluation of all SAE /UPs, bleeding events of BARC type ≥3, and/or major 
bleeding Event (ISTH definition), will be reviewed b y the designed medical 
officers on the DSMB within 1 week of report.  An assessment will be made at 
that time if a full DSMB meeting is required before then next schedule meeting;  
 Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes 
available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an 
impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial;  
 Review study performance, make recommendations and assist in the 
resolution of problems reported by the Principal I nvestigator;  
 Protect the safety of the study  participants.  
 
6 ANALYSIS PLAN  
The primary analyses involving the main effect of treatment will be performed in an 
intent -to-treat framework using a random effects model with random subject -specific 
intercepts and fixed effects for treatment  period and pre -treatment IL -6 (average of two 
measures, from screening and baseline). Separate models with an interaction term 
between treatment and pre -treatment FXa activity will used to test whether the effect of 
treatment d iffers by the degree of FXa activity (as estimated from computational 
modeling) . The coefficients of the period indicator will be tested to check for evidence of 
treatment sequencing and/or carry -over effects. The characteristics of any patients who 
drop o ut of the study will be compared to the characteristics of those who do not to 
ascertain whether drop -out was informative.   Secondary outcomes will be analyzed in a 
similar fashion to analysis of changes in IL -6. In secondary exploratory analyses, we will 
also perform p er-protocol (‘on treatment’) analyses , as well as imputation and (if 
 Protocol Version 2.0  
 22 necessary) sensitivity analyses to account for missing data. If medication adherence is 
sub-optimal, we will also consider compliance -adjusted analyses.  
We will also use th e IL-6 and D -dimer associations with clinical risk ( Scientific 
Background in 1.1.2. ),63 to estimate the predicted  risk redu ctions for both a composite 
outcome (serious non -AIDS events) as well as individual events such as cardiovascular 
disease  (CVD) events . Statistical tests will include a significance level of alpha=0.05 .

 2 APPENDIX B :  BLEEDING ACADEMIC RESEARCH CO NSORTIUM 
(BARC) DEFINITIONS  
 
Type 0  no bleeding  
Type 1  bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek 
unscheduled performance of studies, hospitalization, or treatment by a 
healthcare professional; may include episodes leading to self -discontinuation of 
medical therapy by the patient wi thout consulting a healthcare professional  
Type 2  any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage (e .g., more bleeding than would be 
expected for a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found by imaging 
alone) that does not fit the criteria for type 3, 4, or 5 but does meet at least one 
of the following criteria: (1) requiring nonsurgical, medical intervention by a 
healthcare professional, (2) leading to hospitalization or increased level of care, 
or (3) prompting evaluation  
Type 3  Type 3a  
 Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 -<5 g/dL  (provided hemoglobin 
drop is related to bleed)  
 Any transfusion with overt bleeding  
 
Type 3b  
 Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop ≥5 g/dL  (provided hemoglobin 
drop is related to bleed)  
 Cardiac tamponade  
 Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding 
dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid)  
 Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents  
 
Type 3c

 3 APPENDIX C:  CLINICAL MANAGEM ENT OF FACTOR X INHI BITOR 
BLEEDING EVENTS  
 
NOTE:   TACTICAL -HIV participants the present with acute or active bleeding complication during 
the course of the study should be referred for clinical evaluation at the appropriate or nearby health 
care facility.  Management of clinical bleeding complications w ill not be directed by the TACTICAL -
HIV study team, and will be supported by the participant’s health insurance or third -party payer . 
 
There is no specific reversal agent or pharmacologic antidote  to edoxaban -related bleeding , thus 
management of hemorrhagi c complications is primarily supportive. Edoxaban is moderately protein 
bound (e.g., 5 0-60%) and is not dialyzable. If patients require pharmacologic therapy to manage 
hemorrhagic c omplications, a Hematology/ Coagulation consult is advised.   
 
A FXa -activity level can is available by most clinical labs (and at HCMC), which can provide 
information quickly on the degree of FXa inhibition.  The table below summarizes o ne approach to 
management of Factor Xa inhibitor -related bleeding events , adapted  from University of North 
Carolina Anticoagulation Reversal Guidelines : 
www.med.unc.edu/emergmed/files/emergent -anticoagulation -reversal -in-the-ed 
 
Bleeding Severity  Management Approach  
Mild Delay next dose or discontinue Factor Xa inhibitor  
Moderate  Consider any of the following based on bleeding severity:  
 Symptomatic treatment  
 Mechanical compression  
 Surgical intervention  
 Fluid replacement and hemodynamic support  
 Blood product transfusion  
 Oral activated charcoal  (if previous dose ingested within 2 hours)  
   Dose: Liquid charcoal with sorbitol 50 g PO x 1 dose  
 
If hemostasis is not achieved with the strategies outlined above, proceed to 
the steps below and obtain a Hematology/Coagulation consult for further 
recommendations  
Severe or Life -
Threatening   
Consider any of the strategies outlined above based on bleeding severity. 
No agent currently available in the US  has been shown to successfully 
reverse the anticoagulant effects of Factor Xa inhibitor -related bleeding 
events. However, the strategy below may be considered based on the 
currently available evidence. Therefore, the pharmacologic interventions 
below may be considered, but are not required in the management of 
Factor Xa inhibitor -related bleeding.  
A Hematology/Coagulation consult should be obtained after the following:  
1) Administer KCentra (4 -factor PCC) 50 units/kg IV x 1 (max 5000 units)  
2) For persi stent refractory bleeding, pursue formal Heme/Coag consult.  
3) To investigate potential causes of the bleeding event, obtain the 
following: serum creatinine, PT, aPTT, anti -Xa activity (send -out lab), CBC 
(platelets).  
4) If PT prolonged, administer vitam in K 10mg IV x one dose (as there may 
be vitamin K deficiency present).

 Introduction 
 
The Division of  AIDS (DAIDS) oversees clinical trials throughout the  world whi ch it sponso rs 
and suppo rts.  The  clinical trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic products, 
vaccines, and oth er preventive  modalities.  Adv erse event (AE) data collected during th ese 
clinical trials form the  basis for subsequent safety and efficacy analyses of pharmaceutical 
products and m edical devices.  Incorrect and in consistent AE s everity grading can lead to 
inaccurate data analyses and int erpretation, whi ch in turn can imp act the safety and w ell-being of 
clinical trial participants and future patients using ph armaceutical products. 
 
The DAIDS AE grading table is a shared tool for assessing  the severity of AEs (including 
clinical and laboratory abnormalities) in participants enrolled in clinical trials.  Ov er the years as 
scientific knowl edge and experience have expanded, revisions to the  DAIDS AE grading table 
have become necessary. 
 
This document is for use in PCC008 (TACTICAL -HIV).  Instructions and information related to 
pediatric events and microbicide studies have been removed from the 2014 clarification of the 
DAIDS Table for Grading AE’s.   Thus, all definitions pertain to adults (≥ß18 years old)

 Instructions for Use 
 
General Co nsiderations 
The Division of A IDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the  Severity of Adult and  Pediatric  Adverse 
Events, V ersion 2.0 consists of  parameters, or AEs, with s everity grading guid ance that are to be 
used in D AIDS clinical trials for safety data reporting to maintain accuracy and consist ency in 
the evaluation of  AEs.  The term “severe” is not the  same as the term “serious”  in classifying 
AEs.  The  severity of a specific event describes its int ensity, and it is the  intensity which is 
graded.  Seriousness, whi ch is not graded, relates to an out come of an AE and is a  regulatory 
definition.  
 
Clinical sites are encouraged to report parameters in the  DAIDS AE grading table as they are 
written to m aintain data consist ency across clinical trials.  How ever, since some parameters can 
be reported with mo re specificity, clinical sites are encouraged to report parameters that convey 
addition al clinical information.  For example, diarrhea could be  reported as neonatal diarrhea; 
seizures, as febrile seizures; and pain, as jaw pain. 
 
The DAIDS AE grading table provides an AE severity grading scale ranging from g rades 1 to 5 
with d escriptions for each AE b ased on the  following general guidelines:

•   Grade 2 indi cates a moderate event 
•   Grade 3 indi cates a severe event 
•   Grade 4 indi cates a potentially life-threatening event 
• Grade 5 indi cates death (Note: This grade is not sp ecifically listed on each page of the 
grading table). 
 
Other points to consid er include: 
•   Use parameters defined by age and sex values as applicable. 
•   Male and female sex are defined as sex at birth. 
• Unless not ed, laboratory values are for term neonates.  Preterm neonates should be  assessed 
using  local laboratory normal ranges. 
•   Where applicable, Standard International (SI) units are included in it alics. 
 
Selecting and Reporting a Primary AE  Term 
When selecting a  primary AE term to report, sites should s elect the term that best describes what 
occurred to the  participant.  For example, a participant may present with it ching, urticaria, 
flushin g, angioedema of the face, and dyspnea.  If the underlying diagnosis is d etermined to be 
an acute allergic reaction, sit es should report “Acute Allergic Reaction”  as the primary AE term. 
 
Primary AE terms should be  reported using  the DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System 
(DAE RS) only if they meet expedited reporting criteria.  Ho wever, all primary AE terms should 
be reported using  protocol-specific case report forms (CRFs).  Because the reported information 
is sto red in di fferent databases (i.e., safety and clinical), sites should report primary AE terms 
using  the same terminolo gy for data consist ency.
DAIDS AE Gradin g Table Version 2.0- Nov ember 2014 
Page 5 Instructions for Use    
  
When reporting using DAERS, other clinically significant events associated with a  primary AE 
term that more fully describe the nature, severity, or compli cations of  the primary AE term 
should be  entered in the  “Other Events” section.  How ever, the severity grade for these events 
must be  lower than or equal to the severity grade of the primary AE term.  In the  example  above, 
dyspnea and angioedema of the face may be entered in the “Other Events” section, b ecause they 
are more descriptive  and provide  addition al information on the  severity of the acute allergic 
reaction.  H owever, their severity grades must be  lower than or equal to the  severity grade of the 
primary AE term of “Acute Allergic Reaction”. 
 
Differences exist in the  reporting and recording of information (e.g., signs and symptoms, 
clinically significant events) in DAE RS and CRFs.  Th erefore, sites shou ld refer to their 
protocols and CRF requirements for further instructions.  
 
Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs 
When a single parameter is not appropriate for grading an AE in both adult and pediatric 
popul ations, s eparate parameters with sp ecified age ranges are provided.  If no distin ction 
between adult and pediatric popul ations h as been made, the listed parameter should be  used for 
grading an AE in both p opulations.  
 
Reporting Pregnancy Outcomes 
In the  Pregnan cy, Puerperium, and P erinatal section, all parameters are pregnancy outcomes 
and should be  reported using the moth er's participant ID.  If an infant is not enrolled in the  same 
study as the moth er, any identified birth defects should be  reported usi ng the moth er's participant 
ID.  How ever, if an infant is enrolled in the  same study as the moth er or in another study, any 
identified birth defects should be  reported usi ng the infant's participant ID.  Sites should refer to 
the applicable network standards for reporting abnormal pregnancy outcomes on the  CRFs. 
 
Determining Severity Grade for Parameters between Grades 
If the severity of an AE  could fall in either one of two g rades (i.e., the  severity of an AE could be  
either grade 2 or grade 3), sites should s elect the higher of the two grades. 
 
Laboratory Val ues 
General. An asymptom atic, abnormal laboratory finding  without an accompanying AE should  
not be  reported to DAIDS in an expedited tim eframe unless it m eets protocol-specific reporting 
requirements.  Sites should refer to the  applicable network standards for reporting abnormal 
laboratory findings on t he CRFs. 
 
Valu es below Grade  1.  Any laboratory value that is b etween the  ULN and grade 1 (for high 
values) or the LLN and grade 1 (for low v alues) should not be  graded or reported as an AE. 
Sites should consult the  Manual for E xpedited Reporting of Ad verse Events to DA IDS, Version  
2.0 and th eir protocol when making an assessment of the need to report an AE. 
 
Overlap of Local Laboratory  Normal Valu es with Grading Table Rang es.  When local laboratory 
normal values fall within  grading table laboratory ranges, the  severity grading is based on t he 
ranges in the  grading table unless there is a protocol-specific grading criterion for the laboratory
DAIDS AE Gradin g Table Version 2.0- Nov ember 2014

value.  For example, “Magnesium,  Low" has a grade 1 range of 1.2 to <  1.4 mEq /L, while  a 
particular laboratory’s normal range for magnesium m ay be 1.3 to 2.8 mE q/L.  If a study 
participant’s magnesium  laboratory value is 1.3 mEq /L, the laboratory value should be  graded as 
grade 1. 
 
  
Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not  Identified in the Grading Table 
The functional table below should be  used to g rade the severity of an AE t hat is not sp ecifically

18 The conversion factor used to convert g/dL to mm ol/L is 0.6206 and is the most commonly used conversion factor.  For grading hemoglobin 
results obtained by an analytic method with a conversion factor other than 0.6206, the result must be converted to g/dL using the appropriate 
conversion factor for the particular laboratory.

CONSENT FOR PARTICIPATING IN AN N HLBI /NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH TRIAL  
 
 
INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
You are invited to be in a research study that looks at the use of a medication that may 
improve the health of HIV positive people who are already on HIV medicines. The 
medication ( edoxaban ) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but not 
for treatment of HIV infection; it is commonly used to treat or prevent  blood clots .  
However, this medication may help address some of the damage that HIV causes in the 
body.  Forty HIV positive patients will be enrolled in this study  at HCMC in Minneapolis.   
 
Damage caused by HIV infection results in problems with the immun e system  and other 
organs in the body. One of these problems involves the coagulation system, which is how 
our bodies form blood clots to prevent bleeding.  HIV ‘activates’ or turns on the 
coagulation system.  Over time this increases risk for having blood  clots and also results 
in ‘inflammation’ that can damage the body. Inflammation  occurs when the body’s 
immune system is responding to injury or infection.  Inflammation can be helpful in the 
short term, but when it is persistent it can also cause more dam age to the body over time. 
These problems impair normal health over many years and cannot be fully corrected, 
even with  effective HIV treatment using  antiretroviral medications.   
 
Problems with clotting and o ngoing inflammation with damage to the body  contribute to 
risk for diseases like heart disease among HIV positive person s.  This study will determine 
if a low dose of edoxaban , which reduces blood clotting , will reduce inflammation .  If 
Protocol version 2 .0 
 
 2 successful, edoxaban may then be studied as an approach to achieve  normal health 
outcomes for persons with HIV infection.    
 
YOUR PARTICIPATION IS VOLUNTARY  
This consent form gives you information about the clinical research study that will be 
discussed with you.  Once you understand the study, and if you agree to take part, you 
will be asked to sign this consent form. You will be given a copy to keep.  
 
Before you learn about the study, it is important that you know the following:  
Your participation is entirely voluntary.  
 
You may decide not to take part or to withdraw  from the study at any time without losing 
the benefits of your routine medical care.  
 
Eligibility:  Who is being asked to be part of this research study?  
You may be  eligible for this study if you have HIV infection , you are taking your 
antiretroviral medi cations , you have evidence of increased coagulation (‘risk for clotting’) 
based on a blood test, and you do not have contraindications to study procedures .  Your 
HIV ‘viral load’ must be undetectable.  If your doctor or the study investigators feel that it  
would not be safe to take the study medication then you will not be eligible to participate. 
Some factors that could make you ineligible for this study include using other anti -clotting 
medications (‘blood thinners’) or having other inflammatory , liver or  kidney disease.  
 
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE  IN THE STUDY?  
The study will last approximately 12 months  and consists of 12 visits .  After the screening 
visit, if you qualify, you  will come in for a ‘baseline’ study visit, and then  follow -up visit s at 
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11  and 12 months.  
 
HOW WILL THE STUDY W ORK?  
If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to take 30mg of edoxaban and 
a matching placebo pill once daily, but you would only be taking one medication at any 
given time during the study (i.e., you would not be taking edoxaban and placebo at the 
same time).  A t the beginning of the study  you will be randomly assigned to start one 
study medication, which will either be edoxaban or a matching placebo .  At month 4 you 
will stop taking s tudy medications.  At month 8 you will be asked to start the second study 
medication .  The second medication  will be placebo if your first medication was edoxaban, 
and will be edoxaban  if your first medication was placebo. Neither you, nor the study 
invest igators, will know which study medication you take first or second.   A picture of this 
process is then shown below.

PROCEDURES:  WHAT DO  YOU HAVE TO DO IF YO U ARE IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Screening visit:  
You will be asked to come in for a screening visit, where your study investigators will 
review the study procedures and this consent form.  If you agree to participate, you will 
have your blood drawn (approximately 2 tablespoons) and medical history reviewed 
(similar to a  routine  clinic visit) to determine if you are eligible to participate.  If you meet 
study criteria, you will then return within 1 month  to begin the study.  
 
Baseline and follow -up (month 1,  2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,  12) clinic study visits:  
The baseline and follow -up clinical visit will las t approximately 1-2 hours, and will consist 
of: 
 
Medical History: You will be interviewed to review your medical history and assess your 
risk for developing heart disease.  We will also access your medical chart to obtain the 
results of recent lab tests an d medications you are taking.  
 
Blood Draw:  We will obtain a blood sample ( up to 8 tablespoons ) from a vein in your arm.  
The total blood draw volumes per visit will be less than 100 mL .  You must be fasting for 
at least 6 hours  prior to having your blood  drawn at study visits. Blood samples will be 
used to measure markers in the bl ood related to inflammation, coagulation (‘clotting’) and 
other markers that may contribute to heart disease and other complications of HIV 
infection.  These samples may be stor ed for up to 20 years.  
 
At the baseline visit, you will start taking edoxaban  (or pla cebo). You will take 1 tablet (3 0 
mg) every da y in the morning . The nurses will give you the study medicine during your 
clinic visits. At follow -up visits you will be aske d to bring in all of your study medication, 
and adherence and tolerability to the treatment will be assessed.  
 
STORED SAMPLES  
During your participation in this study, blood will be collected by standard blood drawing 
techniques.  
 

Protocol version 2 .0 
 
 4 Samples will be used to evaluate the potential benefits of edoxaban. Additional samples 
will be store d up to 20 years for future research.  These samples can help us learn more 
about HIV, AIDS, immune function, inflammation, coagulation  (blood ‘clotting’ ), or other 
related diseases  that affect patients with HIV infection .  In general , the research tests we 
perform are not like routine medical tests and may not relate directly to your medical care.  
For this reason, we may not put future research test result s in your medical record or 
share these test results with your medical provider .  We will communicate any clinical labs 
obtained during the study to your primary medical provider.  
 
Genetic Testing  
Future research on stored samples might involve genetic tes ting.  Genetic testing may 
tell researchers something about how health or illness is passed on to you by your parents 
or from you to your children.  Some genetic information, such as the ability to make certain 
proteins in the body, has been associated with  an increased risk of certain diseases like 
arthritis.  
 
Any genetic information collected or discovered about you or your family will be 
confidential. Genetic information about you will not be revealed to others, including your 
relatives, without your per mission.  We will not release any information about you or your 
family to any insurance company or employer unless you sign a document allowing 
release of information.  
 
HOW WILL YOU GET MEDICINES FOR THE STUDY?  
Study medications will be provided to you by the study and will be distributed by study 
nurses during study visits.   You will be provided with sufficient supply to last the duration 
of the study.  You will be asked to return any unused study medication, including empty 
containers.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISK S AND/OR DISCOMFORTS OF THIS STUDY?  
 
You will be monitored for side effects at each visit, and your lab tests will include an 
evaluation for signs of medication toxicity.  
 
Risks of Study Procedures  
You will have your blood drawn at each study visit. This is identical to having your blood 
drawn at a medical clinic, and can involve discomfort, light -headedness and/or minor 
bruising . Discussion of past medical history or risk factors for HIV infection may be 
stressful and cause anxiety. You may decline to ans wer any questions that you do not 
feel comfortable answering.  
 
Study Medication: Edoxaban  
This medication is approved by the FDA. Edoxaban is used to prevent and treat blood 
clots. The most significant possible side effects of edoxaban is bleeding.  This m ay be 
mild, like a bloody nose, or more significant and require medical evaluation.  Examples 
of serious or major bleeding from edoxaban include bleeding in the stomach or 
intestines, or bleeding in the brain.  Major bleeding events were rare, occurring be tween 
1-2% of the time, in prior clinical studies of edoxaban.  We will ask you about signs or 
symptoms of bleeding during each of your visits, such as abdominal pain, black stools, 
dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, or headache.  We will also monitor yo ur blood 
Protocol version 2 .0 
 
 5 results for signs of bleeding at each visit.  We do not expect that edoxaban will interact 
with any of your HIV medicines.   
 
This medication should not be used during pregnancy. If a developing fetus is exposed 
to edoxaban, injury or even death m ay result. For this reason, if you are a woman of 
childbearing potential, you  will be asked what type of birth control you use. You must be 
willing to use a reliable form of birth control for the duration of the study period, such as 
a barrier method or sp ermicide. Condoms cannot be the only form of birth control you 
use. If you become pregnant during the study or think you may be pregnant, you should 
inform either the site investigator or a study nurse immediately. We will ask that you return 
any study med ication. We will ask permission to contact you at the end of the pregnancy 
to check on the health of you and the baby.  
 
WHAT ABOUT PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING?  
If you are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant, you will not be eligible 
for this study.  If you become pregnant during the study, you will be asked to stop study 
medications and withdraw.  Therefore, if it is possible that you could become pregnant, 
we ask that you use a reliable form of birth control  for the duration of the study  (listed 
above in ‘Study Medication’).  
 
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY?  
If you take part in this study, there are no anticipated benefits directly to your health.  The 
research has the potential to benefit people with HIV infection, after the study is completed 
and the findings have been  analyzed.   
  
COMPENSATION  
You will be paid $ 25 for each study visit you attend after the screening visit.  You may 
receive a total of $275 for participating in the study.  Study investigators may ask for your 
social security number as part of the monitoring process for this compensation.  
 
WHAT IF THERE ARE NEW FINDINGS?  
We will not be analyzing data during the study.   However, if during the course of this 
research study, there are significant new findings discovered which might influence your 
willingness to continue, the researchers will inform you of those developments.  You may 
request your own results after the stu dy by contacting the research investigators.  
 
WHAT IF YOU DON’T WANT TO BE IN THE STUDY ANY LONGER?  
If you enroll in this study, you may decide to stop participating at any time.  Withdrawing 
from this study will not affect the benefits of your regular medical care.   
 
CAN YOUR STUDY PARTICIPATION BE STOPPED WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT?  
You may be taken off of  study medicines before the end of the study if investigators or 
your doctor recommend this.  You may be taken off the entire study without your consent 
if: 
 Your study doctor decides that continuing in the study would harm you;  
 Your lab results indicate th at you are experiencing toxicity from study medications;  
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO YOU HAVE BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
You may discuss other strategies for improving your health with your doctor.

WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO YOU?  
The medications that are part of this st udy will be provided free -of-cost to you, and will be 
distributed during study visits.    During the study, you, your insurance company, or some 
other third -party payer must pay for all other medicines, including HIV medicines not paid 
by the study and medi cines needed to prevent or treat other illnesses.  We will provide all 
clinical and professional services, lab work, and other tests that are part of this study and 
not part of your regular care at no cost to you.

1 Introduction 
 
1.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma 
 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the eigth most common cancer with approximately 54,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths estimate d in 2008 (1).  The incidence of RCC has been rising each 
year in the United States sinc e 1970, with a 3:2 prevalence in  men over women and a median 
age of diagnosis of 60 years (1).  While many patients present with su rgically resectable 
disease, approximately 20-30% present with metastatic di sease and 20-40% of patients 
undergoing nephrectomy for localized disease w ill develop metastases (2).  Traditionally, 
treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma ha s been limited.  Standard chemotherapeutic 
agents have been largely ineffective and cytoki ne-based treatments with interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
or interferon-  (IFN) benefit a small proportion of patient s.  Objective res ponse rates to IL-2 
range from 10-20% with 5-10 % of these patients having durable respon ses (3-5).  
Additionally, the toxicity  of high-dose IL-2 has limited its widespread use.  Low dose IFN has 
produced response rates in the 10% range with several studies showing a modest survival 
benefit (6, 7).  There has thus been significant interest in developing more effective therapies for this group of patients.    Many advances have been made in our understand ing of the molecular bi ology of RCC.  Since 
1997, renal epithelial tumors have b een classified into subtypes (c lear cell, papillary type I, 
papillary type II, chromophobe, and oncocytom a), each with distinct morphology, genetic 
features, and cell of origin (8, 9).  Clear cell or conventional type renal cancer accounts for 65% to 75 % of renal epithelial tumors.  It is now known that 75% to 80% of sporadic clear 
cell renal cancer cases possess bi-allelic somatic alterations in the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene either via deletion, muta tional inactivation, or silenc ing by hypermethylation (10, 11).  
The VHL gene encodes a tumor suppressor prot ein that under normoxic conditions forms a 
complex that binds to Hypoxi a Inducible Factor (HIF)-1 α and -2α in the presence of oxygen 
and targets them for proteasomal degradation.  Loss of VHL function results in inappropriate 
accumulation of both HIF-1 α and HIF-2α  and the subsequent activati on of their ta rget genes, 
including vascular endothelial gr owth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), 
transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF- α), erythropoietin, GLUT- 1, and CXCR4 (12-15).  
This accumulation of HIF-regulated proteins is  believed to play a critical role in RCC 
tumorigenesis and RCC-mediated an giogenesis.  VEGF has been well established as having a 
central role in endothelial cell proliferation and survival (16).  PDGF is believed to play a role 
in endothelial stabilization. Di sruption of PDGF signaling in perivascular cells has been 
shown to potentially enhance an anti-angiogenic response triggered by VEGFR inhibition 
(17).  The TGF- /EGFR pathway has been shown to be  activated and critical for tumor 
progression in VHL-/- RCC tumor lines (18).  Thus, VHL dysfunction causing the 
inappropriate accumulation of HIF-1 α and HIF-2α  results in a cascade of signaling events 
favorable for RCC tumorigenesis and prolifer ation.  Given its central role in RCC 
development, the VHL-HIF pathway has emerged as perhaps the preeminent target in RCC therapy and several agents targeting elements of this pathway have demonstrated substantial clin
ical efficacy.

1.2 VEGF-Targeted Therapies 
 
Recently, two multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved by FDA for the 
therapy of metastatic RCC.  Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) is an oral ly administered TKI 
originally discovered through a scre en to discover inhibitors of Ra f-kinase (19).  In addition to 
potent activity against both mutant and wild-t ype b-raf and c-raf, it was subsequently 
discovered that sorafenib also  had inhibitory activity agai nst a broad group of receptor 
tyrosine kinases including VEGFR2, PDGFR, c-KIT, p38 α, and flt3 (20).  Sorafenib gained 
FDA approval based on a randomized, placebo- controlled trial of sorafenib conducted in 
patients with advanced RCC who had failed one pr ior therapy (21).  Ov erall, 903 patients 
were enrolled and randomized to placebo (n=452) versus sorafenib (n=451).  The primary end-point was overall survival with secondary  end-points including pr ogression free survival, 
response rate, and safety.  While the final analysis for overall su rvival has not be en completed, 
the median progression free survival was found to be significantly longer in patients who 
received sorafenib versus placebo (24 weeks vs. 12 weeks; p<0.000001).  The objective response rate was only 2% on fina l analysis.  Drug-related adve rse events (all grades) for 
sorafenib versus placebo included rash (34% vs. 13%), diarrhea (33% vs. 10%), hand-foot skin reaction (27% vs. 5%), fatigue (26% vs. 23%) and hypertension (11% vs. 1%). Any grade 3 / 4 events were reported in 30% of patie nts on sorafenib versus 22% patients on placebo. 
Based on the promising prolongatio n of progression free survival and tolerability, sorafenib 
was approved by the FDA for th erapy of patients with meta static or unresectable RCC on 
December 20, 2005.   
 
Sunitinib (SU11248, Sutent) is an oral multi-targ eted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR, 
PDGFR and c-Kit (22).  Sutent has demonstr ated promising efficacy in two independent 
single-agent phase II trials in  patients with advanced RCC (23, 24). Sixty-three and 106 
previously treated patients were enrolled in th e two trials, respectively, with a primary end-
point of response rate.  The overall response rate  for the combined trials was approximately 
40% with a median PFS of 8.2 months.  Based on these findings, sunitinib received FDA approval for therapy of advanced RCC on January  26, 2006.  Sunitinib was also studied in the 
first-line setting in a randomized phase III trial comparing sunitinib to IFN- α (25).  Overall, 
750 patients were enrolled and randomized w ith 375 per treatment arm.  The objective 
response rate was 31% for sunitinib versus 6% for IFN- α (p<0.001) and the median PFS was 
11 months for sunitinib versus 5 months for IFN- α, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.42 
(95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.54; P<0.001).  At the time of analysis, the median overall survival had not yet been met in either group.  Both sorafenib and sunitinib represent promising advancement in the therapy of metastatic RCC.  However, there are limitations to both ag ents.  While both drugs have been shown to 
significantly delay time to progression, objective responses have rarely been complete or maintained off therapy and all patients will eventually experience disease progression while on therapy.  It is possible that there may be limitations to what can be achieved therapeutically 
with agents that target the tumor endothelium and have prim arily antiangiogenic effects.  
More robust responses may require agents whic h directly target oncoge nic signaling pathways

in RCC tumor cells.  Fortunately, such agents are now emerging and demonstrating efficacy in 
RCC. 
 
1.3 RAD001 (everolimus) 
RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel derivative of rapamycin. RAD001 has been in clinical 
development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant  in solid organ transplantation. Since 2003, 
RAD001 is approved in Eur ope (trade name: Certican ) via the Mutual Recognition 
Procedure (MRP) for the prevention of organ re jection in patients w ith renal and cardiac 
transplantation. Certican is also approved in Australia, South Africa, the Middle East, 
Central and South America, the Ca ribbean and some Asian countries.  
RAD001 is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act  
 directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation  
 indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tu mor vascularity (via potent 
inhibition of tumor cell VEGF production a nd VEGF-induced prolifer ation of endothelial 
cells)

1.3.1 mTOR pathway and cancer 
At the cellular and molecular level, RAD001 acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It 
selectively inhibits mTOR (m ammalian target of rapamycin), a key protein kinase which 
regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival.  The mTOR is mainly activated via the PI3 kinase pathway through AKT/PKB  and the tuberous sclerosis complex (T SC1/2).  Mutations 
in these components or in PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3 kinase, may result in their 
dysregulation. Abnormal functioning of various  components of the signaling pathways 
contributes to the pathophysiol ogy of numerous human cancers.  Various preclinical models 
have confirmed the role of this pathway in tumor development (26). 
The main known functions of mT OR include the following (27): 
 mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, gr owth factors and ener gy and nutrient levels, 
facilitating cell-cycle progression from G1-S  phase in appropriat e growth conditions. 
 Confidential Page 8 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
 The PI-3K (mTOR) pathway itself is frequently dysregulated in many human cancers, and 
oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors. PI3-kinase 
mutations have been reported in the primary tumor in 10-20% of human colorectal cancers 
(28, 29). 
 The loss of PTEN protein, eith er through gene deletion or f unctional silencing (promoter 
hypermethylation), is reported in approximately  60% of primary human colorectal cancers 
(30).  
 The mTOR pathway is involved in the producti on of pro-angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF) 
and inhibition of endothelial cel l growth and proliferation. 
 Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 
40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e ., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates protein transl ation, including 
the HIF-1 proteins. Inhibition of mTOR is ex pected to lead to decreased expression of 
HIF-1. 
1.3.2 Preclinical studies 
RAD001 inhibits the pro liferation of a range of  human tumor cell lines in-vitro  including lines 
originating from lung, breast, pr ostate, colon, melanoma and gli oblastoma.  IC50s range from 
sub/low nM to µM. RAD001 also inhibits th e proliferation of human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECS) in vitro , with particular poten cy against VEGF-induced 
proliferation suggesting that RAD001 may also act as an anti-angiogenic agent. The anti-
angiogenic activity of RAD001 was confirmed in vivo . RAD001 selectively inhibited VEGF-
dependent angiogenic response at  well tolerated doses. Mice w ith primary and metastatic 
tumors treated with RAD001 showed a signif icant reduction in blood vessel density when 
compared to controls. 
The potential of RAD001 as an anti-cancer agent was shown in rodent models. RAD001 is 
orally bioavailable, residing longer in tumor ti ssue than in plasma in an s.c mouse xenograft 
model, and demonstrating high tumor penetrati on in a rat pancreatic tumor model.  The 
pharmacokinetic profile of RAD001 indicates su fficient tumor penetration, above that needed 
to inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells and tumor cell lines deemed sensitive to 
RAD001 in vitro . 
RAD001 administered daily p.o. was a potent inhi bitor of tumor growt h, at well tolerated 
doses, in 11 different mouse xenograft models (i ncluding pancreatic, co lon, epidermoid, lung 
and melanoma) and two syngeneic models (ra t pancreatic, mouse orthotopic melanoma).  
These models included tumor lines consider ed sensitive and “relatively resistant” in vitro . In 
general, RAD001 was be tter tolerated in mous e xenograft models than standard cytotoxic 
agents (i.e., doxorubicin and 5-fl uorouracil), while possessing si milar anti-tumor activity.  
Additionally, activity in a VEGF -impregnated s.c. implant mode l of angiogenesis and reduced 
vascularity (vessel density) of  RAD001-treated tumors (murin e melanoma) provided evidence 
of in vivo  effects of angiogenesis. 
It is not cle
ar which molecular determinants pr edict responsiveness of tumor cells to RAD001. 
Molecular analysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to RAD001 in vitro  correlates with the 
degree of phosphorylation (activa tion) of the AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 ribosomal 
protein; in some cases (i.e., g lioblastoma) there is also a co rrelation with PTEN status.  
 Confidential Page 9 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
In vivo  studies investigating the anti-tumor activit y of RAD001 in experimental animal tumor 
models showed that RAD001 mo notherapy typically reduced tu mor cell growth rates rather 
than produced regressions or stab le disease. These effects occu rred within the dose range of 
2.5 mg to 10 mg/kg, p.o. once a day. 
In preclinical models, the administration of RA D001 is associated with reduction of protein 
phosphorylation in target proteins downstream  of mTOR, notably phosphorylated (p)-S6 (p-
S6) and p-4E-BP1, and occasionally with an  increase in phosphorylated AKT, a protein 
upstream of mTOR signaling pathway. Study CRAD001A2107 explored MPD (molecular 
pharmacodynamic) changes in tumor at different  doses and schedules of RAD001 (weekly 20 
mg, 50 mg and 70 mg or daily 5 mg and 10 mg). All significant adverse events observed in toxicology studie s with RAD001 in mice, rats, 
monkeys and mini-pigs were consistent with its  anticipated pharmacologi cal action as an anti-
proliferative and immunosuppressant and at leas t in part reversible after a 2 or 4-week 
recovery period with the excepti on of the changes in male repr oductive organs, most notably 
testes. 
1.3.3 Clinical experience 
1.3.3.1 RAD001 pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of RAD001 have been extensively investigated in the 
context of the drug’s development as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation 
where RAD001 was administered twice daily as a part of an immunosuppressant, multi-drug 
regimen consistently including cyclosporin A a nd glucocorticoids. Recent Phase I studies 
provide steady-state pharmacokine tics for both the weekly and da ily schedules at varying dose 
levels in patients with advanced cancers. 
RAD001 is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a median time to peak blood levels 
(t
max) of 1-2 hours postdose. The ex tent of absorption is estimat ed at above 11%.  The area 
under the blood concentra tion-time curve (AUC) is dose-proportional over the dose range 
tested while maximum blood concentration C max appears to plateau at dose levels higher than 
20 mg. The terminal half-life in cancer patients averaged  30 hours, which is similar to that in 
healthy subjects. Inter-patient variability is mode rate with the coefficient of variation (CV) of 
approximately 50%.  A high-fat meal altered th e absorption of RAD001 with 1.3 hour delay in 
tmax, a 60% reduction in C max and a 16% reduction in AUC. In whole blood, approximately 
80% of RAD001 is contained in red blood cells. Of the fraction of drug contained in plasma, 
74% is protein-bound. The apparent  distribution volume (Vz/F) after a single dose was 4.7 
L/kg. RAD001 is eliminated by metabolism, main ly by hydroxylation, then excreted into the 
feces >80%. 
RAD001 is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some exte nt in the intestinal 
wall. RAD001 is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and 
subsequent elimination of systematically abso rbed RAD001 may be influenced by medicinal 
products that interact with CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein. In vitro studies showed that 
RAD001 is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4  and of CYP2D6 subs trates, potentially 
increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. In two phase III clinical trials in patients following kidney transplantation, strong inhibitors of 
 Confidential Page 10 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
CYP3A4 (azoles, antifungals, cyclosporine, er ythromycin) have been shown to reduce the 
clearance of RAD001 therapy thereby increasi ng RAD001 blood levels. Similarly, Rifampin, 
a strong inducer of CYP3A4, increases the clearance of RAD001 th ereby reducing RAD001 
blood levels. Caution should be exercised wh en co-administering RAD001 with CYP3A4 
inhibitors or inducers. 
Pharmacokinetic drug to drug in teractions with cancer agents are bein g evaluated in ongoing 
phase Ib studies. Based on curr ently available results, gemcitabine (study 2101 part 2) and 
paclitaxel (study 2104) did not a lter RAD001 pharmacokinetics to a clinically relevant extent 
whereas imatinib notably incr eased RAD001 exposure with a mean increase in AUC by a 
multiple of 3.7 for RAD001 administered week ly and two-fold for RAD001 administered 
daily (study 2206). Exposure to RAD001 in the pr esence of letrozole did not exceed that in 
monotherapy (study 2108). Co-administration of RAD001 did not influence pharmacokinetics 
of gemcitabine, imatinib or letrozole. Exposur e to paclitaxel in the presence of RAD001 was 
slightly decreased (average by 23%). 
RAD001 pharmacokinetics in tran splant patients was investigat ed in special populations such 
as subjects with hepatic or renal impairme nt, various ethnic group s and pediatric renal 
transplant patients. In subjects with mild –moderate hepatic impairment, mean AUC to 
RAD001 is increased by 3-fold whilst renal im pairment does not affect  the pharmacokinetics 
of RAD001. Age, weight (both over the adult range) and gender do not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of RAD001 to a clinically relevant extent. Also, pharmacokinetics does not 
alter in Japanese or Asian patients wherea s black patients have 21% higher clearance 
compared to non-blacks. In children, the appa rent clearance of R AD001 increases linearly 
with body surface. The clearance per square me ter of body surface area is 12-fold higher 
compared with adult patients. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived for RA D001 given weekly are summarized in Table

Cmax was achieved by 1 to 2 hours post dose.  While Cmax rose in roughly dose proportional 
manner from 5 to 20 mg/week, it appeared to in crease less than proporti onally at higher doses. 
Pharmacodynamic studies 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling base d on inhibition in a peripheral biomarker 
(S6 kinase inhibition in peripheral blood mon onuclear cells) suggests that 5-10 mg daily 
should be an adequate dose to produce a hi gh-degree of sustaine d target inhibition. 
Furthermore, molecular pharmacodynamic (MPD) studies using IHC in biopsied tumor tissue 
assessed the degree of inhibition and its duratio n (for p-S6, p-4E-BP1 and p-Akt expression) 
with the daily and weekly dosing. The pathologist  was blinded for the biopsy sequence. There 
was almost complete inhibition of p-S6 at all doses and schedul es studied (p=0.001). 
Preliminary results suggest a dose-related de crease in p-4E-BP1 and increase in p-Akt 
expression with maximal effect at 10 mg daily and ≥ 50 mg weekly. The study results are 
provided in Table 1-1.

Reduced blood cell counts at the initiation of treatment are frequent but remain mostly within 
the normal range or limited to grade 1 although a grade 3 neutropenia was a DLT in one 
patient as was a grade 3 thrombocytopenia in  a patient receiving RAD001 with letrozole 
where pharmacodynamic interaction is unlikely. This suggest that some patients may be 
particularly sensitive to the myelosuppressive  effect of RAD001 ma king it necessary to 
monitor carefully blood cell counts  at initiation of treatment. 
Metabolic changes (hyperlipidemia and hyperg lycemia) may be observed during treatment 
with RAD001. Both events may be medically ma naged. Hyperlipidemia has been reported as 
an ADR in 10% of patients alt hough review of the laboratory va lues suggests that as many as 
a quarter of patients develop grade 1-2 hyperlipidemia on treatment, mostly hypercholesterolemia. Hyperglycemia has been repor ted as an adverse even t in 7% of patients. 
Grade 3 hyperglycemia has been observed, especially in diabetics receiving RAD001 
treatment. Therefore, patients with diabetes  should have their blood glucose monitored 
carefully and their medications adjusted, as ne eded, to maintain adequate control of their 
blood glucose levels.

In Novartis-sponsored clinical  trials, symptomatic non-infectious pneumonitis has been 
reported as a serious adverse event in less th an 1% of patients out of approximately 1000 
cancer patients treated with R AD001 as of April 30, 2006. This adverse event has been noted 
in the Investigators’ Brochure. Corticosteroids were often administered to the patients with 
symptomatic pneumonitis.  
Novartis has recently received reports of lo w grade non-infectious pneumonitis in cancer 
patients treated with RAD001. Mo st of these reports involve patients with no respiratory 
symptoms (CTC grade 1 pneumonitis: radiographi c findings only) or mild severity (CTC 
grade 2: symptomatic, not interfering activi ties of daily living), and were from two 
investigator-sponsored (private  IND) trials, as follows: 
 In a study of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma receiving 10 p.o. mg/day, 15/20 
patients reviewed by an indepe ndent radiologist we re noted to have lung infiltrates 
consistent with pneumonitis on routine chest CT scans performed to follow the patients’ 
thoracic metastases. 
 In a study of patients with advanced breast cancer, 7/18 patients tr eated with RAD001 10 
mg/d and 2/16 patients treated with RAD001 70 mg/week, had findings consistent with pneumonitis. In this study, two patients, one on the daily RAD arm and one on the weekly RAD001 arm, developed severe (grade 3) pneumonitis which resolved after RAD001 was 
discontinued.  
In both studies, most patients had radiological changes with m ild or no symptoms and have 
continued RAD001 treatment without developing symptoms. The reason for an increased rate 
of reported low-grade pneumonitis among oncology patients in these studies is unclear.  Both studies included serial chest CT scans allowing prolonged, detailed evaluation of the lung parenchyma; the dosage and drug exposure in these phase 2 trials is gene rally longer than in 
the phase 1 experience. In addition, the dosage of RAD001 used in the treatment of cancer 
patients is substantially higher than that given routinely in the organ transplant setting.  Everolimus (RAD001) is approved at a da ily dose of 0.75 mg twice a day guided by 
therapeutic drug monitoring (3-8 ng/ml) in co mbination with cyclosporine microemulsion in 
many regions of the world for renal and cardiac tr ansplantation. In phase 3 trials investigating 
everolimus in renal and cardiac transplantation, the overall reported rate of pneumonitis ranged from 0.0 to 1.4%. The spontaneous repor ting rate for pneumonitis following exposure 
to commercially available everolimus in tr ansplantation is very low (0.08% or 84.4 
events/100,000 patient-years). Refer to the late st version of the R AD001 Investigator’s 
Brochure and safety letters (Investigator Notific ations) for the most up to date information 
available.  Everolimus has demonstrated promising activit y in advanced renal cell carcinoma.  Results 
from a phase 2 trial of everolimus in previ ously treated patients with advanced RCC were 
recently presented (31).  Overall, 41 patients wi th metastatic RCC were enrolled and 37 were 
evaluable for response and toxicity.  12 patient s (32%) showed an objective response and the 
median survival was over 11.5 months.  Base d on these promising results, everolimus was 
studied in a large, randomize d, phase 3 trial versus placebo in  patients with metastatic RCC 
who had failed VEGF-targeted TKI (32).  Ov erall, 410 patients were randomized in a 2:1 
fashion to receive either everolimus at a dos e of 10mg/day or best supportive care (272 pts 
everolimus, 138 pts placebo).  Everolimus resulted  in a statistically a nd clinically significant 
 Confidential Page 14 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
improvement in PFS over placebo with a favorab le safety profile ( PFS 4.0 vs. 1.9 months, 
p<0.0001).  The most common grade 3 or 4 adve rse events reported for everolimus were 
stomatitis (36% grade 3, 4% grade 4), anemia (28% grade 3, 7% grade 4), and asthenia (28% 
grade 3, 2% grade 4).  Everolim us is now being studied in othe r settings and in combination 
with other molecularly targeted agents.   
1.4 Predictors Biomarkers of Response to mTOR Inhibitors 
 Concurrent with the developmen t of molecularly targeted th erapies in RCC has been the 
pursuit of biomarkers which might predict for re sponse to these same therapies.  With many 
agents with distinct molecular targets curr ently available and even more on the horizon, 
identification of predictive biom arkers of response to these ag ents is a high priority for 
directing the most appropriate therapies to individual patients
.  Unlike VEGF-targeted 
therapies which putatively target non-malignantly transfor med tumor endothelial cells, the 
clinical benefit of mTOR inhi bitors in RCC may be mediated through direct effects on tumor 
cells.  Therefore, mTOR inhibitors may be uniquely suited for the development of tumor-
based predictive molecular biomarkers of respons e.  One possible candidate biomarker is the 
pre-treatment activation status of the PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.  The hypothesis that this basal activity of the targeted pathway might predict for sensitivity to molecularly targeted agents is based on similar examples  in other malignancies.  The link between 
response to the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 and the presence of an  activating B-RAF mutation in 
melanoma is one example (33).   
 
Recently, pathologic surrogates of pre-treatment mTOR pathway activation were investigated 
in tumor specimens collected from a subset of pa tients treated with temsirolimus as part of a 
randomized phase 2 trial (34, 35).  Twenty pre- treatment tumor specimens from patients with 
metastatic RCC treated with temsirolimus were stained for expression of phospho-S6 (pS6) (Ser 235/236) ribosomal protein, a substrate downstream of mTOR.  At the same time, 19 
tumor specimens were stained for phospho-Akt (pAkt) (Ser 473), a substrate upstream of 
mTOR.  Higher pS6 expression was significan tly correlated with ob jective response to 
temsirolimus (p=0.02) while there was a trend towards a significant corre lation of pAkt with 
objective response (P=0.07).  No patient without high expression of either pAkt or pS6 
experienced an objective response.  Although this study has a small sample size, the findings 
serve as proof of principle that these surr ogates of PI3-K/Akt pathway activation (in 
particular, S6 phosphorylation) are sufficiently stable in formalin-fixed tissue to yield 
reproducible data that may be predictive of respon se to molecularly targeted agents that block 
the PI3-K/Akt pathway. 
 
Despite the findings in this small retrospective analysis, there have been many concerns raised regarding the reliability  of phosphoproteins as surrogates of  signaling pathway activation in 
tumor specimens.  In particular, while there a ppears to be consensus that phospho-S6 is a 
particularly stable epitope, phospho-Akt appears quite variable due to rapid dephosphorylation 
(36).  As such, there are ongoing efforts to identify  more reliable surrogate s of Akt activation.  
Akt activation in the nucleus induces the transl ocation of the FOXO tran scription factors into 
the cytoplasm (37).  As the detection of the intracellular location of FOXO is not dependent 
 Confidential Page 15 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
upon a phospho-protein, it is possible that this would be a particularly st able marker of Akt 
activation in tumor specimens.  Akt also phosphorylates multiple other downstream substrates 
which may be more stable than phospho-Akt itse lf.   For example, PR AS40 (proline rich Akt 
substrate of 40 kd) is known to be directly phosphorylated by Akt and has recently been shown to potentially regulate mTOR activity by binding to raptor and competing with mTOR 
for binding to its substrates S6Kinase and 4EBP (38).  Preliminary work in paraffin-embedded tissue specimens suggests that phospho-PRAS40 may be a more stable epitope than phospho-
Akt (Ser 473) and therefore may serve as a mo re reliable biomarker of Akt activation.   
 Although the mTOR is traditiona lly thought to be activated pr imarily by signaling through the 
PI3K/Akt pathway, alternate mechanisms of mTOR activation independent of Akt have 
recently been described.  For example, the tumor suppressor Promyelocytic Leukemia (PML) protein has recently been shown to play a cr itical role in the inhibition of mTOR and 
activation of FOXO transcription factors (39, 40).   Better known for its causative role in Acute 
Promyelocytic Leukemia, where its function is al tered as a result of th e (15;17) translocation 
and fusion with RAR α (41), PML has more recently been s hown to play a role in epithelial 
malignancies (e.g. breast, lung and prostate cancer) in which its function is frequently lost (42, 
43).  Loss of PML function would be expected to result in both the constitutive activation of mTOR independent of Akt and th e nuclear activation of Akt inde pendent of PI3-K signaling.  
Recent data has suggested that the expression and intranuc lear distribution of PML is 
frequently altered in RCC (unpublished observations ).  Similar to the loss of PML, activation 
of the MAP-Kinase (MAP-K) path way may also result in the ac tivation of mTOR independent 
of PI3-K/Akt signaling.  It has recently been  shown that MAP-K regulated kinase Erk is 
capable of phosphorylating TSC2 at a specific residue (Ser
664), resulting in inhibition of its 
GAP activity and subsequent downstream activat ion of mTOR (44).  It is possible that 
activation of mTOR through either  of these pathways , PML loss or Erk act ivity, may represent 
oncogenic constitutive mTOR activation which is particularly sensitive to mTOR inhibition.  The determination of the frequenc y and predictive value of these signaling events with respect 
to response to mTOR inhibito rs is of great interest. 
 Finally, there may be molecular characteristics within individual tumors which determine its 
susceptibility to the beneficial effects of mTOR inhibition, whic h are presumably at least in 
part mediated through the achievement of G1 phase cell cycle arrest.  mTOR mediates its 
control of translation by phos phorylating 4EBP, causing it to di sassociate from eurkaryotic 
translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E).  eIF4E binds to the 5’,7-methylguanosine cap structure 
of mRNAs, allowing them to associate with th e eIF4F translation initiation complex, which 
then enables translation by scanning the 5’ UT R for the translation initiation codon.  It has 
recently become clear that individual mRNA vary widely in the ease with which they can be 
translated dependent upon the length and struct ure of their 5’ UTR (such as CG rich, high-
structured 5’ UTR) (45).  mRNA which are the most difficult to translate are therefore those 
which are most highly effected by the availa bility of eIF4E and include several well known 
growth and survival factors such as cyclin D 1, c-myc, VEGF, and survivin.  The availability 
of eIF4E is dependent upon seve ral factors such as activation of the ras and PI3-Kinase/Akt 
pathways.  However, eIF4E can also be overe xpressed independent of the activity of these 
pathways in several tumor types (46).  Overe xpression of eIF4E beyond the availability of 
4EBP is believed to potentially impart resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of mTOR 
 Confidential Page 16 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
inhibition.  While the existence of such ove rexpression of eIF4E in RCC remains to be 
investigated, such baseline variability may be predictive of response to mTOR inhibitors.  
 In addition to the levels of individual protein ma rkers, the transcriptiona l expression profile of 
an individual RCC tumor may also be predicti ve of activation of the mTOR pathway and 
predict response to targeted mTOR inhibitors su ch as everolimus.  Th e Nevins laboratory at 
Duke University’s Institute for Genome Sc iences & Policy has significant experience in 
performing these microarrays and analyzing the re sulting data.  In our laboratory, microarray 
data from tumor cell lines have been used to generate genomic signatures to predict response to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents (48).   Expression analysis of transcri pts in peripheral blood mononucle ar cells (PBMC) of patients 
with RCC have also proven informative.  In a prior study, 184 gene transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in PBMC of RCC patients compared  to normal control patients 
(51).  In a separate study, PBMC expression sign atures from RCC patients prior to treatment 
with temsirolimus were correlated with patien t outcomes, including overall survival (52).  
Expression analysis of PBMC fr om patients enrolled in this study will evaluated with the goal 
of developing a signature that can predict re sponse to mTOR inhibitor therapy.  During the 
study, PBMC will be collected at the beginning of  every other cycle of therapy, and the data 
will be analyzed for changes in the PBMC expression signature during treatment with 
everolimus.  
 
1.5 Rationale for Study 
 Clinical experience with temsirolimus and everolim us has shown that only a subset of patients 
with advanced RCC derive substant ial clinical benefit from mTOR  inhibitors (31, 44).  The 
particular benefit of temsirolimus in patient s with high-risk MSKCC prognostic features and 
in non-clear cell histology suggests that this subset of patients  may be distinct from those 
responding to VEGF-targeted therapies (47).  Th e discovery of predictive biomarkers would 
allow the direction of mTOR inhi bitors to those patients most likely to benefit and potentially 
identify those who should receiv e VEGF-targeted agents instead. 
 
It has been shown in a small retrospective study that  certain markers of mTOR activation (e.g. 
Akt or S6 phosphorylation) may pr edict response to temsirolimus  (35).  This study has several 
clear limitations which include small sample size, the retrospective nature of the analysis, and 
the use of mostly primary tumor (nephrectomy)  specimens for biomarker determination.  The 
last issue may be particularly concerning as it is not clear if the expression of the biomarkers 
of interest will be the same in the primary lesion (sometimes resected several years prior to therapy) as in the metastatic lesions which are presumably being treated.  We therefore 
propose to validate these previously identified predictive biomarkers prospectively in metastatic lesions from patients treated with everolimus in a phase II trial.  This approach appears feasible as everolimus has demonstrat ed a robust objective response rate in prior 
phase II trials in advanced RCC, facilitating the correlation of biomarker expression with 
response.    
 Confidential Page 17 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
In addition, there appear to baseline varia tions in RCC that may modulate the response to 
mTOR inhibitors.  Both loss of PML function and Erk-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 are 
Akt-independent pathways of constitutive mTOR activation which may predict for a 
particularly robust response to mTOR inhib ition.  Conversely, overexpression of eIF4E may 
predict for resistance to mTOR i nhibition.  This phase II trial is an ideal setting to explore the 
frequency of these signaling events  in metastatic RCC lesions as well as their predictive value 
with respect to response to mTOR inhibitors.  
 Microarray expression analysis of the tumor sa mples that will be obtained during this study 
will be paired with individual patient response data, and used to develop a genomic expression 
pattern that could predict res ponse to everolimus, thus rapidl y and reproducibly identifying a 
subgroup of patients with renal cell carcinoma who are more like ly to benefit from therapy 
with this agent (48, 50).  This signature coul d then be validated in  future studies with 
additional tumor samples.  In addition, microarra y data will be used to determine if gene 
products corresponding to potential biomarker proteins such as Erk, mTOR and S6 are 
overexpressed in these tumors.

This will be an open-label, single-arm phase II trial of everolimus in patients with advanced 
RCC.  The primary objective of the protocol wi ll be to prospectively validate pS6 and pAkt 
expression as predictive biomarkers of respons iveness to everolimus using progression free 
survival.  Forty patients total will be enrolled in the trial. Expected enrollment is 2-3 patients per months over 13-20 months. Patients may ha ve had prior VEGF-targeted therapy (i.e. 
sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, or pazopanib) or prior cytokine-based therapy (i.e. IL-2).  All patients will be required to undergo core needle biopsy or metastectomy of an accessible 
metastatic lesion prior to beginni ng therapy.  Enrollment, in general, will therefore be limited 
to patients who have safely accessible metastatic  disease.  Safely accessible metastatic disease 
will be defined to include those lesions which are palpable with no overlying viscera and are 
at least 2cm in size (longest dimension).  Given the paucity of  subcutaneous lesions in RCC, 
lesions which are felt safe to biopsy in the opin ion of the investigator will also be allowed.  
These lesions will include pleural-based tumors, peripheral liver lesions, kidney lesions and bone lesions with exophytic soft  tissue component.  As with palpable lesions, these other 
lesions should be at least 2c m in size (longest dimension) w ith no overlying viscera.  In 
addition to patients with safely accessible meta static disease, patien ts who have undergone 
clinically indicated biopsy or surgical resecti on of metastatic lesions prior to enrollment will 
also be eligible provided that: 1) They were o ff any systemic therapy for at least 7 days prior 
to the biopsy or surgery; 2) They have not received any othe r systemic therapy since the 
biopsy or surgical resection; an d 3) The tissue has been both pa raffin-preserved and frozen as 
described in section 6.1. A subset of patients will be asked to undergo an on-treatment biopsy between days 7-14.  However, this will not be a requirement for participation in the protocol.  
For those patients who have undergone nephrectom y, the enrolling site will also be asked to 
submit tumor blocks or at least ten unstained paraffin-embedded slides of the primary tumor 
for analysis.          All patients will begin everolimus at 10mg once da ily.  One cycle will be defined as 28 days.  
Physician and laboratory assess ments will occur every 28 days (+/- 2 days).  Disease 
assessment will occur every 2 cycl es (q8 weeks +/- 1 week) by either CT or MRI.  Patients 
will continue on therapy until disease progress ion, intolerable toxicit y, or they withdraw 
consent.  Patients discontinued from the treatment phase of the study for any reason will be evaluated ~30 days (28–42 days) after the decision to discontinue treatment (see Table 3-4 for details of off-study visit).  Patients will be fo llowed for a total period of two years following 
registration.         
Dose selection for RAD001 
In phase 1 clinical studies of  RAD001 as a monotherapy agent in oncology patien ts, the side-
effect profile is essentially mild to moderate adverse events with a low frequency of DLT at 
the daily dose of 10 mg/d (see Table 1-3). 
 Based on the PK/PD model, a daily dose of 10mg RAD001 is assumed to provide a persistently high degree of target inhibition in the tumor [I nvestigators’ Brochure-Section 
5.3.1.1].  In addition, preliminary data from phas e 1 studies, in which changes in molecular 
characteristics of tumor induced by treatment with RAD001 at the doses of 5 and 10 mg/d 
were investigated, confirm the pharmacodynami c activity predicted pr eviously by PK/PD 
modeling [Table 1-2].  Therefore, a dose of 10 mg/d should ensure adequate drug target 
 Confidential Page 20 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
inhibition for most patients, taking into cons ideration the known inter- patient variability in 
drug levels (CV of approx 50%). 
  
Tumor Sampling 
All patients who have not had prior biopsy or metastectomy will undergo either a core needle 
biopsy or metastectomy of an accessible metastatic  lesion prior to beginning therapy.  Lesions 
for core needle biopsy will be limited to subcutaneous and cutaneous lesions, or those otherwise felt by the investigator to be safely ac cessible as defined above.  Core biopsies must 
be performed with at least a 20 gauge or larger (in size) biopsy needle.  Core biopsies can be 
performed under CT or ultrasound guidance by a radi ologist.  Four biopsies will be taken of 
the same metastatic lesion and processe d as described in the Correlative Scien ce (Section 6.0).               
  
3.2 Study population 
3.2.1 Patient population 
A total of 40 patients with metastatic RCC will be enrolled on the study.  All patients will

 Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of the 
cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. 
 Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their partic ipation in the study such as: 
  unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction ≤ 6 months prior to first study trea tment, serious uncontrolled cardiac 
arrhythmia 
 severely impaired lung function  
  any active (acute or chronic) or un controlled infection/ disorders.   
  nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be 
jeopardized by the treatment  with the study therapy 
  liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic activ e hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis 
 Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by fasting serum glucose >1.5 X ULN 
 A known history of HIV seropositivity.  Inhibi tors of mTOR have been known to have 
immunosuppressive effects making its safety in the population of patients questionable. 
 Impairment of gastrointestinal function or ga strointestinal disease that may significantly 
alter the absorption of RAD 001 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, malabsorption syndrom e or small bowel resection) 
 Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis or  on systemic anticoagulation (i.e. warfarin, 
heparin, lovenox, etc).  Aspirin is permitted. 
 Women who are pregnant or br east feeding, or women/men able to conceive and unwilling 
to practice an effective method of birth control. (Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test  within 7 days prior to administration of 
RAD001). Oral, implantable, or injectable c ontraceptives may be affected by cytochrome 
P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. 
 Patients who have received prior treatm
ent with an mTOR inhibitor (e.g. sirolimus, 
temsirolimus, everolimus). 
 Patients with a known hypersensitivity to R AD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycins 
(sirolimus, temsirolimus) or to its excipients

 History of noncompliance to medical regimens 
 Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol 
 
3.2.3 Interruption, modification, or discontinuation of treatment 
 
For patients who are unable to  tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose 
adjustments are permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug.  If administration of 
RAD001 must be interrupted because of unaccept able toxicity, drug dosing will be interrupted 
or modified according to rules described in Table 3-1.  Toxicity will be assessed using the NIH-NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, ve rsion 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0, 
(http://ctep.cancer .gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf)
). 
 All patients will start therapy at 10mg orally once daily.  Patients will be permitted to have up to two reductions in therapy prior to discontinui ng therapy.  These dose levels will be defined 
as:  Dose Level I:  10mg PO once daily 
 Dose Level II: 5mg PO once daily  Dose Level III: 5mg PO QOD  Toxicities which are intolerable at dose le vel III will require discontinuation of study 
medication.  Please see Ta ble 3-1 for directions on holding of study drug.  Missed or vomited 
doses will not be made up.  
3.2.4 Patients with history of resol ved or inactive Hepatitis B infection 
 
Recent findings suggest that treatment of pa tients who been previously diagnosed with 
resolved or active Hepatitis B with everolimus  may trigger reactivation of Hepatitis B.  
Therefore, all patients with a known history of resolved or activ e Hepatitis B should be treated 
with lamivudine for at least 14  days prior to begi nning therapy on trial a nd continue treatment 
throughout duration of study drug treatment.  Patients with normal renal function should be 
treated with lamivudine 100mg PO once daily.  Patients with impaired renal function should 
be treated according to creatinine clearance as  follows: CrCl 30-49 mL /min, 100 mg first dose 
then 50 mg once daily; CrCl 15-29 mL/min, 100 mg  first dose then 25 mg once daily; CrCl 5-
14 mL/min, 35 mg first dose, then 15 mg once daily; CrCl less than 5 mL/min, 35 mg first dose then 10 mg once daily.  Please see attach ed package insert for potential toxicities 
associated with lamivudine administration.
  Lamivudine will be charged to patients insurance 
company.  If not covered by insurance, cost of lamivudine will be covered by the sponsor.

Table 3-1 Criteria for dose-modification in case of suspected RAD001 toxicity 
and re-initiation of RAD001 treatment 
Toxicity Actions 
Non-hematological toxicity  
Grade 2  
(except pneumonitis – refer to Table 3-2) If the toxicity is tole rable to the patient, 
maintain the same dose. If the toxicity is 
intolerable to patient,  interrupt RAD001 until 
recovery to grade 1. Then reintroduce 
RAD001 at same dose. 
If event returns to grade 2, then  interrupt 
RAD001 until recovery to grade 1. Then 
reintroduce RAD001 at the lower dose level. 
Grade 3 
(except pneumonitis – refer to Table 3-2) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade 1. 
Then reintroduce RAD001 at the lower dose 
level. For pneumonitis consider the use of a 
short course of corticosteroids. 
Grade 4 Discontinue RAD001. 
Hematological toxicity  
Grade 2 Thrombocytopenia (platelets <75, ≥ 50x109/L)  Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade 1 
(>75 x109/L). Then reintroduce RAD001 at 
initial dose. If thrombocytopenia again returns to grade 2,  
interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade 1. 
Then reintroduce RAD001 at the lower dose 
level.  
Grade 3 Thrombocytopenia (platelets <50, ≥ 25 x109/L) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade ≤1 
(platelets ≥ 75 x109/L).  Then resume  RAD001 
at one dose level lower.  If grade 3 thrombocytopenia recurs, discontinue 
RAD001. 
Grade 4 Thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25 x109/L) Discontinue RAD001. 
Grade 3 Neutropenia (neutrophils <1, ≥ 0.5 x109/L) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade 1 ( 
neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L). Then resume 
RAD001 at the initial dose.  If ANC again 
returns to Grade 3, hold RAD001 until the ANC 
≥ 1.5 x 109/L.  Then resume RAD001 dosing at 
the lower dose level.  Discontinue patient from study therapy for a third episode of grade 3 
neutropenia. 
Grade 4 Neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x109/L) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade  1  
(neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L). Then resume 
RAD001 at the lower dose level. If grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia occurs despite this dose 
reduction, discontinue RAD001. 
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (not life-threatening) Interrupt RAD001 until resolution of fever and 
neutropenia to grade ≤ 1. Hold further RAD001 
until the ANC ≥ 1,500/mm3 and fever has 
resolved. Then resume RAD001 at the lower 
dose level. If febrile neutropenia recurs, 
discontinue RAD001. 
Grade 4 febrile neutropenia (life -threatening) Discontinue RAD001. 
 Confidential Page 25 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
Any hematological or non-hematological toxicity requiring 
interruption for ≥ 3 weeks Discontinue RAD001 
*Grade 2 hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterole mia and/or hypertriglyceridemia) should 
be managed using medical therapies. 
 3.2.5 Monitoring of RAD001 suspected toxicities  
 
Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value suspected to be related to RAD001 must be followed at least 
weekly until the adverse event or  abnormal laboratory resolves or returns to grade 1.  If a 
patient requires a dose delay of > 21 days from  the intended day of the next scheduled dose, 
then the patient must be discontinued from the study. 
 
3.2.6 Known Undesirable Side Effects of RAD001 
 
Adverse events most frequently observed wi th RAD001 are rash, stomatitis/oral mucositis, 
fatigue, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, di arrhea and infections.  Overall, the most 
frequently observed laboratory abnormalities include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, and/or hypertriglyceridemia.  The majority of these AEs have been of 
mild to moderate severity (CTCAE 3.0 grade 1-2).   
Management of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers 
 
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to  RAD001 should be treated using local 
supportive care.  Please note that investigators in earlier tria ls have described the oral 
toxicities associated with RAD001 as mouth ulcer s, rather than mucositis or stomatitis.  If 
your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than  a more general inflammation of the mouth, 
please classify the adverse event as such.  Pl ease follow the paradigm below for treatment of 
stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers: 
1. For mild toxicity (grade 1), use conservative measures such as  
non-alcoholic mouth wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash
 several times a day until 
resolution. 
2. For more severe toxicity (grade 2 in which case patients have pain but are able to maintain 
adequate oral alimentation, or grade 3 in wh ich case patients cannot maintain adequate 
oral alimentation), the suggested treatments are topical analgesic mouth treatments (i.e., 
local anesthetics such as, benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetrac aine hydrochloride, 
menthol, or phenol) with or without topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone oral 
paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase®). 
3. Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen 
mouth ulcers.  It is prefer able to avoid these agents. 
4. Antifungal agents must be avoided unless a funga l infection is diagnosed.  In particular, 
systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketocona zole, fluconazole, itra conazole, etc.) should 
be avoided in all patients due to their st rong inhibition of RAD001 metabolism, therefore 
leading to higher RAD001 exposures.  Therefore,  topical antifungal agen ts are preferred if 
 Confidential Page 26 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
an infection is diagnosed.  Si milarly, antiviral agents such  as acyclovir should be avoided 
unless a viral infection is diagnosed. 
Management of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia  
Treatment of hyperlipidemia shoul d take into account the pre-treatment status and dietary 
habits.  Blood tests to monitor hyperlipidemia must be taken in the fasting state. Grade 2 
hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L ) or grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia (>2.5 x 
upper normal limit) should be treat ed with a statin or appropriate  lipid-lowering medication, in 
addition to diet.  Atorvastatin and pravastatin have been shown to have no PK interactions 
with everolimus and are the preferred statins fo r this protocol.  Patients should be monitored 
clinically and through serum biochemistry for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other 
adverse events as required in the product labe l/data sheets for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 
Note: Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is associated 
with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested by rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine ki nase (CPK) levels a nd myoglobinuria, acute 
renal failure and sometimes death.  The risk ve rsus benefit of using this therapy should be 
determined for individual patients based on th eir risk of cardiovascular complications of 
hyperlipidemia. 
Grade 3 hyperglycemia  has been observed in patients receiving RAD001 therapy. In many 
cases the affected patients had an abnormal fas ting glucose at baseline.  Based on this finding, 
we suggest that optimal glucose control shou ld be achieved before starting a patient on 
RAD001 and should be monito red during RAD001 therapy. 
Management of non-infectious pneumonitis 
Both asymptomatic radiological changes and symptomatic non-infectious pneumonitis have 
been noted in patients rece iving RAD001 therapy.  Non-infectious pneumonitis has been 
associated with RAD001 and other mTOR i nhibitors (33). In order to monitor for 
asymptomatic (grade 1) pulmonary infiltrates, a ches t X-ray is required if a CT scan of chest is 
not used for bi-monthly disease evaluations. Additional chest X-rays/CT scans may be done, 
when clinically necessary. If non-infectious  pneumonitis develops, consultation with a 
pulmonologist should be considered. Management  of non-infectious pneumonitis suspected to 
be associated with RAD001 and dose modificati ons instructions are pr ovided in Tables 3-1 
and 3-2.

All interruptions or changes to study drug administration must be recorded.  It will be documented whether or not each pa tient completed the clinical study.  If for any 
patient either study treatment or observations were discontinued the reason will be recorded. 
Reasons that a patient may discontinue particip ation in a clinical study are considered to 
constitute one of the following: 
1. adverse event(s) 
2. abnormal laboratory value(s) 
3. abnormal test procedure result(s) 
4. disease progression

3.3 Treatments 
 
3.3.1 Investigational therapy 
 
The investigational therapy used  in the course of this study is RAD001.  Study medication 
will be administered by the patients themse lves.  During the stud y, RAD001 will be 
administered orally as once daily dose of  10mg continuously from study day 1 until 
progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.  Medication labels will comply with US legal requirements and be printed in English. They will supply no information about the patient.  The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication label.  
RAD001 will be provided by Novartis. RAD 001 is formulated as tablets for oral 
administration of 5mg strength.  Tablets are bl ister-packed under aluminum foil in units of 10 
tablets, which should be opened only at the time of administration as drug is both hygroscopic 
and light-sensitive. 
 RAD001 should be taken by the patien t in a fasting state or with no more than a light fat-free 
meal.  Dietary habits around the time of RAD001 intake should be as consistent as possible 
throughout the study.  
 
3.3.2 Concomitant therapy 
 
Patients must be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over- the-counter 
products) during the trial withou t prior consultation with the investigator. All medications 
taken within 30 days of screen ing should be recorded. If conc omitant therapy must be added 
or changed, the reason and name of the drug/therapy should be recorded. 
 In general, the use of any concomitant medicatio n/therapies deemed necessary for the care of 
the patient are allowed, including drugs given prophylactically (e.g. antiemetics +/- steroids), 
with the following exceptions:  
 no other investigational therapy should be given to patients 
 no chronic treatment with systemic ster oids or another i mmunosuppressive agent 
 no anticancer agents other than the study medications administer ed as part of this study 
protocol should be given to patients. If such  agents are required for a patient then the 
patient must first be wi thdrawn from the study. 
 leukocyte growth factors (e.g.G-CSF and GM -CSF) are not to be administered 
systematically but may be prescribed by the investigator for severe neutropenia if this is 
thought to be appropriate.  
 no live vaccines should be administered to pa tient due to immunosuppressant potential of 
RAD001.    
 Confidential Page 29 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
 drugs or substances known to be inhibitors  or inducers of the isoenzyme CYP3A should 
be avoided in association with RAD001 as thes e can alter metabolism. Strong inhibitors or 
inducers of the isoenzyme CYP3A should not be administered as systemic therapy (See 
Table 3-3).  Grapefruit juice s hould be avoided while on study. 
The investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study staff about any new medications 
he/she takes after the start of the study drug. All medications (other than study drug/s) and 
significant non-drug therapies (including physical thera py and blood transfusions) 
administered after the patient starts treat ment with study drug/s must be recorded.

Please note: 
- strong inhibitor implie s that it can cause ≥ 5-fold increase in AUC or ≥80% decrease in clearance of 
sensitive CYP substrates 
- moderate inhibitor implies that it can cause 2 to 5-fold increase in AUC values or 50-80% decrease in 
clearance  of sensitive CYP substrates. 
(Distinction is not always categorical as in teraction can vary according to conditions). 
1. Macrolide antibiotics: Azithrom ycin is not a CYP3A substrate. It may therefore be employed where

2. Statins: Atorvastatin  and pravastatin may be associated with RAD001, since a PK interaction study has 
shown that there is no relevant PK interaction.  
 
3.3.3 Treatment compliance 
Records of study medication used, dosages administ ered, and intervals betw een visits will be

3.4.2 Duration of Follow-up 
 
For this protocol, all patients, including those who discontinue protocol therapy early, will be 
followed for response until progression and for survival for 2 years from the date of 
registration.  Following the off-study visit, th e study team will update survival data every 6 
months for up to three years.      
Patients who have an ongoing everolimus-related Gr ade 4 or serious adverse event at the time 
of discontinuation from study treatment will con tinue to be followed until resolution of the 
event or until the event is considered irreversible.  Otherwise, there will no specific follow-up 
visits or studies following  the off-study visit.   
 
3.4.3 Efficacy assessments 
 
Tumor measurements will occur every 8 weeks (+/-  1 week) on study by either CT or MRI.  
RECIST criteria will be us ed to classify response. 
 
Patients who prematurely exit the study should have the required evaluations performed at the 
time study drug is discontinued and before initi ation of any other tr eatment.  Physical 
examination, performance status (PS) determ inations, and all labor atory tests should be 
repeated on the last day of study if these have not been evalua ted within 14 days, inclusive, 
before discontinuation.  Repeat measurements or evaluations of all tumor sites should be 
performed if these have not been evaluated with in 30 days, inclusive, before discontinuation. 
 
3.4.3.1 Solid Tumor Response Criteria (RECIST) 
 
Malignant Disease Evaluation
 
 
To assess objective response, it is necessary to es timate the overall tumo r burden at baseline to 
which subsequent measurements will be compared. Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion. 
 
All measurements should be recorded in metric  notation by use of a ruler or calipers. The 
same method of assessment and the same tec hnique should be used to characterize each 
identified lesion at baseline and during fo llow-up. All baseline ev aluations should be 
 Confidential Page 34 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
performed as closely as possi ble prior to registration and never more than four weeks  before 
registration. 
  
The term evaluable in reference to measurability  will not be used because it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  At baseline, tu mor lesions will be characterized as either 
measurable or non-measurable. 
 Measurable 
 
 
Lesions that can be accurately measured in at  least one dimension (l ongest diameter to be 
recorded) as > 20 mm (2.0 cm) w ith conventional techniques or as > 10 mm (1.0 cm) with 
spiral  CT scan. 
 
If the measurable disease is restricted to a so litary lesion, its neopla stic nature should be 
confirmed by cytology/histology.  Non-Measurable
 
 All other lesions, including small lesions [longest diameter < 20 mm (2.0 cm) with 
conventional techniques or < 10 mm (1.0 cm) with spiral  CT scan] and truly non-measurable 
lesions.  Lesions considered to be truly non-measurable include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/peri cardial effusion, inflamma tory breast disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by 
imaging techniques, and cystic lesions. 
 
3.4.3.2 Definition of Response 
 
3.4.3.2.1 Target Lesions 
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per or gan and 10 lesions  in total, 
representative of all involved organs. Target le sions should be selected  on the basis of their 
size (those with the longest diameters) a nd their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements  The sum of the longest diameters of all target  lesions will be calculated at baseline and 
reported as the bas eline sum longest diameter . The sum longest diameter  will be used to 
characterize the objective tumor response. For lesions measurable in  2 or 3 dimensions, 
always report the longest diameter at the time of each assessment. 
 Complete Response (CR)
  
 Confidential Page 35 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
The disappearance of all target lesions. To be assigned a status of complete response, changes 
in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than four 
weeks  after the criteria for response are first met. 
 
 
Partial Response (PR)   
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the l ongest diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum longest diameter . To be assigned a stat us of partial response, 
changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less 
than four weeks  after the criteria for response are first met. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD)   
At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the longest diameters of target le sions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum longest diameter  recorded since the baseline measurements, or the 
appearance of one or  more new lesion(s). 
 Stable Disease (SD)
  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient in crease to qualify for 
progressive disease. To be assi gned a status of stable disease,  measurements must have met 
the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval.  
 
3.4.3.2.2 Non-Target Lesions 
 
All other lesions or sites of disease not meeting de finition of target lesions will be classified as 
non-target lesions. Measurements of these le sions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be  noted throughout follow-up. 
 
Complete Response (CR)  
The disappearance of all nontarge t lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels, if 
applicable. To be assigned a status of complete response, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than four weeks  after the criteria 
for response are first met. 
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD)   
The persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/ or the maintenance of tumor marker 
levels above the normal limits. To be assigned a st atus of stable disease, measurements must 
have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval at a 
minimum interval of 8 weeks. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD)   
Appearance of one or more new lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-
target lesions.

3.4.3.3 Symptomatic Deterioration 
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discon tinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
symptomatic deterioration. 
 
3.4.3.4 Evaluation of Patien t’s Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best respon se recorded from registration until disease 
progression/recurrence, taking as reference for pr ogressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since registration. The table below provides overall responses for all possible 
combinations of tumor responses in target and nontarget lesions, with or without new lesions. 
 
To be assigned a status of complete or partia l response, changes in tumor measurements must 
be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than four weeks after the criteria for 
response are first met. 
 
To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease 
criteria at least once afte r study entry at a minimum interval of eight weeks.

Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
 
     
3.4.3.5 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response – the period measur ed from the time that measurement criteria 
are met for complete or partial response (whichever  status is recorded first) until the first date 
that progressive disease is objectively doc umented, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since treatment started.  Duration of Complete Response
 
The period measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response until 
the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  Duration of Stable Disease
 
The period measured from registration on to the study until the criteria fo r disease progression 
is met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since registration. To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements  must have met the stable disease criteria at 
least once after study entry at a minimum interval of eight weeks.  
 
Survival
 
Survival will be measured from the date of registration on to the study. 
 
Progression Free Survival  
Progression-free survival will be measured from  the date of registra tion on to the study until 
the first date that progressive disease is obj ectively documented or death from any cause, 
whichever occurs first.  
 
3.4.3.6 Methods of Measurement  
 
Imaging based evaluation is preferred to ev aluation by clinical examination.  The same 
imaging modality must be used th roughout the study to measure disease. 
 
CT and MRI  
CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ar e the best currently available and most 
reproducible methods for measuring target lesions. Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or le ss in slice thickness. Spiral CT should be 
performed by use of a 5 mm contiguous reconstruc tion algorithm. This sp ecification applies to 
tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, wh ile head and neck tumors, and those of the 
extremities require specific procedures.

Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
3.4.4 Safety assessments 
 
Please see the DF/HCC Multi-Cente r Data and Safety Monitoring Plan in Appendix C. Safety 
assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events and serious adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematol ogy, blood chemistry and urine values, regular 
measurement of vital signs and the performance of physical examinations.  See multi-center 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan (A ppendix C) for more details. 
These assessments should be performed within ±2 days of the scheduled day of assessment except for adverse events that  will be evaluated continuou sly through the study. Safety and 
tolerability will be assessed according to the NIH/NCI CTCAE version 3.0 
http://ctep.cancer .gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf
. 
 
3.4.4.1 Adverse events 
 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by the subj ect, discovered by 
investigator questioning, or detected through p hysical examination, labor atory test or other 
means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate.  An adverse event is the appearance or wo rsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after st arting the study drug even if th e event is not considered to 
be related to study drug. Medi cal conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are 
only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically signi ficant, or require therapy. 
 The occurrence of adverse events should be so ught by non-directive ques tioning of the patient 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also  may be detected when they are volunteered 
by the patient during or between visits or th rough physical examinati on, laboratory test, or 
other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1. the severity grade (grade 1: mild; grade 2: moderate; grade 3: severe; grade 4: life 
threatening; grade 5:fatal) 
2. attribution: the determination of  whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment 
or procedure 
Attribution categories: 
 Definite : The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s).  
 Probable : The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s).  
 Possible: The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s).  
 Unlikely : The adverse event is doubtfully relate d to the investigational agent(s).  
 Unrelated : The adverse event is clearly NOT rela ted to the investigational agent(s) 
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
4. action taken (no action taken;  study drug dosage adjusted/tem porarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued due to this ad verse event; concomitant medication taken; 
non-drug therapy given; hospitaliz ation/prolonged hospitalization) 
 Confidential Page 39 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
5. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in 
study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuati on, starting or stopping 
concomitant treatments, changes in the frequenc y or nature of assessm ents, hospitalization, or 
any other medically required intervention. Once  an adverse event is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, 
if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected re lationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
 Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigators’ Broc hure or will be communicated between IB updates in the form 
of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
3.4.4.2 Serious adverse events 
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded. To ensure patient 
safety each serious adverse event must also be  reported to the overall principal investigator 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The overall principal investigator will then 
report the event to Novartis and to the Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS).  A serious 
adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: 
 is fatal or life-threatening 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 requires inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is for: 
 routine treatment or monito ring of the studied indicati on, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (specify what this includes) 
 elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-ex isting condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not wors ened since the start of study drug 
 treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission 
 social reasons and respite care in the abse nce of any deterioration in the patient’s 
general condition 
 is medically significant, i.e., defined as an ev ent that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to pr event one of the outcomes listed above 
 
3.4.5 Reporting of Adverse Events The DFCI Institutional Review Board (IRB) requir es the following events to be reported:  
 
 Confidential Page 40 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
 Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (serious ) Events -- Only events that are 
Unexpected and Possibly, Probably or Defi nitely Related/Associated with the 
Intervention. 
 ALL Grade 4 (life-threatening) events.  
 ALL Grade 5 (Fatal) Events -- When  subject is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial or when event occurs within 30 days of the last study 
intervention. 
Full written SAE report must be submitted to th e Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS) 
as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days from notification of event.  DF/HCC 
institutions should electronica lly submit SAE reports via DFCI  SAE reporting forms directly 
to the OHRS.   For participating institutions outside  the DF/HCC, the overall principal 
investigator must be notified electronically of any events m eeting the above requirements, 
even if they are not required to be reported by thei r local IRB.  All ev ents should also be 
reported to the local IRB as per thei r respective requirements.       
 
 If subject is in Long-Term Follow Up, death is reported at continuing review. 
 
3.4.6 Instructions for rapid notif ication of serious adverse events 
 
The overall principal investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to the FDA, DFCI IRB, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Clinical Safety and Epidemiology Department (CS&E).  All events reported to the FDA by the investigator are to be filed utilizing the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form).   This form can be downloaded at:  http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/REPORT/Mfg.htm[fordrugs/biologics]
 
 All events must be reported elect ronically to the overall princi pal investigator within 24 hours 
of learning of its occurrence.  The overall principal investigator will notify Novartis Pharmaceuticals CS&E Department by FAX (888 -299-4565) also within 24 hours of learning 
of its occurrence. This includes serious, rela ted, labeled (expected) and serious, related, 
unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences.  A ll deaths during treatment or within 30 days 
following completion of active protocol therapy must be reported within 5 working days. 
 Any serious adverse event occurring after the pa tient has provided informed consent and until 
4 weeks after the patient has stopped study participation must be reported. This includes the 
period in which the study protocol  interferes with the standard  medical treatment given to a 
patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal  during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose 
of concomitant medication).  Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only be reported if a relationship to the Novartis  study drug (or therapy) is suspected.  
 
 Confidential Page 41 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Conc omitant Medications), all serious adverse 
experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by the investigator. 
3.4.6.1 Pregnancies 
Any pregnancy that occurs during study particip ation should be reported. To ensure patient 
safety each pregnancy must also  be reported to Novartis with in 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence. The pregnancy should be fo llowed up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termina tion, details of bi rth, and the pres ence or absence of any birth 
defects, congenital abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. 
3.4.6.2 Laboratory evaluations 
Hematology 
Hematology must include hemoglobin, hematocr it, platelets, total white blood cell count 
(WBC) and differential. PT (IN R) evaluation will be includ ed for baseline evaluations. 
Blood chemistry Blood chemistry must include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, glucose, 
creatinine, blood urea n itrogen, albumin, total protein, S GOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, phosphorus, magnesium, LDH, fasting serum 
triglycerides, and fasting total cholesterol,  hepatitis B screening (HepB surface Ab, HepB 
surface antigen, HepB Core Ab). 
Because accurate serum glucose and lipid m easurements are required, patients should be 
fasting at least 6 hours at th e time of the blood sampling. 
ALL PATIENTS IN ACTIVE TREATM ENT WHO ALREADY ENROLLED AND 
PATIENTS BEING SCREENED FOR THIS STUDY WILL BE TESTED FOR HEPATITIS 
B INFECTION.  
Urinalysis 
Standard urinalysis assessment (pH, protein, glucose, blood, ketones,  and leukocytes) should 
be performed. This must be supplemented with  laboratory quantificatio n of any potentially 
relevant abnormalities.   
3.4.6.3 Vital signs 
Vital sign assessment consists of height (first  visit), pulse, blood pres sure, respiration rate, 
temperature and weight. Blood pressure, pulse a nd respiration rate should be measured on 
patients after at least 3 minutes in the sitting position 
3.4.6.4 Physical examination 
Physical examination will be performed which must comprise a total body examination 
(general appearance, skin, neck, including thyr oid, eyes, ears, nose, th roat, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extrem ities and basic nervous system). 
 Confidential Page 42 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
Significant findings made after the start of study drug which meet the defi nition of an Adverse 
Event must be recorded. 
3.4.6.5 ECG 
A standard 12 lead ECG is to be performed during screening a nd significant findings must be 
recorded. 
3.4.6.6 Performance status 
Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale. 
3.4.7 Drug levels and pha rmacokinetic assessments 
None will be made 
 
4 Protocol amendments, or changes in study conduct 
Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protoc ol requires a wr itten protocol 
amendment that must be reviewed by Novartis and the investigator before implementation. 
Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the 
scientific quality of the study require additi onal approval by the IRB at each study center.  A 
copy of the written approval of  the IRB must be provided to Novartis. Examples of 
amendments requiring such approval are: 1. increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects, 
2. significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group), 
3. increases in the number of  invasive procedures, 
4. addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of safety. 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being 
taken by the investigator or by Novartis in the in terests of preserving the safety of all patients 
included in the trial.  If an immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by the 
investigator and is implemented for safety reas ons Novartis must be notified and the IRB at 
the center must be informed immediately.   Am endments affecting only administrative aspects 
of the study do not require formal protocol amen dments or IRB approval but the IRB must be 
kept informed of such admini strative changes. Examples of administrative changes not 
requiring formal protocol amendm ents and IRB approval include: 
1. changes in the staff used to monitor trials  
2. minor changes in the packag ing or labeling of study drug.

5 Registration Procedures 
5.1 General Guidelines fo r DF/HCC Institutions 
Institutions will register eligible participan ts with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office 
for Clinical Trials (QACT) cen tral registration system. Regist ration must occur prior to the 
initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before treatment begins 
will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
A member of the study team will confirm eligib ility criteria and comp lete the protocol-
specific eligibility checklist. 
 
Following registration, participants may begin pr otocol treatment. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Pr incipal Investigator. If a participant does not 
receive protocol therapy following registration, the participan t’s protocol st atus must be 
changed. Notify the QACT Registrar of particip ant status changes as soon as possible.  
5.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC Institutions 
The QACT registration staff is accessible on M onday through Friday, fr om 8:00 AM to 5:00 
PM Eastern Standard Time. If a participan t must be registered  during off-hours or 
holidays, call the QACT registration line at  617-632-3761 and follow  the instructions for 
registering participants after hours.   
The registration procedures are as follows: 
1. Obtain written informed consen t from the particip ant prior to the performance of any 
study related procedures or assessments. 
2. Complete the protocol-specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment 
documented in the participan t’s medical/research record. To be eligible for 
registration to the study, the participant must meet each inclusion and 
exclusion criteria listed on  the eligibility checklist.  
 Reminder:  Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies  at the same time as eligibility for 
the treatment study. Registration to both treatment and ancillary studies will not be completed if eligibility requirements are not met for all studies.  
3. Fax the eligibility checklist(s) and all page s of the consent form(s) to the QACT at 
617-632-2295.  
 exception: DF/PCC Affiliate sites must fax th e entire signed consen t form including 
HIPAA Privacy Authorization and the eligib ility checklist to the Network Affiliate 
Office. The Network Affiliate Office will re gister the participan t with the QACT.

Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
4. The QACT Registrar will (a) validate eligib ility, (b) register the participant on the 
study, and (c) randomize the part icipant when applicable.  
5. The QACT Registrar will send an email confirmation of the registration and/or 
randomization to the person initiating the registration immediately following the 
registration and/or randomization.  
 
5.3 General Guidelines  for other Participating Institutions 
 
Eligible participants will be entered on study centrally at the BIDMC by the Study 
Coordinator (Bryan Marion). All sites should call the Study Coordinator at [617-632-9271] 
to verify treatment availability . The required eligibility checklist  can be found in 
Appendix D . 
Following registration, participants should begin protocol treat ment within 72 hours or 
as soon as possible. Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the 
Principal Investigator. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following 
registration , the participant’s protocol status must  be changed. The St udy Coordinator should 
be notified of partic ipant status changes  as soon as possible. 
 
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order the study 
agent(s) directly from the supplier. A participating site may order the agent(s)  only after 
the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by the Coordinating Center to the 
supplier. 
Any other questions regarding the protocol can be addre ssed to the overall Principal 
Investigator:  David F. McDermott, MD (617-632-9250; dmcdermo@bidmc.harvard.edu).  
5.4 Registration Process for Other Participating Institutions 
To register a participant, the following documents should be completed by the research

6 Correlative Studies 
 
Correlative studies appended to this clinical protocol incl ude those proposed in tissue 
specimens and blood collected serially during treatment.     
6.1 Studies proposed in tissue 
 All patients who have not had prior biopsy of  a metastatic lesion or metastectomy will 
undergo either a core needle biopsy or metastectomy  of an accessible metast atic lesion  prior to 
beginning everolimus.  A subset of patients will be asked to  undergo an on-treatment biopsy 
of the same metastatic lesion between days 7-14 on-study medication.  This second biopsy 
will not be a requirement for participation in the protocol. These on-treatment biopsies will 
handled and analyzed identically  to the pre-treatment biopsies (on-protocol) and will provide 
an opportunity to assess biologic target inhibition (i.e. suppre ssion of S6 phosphorylation) and 
pharmacodynamic effects (i.e. changes in eIF4 E phosphorylation and Cyc lin D1 levels) of 
drug treatment.  We anticipate 6-10 patients wi ll agree to undergo an on-treatment biopsy.  At 
teach time point, four core-needle biopsies will be taken of the same metastatic lesion.  One 
will be immediately placed in formalin, one wi ll be promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 
two will be placed in OCT and frozen.  Samples frozen in liquid nitrogen will ultimately be 
shattered and the powder dissol ved equally into protein lysi s buffer and trizol for RNA 
isolation (followed by RNAeasy cleanup, Qiagen).  Samples stor ed in OCT will be ultimately 
analyzed via microarray analysis.  If for some  reason only one core biopsy can be obtained, 
preference will be given to fo rmalin fixation for immunohistochemical studies. In cases of 
metastectomy, the specimen will be divided into thirds.  One piece will be placed in formalin 
and processed as decribed below.  Another piece will be stored in OCT and the final piece will be frozen separately in liquid ni trogen and stored at -80ºC.   
 For patients who have undergone c linically indicated biop sy or surgical res ection of metastatic 
lesions prior to enrollment, these specimens must  meet the following criteria for these patients 
to be eligible: A) All biopsies must be core needle biopsies; specimens obtained by fine needle 
aspiration are unacceptable. B) At least one portion of the specimen must be preserved in paraffin.  C) At least one portion must be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
 Formalin fixed (or paraffin embedded) specimen  should be shipped by overnight courier at 
room temperature to the DF/HCC RCC SPORE Pathology Core using the shipping form in 
Appendix A.  Frozen specimens should be shipped on dry ice also  the DF/HCC SPORE 
Pathology CORE using the form in Appendix A.  Frozen specimens can also be stored at -
80ºC and batch shipped.      For patients who have undergone nephrectomy, the enrolling site wi ll be asked  to obtain and 
submit the tumor block or at least 10 unstain ed paraffin-embedded slides of the primary 
 Confidential Page 46 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
tumor. These are not required for enrollment on the study and can be submitted at any point 
during study enrollment using the form in Appendix A.    
6.1.1 Phospho-Akt and Phospho-S6 Expression 
5m thick sections will be prepared from form alin-fixed tumor specimens and stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin.  Sections will then  be dewaxed, soaked in alcohol, and after 
microwave treatment in antigen unmasking soluti on for 10 minutes and then incubated in 3% 
hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes to inactivate e ndogenous peroxidase.  Sec tions will next be 
incubated with the appropriate  either the Phospho-Akt (Ser
473) or Phospho-S6 
Ribosomal Protein (Ser235/236) antibodies from Cell Signali ng Technology, Beverly, MA.  
Following this, detection of expression will be performed using DAKO EnVision™+ System 
horseradish peroxidase detecti on kit (Dako, Carpinteria).  Semi -quantitative assessment of 
antibody staining will be performed by a single pa thologist blinded to the clinicopathologic 
variables.  Expression of phospho- S6 will be scored based on a co mposite of staining intensity 
(graded 0=1+, 1=2+, 2=2-3+, and 3=3+) and per centage of tumor cells staining positive (1=1-
29%, 2=30-69%, 3=70-100%).  Patients will then be  classified as low (product of intensity 
and staining percentage score = 0-1), intermediate (2-3), and high (4-9) expressors of pS6.  
Phospho-Akt expression will be similarly scored base d on a composite of  intensity (graded 
0=1+, 1=1-2+, and 2= 2+ or 2-3+) and percentage of tumor cells positive (1=1-29%, 2=30-
69%, 3=70-100%).  Patients will then be classified as low (product of  intensity and staining 
percentage score = 0), intermediate (1-2), and high (3-6) expressors of pAkt.  The expression 
of the markers will then be correlated with response to everolimus as determined by PFS.  
Detection of phospho-Akt and phospho-S6 by IHC will be verified by western blot from 
protein lysates.  Western blots will be perfor med once at the end of the study when all the 
biopsy specimens have been obtained and imm unohistochemistry has been performed.  IHC 
studies will be performed with the guidan ce of the Pathology core of the DF/HCC RCC 
SPORE.  The same stains will also be perfor med in nephrectomy specimens collected.  The 
expression of the substrates in the metastatic and primary tumors will be compared.    
6.1.2 Analysis of other biomarkers 
 
Slides will be prepared as above from forma lin fixed samples.  PML expression will be 
analyzed by IHC using a commercially availa ble antibody for PML (PGM3, Santa Cruz).  For 
the purpose of the correlative studies outlined below, PML expression/distribution will be categorized as absent, normal (particulate distri bution), or increased (d iffuse distribution).  
Phospho-TSC2 (Ser
664) expression will be assayed both by IHC using an antibody provided by 
Dr. Piers Pandolfi.  For the purpose of correla tive studies, phospho-TSC2 distribution will be 
categorized as low or high on IHC based on a composite of staining intensity and percentage of tumor cells positive for stain.  Phospho-PRAS 40, eIF4E, and Cyclin D1 expression will be 
analyzed by IHC using commercially available antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA).  Expression will be scored as high or low ba sed on a composite of staining intensity and 
percentage of tumor cells po sitive.  Localization of FOXO transcription factors will be 
assessed by IHC using a commercially available antibody (Cell Signaling).  FOXO will be classified as predominantly nuclear or cyto plasmic.  Expression of PML, phospho-TSC, 
 Confidential Page 47 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
eIF4E, Cyclin D1, and phospho-PRAS will be verifi ed by western blot from protein lystates.  
Expression of these biomarkers thus classifi ed will then be correlated to response to 
everolimus.   
 
6.1.3 Gene and micro-RNA expression studies 
 
Variations in gene expression patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of response/resistance to mTOR inhibitors.  For this reason, depending upon the availability of 
funding, transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarrays from RNA isolated from frozen 
specimens will be performed.  While these cDNA microarrays may provide part of the picture, 
it is becoming increasingly clear that post-tran scriptional regulation by micro-RNA may play 
an important role in the ultimate expression of gene products at the tran slational level.  For 
this reason, also depending upon funding, micro- RNA expression profiling will be performed 
using RNA isolated from frozen specimens.         In cases of on-study biopsy, three core biopses will be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and 
stored at -80ºC.  Samples will be de-identified of  any patient data and will be listed by sample 
number only.  The code document linking the sa mple number to each individual patient will 
be stored in a locked cabinet in the principal investigator’s office.  Two of the three core 
needle frozen biopsies (or one-third of the metastectomy specimen) will be shipped in an insulated container on dr y ice via commercial over night delivery to:

Total RNA will be isolated from frozen tumors using Qiagen Rneasy Mini  Kit according to manufacturer’s recommendations (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using approximately 1-2mg of wet tissue from each sample.  Total RNA will then be utilized for both c DNA microarrays as well 
as microRNA arrays.  50ng of total RNA from  the qRT-PCR experiments above will be 
amplified.  There will be two rounds of amplifi cation and Biotin-labeled  aRNA is generated at 
the second in vitro tr anscription step.  15 g of biotin-labeled aRNA is combined with the 
hybridization mix and loaded on to the Affymetrix Huma n Genome U133A GeneChip 
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  After hybridi zation, the GeneChip will  be washed, stained 
with Stepavidin/phycoerythrin conjugate and bi otinylated antibody, and scanned according to 
the manufacturer’s recommendations.  Total RNA will also be sent to Exiqon Inc (Woburn, 
MA) for micro-RNA array analysis using the miRCURY™ LNA Array.

6.2 Studies to performed on blood 
 
Blood samples will be collected pre-study (or cy cle 1 day 1) and day 1 of every other cycle 
starting with C2 (i.e. C2D1, C4D1, etc).  One 7ml CPT tubes should be collected at each time 
point and submitted by overnight courier as instructed in Appendix B (include shipping form).  The peripheral blood will be used in correlative studies investigating th e angiogenic effects of 
treatment as well as surrogates of targeted pathway activation.    
6.2.1 Angiogenesis 
RCC is known to be a highly vasc ular tumor type.  While mTOR inhibitors are believed to 
target the process of angiogenesis, the degree to which this effect may correlate with or 
contribute to tumor responses is unknown.  Ther efore, studies investigating markers of 
angiogenesis in the blood before  and during therapy are proposed. 
 
Plasma levels of circulating pro-an giogenic cytokines, VEGF, bFGF, TGF- , and TGF-  will 
be measured in all patients at the selected ti me points.  These cytokines are chosen because 
they are prominent pro-angiogenic molecules that are secreted by renal cancer cells.   
 
In addition to more standard ELISA assays, ci rculating cytokines will be investigated using 
xMAP technology from Luminex Corporation (A ustin, TX) in the Angiogenesis Monitoring 
Core Lab of the DF/HCC Renal Spore.  This is a novel bioassay system in which microspheres are made with intern al dyes (red/infrared) and coated  with a reagent specific to a 
certain bioassay (i.e. for circulating VEGF).  The internal dye mix is specific for the particular 
assay of interest and allows its identification based on its laser excitation pattern.  The reporter dye from the microsphere coating then allows for the detection and quantification of the protein of interest.  The Lumi nex technology allows for the rapid analysis of very small 
quantities of serum for simulataneous measuremen t of up to 100 different proteins of interest 
with sensitivity comparable to standard ELI SA.  The access to such technology will allow the 
rapid exploration of more novel angiogenic cyto kines such as SDF-1 and Angiopoietin-like 4 
in the context of these antiangiogenic therapies.  
6.2.2 HIF activity 
 
Hypoxia-driven increase in HIF activity may be a mechanism of resistance to VEGF-targeted 
therapies.  As the extent to which increased  HIF activity is present and effected by the 
everolimus is unknown, potential surrogates of HI F activity will be measured from serum at 
the selected time points.  Levels of serum erythropoietin and carboni c anhydrase IX will be 
measured and correlated with response to everolimus.      
6.2.3 Peripheral blood cell signature

Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
RNA will be isolated from PBMC s isolated from CPT tubes dr awn pre-study.  PBMCs will be 
isolated as described in Appendix D, frozen vi ably in freezing media (95% Fetal Calf Serum, 
5% DMSO), and stored at -80°C or in liqui d nitrogen.  RNA will be isolated from PBMCs 
using Trizol® reagent.  Briefly, frozen PBMCs will thawed, pelleted, wa shed once in PBS and 
pelleted again.  Cells will be lysed in 1ml of Tr izol®  and incubated at room temperature for 5 
minutes.  200µl of chloroform will be added to  each sample, which will then be shaken 
vigorously for 10-15 seconds, incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, and centrifuged at 
no more than 12,000 G for 15 minutes at 2 to 8°C.  Following centrifugation, the mixture will 
separate into a lower red, phe nol-chloroform phase, an inte rphase, and a colorless upper 
aqueous phase.  RNA remains exclusively in th e aqueous phase.  The aqueous (clear) phase 
will be transferred to a separate tube and RNA precipitated by the addition of 0.5ml of isopropyl alcohol.  After additi on of isopropyl alcohol, samples will be incubated at room 
temperature for 10 minutes, then centrifuged at no more than 12,000 G for 15 minutes at 2 to 
8°C.  The resulting pellets will be washed onc e with 70% ethanol, ai r-dried, dissolved in 
RNase-free water, and stored at -80°C.  At the conclusion of the study, RNA thus isolated should be batch shipped to for analysis:  Ranjit Goudar, MD Nevins Laboratory CIEMAS Building, Room 2133 101 Science Drive Durham, NC 27708 919-684-8712  
50ng of total RNA will be utilized for microarray  expression analysis.  The RNA is amplified 
twice, and biotin-labeled aRNA is generated at  the second in vitro transcription step.  15 g of 
biotin-labeled aRNA is combined with the hybrid ization mix and loaded on to the Affymetrix 
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (A ffymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  After 
hybridization, the GeneChip will be washed, stained with streptavidin/phycoerythrin 
conjugate and biotinylated antibody, and s canned according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. Expression data will be anal yzed using published protocols (49, 50). 
 
 
7 Data and safety management  
 
7.1 Data collection 
 Investigators or their designee must enter the information required by the protocol onto electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs).  The QACT will collect, manage, and monitor for this study.   
7.2 Data and safety management 
 
 Confidential Page 50 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
Please see the full DF/HCC Multi-Center Data a nd Safety Monitoring Plan in Appendix C.  
This Phase II trial will be managed through the DF/HCC review and monitoring systems and 
therefore are subject to the Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Pl a n  ( D S M P )  t h a t  h a s  
been approved by NCI. This plan outlines the extensive Scientific Review Process, 
Institutional Review Board’s (I RB) review and monitoring of Adverse Events, and Internal 
Auditing.  A Data and Safety Monitoring Committ ee (DSMC) reviews patient safety data for 
high risk Phase II trials.  The risk level is determined with the help of the disease programs 
and the committee.   The DSMC has representatives from different modalities, disease 
programs and institutions.  The DSMB meetings  occur semi-annually and the DSMC meetings 
occur quarterly for high-risk protocols. The co mmittees will notify the Principal Investigator 
of safety issues that need to be addressed.  In the case of any unexpected safety problems, the 
PI and/or the DSMB or DSMC have the option to call an unsc heduled meeting.  A summary 
of the DSMB and DSMC meetings  is shared with the Clinic al Investigations Policy and 
Oversight Committee (CLINPOC) and the IRB.  De tails of the review are maintained in the 
Quality Assurance Office for Clinical Trials’ files.  
 
8 Statistical methods 
 
This is a single-arm phase II st udy. Forty patients will be enrolled; expected  enrollment is 2-3 
patients per month over 13-20 months. Patients will be followed for up to two years.  The biomarkers of primary interest are pAkt and pS6. Expression of phospho-S6 and phospho-Akt will be classified as low, intermediate, or high based on a composite score of staining intensity and percentage of tumor cells staining positive as previously described for temsirolimus [35]. Based on prior analysis for temsirolimus we assume that approximately 
50% of patients will have tumors with high pS 6 expression and/or high pAkt and therefore be 
classified in the favorable group. We assume 4 months medi an progression-free survival 
(PFS) in this cohort of patients.  The primary endpoint will be considered met if the median 
PFS of favorable versus  unfavorable group is ≥ 4 months. 
   When 26 events have been observed, a hazard ratio of 3.0 (2m vs. 6m median PFS) for 
biomarker low/intermediate ( unfavorable) vs. high (favorable ) groups would be detectable 
with 80% power (two-sided α=0.05) [George and Desu, 1974].  
 Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS distribution accord ing to biomarker groups will be calculated, 
and Cox modeling used to estimate HRs and co mpare PFS between biomarker groups.  PML, 
pTSC2, pPRAS40, and FOXO localization will be  analyzed similarly, though the expected 
proportions of absent/normal/increased PML or  low/high pTSC2 are uncertain a priori. 
 
The tumor biopsy expression data will be an alyzed to create a genomic predictor of 
everolimus response.  The genes whose level of expression are statistically significantly 
different between everolimus responders and nonresponders will be used to generate a 
metagene summary model.
48  Leave-one-out cross-validation will be performed to strengthen 
 Confidential Page 51 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
the metagene model.  Binary classification tree analysis will be used to predict a probability 
that a given subject wi ll respond to everolimus.50  This signature can then be validated in an 
external data set.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi- Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DF/HCC DSMP) outlines the procedures for a DF/HCC Multi-Center research protocol.  
 1.1       Purpose 
 To establish standards that will ensure th at a Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center 
(DF/HCC) Multi-center protocol will comply  with Federal regula tions (21 CFR Part 
11); Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines ; and  Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements in accordance with the CTEP Multi-center 
Guidelines.        
 
1.2      Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  Components 
 
The Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan includes the following 
components: 
 
DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol :  One or more outside institutions collaborating with 
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center on a re search  protocol where DF/HCC is the 
Lead Institution.  Lead Institution:  The BIDMC will be the Lead Instit ution and will be responsible for 
the coordination, development, submission, a nd approval of a protocol as well as its 
subsequent amendments per the DFCI IRB and the FDA.   DF/HCC Contract Principal Investigator:  Dr. David McDermott located at the BIDMC will be charged with the responsibility of the administration of the DF/HCC Project.   Protocol Chair:  The Protocol Chair is the Princi pal Investigator (Dr. David 
McDermott).  Dr. McDermott will be the single liaison with any regulatory agencies the FDA.   Participating Institution:  A participating institution is an institution that desires to 
collaborate with DF/HCC and commits to accru ing participants to a DF/HCC protocol.  
The participating in stitution acknowledges the Protocol  Chair as having the ultimate 
authority and responsibility for the overall conduct of the study.    
 Coordinating Center: The BIDMC is the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol. The Coordinating Center will provide the administrative 
support to the Protocol Chair in order th at he/she may fulfill the responsibilities 
outlined in the DSMP and as specified in applicable regulatory guidelines (ie. CTEP Multi-Center Guidelines).  In addition to the Lead Institution, the Quality Assurance 
Office for Clinical Trials ( QACT) provides support services  to assist the Protocol

3.0 DF/HCC QUALITY ASSURANCE OFFI CE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS 
 
The DF/HCC QACT is a unit that has been deve loped to collect, manage, and monitor data for 
DF/HCC trials.  The DF/HCC QACT is located administratively in the office of the Senior 
Vice President for Clinical Research, at Da na-Farber Cancer Institute.  The QACT uses 
DF/HCC computerized institutional database s for participant registrations and for the 
management of trial data as well as a set of  quality assurance programs designed to monitor 
DF/HCC trials.   
 
3.1      Organizational Structure 
 
The DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office for C linical Trials administrative structure 
consists of: 
 
DF/HCC Quality Assurance Officer for Clinical Trials : Oversees the functions of 
the DF/HCC QACT. 
 QACT Assistant Director for Data: Provides direct oversight  to the QACT Data 
Analysts assigned to CRF design, data co llection and computerization for DF/HCC 
trials.  
 
The DF/HCC QACT Data Analysts will be assigned on a protocol by protocol basis. 
Each protocol’s data analyst is responsible for  database management, data entry, data 
quality assurance, and protocol specific correspondence related to the collection and 
quality assurance of data. 
 
QACT Assistant Director for Monitoring: Provides direct oversight to the QACT 
Protocol Registrars and Clinical Research Auditors. 
 The DF/HCC Protocol Registrars are re sponsible for the confirmation of each 
participant’s eligibility  and consent prior to protocol registration.

designee by teleconference. 
 
 
5.0  PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT 
 
The Coordinating Center (BIDMC) is respon sible for assuring that each Participating 
Institution has the appropriate assurance on file with the Offi ce of Human Research Protection 
(OHRP).   Additionally, the BIDM C or designee must maintain copies of all IRB approvals, 
for each participating institution.  
 
5.1 Protocol Distribution 
 
The Coordinating Center (BIDMC) will distribute the final approved protocol and any 
subsequent amended protocols to all Participating Institutions.    
 
5.2 Protocol Revisions and Closures 
 
The participating instituti ons will receive phone, fax, ma il or e-mail notification of

aware of imminent protocol closures. 
 
5.3 Informed Consent Requirements 
 
The Principal Investigator (P I) at each participating si te will identify the physician 
members of the study team who will be obtaining consent and signing the consent 
form for therapeutic protocols. It is DF /HCC policy that Nurses and Fellows cannot 
obtain consent to greater than minimal risk trials  
 
5.4      IRB Documentation 
 
The following must be on file with the BIDMC prior to participant registration:  
 
 Activation Letter of the institution's IRB  (An Expedited IRB first 
approval is NOT acceptable)  
 IRB approval for all amendments 
 
It is the individual institution's responsibility  to notify its IRB of protocol revisions.  
Participating institutions will have 90 days  from receipt to provide the BIDMC their 
IRB approval for Major Amendments* to a protocol.    
 
* DF/HCC defines a Major Amendment  as: A substantive change in the study which 
may increase or decrease the risk to study pa rticipants.  Major revisions require full 
IRB approval.  The following criteria are examples of revisions to a protocol that are 
considered to be major amendments:      
 Change of eligibility (inc lusion/exclusion) criteria 
 Change in design of protocol 
 Change in statistical section 
 Change in sample size/accrua l (e.g., doubling the sample size) 
 Change in informed consent 
 Change of estimated dropout rate 
 Change of treatment or intervention 
 Change of device 
 Change in primary objective evaluation process 
  
5.5      IRB Re-Approval 
 
 Confidential Page 69 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
Annual IRB re-approval from the Participat ing institution is re quired in order to 
register participants onto a protocol.  There is no grace pe riod for annual re-approvals.  
 
Protocol registrations will not be completed if a re-approval letter is not received by 
the DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee from the Participating Institutions on or 
before the anniversary of th e previous approval date.   
 
5.6  Participant Confidentialit y and Authorization Statement 
  
The Health Insurance Portabili ty and Accountability Act of 1996 contains,  as one of 
its six major components, the requirement to  create privacy standards for health care 
information that is used or disclosed in th e course of treatment, payment or health care 
operations.  The original Privacy Rule, as it has come to be known, was published in 
December 2000.  The Final Rule was published on August 14, 2002, which has modified the privacy rule in signi ficant ways vis- à-vis research. 
 In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health information during the course of a DF/HCC Multi-Center Protoc ol the study particip ant must sign an 
Authorization.  This Authorization may or may not be separate from the Informed 
Consent.  The DF/HCC Multi-Center Protoc ol, with the approval from the DFCI IRB 
will provide an Informed Consent templa te, which covered entities (DF/HCC Multi-
Center Protocol participati ng institutions) must use.  
 
The DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol will use all efforts to limit its use of protected 
health information in its trials.  However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information must be collected per National Cancer Institute 
requirements. These are the primary r easons why DF/HCC has chosen to use 
Authorizations, signed by the participant in the trial, rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.   
 
5.7  Participant Registration  
 
To register a participant, the following documents should be completed by the 
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol p articipating site  and faxed to or e-mailed to the 
Lead Institution or designee (S tudy Coordinator Bryan Marion): 
 Copy of required tests (baseline CBC, baselin e chemistries, pathology 
report, baseline radiog raphic study reports) 
 Signed informed consent form 
 HIPAA authorization form (if separate from the informed consent 
document)  
 Eligibility Screening Checklist 
 
The research DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol p articipating site will then call
 or e-mail 
the BIDMC  to verify eligibilit y. To complete the registration process, the Lead 
Institution or designee will: 
 Confidential Page 70 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
 Register the participant on the study with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance 
Office for Clinical Trials (QACT)  
 Fax or e-mail the participant case  number to the pa rticipating site 
 Call the research nurse or data manager at the participating site and  
verbally confirm  registration 
 
5.8  DF/HCC Multi-center Pr otocol Case Number 
 
Once eligibility has been established and th e participant successfully registered, the 
participant is assigned a five digit protocol case number.  This number is unique to the 
participant on this trial and must be used  for QACT CRF/eCRF completion and written 
on all data and QACT corres pondence for the participant.  
 
5.9 DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol Registration Policy 
 5.9.1   Initiation of Therapy : Participants must be registered with the DF/HCC QACT 
before receiving treatment.  Treatment may not be initiated until the site 
receives a faxed or e-mailed  copy of the participant’s Registration 
Confirmation memo from the DF/HCC QA CT. Therapy must be initiated per 
protocol guidelines.  The Protocol Chai r and DFCI IRB must be notified of 
any exceptions to this policy .  
 5.9.2  Eligibility Exceptions:  The DF/HCC QACT will make no exceptions to the 
eligibility requirements for a protocol without DFCI IRB approval. The 
DF/HCC QACT requires each institution to fully comply with this requirement. 
 
5.9.3  Verification of Registration:  A registration confirmation memo for 
participants registered to DF/HCC Mu lti-Center Protocol will be faxed or 
emailed to the registering institu tion within one working day of the 
registration. Treatment may not be init iated until the site receives a faxed or 
e-mailed  copy of the registrati on confirmation memo.  
 
5.9.4 Confidentiality:  All documents, investigative reports, or information relating 
to the participant are strictly confidential. Any participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Lead Institution or designee must have the participant’s full name & social security number “blacked out” and the assigned DF/HCC QACT case number and protocol number
 written in (with the exception of the signed 
informed consent document). Participan t initials may onl y be included or 
retained for cross verification of identification. 
   
5.10  Schedule of Data Submission

 5.11  Data Form Review 
 
When data forms arrive at the DF /HCC QACT, they are reviewed for:  
  
Timeliness:  
Did the form arrive on time as  specified in the protocol?  
    
Completeness:  
Is all the information provided as required per protocol?  
  
Participant Eligibility:   
Does the participant meet the eligibility re quirements for the study based on the 
demographic data, lab values and measurements provided?  
 Stratification:  
Are the stratification parameters consistent  with what was given at the time of 
registration?  
 
Protocol Treatment Compliance:   
Are the body surface area (BSA) and drug dosag e calculations correct?  The dose must 
be within 10% of the calculated protocol dose.  
  Adverse Events (Toxicities):  
 Confidential Page 74 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
Did the participant experience adverse events (toxicities or side effects) associated 
with the treatment? Was the treatment delaye d due to the adverse event? What was the 
most severe degree of toxicity  experienced by the participant?  
 
Notations concerning adverse events will addr ess relationship to protocol treatment for 
each adverse event grade.  All adverse ev ents encountered during the study will be 
evaluated according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria as signed to the protocol and 
all adverse events must be noted on the pa rticipant's Adverse Event (Toxicity) Forms. 
 
Response:   
Did the participant achieve a response?  What level of response did they achieve?  On 
what date did the partic ipant achieve the response and how was the response 
determined? 
 Response criteria are defined in the protocol.  A tumor assessment must be performed prior to the start of treatment and while the participant is on treatment as specified by 
the protocol.    Objective responses must have documentation such as physical measurements, x-rays, scans, or laboratory tests.    A subjective response is one that is perceived by the participant, such as reduction in pain, or improved appetite.

5.12 Missing and Deficient Memorandum  
 
Data submissions are monitored for time liness and completeness of submission. 
Participating institutions ar e notified of their data submission delinquencies in 
accordance with the followi ng policies and procedures: 
 
Incomplete or Questionable Data  
 If study forms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitting institution will receive a written query fr om the DF/HCC QACT Data Analyst.  
Responses to the query should be completed and returned within 14 days.  Responses 
may be returned on the written query or on an amended case report form. In both instances the query must be attached to  the specific data being re-submitted in 
response.    Missing Forms
 
 If study forms are not submitted on schedule, th e participating institution will receive a 
Missing Form Report from the DF/HCC QA CT noting the missing forms.  These 
reports are compiled by the DF/HCC QACT a nd distributed a minimum of three times 
a year.  
  
6.0 REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG 
  
The ordering of investigational agen t is specified in the protocol.  
 
Participating sites should order their own agent regardless of the supplier.  
 
If the agent is commercially available, check wi th the local Director of Pharmacy and/or the 
Research Pharmacy to ensure that the agent is in stock. If the agent is not stocked, ensure that the agent can be ordered once the protocol is  approved by the local IRB. If the agent is 
investigational, ensure that the pharmacy will be able to receive and store the agent. The local 
IRB should be kept informed of who will s upply the agent (i.e., NCI or a pharmaceutical 
company) so that any regulatory responsib ilities can be met in a timely fashion.  
 
 
7.0  SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND TOXICITY  MONITORING  
 
All participants receiving investigational agents will be evaluated for safety.  The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneo us reports of adverse events reported to the investigator 
by participants.  All toxicities encountered dur ing the study will be evaluated according to 
the NCI criteria assigned to the protocol (CTC AE Version 3.0) and recorded prior to each 
course of therapy.  Life-threate ning toxicities should be reported  immediately to the Protocol 
Chair and Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
 Confidential Page 76 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
 
Additional safety assessments and toxicity  monitoring are outlined in the protocol. 
 
7.1 Serious Adverse Events 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE ) is any adverse drug expe rience at any dose that 
results  in any of the following outcomes : death, a life-threatening adverse drug 
experience, inpatient hospitalization or pr olongation of existi ng hospitalization, a 
persistent or significant disa bility/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result  in death, be life-t hreatening, or require 
hospitalization may be cons idered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the particip ant or may require me dical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in th is definition.  Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronc hospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscras ias or convulsions in a participant who 
has never had seizure activity in the pa st that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or abuse. 
 
Unless otherwise specified in the protocol , the study will utilize the Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) Common Termi nology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 for Toxicity and Adve rse Event reporting.  A copy of the CTC 
or CTCAE Criteria can be downloa ded from the CTEP home page 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov) .   
 
7.2  Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
Guidelines for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be followed as is 
delineated in the protocol.      
 
In addition, the Particip ating Institutions must report th e serious adverse events to the 
Protocol Chair and the Coordinating Ce nter (BIDMC) at th e time SAEs are 
submitted.   The Lead Institution will maintain documentation of all Adverse Event Reporting and be responsible for communicating a ll SAEs to all Participating sites. 
 
7.3 Guidelines for Processing IND Safety Reports  
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) re gulations require sponsors of clinical 
studies to notify the FDA and all particip ating investigators of any serious and 
unexpected adverse experiences that are possibl y related to the investigational agent.  
 
IND Safety Reports:  Investigators will be sent a copy of expedited adverse events 
which have been sent to the FDA.  The i nvestigators are to file a copy with their 
protocol file and send a copy to their IRB according to their local IRB’s policies and 
procedures.

8.0  PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS AND DEVIATIONS 
 
Neither the FDA nor the ICH GCP guidelines de fine the terms “protocol violation” or 
“protocol deviation.”  All DF/HCC Protocol Ch airs must adhere to those policies set by the 
DFCI IRB, the definitions for protocol violation and devia tion as described by the DFCI 
IRB will be applied for reporting purposes for all institutions participating in the DF/HCC 
Multi-center Protocol.     
8.1 Definitions 
 
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB-
approved protocol. 
   
Protocol Violation: Any protocol deviation that was not prospectively approved by the IRB prior to its initiation or implementation.    
 
8.2  Reporting Procedures 
 The Protocol Chair:
 is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is 
available in the medical record to  describe all protocol deviations  and violations. 
  The Protocol Chair will also be respons ible for ensuring that all protocol 
violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 Participating Institutions
: Protocol deviations require prospective approval from 
DFCI IRB. The Participating institution mu st submit the deviation request to the 
Protocol Chair and Lead Institution or designee, who will submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the deviation should be 
submitted to the participating site’s own IRB, per its policy.  Protocol violations occurring at a particip ating institution will be submitted to that 
site’s own IRB.   A copy of the part icipating institution’s IRB report and 
determination will be forwarded to the DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee by 
mail, facsimile, or via e-mail within 10 busin ess days after the or iginal submission.  
 Coordinating Center:
  Upon receipt of the violati on/deviation report from the 
participating institution, the BIDMC will subm it the report to the Protocol Chair for 
review. Subsequently, the participating in stitution’s IRB violat ion/deviation report 
will be submitted to the DFCI IRB for revi ew per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines.  
  
9.0  QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
The quality assurance process for a clinical trial research study requires verification of protocol 
 Confidential Page 78 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
compliance and data accuracy. As the Coordina ting Center, the BIDMC with the aid of the 
QACT provides quality assura nce oversight for the DF/H CC Multi-center Protocol. 
 
9.1  Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance  
  
All data submitted to the DF/HCC QACT will be monitore d for timeliness of submission, 
completeness, and adherence to protocol requ irements.  Monitoring will begin at the time 
of participant registration an d will continue during protocol  performance and completion.  
The BIDMC and if applic able QACT Data Analysts assign ed to the Protocol will perform 
the ongoing protocol compliance monitoring  with the support of the participating 
institution’s Coordinators, th e Principal Investigators, and the Protocol Chair.  
 
9.2 Evaluation of Participating Institution Performance 
 
9.2.1  Eligibility Checklist:  Eligibility criteria are checke d on a protoc ol-specific 
eligibility checklist and faxed to  the DF/HCC QACT pr ior to registration on protocol.  
The checklist and informed consent document are reviewed by a DF/HCC QACT Protocol Registrar before the participant can be registered on a protocol.  The DF/HCC 
QACT cannot make exce ptions to the elig ibility requirements. 
 
9.2.5  Accrual of Elig ible Participants: Annual accrual rates for eligible participants 
enrolled onto therapeutic clinical trials is calculated for each institution. Institutions are 
expected to maintain  the minimum annual average accrual as defined by the protocol 
grant or contract.  
 
 9.3  On-Site Auditing  
 
 9.3.1 NCI & DF/HCC Sponsored Trials 
 
For all DF/HCC sponsored protocols: 
 The participating institutions may be required to submit subject source documents to the BIDMC for monitoring. Each participatin g institution will be subject to on-site 
monitoring conducted by the QACT. The fi rst on-site audit will be conducted 
following the enrollment of the third participant at each participating institution.  Further on-site audits will be determined as  necessary by the results of this initial 
audit.  The BIDMC or designe e will also require source documentation for review on 
1-2 patients at each participating institution every 6 months.  A report of these reviews 
will be filed in a separate monitoring binder at the lead institution (BIDMC).  
 
9.3.2  Participating Institution 
 
It is the participating institution’s responsib ility to notify the BIDM C or designee of all 
scheduled audit dates (internal or NCI) a nd re-audit dates (if applicable), which 
involve the DF/HCC Multi-Cente r Protocol. The All institutions will forward a copy of 
 Confidential Page 79 
Clinical study protocol  October 3, 2014 
 
final audit and/or re-audit reports and corr ective action plans (if applicable) to the 
BIDMC Research Coordinator (Bryan Marion ) within 12 weeks after the audit date.  
 
9.3.3  Coordinating Center (BIDMC)  
 
The Protocol Chair (Dr. Cho) will review  all DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol Final 
Audit reports and corrective action plans if applicable. The Lead Institution or 
designee must forward these reports to the DF/HCC QACT per DF/HCC policy for 
review by the DF/HCC Aud it Subcommittee. Based upon the audit assessments the 
DF/HCC Audit Subcommittee could accept or conditionally accept the audit rating and 
final report. Conditional appr oval could require the Prot ocol Chair to implement 
recommendations or require further follow- up.  For unacceptabl e audits, the Audit 
Subcommittee would forward the final audit report and corrective action plan to the 
Clinical Investigations Policy and Oversight Committee and the DFCI IRB as applicable. 
 
9.4  Sub-Standard Performance  
 
The Protocol Chair, DFCI IRB and the NCI for CTEP trials, is charged with considering the totality of an institution’s performance in considering institutional participation in the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol. 
 
9.4.1  Corrective Actions  
  
 Institutions that fail to meet the pe rformance goals of accrual, submission of 
timely accurate data, and adherence to protocol requirements will be 
recommended for a six- month probation period. Such institutions must respond with a corrective action plan  and must demonstrate during the 
probation period that deficiencies have been corrected, as evidenced by the improved performance measures. Instit utions that fail to demonstrate 
significant improvement will be cons idered by the Protocol Chair for 
revocation of participation.  
 
9.5 Scheduled Conference Calls 
 
Conference calls will be held  once monthly involving the study staff from all DF/HCC 
and participating institutions to discuss prot ocol progress, accrual, side effects, and 
relevant regulatory issues.

Appendix D 
 
Collection of blood for both cytoki ne and for PBMC analysis will  be performed as described 
below: 
 Approximately 7 cc of venous blood will be coll ected into a BD Vacuta iner CPT™ tube with 
Sodium Citrate  (Becton Dickinson product #36 2761).  The tube should be gently inverted 
several times to ensure mixing with the anti coagulant. Within 24 hours the CPT tube should 
be centrifuged at room temperature in a hor izontal rotor for 25 minutes at 1600g.  After 
centrifugation, the mononuclear cells will be visibl e in a whitish layer just under the plasma 
(see figure below).   Remove 2-3 mls of plasma (top layer) and aliquo t into 3 tubes (1 ml cryotubes). Then remove 
mononuclear layer (1.5 ml) and put into cryotube  #1. Then transfer half  of mononuclear cells 
(750 microliters) to cryotube #2. Add 750 microliters of fr eezing media (RPMI-1640 media 
with 20% dimethyl sulfoxide) to PBMC cr yotubes (#1 and #2). All cryotubes (plasma and 
PBMC containing tubes) should immediately be placed in a –80 degree freezer.   All samples 
should be labeled with the following:      Patient Initials, ID number     Protocol number     Collection date     Cells or plasma      Institution  Samples should be stored at -70° to -80°C.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 
WARNING: RISK OF LACTIC ACIDOSIS , EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B IN 
CO-INFECTED PATIENTS UPON  DISCONTINUATION OF EPIVIR®, DIFFERENT 
FORMULATIONS OF EPIVIR. 
 Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with  steatosis, including fatal cases, have 
been reported with the use of nucleoside anal ogues alone or in combination, including 
lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. Suspend t reatment if clinical or laboratory findings 
suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)] . 
 Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are 
co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) a nd human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and 
have discontinued EPIVIR. Hepatic function shou ld be monitored closely with both clinical 
and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue EPIVIR 
and are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If a ppropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B 
therapy may be warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].  
 EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution (used to  treat HIV-1 infection) contain a higher 
dose of the active ingredient  (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV® Tablets and Oral Solution 
(used to treat chronic HBV infection). Patien ts with HIV-1 infection should receive only 
dosage forms appropriate for treatment of HIV-1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].  
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
 EPIVIR is a nucleoside analogue indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
agents for the treatment of human immunodeficien cy virus (HIV-1) infect ion. Limitation of use: 
The dosage of this product is for HIV-1 and not for HBV. 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
2.1 Adults and Adolescents >16 years of age 
 The recommended oral dose of EPIVIR in  HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents 
>16 years of age is 300 mg daily, administered as either 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg once daily, in combination with other an tiretroviral agents. If  lamivudine is administered to a patient 
infected with HIV-1 and HBV, the dosage indicated for HIV-1 therapy should be used as part of 
an appropriate combination regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 
2.2 Pediatric Patients 
 The recommended oral dose of EPIVIR Oral Solution in HIV-1-infected pediatric patients 3 months to 16 years of age is 4 mg/kg twice daily (up to a maximum of 150 mg twice a 
day), administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. 
 EPIVIR is also available as  a scored tablet for HIV-1-in fected pediatric patients who 
weigh ≥ 14 kg and for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate. Before prescribing EPIVIR 
 2
Tablets, children should be assess ed for the ability to swallow ta blets. If a child is unable to 
reliably swallow EPIVIR Tablets, the oral solution formulation should be prescribed. The 
recommended oral dosage of EPIVIR Tablets for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients is presented 
in Table 1.

 No additional dosing of EPIVIR is require d after routine (4-hour) hemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis. 
 Although there are insufficient data to reco mmend a specific dose adjustment of EPIVIR 
in pediatric patients with renal impairment, a re duction in the dose and/or an increase in the 
dosing interval should be considered.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe He patomegaly With Steatosis 
 Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been 
reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alon e or in combination, including lamivudine and 
other antiretrovirals. A majority  of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged 
nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Pa rticular caution should be exercised when 
administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases 
also have been reported in patients with no know n risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should 
be suspended in any patient who develops clinic al or laboratory findings  suggestive of lactic 
acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked tr ansaminase elevations). 
5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection 
 Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis:  In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected 
patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepa titis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of 
exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These 
exacerbations have been detected primarily  by serum ALT elevations in addition to 
re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities 
have been reported in some cases. Similar ev ents have been reported from postmarketing 
experience after changes from lamivudine-c ontaining HIV-1 treatment regimens to 
non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients in fected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal 
relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely 
monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at l east several months after stopping 
treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determ ine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters 
the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 
 Important Differences Among Lam ivudine-Containing Products:  EPIVIR Tablets 
and Oral Solution contain a higher dose of th e same active ingredient (lamivudine) than 
EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIV IR-HBV was developed for 
patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formula tion and dosage of lamivud ine in EPIVIR-HBV are 
not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine 
have not been established for trea tment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 
and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescr ibed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with 
unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to 
result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 
 4
treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-i nfected with HIV-1 and 
HBV, EPIVIR Tablets, EPIV IR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR® (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, 
EPZICOM® (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR® (abacavir sulfate, 
lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used  as part of an appropriate combination 
regimen. 
 Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV:  In non–HIV-1-infected patients treated 
with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been 
detected and has been associated with dimini shed treatment response (see full prescribing 
information for EPIVIR-HBV fo r additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus 
variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lami vudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of 
concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 
5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- a nd Emtricitabine-Containing Products 
 EPIVIR should not be admi nistered concomitantly with  other lamivudine-containing 
products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets,  EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR 
(lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (ab acavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or 
TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zi dovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, 
including ATRIPLA® (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA® (emtricitabine), or 
TRUVADA® (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 
5.4 Use With Interferon- a nd Ribavirin-Based Regimens 
 In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine 
nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/ HCV virologic suppression) was seen when 
ribavirin was coadministered with lami vudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)] , hepatic decompensation (some fata l) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV 
co-infected patients receiving co mbination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa 
with or without ribavirin. Patie nts receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR 
should be closely monitored for treatment-a ssociated toxicities, especially hepatic 
decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. 
Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered 
if worsening clinical toxici ties are observed, includi ng hepatic decompensation (e.g., 
Child-Pugh >6). See the complete  prescribing information fo r interferon and ribavirin. 
5.5 Pancreatitis 
 In pediatric patients with a hist ory of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of 
pancreatitis, or other significan t risk factors for the developmen t of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should 
be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR s hould be stopped immediately if clinical signs, 
symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions 
(6.1)]. 
5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome 
 Immune reconstitution syndrome has been repo rted in patients treated with combination 
 5
antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral 
treatment, patients whose immune system res ponds may develop an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunist ic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, 
cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tube rculosis), which may 
necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 
5.7 Fat Redistribution 
 Redistribution/accumulation of body fat includ ing central obesity, dorsocervical fat 
enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasti ng, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and 
“cushingoid appearance” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The 
mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are curre ntly unknown. A causal 
relationship has not been established. 
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience 
 The following adverse reactions are discussed in  greater detail in other sections of the 
labeling: 
• Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)].  
• Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions 
(5.2)]. 
• Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and Hepatitis C [see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.4)].  
• Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  
 Because clinical trials ar e conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 
rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot  be directly compared to rates in the clinical 
trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
 Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1:  The safety profile of EPIVIR  in adults is primarily 
based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected pati ents in 7 clinical trials. 
 The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs 
and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. 
 Selected clinical adverse reactions in ≥5% of patients during therapy with EPIVIR 
150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR® 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in

combination with other antir etroviral agents. In an ope n-label dose-escalation study 
(NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with 
EPIVIR. Three of these patients di ed of complications of pancre atitis. In a s econd open-label 
study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pa ncreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis 
was not observed in 236 patients randomized to  EPIVIR plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was

 Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1:  Limited short-term safety information is available 
from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Af rica in neonates receivi ng lamivudine with or 
without zidovudine for the first week of life follo wing maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 
36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Selected adverse reac tions reported in these 
neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, 
hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, re spiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates 
died (1 from gastroenteritis w ith acidosis and convulsions, 1 from  traumatic injury, and 1 from 
unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea ca ses were reported, including 
1 with convulsions; 1 infant ha d transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The 
absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that 
perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for ad verse reactions comparable  to those reported in 
pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients tr eated with lamivudine-containing combination 
regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 
6.2 Postmarketing Experience 
 In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse 
reactions have been reported during postmarketi ng use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are 
reported voluntarily from a population of unknown si ze, estimates of frequency cannot be made. 
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. 
 Body as a Whole:  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.7)].  
 Endocrine and Metabolic:  Hyperglycemia. 
 General:  Weakness. 
 Hemic and Lymphatic:  Anemia (including pure red ce ll aplasia and severe anemias 
progressing on therapy). 
 Hepatic and Pancreatic:  Lactic acidosis and hepatic  steatosis, posttreatment 
exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. 
 10
 Hypersensitivity:  Anaphylaxis, urticaria. 
 Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. 
 Skin:  Alopecia, pruritus. 
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. 
The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered c oncurrently should be considered, 
particularly when their main route of eliminati on is active renal secretio n via the organic cationic 
transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data ar e available regarding in teractions with other 
drugs that have renal clearance mechan isms similar to that of lamivudine. 
7.1 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens 
 Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of 
HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with 
lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has 
occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infect ed patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for 
HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
7.2 Zalcitabine 
 Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphoryla tion of one another. 
Therefore, use of lamivudine in combin ation with zalcitabine is not recommended. 
7.3 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 
 No change in dose of either drug is recomm ended. There is no information regarding the 
effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher dos es of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat 
PCP. 
7.4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions With EPIVIR 
 A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between EPIVIR and zidovudine. 
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
8.1 Pregnancy 
 Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate  and well-controlled studies of EPIVIR in 
pregnant women. Animal reproduc tion studies in rats and rabb its revealed no evidence of 
teratogenicity. Increased early em bryolethality occurred in rabbits at exposure levels similar to 
those in humans. EPIVIR should be used during pr egnancy only if the pote ntial benefit justifies 
the potential risk to the fetus. 
 Lamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical studies 
conducted in South Africa. The study assesse d pharmacokinetics in: 16 women at 36 weeks 
gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, 10 women at 38 weeks gestation 
using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, and 10 women at 38 weeks gestation using lamivudine 300 mg twice daily without othe r antiretrovirals. These studies were not 
designed or powered to provide efficacy inform ation. Lamivudine pharmacokinetics in pregnant 
 11
women were similar to those seen in non-pregnant adults and in postpartum women. Lamivudine 
concentrations were generally similar in maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord serum samples. 
In a subset of subjects, lamivudine amniotic fl uid specimens were collected following natural 
rupture of membranes. Amniotic fluid concentrations of lamivudine were typically 2 times 
greater than maternal serum levels and ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 mcg/mL (150 mg twice daily) and 
2.1 to 5.2 mcg/mL (300 mg twice daily). It is  not known whether risks of adverse events 
associated with lamivudine are altered in pregna nt women compared with other HIV-1-infected 
patients. 
 Animal reproduction studies performed at oral doses up to 130 and 60 times the adult dose in rats and rabbits, respectiv ely, revealed no evidence of te ratogenicity due to lamivudine. 
Increased early embryolethality occurred in rabbits at exposure levels similar to those in humans. 
However, there was no indication of this effect in rats at exposure levels up to 35 times those in 
humans. Based on animal studies, lamivudine crosses the placenta and is transferred to the fetus 
[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].  
 Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry:  To monitor maternal-fetal  outcomes of pregnant 
women exposed to lamivudine, a Pregnancy Regi stry has been established. Physicians are 
encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263. 
8.3 Nursing Mothers 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers 
in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal  transmission of HIV-1 
infection. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants and HIV-1 
transmission, mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving lamivudine. 
 Lamivudine is excreted into human mil k. Samples of breast milk obtained from 
20 mothers receiving lamivudine monotherapy (300 mg twice daily) or combination therapy 
(150 mg lamivudine twice daily and 300 mg  zidovudine twice daily) had measurable 
concentrations of lamivudine. 
8.4 Pediatric Use 
 The safety and effectiveness of twice- daily EPIVIR in combination with other 
antiretroviral agents have been established in pediatric patients 3 months and older [see Adverse 
Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacol ogy (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)] . 
8.5 Geriatric Use 
 Clinical studies of EPIVIR  did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and 
over to determine whether they respond differen tly from younger subjects. In general, dose 
selection for an elderly patient should be cautiou s, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased 
hepatic, renal, or cardiac f unction, and of concomitant diseas e or other drug therapy. In 
particular, because lamivudine is substantially excreted by the kidney and elderly patients are 
more likely to have decreased renal function, renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
8.6 Patients With Impaired Renal Function 
 12
 Reduction of the dosage of EPIVIR is reco mmended for patients with impaired renal 
function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
10 OVERDOSAGE 
 There is no known antidote for EPIVIR. One cas e of an adult ingesting 6 g of EPIVIR 
was reported; there were no clinical signs or symptoms noted and hematologic tests remained 
normal. Two cases of pediatric overdose were  reported in Study ACTG 300. One case involved a 
single dose of 7 mg/kg of  EPIVIR; the second case involved use of 5 mg/kg of EPIVIR twice 
daily for 30 days. There were no clinical signs or symptoms noted in either case. Because a 
negligible amount of lamivudine was removed vi a (4-hour) hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory 
peritoneal dialysis, and automated peritoneal dial ysis, it is not known if continuous hemodialysis 
would provide clinical benefit in a lamivudine overdose event. If overdose occurs, the patient 
should be monitored, and standard suppor tive treatment applied as required. 
11 DESCRIPTION 
 EPIVIR (also known as 3TC) is a brand name for lamivudine, a synthetic nucleoside 
analogue with activity against HIV-1 and HBV. Th e chemical name of lamivudine is (2R,cis)-4-
amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl)- (1H)-pyrimidin-2-one. Lamivudine is the 
(-)enantiomer of a dideoxy analogue of cytidine. Lamivudine has also been referred to as (-)2 ′,3′-
dideoxy, 3 ′-thiacytidine. It has a molecular formula of C 8H11N3O3S and a molecular weight of 
229.3. It has the following structural formula: 
 
 Lamivudine is a white to off-white crystallin e solid with a solubili ty of approximately 
70 mg/mL in water at 20°C. 
 EPIVIR Tablets are for oral administrati on. Each scored 150-mg film-coated tablet 
contains 150 mg of lamivudine and the inactive ingredients hypromellose, magnesium stearate, 
microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, sodium starch glycolate, and 
titanium dioxide. 
 Each 300-mg film-coated tablet contai ns 300 mg of lamivudine and the inactive

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
12.1 Mechanism of Action 
 Lamivudine is an antiviral agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
 Pharmacokinetics in Adults:  The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been 
studied in asymptomatic, HIV-1-in fected adult patients after administration of single intravenous 
(IV) doses ranging from 0.25 to 8 mg/kg, as well as  single and multiple (twice-daily regimen) 
oral doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. 
 The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine  have also been st udied as single and 
multiple oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 600 mg/d ay administered to HBV-infected patients. 
 The steady-state pharmacokinetic properties of the EPIVIR 300-mg tablet once daily for 
7 days compared with the EPIVIR 150-mg tablet  twice daily for 7 days were assessed in a 
crossover study in 60 healthy vo lunteers. EPIVIR 300 mg once daily resulted in lamivudine 
exposures that were similar to EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily with respect to plasma AUC 24,ss; 
however, C max,ss was 66% higher and the trough value was 53% lower compared with the 
150-mg twice-daily regimen. Intracellular lamivudine  triphosphate exposures in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells were also similar with respect to AUC 24,ss and C max24,ss ; however, trough 
values were lower compared with the 150-mg tw ice-daily regimen. Inter-subject variability was 
greater for intracellular lamivudi ne triphosphate concentrations versus lamivudine plasma trough 
concentrations. The clinical si gnificance of observed differen ces for both plasma lamivudine 
concentrations and intracellu lar lamivudine triphosphate concentrations is not known. 
  Absorption and Bioavailability:  Lamivudine was rapidly absorbed after oral 
administration in HIV-1-infected patients. Abso lute bioavailability in 12 adult patients was 
86% ±  16% (mean ± SD) for the 150-mg tablet and 87% ± 13% for the oral solution. After oral 
administration of 2 mg/kg twice a day to 9 adults with HIV-1, the peak serum lamivudine concentration (C
max) was 1.5 ± 0.5 mcg/mL (mean ± SD). The area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve (AUC) and C max increased in proportion to oral dose over the 
range from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. 
 The accumulation ratio of lamivudine in HIV-1-positive asymptomatic adults with 
normal renal function was 1.50 following 15 days of oral administration of 2 mg/kg twice daily. 
   Effects of Food on Oral Absorption:  An investigational 25-mg dosage form of 
lamivudine was administered orally to 12 asympt omatic, HIV-1-infected patients on 2 occasions, 
once in the fasted state and once with food ( 1,099 kcal; 75 grams fat, 34 grams protein, 72 grams 
carbohydrate). Absorption of lamivudine was slower in the fed state (T max: 3.2 ± 1.3 hours) 
compared with the fasted state (T max: 0.9 ± 0.3 hours); C max in the fed state was 40% ± 23% 
(mean ± SD) lower than in the fasted state. There was no significant difference in systemic 
 14
exposure (AUC ∞) in the fed and fasted states; therefore, EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution may 
be administered with or without food. 
  Distribution:  The apparent volume of distribut ion after IV administration of 
lamivudine to 20 patients was 1.3 ± 0.4 L/kg, suggesting that la mivudine distributes into 
extravascular spaces. Volume of distribution was independent of dose and did not correlate with 
body weight. 
 Binding of lamivudine to human plasma protei ns is low (<36%). In vitro studies showed 
that over the concentration range of 0.1 to 100 mcg/mL, the amount of lamivudine associated 
with erythrocytes ranged from 53% to 57%  and was independent of concentration. 
  Metabolism:  Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor  route of elimination. In man, the 
only known metabolite of lamivudine is the trans- sulfoxide metabolite. Within 12 hours after a 
single oral dose of lamivudine in 6 HIV-1-infected adults, 5.2% ± 1.4% (mean ± SD) of the dose 
was excreted as the trans-sulfoxide metabolite in the urine. Serum concentrations of this 
metabolite have not been determined. 
  Elimination:  The majority of lamivudine is e liminated unchanged in urine by active 
organic cationic secretion. In 9 healthy subjects given a single 300-mg oral dose of lamivudine, 
renal clearance was 199.7 ± 56.9 mL/min (mean ± SD). In 20 HIV-1-infected patients given a 
single IV dose, renal clearance was 280.4 ± 75.2 mL/min (mean ± SD), representing 71% ± 16% 
(mean ± SD) of total clearance of lamivudine. 
 In most single-dose studies in HIV-1-infected  patients, HBV-infected patients, or healthy 
subjects with serum sampling for 24 hours after do sing, the observed mean elimination half-life 
(t½) ranged from 5 to 7 hours. In HIV-1- infected patients, total clearance was 
398.5 ±  69.1 mL/min (mean ± SD). Oral clearance and eliminati on half-life were independent of 
dose and body weight over an oral dosing range of 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. 
 Special Populations:  Renal Impairment:  The pharmacokinetic properties of 
lamivudine have been determined in a small group of HIV-1-infected adults  with impaired renal 
function (Table 7).

 Exposure (AUC ∞), C max, and half-life increas ed with diminishing renal function (as

expressed by creatinine clearance) . Apparent total oral clearance (Cl/F) of lamivudine decreased 
as creatinine clearance decreased. T max was not significantly affected  by renal function. Based on 
these observations, it is recommended that the dosage of lamivudine be modified in patients with 
renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 
 Based on a study in otherwise healthy subjects with impaired renal function, 
hemodialysis increased lamivudine clearance fr om a mean of 64 to 88 mL/min; however, the 
length of time of hemodialysis (4 hours) was insufficient to significantly  alter mean lamivudine 
exposure after a single-dose ad ministration. Continuous ambulato ry peritoneal dialysis and 
automated peritoneal dialysis have negligible effects on lamivudine clearance. Therefore, it is 
recommended, following correction of dose for creatinine clearance, that no additional dose 
modification be made after routine he modialysis or peri toneal dialysis. 
 It is not known whether lamivudine can be removed by continuous (24-hour) 
hemodialysis. 
 The effects of renal impairment on lamivudine  pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients are 
not known. 
  Hepatic Impairment:  The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been 
determined in adults with impaired hepatic function. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not 
altered by diminishing hepatic func tion; therefore, no dose adjustme nt for lamivudine is required 
for patients with impaired hepatic function. Safe ty and efficacy of lamivudine have not been 
established in the presence of decompensated liver disease. 
  Pediatric Patients:  In Study NUCA2002, pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine 
were assessed in a subset of 57 HIV-1-infected  pediatric patients (age range: 4.8 months to 
16 years, weight range: 5 to 66 kg) after oral  and IV administration of 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 
20 mg/kg/day. In the 9 infants and children (range : 5 months to 12 years of age) receiving oral 
solution 4 mg/kg twice daily (the usual recomme nded pediatric dose), absolute bioavailability 
was 66% ±  26% (mean ± SD), which was less than the 86% ± 16% (mean ±  SD) observed in 
adults. The mechanism for the diminished absolute  bioavailability of lamivudine in infants and 
children is unknown. 
 Systemic clearance decreased with increasi ng age in pediatric pa tients, as shown in 
Figure 1. 
 
 16
Figure 1. Systemic Clearance (L/hr•kg) of Lamivudine in Relation to Age 
 
 
 After oral administration of lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily to 11 pediatric patients 
ranging from 4 months to 14 years of age, C max was 1.1 ± 0.6 mcg/mL and half-life was 
2.0 ±  0.6 hours. (In adults with simila r blood sampling, the half-life was 3.7 ± 1 hours.) Total 
exposure to lamivudine, as reflected by mean AU C values, was comparable between pediatric 
patients receiving an 8-mg/kg/day dose and adults receiving a 4-mg/kg/day dose. 
 Distribution of lamivudine into cerebrospina l fluid (CSF) was assessed in 38 pediatric 
patients after multiple oral dosing with lamivudi ne. CSF samples were collected between 2 and 
4 hours postdose. At the dose of 8 mg/kg/day, CSF lamivudine concentrations in 8 patients 
ranged from 5.6% to 30.9% (mean ± SD of 14.2% ± 7.9%) of the concentration in a 
simultaneous serum sample, with CSF lamivudine concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 
0.3 mcg/mL. 
 Limited, uncontrolled pharmacokinetic and safe ty data are available from administration 
of lamivudine (and zidovudine) to 36 infants up to 1 week of age in 2 studies in South Africa. In 
these studies, lamivudine clearance was substantially  reduced in 1-week-old neonates relative to 
pediatric patients (>3 months of age) studied previously. There is insufficient information to 
establish the time course of changes in clearance between the immediate neonatal period and the 
age-ranges >3 months old [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 
  Geriatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of lamivudi ne after administration of 
EPIVIR to patients over 65 years of age have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations 
(8.5)] . 
  Gender:  There are no significant gender differe nces in lamivudine pharmacokinetics. 
  Race:  There are no significant racial diffe rences in lamivudine pharmacokinetics. 
 Drug Interactions:  Interferon Alfa:  There was no significant pharmacokinetic 
interaction between lamivudine and interferon al fa in a study of 19 healthy male subjects [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . 
 17
  Ribavirin:  In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, 
stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacoki netic (e.g., plasma concentrations or 
intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite  concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss 
of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interactio n was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine 
(n = 18), stavudine (n = 10), or zidovudine (n = 6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug 
regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . 
  Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole: Lamivudine and TMP/SMX were coadministered 
to 14 HIV-1-positive patients in a single-cente r, open-label, randomize d, crossover study. Each 
patient received treatment with a single 300-mg dose of lamivudine and TMP 160 mg/SMX 
800 mg once a day for 5 days with concomitant administration of lamivudine 300 mg with the 
fifth dose in a crossover design. Coadministration of TMP/SMX w ith lamivudine resulted in an 
increase of 43% ± 23% (mean ± SD) in lamivudine AUC ∞, a decrease of 29% ± 13% in 
lamivudine oral clearance,  and a decrease of 30% ± 36% in lamivudine renal clearance. The 
pharmacokinetic properties of TMP and SMX were not altered by coadministration with 
lamivudine [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] . 
  Zidovudine:  No clinically signi ficant alterations in lamivudine or zidovudine 
pharmacokinetics were observed in 12 asymptoma tic HIV-1-infected ad ult patients given a 
single dose of zidovudine (200 mg) in combination with multiple doses of lamivudine (300 mg q 
12 hr) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . 
12.4 Microbiology 
 Mechanism of Action:  Intracellularly, lamivudine is  phosphorylated to its active 
5′-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudi ne triphosphate (3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of 
3TC-TP is the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse tran scriptase (RT) via DNA ch ain termination after 
incorporation of the nucleotide analogue into viral DNA. 3TC-TP is a weak inhibitor of 
mammalian DNA polymerases α, β , and γ. 
 Antiviral Activity:  The antiviral activity of lamivudine  against HIV-1 was assessed in a 
number of cell lines (including monocytes and fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes) using 
standard susceptibility assays. EC 50 values (50% effective concentrations) were in the range of 
0.003 to 15 µM (1 μM = 0.23 mcg/mL). HIV-1 from therapy- naive subjects with no amino acid 
substitutions associated with  resistance gave median EC 50 values of 0.429 µM (range: 0.200 to 
2.007 µM) from Virco (n = 92 baseline sa mples from COLA40263) and 2.35 µM (1.37 to 
3.68 µM) from Monogram Biosciences (n = 135  baseline samples from ESS30009). The EC 50 
values of lamivudine against different HIV-1 clades (A-G) ranged from 0.001 to 0.120 µM, and against HIV-2 isolates from 0.003 to 0.120 μM in peripheral blood monon uclear cells. Ribavirin 
(50 μ M) decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5 fold in MT-4 cells. In 
HIV-1-infected MT-4 cells, lamivudine in co mbination with zidovudine  at various ratios 
exhibited synergistic antiretroviral activity. Pl ease see the full prescribing information for 
EPIVIR-HBV for information re garding the inhibito ry activity of lami vudine against HBV. 
 Resistance:  Lamivudine-resistant variants of HIV-1 have been selected in cell culture. 
Genotypic analysis showed that the resistance was due to a specific amino acid substitution in 
 18
the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase at codon 184 cha nging the methionine to either isoleucine or 
valine (M184V/I). 
 HIV-1 strains resist ant to both lamivudine and zidovudine have been isolated from 
patients. Susceptibility of clinical isolates  to lamivudine and zidovudine was monitored in 
controlled clinical trials. In patients receivi ng lamivudine monotherapy or combination therapy 
with lamivudine plus zidovudine, HIV-1 isolates from most pa tients became phenotypically and 
genotypically resistant to lamivudine within 12 weeks. In some patients harboring 
zidovudine-resistant virus at ba seline, phenotypic sensitivity to zidovudine was restored by 
12 weeks of treatment with lamivudine and zi dovudine. Combination therapy with lamivudine 
plus zidovudine delayed the emergence of mu tations conferring resistance to zidovudine. 
 Lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates develop substitutions (rtM204V/I) in the YMDD 
motif of the catalytic domain of  the viral reverse transcriptas e. rtM204V/I substitutions are 
frequently accompanied by other substitutions (rtV173L, rtL180M) which enhance the level of 
lamivudine resistance or act as compensatory mu tations improving replication efficiency. Other 
substitutions detected in lamivudi ne-resistant HBV isolates include: rtL80I and rtA181T. Similar 
HBV mutants have been reported in HI V-1-infected patients who received 
lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concu rrent infection with 
hepatitis B virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 
 Cross-Resistance:  Lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 mutant s were cross-resistant to 
didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC). In some patients treated with zi dovudine plus didanosine 
or zalcitabine, isolates resistant to multiple reve rse transcriptase inhibitors, including lamivudine, 
have emerged. 
 Genotypic and Phenotypic Analysis of On-Therapy HIV-1 Isolates From Patients 
With Virologic Failure:  Study EPV20001:  Fifty-three of 554 (10%) patients enrolled in 
EPV20001 were identified as virological failures (plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥400 copies/mL) by 
Week 48. Twenty-eight patients were randomized to the lamivudine once-daily treatment group and 25 to the lamivudine twice-daily treatment group. The median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA 
levels of patients in the lamivudine once-da ily group and lamivudine tw ice-daily group were 
4.9 log
10 copies/mL and 4.6 log 10 copies/mL, respectively. 
 Genotypic analysis of on-therapy isolates from  22 patients identified as virologic failures 
in the lamivudine once-daily group showed th at isolates from 0/ 22 patients contained 
treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions as sociated with zidovudine resistance (M41L, 
D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E), isolates from 10/22 patients contained 
treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions associ ated with efavirenz re sistance (L100I, K101E, 
K103N, V108I, or Y181C), and isolates from 8/22 patients contained a treatment-emergent 
lamivudine resistance-associated substitution (M184I or M184V). 
 Genotypic analysis of on-therapy isolates from patients (n = 22) in the lamivudine 
twice-daily treatment group showed that  isolates from 1/22 patients contained 
treatment-emergent zidovudine resistance subs titutions, isolates from 7/22 contained 
treatment-emergent efavirenz resistance subs titutions, and isolates  from 5/22 contained 
 19
treatment-emergent lamivudine  resistance substitutions. 
 Phenotypic analysis of baseline-matched  on-therapy HIV-1 isol ates from patients 
(n = 13) receiving lamivudine once daily show ed that isolates fr om 12/13 patients were 
susceptible to zidovudine; isolates  from 8/13 patients exhibited a 25- to 295-fold decrease in 
susceptibility to efavirenz, and isolates from 7/13 patients showed an 85- to 299-fold decrease in 
susceptibility to lamivudine. 
 Phenotypic analysis of baseline-matched  on-therapy HIV-1 isol ates from patients 
(n = 13) receiving lamivudine twice daily showed  that isolates from all 13 patients were 
susceptible to zidovudine; isolates  from 3/13 patients exhibited a 21- to 342-fold decrease in 
susceptibility to efavirenz, and isolates from 4/13  patients exhibited a 29- to 159-fold decrease in 
susceptibility to lamivudine. 
  Study EPV40001:  Fifty patients received zidovudine 300 mg twice daily plus 
abacavir 300 mg twice daily plus lamivudine  300 mg once daily and 50 patients received 
zidovudine 300 mg plus abacavir 300 mg plus la mivudine 150 mg all twice daily. The median 
baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels for patients in the 2 groups were 4.79 log 10 copies/mL and 
4.83 log 10 copies/mL, respectively. Fourteen of 50 patients in the lamivudine once-daily 
treatment group and 9 of 50 patients in the la mivudine twice-daily gr oup were identified as 
virologic failures. 
 Genotypic analysis of on-thera py HIV-1 isolates from patient s (n = 9) in the lamivudine 
once-daily treatment group showed that isolates from 6 patients had an abacavir and/or lamivudine resistance-associated substitution M1 84V alone. On-therapy isolates from patients 
(n = 6) receiving lamivudine twice daily showed that isolates from 2 patients had M184V alone, 
and isolates from 2 patients harbored the M184V  substitution in combination with zidovudine 
resistance-associated amino acid substitutions. 
 Phenotypic analysis of on-th erapy isolates from patients (n = 6) receiving lamivudine 
once daily showed that HIV-1 isolates from 4 patients exhibited a 32- to 53-fold decrease in 
susceptibility to lamivudine. HIV-1 isolates from these 6 patients were susceptible to zidovudine. 
 Phenotypic analysis of on-th erapy isolates from patients (n = 4) receiving lamivudine 
twice daily showed that HIV-1 isolates from  1 patient exhibited a 45-fold decrease in 
susceptibility to lamivudine and a 4.5-fold decrease in susceptibility to zidovudine. 
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesi s, Impairment of Fertility 
 Long-term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in mice and rats showed no evidence 
of carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 10 times  (mice) and 58 times (rats) those observed in 
humans at the recommended therapeutic dose fo r HIV-1 infection. Lamivudine was not active in 
a microbial mutagenicity screen or an in vi tro cell transformation assay, but showed weak 
in vitro mutagenic activity in a cytogenetic assa y using cultured human lymphocytes and in the 
mouse lymphoma assay. However, lamivudine show ed no evidence of in vivo genotoxic activity 
in the rat at oral doses of up to 2,000 mg/kg, produc ing plasma levels of 35 to 45 times those in 
 20
humans at the recommended dose for HIV-1 inf ection. In a study of reproductive performance, 
lamivudine administered to rats at doses up to  4,000 mg/kg/day, producing plasma levels 47 to 
70 times those in humans, revealed no evidence of impaired fertility and no effect on the 
survival, growth, and development to weaning of the offspring. 
13.2 Reproductive Toxicology Studies 
 Reproduction studies have been performed in ra ts and rabbits at orally administered doses 
up to 4,000 mg/kg/day and 1,000 mg/kg/day, resp ectively, producing plasma levels up to 
approximately 35 times that for the adult HIV dose. No evidence of teratogenicity due to 
lamivudine was observed. Evidence of early embryol ethality was seen in the rabbit at exposure 
levels similar to those observed in humans, but there was no indicati on of this effect in the rat at 
exposure levels up to 35 times those in humans. Studi es in pregnant rats an d rabbits showed that 
lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 
 The use of EPIVIR is based on the results of cl inical studies in HIV-1-infected patients in 
combination regimens with other antiretroviral agents. Information from trials with clinical endpoints or a combination of CD4+ cell count s and HIV-1 RNA measurements is included 
below as documentation of the contribution of lamivudine to a combination regimen in 
controlled trials. 
14.1 Adults 
 Clinical Endpoint Study:  NUCB3007 (CAESAR) was a multi-center, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study comparing continued current therapy (zidovudine alone [62% of 
patients] or zidovudine with dida nosine or zalcitabine [38% of  patients]) to the addition of 
EPIVIR or EPIVIR plus an investigational non-nuc leoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI), randomized 1:2:1. A total of 1,816 HIV-1-infected adults with 25 to 
250 CD4+ cells/mm3 (median = 122 cells/mm3) at baseline were enrolled: median age was 
36 years, 87% were male, 84% were nucleoside- experienced, and 16% were therapy-naive. The 
median duration on study was 12 months. Results are summarized in Table 8.

 Surrogate Endpoint Studies:  Dual Nucleoside Analogue Studies:  Principal clinical 
trials in the initial developm ent of lamivudine compared lamivudine/zidovudine combinations 
with zidovudine monotherapy or with zidovudine pl us zalcitabine. These studies demonstrated 
the antiviral effect of lamivudine  in a 2-drug combination. More recent uses of lamivudine in 
treatment of HIV-1 infection incorporate it in to multiple-drug regimens containing at least 
3 antiretroviral drugs for e nhanced viral suppression. 
  Dose Regimen Comparison Surrogate E ndpoint Studies in Therapy-Naive 
Adults: EPV20001 was a multi-center, double-blind, cont rolled study in which patients were 
randomized 1:1 to receive EPIVIR 300 mg once daily or EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily, in 
combination with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily  and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. A total of 
554 antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1-infected adults enrolled: male (79%), Caucasian (50%), 
median age of 35 years, baseline CD 4+ cell counts of 69 to 1,089 cells/mm3 
(median = 362 cells/mm3), and median baseline pl asma HIV-1 RNA of 4.66 log 10 copies/mL. 
Outcomes of treatment through 48 weeks are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 9.

 The proportions of patients with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (via Roche Ultrasensitive 
assay) through Week 48 were 61% for patients receiving EPIVIR 300 mg once daily and 63% 
for patients receiving EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily. Median increas es in CD4+ cell counts were 
144 cells/mm3 at Week 48 in patients receiving EP IVIR 300 mg once daily and 146 cells/mm3 for 
patients receiving EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily. 
 A small, randomized, open-label pilo t study, EPV40001, was conducted in Thailand. A 
total of 159 treatment-naive adult patients (male 32%, Asian 100%, median age 30 years, 
baseline median CD4+ cell count 380 cells/mm3, median plasma HIV-1 RNA 
4.8 log 10 copies/mL) were enrolled. Two of the tr eatment arms in this study provided a 
comparison between lamivudine 300 mg once daily (n = 54) and lamivudine 150 mg twice daily 
(n = 52), each in combination with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily a nd abacavir 300 mg twice 
daily. In intent-to-treat analys es of 48-week data, the proporti ons of patients with HIV-1 RNA 
below 400 copies/mL were 61% (33/54) in the group randomized to once-daily lamivudine and 
75% (39/52) in the group randomized to receiv e all 3 drugs twice daily ; the proportions with 
HIV-1 RNA below 50 copies/mL were 54% (29/54)  in the once-daily lamivudine group and 67% 
(35/52) in the all-twice-daily  group; and the median increases in CD4+ cell counts were 
166 cells/mm3 in the once-daily lamivudi ne group and 216 cells/mm3 in the all-twice-daily 
group. 
14.2 Pediatric Patients 
 Clinical Endpoint Study:  ACTG300 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind study 
that provided for comparison of EPIVIR pl us RETROVIR (zidovudine ) with didanosine 
monotherapy. A total of 471 symptomatic , HIV-1-infected therapy-naive ( ≤56 days of 
 23
antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients were enrolled in these 2 treatment arms. The median age 
was 2.7 years (range: 6 weeks to 14 years), 58% were female, a nd 86% were non-Caucasian. The 
mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 868 cells/mm3 (mean: 1,060 cells/mm3 and range: 0 to 
4,650 cells/mm3 for patients ≤5 years of age; mean: 419 cells/mm3 and range: 0 to 
1,555 cells/mm3 for patients >5 years of age) and th e mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 
5.0 log 10 copies/mL. The median duration on study was 10.1 months for the patients receiving 
EPIVIR plus RETROVIR and 9.2 months for patients rece iving didanosine monotherapy. 
Results are summarized in Table 10.

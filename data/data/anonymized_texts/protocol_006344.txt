Terms Definition of terms
Baseline 1) Observed values/findings which are regarded as calibrated zero status in the 
present study, 2) Time when ‘Baseline ’is observed .
Discontinuation The act of concluding participation, prior to completion of all protocol -
required elements, in a trial by an enrolled subject . Four categories of 
discontinuation are distinguished: a) dropout: Active discontinuation by a 
subject (also a noun referring to such a discontinued subject); b) investigator -
initiated discontinuation (e.g., for cause); c) loss to follo w-up: cessation of 
participation without notice or action by the subject; d) sponsor -initiated 
discontinuation. Note that subject discontinuation does not necessarily imply 
exclusion of subject data from analysis. “Termination” has a history of 
synonymous use, but is now considered non- standard.
Enroll To register or enter into a clinical study ; transitive and intransitive.  Informed 
consent precedes enrollment, which precedes or is contemporaneous with 
treatment allocation.
End of study The end of study for this protocol is defined as Last Subject’s Last Visit.
Investigational 
PeriodPeriod of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed, and 
where the study drug or comparative drug is given to a subject, and continues 
until the last assessment after completing administration of the study drug or 
comparative drug .
Screening 1) Process for retrieving candidates for the study. 2) Process for checking the 
eligibility of subjects done prior to the investigational period.
Study Drug Agents given as part of a clinical trial. In this study, MDV3100 is the study 
drug.
Study Period Period of time beginning with the first subject consented through to the last 
observation collected for the study.
Subject An individual who participates in a clinical trial, either as a recipient of the 
investigational product(s) or as a control.
Variable Any quantity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

Title of Study APhase 2 Open -Label Extension Study to Assess the Safety of Continued 
Administration of MDV3100 in Subjects with Prostate Cancer who Showed 
Benefit from Prior Exposure to MDV3100 [ISN 9785 -CL-0121]
Planned Study 
PeriodFrom 3Q2011 to 1Q2017
Study O bjective (s) Primary Objective:
To follow up the long -term s afety of continued administration of MDV3100 in 
prostate cancer subject swho were enrolled and completed MDV3100 
treatment period in a prior study with MDV3100 .
Planned T otal 
Number of S tudy 
Centers and 
LocationThose sites that currently have subject s actively enrolled and completed 
MDV3100 treatment in a prior study with MDV3100 may participate.  
Design and 
MethodologyThis is a multi -center phase 2 open -label extension study in subject s with 
prostate cancer who have completed MDV3100 treatment in a previous study 
with MDV3100 to assess the long-term safety of continued administration of 
MDV3100 , when judged by the investigator to be in the best interest of the 
subject.
For the study duration, all subjects with castrat ion-resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC) will have to maintain androgen deprivation with an LHRH 
agonist/antagonist unless they underw entbilateral orchiectomy .
Subjects will be discontinued from study drug when continued administration 
of study drug is deemed to be not in the subject’s best interest by the 
investigator based on clinical assessment .
Throughout the study, safety and tolerability will be assessed by the recording 
of adverse events, monitoring of vital signs and physical examinations, safety 
laboratory evaluations, and 12
-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs).  
Subjects that have not met any o f the discontinuation criteria as outlined in 
Section 3.4 may be eligible to continue to receive treatment with enzalutamide 
in Study  upon approval an d activation of this study at the 
participating institution. Subjects who enroll in Study  will not 
be required to have a safety follow -up visit.
Subjects who choose not to participate or are not eligible for Study 
 will complete th eir participation in Study 9785- CL-0121 by completing 
the safety follow -up visit upon activation of Study  at the 
institution.
Number of 
Subjects PlannedSubjects who were actively enrolled and have completed MDV3100 treatment 
in a previous study with MDV3100 may be eligible to participate in this study
when continuation of MDV3100 is deemed by the investigator in the best 
interest of the subject s.

Reference Therapy
Dose:Not applicable
Concomitant 
Medication The following medications are prohibited while the subject is continuing on 
study drug:
Concomitant medication that likely could cause clinical lyrelevant drug -to-
drug interactions with MDV3100
Other than MDV3100 AR antagonists (bicalutamide, flutamide, 
nilutamide)
Investigational therapy other than MDV3100 or investigational procedures 
of any kind. 
When applicable, t he following medications should be maintained during the 
investigational period at the same dosage and schedule :
LHRH agonist/antagonist .
Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) increased 
the composite AUC0 -inf of MDV3100 plus its active metabolite in healthy 
volunteers; therefore, co- administration of MDV3100 with strong CYP2C8 
inhibitors should be avoided, if pos sible. 
The effects of CYP2C8 inducers on the PK of MDV3100 have not been 
evaluated in vivo. Co -administration of MDV3100 with strong or moderate 
CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease the plasma exposure of 
MDV3100 and should be avoided if possible. Selection of a concomitant 
medication with no or minimal CYP2C8 induction potential is recommended.
Co-administration of MDV3100 with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine) may 
decrease th e plasma exposure of MDV3100 and should be avoided , ifpossible.

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4Selection of a concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4 induction 
potential is recommended. Moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, 
efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) and St John’s Wort may also reduce 
the plasma exposure of MDV3100 and should be avoided, if possible .
MDV3100 is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19 inducer in humans. Concomitant use of MDV3100 with narrow 
therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, 
cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, 
sirolimus and tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin) and CYP2C19 
(e.g., S -mephenytoin) should be avoided, as MDV3100 may decrease their 
exposure. If co- administration with warfarin cannot be avoided, conduct 
additional INR monitoring .
Primary Variable Safety parameters include clinical laboratory test, 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, 
physical examination and adverse events (AEs) .

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 41 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
Enzalutamide is approved in the US, Canada and EU for patients with metastatic CRPC who
have previousl y received docetaxel.   Enzalutamide (formerl y MDV3100) is an androgen 
receptor (AR) inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the AR signaling pa thway . Enzalutamide 
competitively  inhibits binding of androgens to ARs, inhibits nuclear translocation of receptors
and inhibits the association of the AR with DNA even in the setting of AR over expression and 
in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti -androgens. By  inhibiting AR signaling, enzalutamide 
elicits several downstream effects, which include reduced expression of AR -dependent genes, 
decreased growth of prostate cancer cells, induction of cancer cell death, and tumor regression.
Enzalutamide lacks agonist activities such as those that may  limit the sustained efficacy  of 
current anti -androgens.
The 9785- CL-0121 study is an extension to the preceding MDV3100 studiesoffering patients a 
possibility  to continue MDV3100 medication if deemed as being of benefit to the patient by  the 
investigator. The main objective of this study  is to follow up the long -term safet y of continued 
administration of MDV3100 in prostate cancer subjects who were enrolled and completed 
MDV3100 treatment period in prior (e.g., ph ase 1) studies.
1.2 Non-clinical and Clinical Data
1.2.1 Non-clinical Data
In mice, rats, and dogs, oral MDV3100 had a half -life (t 1/2) of approximately 0.25 to 3 days. 
The t 1/2did not appear to be affected b y the dose size; however, the bioavailability  appeared to 
decrease with increasing dose size . Plasma protein binding of MDV3100 in human plasma 
ranged from 97.2% to97.8% and was similar in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. In vitro drug 
metabolism studies suggest that MDV3100 undergoes very  slow rates of metabolism. In vitro 
drug metabolism studies suggest that MDV3100 may  have the potential to induce cy tochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4 and to directly  inhibit CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. I n 
consideration of time -dependent inhibition data, a metabolite of MDV3100 may  inhibit 
CYP1A2 [Investigator’s Brochure ].
1.2.2 Clinical Data
A clinical drug -drug interaction study  in 41healthy  volunteers (9785- CL-0006) revealed that 
CYP2C8 play s an important role in the elimination of MDV3100 and the formation of the 
active metabolite . Following oral administration of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil 
(600 mg twice dail y) to healthy male subjects the AUC of MDV3100 increased 4.26 -fold, 
while Cm ax decreased by 18%; the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite decreased b y 25% 
and 44% respectivel y. CYP3A4 play s a minor role in the metabolism of MDV3100 . Following 
oral administration of CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily ), the AUC of 
MDV 3100 increased b y 1.41-fold while the Cmax was essentially  unaffected (decreased b y
2%); the AUC of the active metabolite increased 1.21 -fold while the C maxdecreased b y 14%.

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4A clinical drug -drug interaction study  in 14patients with castration resistant prostate cancer 
(9785 -CL-0007 )indicated that MDV3100 (160 mg once dail y to stead y state) has no 
clinically  relevant effect on CYP2C8, is a moderate inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C19, and 
is a strong inducer of CYP3A4, base d on changes in plasma AUC0- inf for single doses of the 
sensitive substrates pioglitazone, S -warfarin, omeprazole and midazolam respectivel y.
The PK of MDV3100 were examined in subjects with baseline mile (n=6) or moderate (n=8) 
hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A and B, respectively ) and in 14 matched control 
subjects with normal hepatic function (9785 -CL-0009). Following a single 160 mg dose of 
MDV3100 , exposure parameters of MDV3100 increased b y approximately 24% and 29% in 
subject with mild and moder ate hepatic impairment, respectivel y, compared to healthy control 
subjects. Hepatic impairment had similar minimal effects on the exposure parameters of the 
active metabolite .
A total of 1199 subjects were enrolled in a phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo-
controlled study  in patients with progressive castration resistant prostate cancer previously  
treatment with docetaxel -based chemotherap y (CRPC2/AFFIRM). The protocol pre -specified 
interim analysis after 520 deaths showed a statistically  significant superiority  in overall 
survival in patients treated with MDV3100 compared to placebo. Interim data revealed that the 
estimated median overall survival in man who had received MDV3100 was ab out 18.4 months 
compared with 13.6 months for the placebo group. An overall survival difference of 4.8 
months and a 37% reduction of risk of death were observed. This benefit was sufficientl y 
compelling to stop the patient study  early  and switch men who had taken placebo over to 
MDV3100 .
Please see the most current vers ion of the IB for additional details.
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
More than 4900 subjects and patients have been enrolled worldwide in completed and 
ongoing clinical trials evaluating enzalutamide of whom, approximately  3200 received at 
least 1 dose of enzalutamide (MDV3100).
In the phase 3 study  CRPC2 (AFFI RM; N =1199), a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo- controlled, efficacy  and safet y stud y of enzalutamide (160 mg daily ) in patients with 
progressive CRPC previously  treated with docetaxel-based chemotherap y, the most common 
adverse drug reactions (³ 5%) in patients treated with enzalutamide (N =800) were 
asthenia/fatigue, back pain, diarrhea, arthralgia, hot flush, peripheral edema, musculoskeletal 
pain, headache, upper respirator y infection, muscular weakness, dizziness, insomnia, lower 
respiratory  infection, spinal cord compression and cauda equina s yndrome, hematuria, 
paresthesia, anxiety , and hy pertension. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported 
for 16% of enzalut amide -treated patients and 18% of placebo -treated patients. The most 
common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 
0.9% of the enzalutamide -treated patients and none (0%) of the placebo- treated patients.

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4In the phase 3 study  MDV3100- 03 (PREVAIL; N = 1717), a multinational, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, efficacy  and safety  study  of enzalutamide in 
chemotherap y-naïve patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer who have failed 
androgen d eprivation therapy , enzalutamide was generall y well tolerated with an overall 
safet y profile consistent with that observed in AFFIRM, with a lower seizure rate observed in 
PREVAIL (1 patient [0.1%] each in the enzalutamide and placebo treatment groups).
Additional information on the clinical experience with enzalutamide is provided in the most 
current edition of the MDV3100 Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment 
MDV3100 is a novel small molecule designed to have an increased affinity for the androgen 
receptor and more effective suppression of the androgen pathway  in the setting of androgen 
over expression [Tran et al, 2009]. MDV3100 has a higher binding a ffinit y to the AR 
(8-10times greater), has no agonist activity , and has demonstrated supe rior AR downstream 
effects compared to bicalutamide in pre -clinical studies. I n a clinical trial ( phase 1-2) involving 
140 castrate subjects with progressive prostate cancer who have either failed androgen 
deprivation therap y or chemotherapy, MDV3100 has s hown strong anti -tumor effects. These 
effects include reduction of PSA, prolonged time to radiographic and PSA progression and 
CTC conversion from unfavorable to favorable status. 
Commonly  used androgen receptor antagonists are flutamide, bicalutamide and
nilutamide. The endocrine effects of antiandrogens usually  include significant increases in LH, 
Follicle Stimulating Hormones, Testosterone and Estradiol .Common adverse effects resulting 
from androgen receptor blockade are to be expected. For these compo unds the most common 
side effects are known and include breast pain, gynecomastia, hot flushes, back pain, asthenia, 
and constipation.
It has now been shown in phase1- 3 clinical trials that MDV3100 demonstrates a similar 
endocrine response profile ( hypergonado- tropic h ypergonadism) as other marketed AR 
antagonists. Given the strong in vitro data showing superiority  to bicalutamide, the 
nonclinical data demonstrating few toxicities, robust clinical data from the phase 1 -3 showing 
anti-tumor effect, th e favorable overall safety  profile of MDV3100 in the phase 1-3 
completed and ongoing  studies, together with the manageable safety  profile , the benefits of 
study ing MDV3100 outweigh the risks involved. Patients with locally  advanced or metastatic 
prostate cancer may  benefit from a compound that offers improved efficacy to traditional 
anti-androgens coupled with a less unfavorable side effect profile when compared to LHRH 
analogues. The proposed total daily  dosage (160 mg) in the proposed study  seems to be 
acceptable in light of the safet y and efficacy data obtained to date. The identified risk of 
seizure and potential risks described for currentl y approved anti -androgens will be monitored 
through clinical follow -up and by  routine laboratory  assessments. The FDA’s guidance for 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI) will also be followed . In summary , the benefit risk profile 
for patients participating in the study  that will be treated with MDV3100 is considered to be 
favorable as potential benefits exceed identified and potential risks .Please refer to the most

Effects of MDV3100 on Exposure to Other Drugs
Clinical data indicate that MDV3100 is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.  Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolized by  
CYP3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus), CYP2C9 
(e.g., phen ytoin, warfarin), and CYP2C19 (e.g., S- mephen ytoin) should be used with caution 
and may  require dose adjustment as co- administration with MDV3100 may result in decreased 
exposure . If MDV3100 is co-administered with warfarin, conduct additional INR monitoring.
In consideration of the long half -life of MDV3100 (approximately  1week), effects on 
enzy mes may  persist for 1 month or longer after stopping MDV3100 .
Drugs That May Affect Exposure to MDV3100
Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP2C8
Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) increased the composite 
AUC0 -inf of MDV3100 plus its active metabolite in healthy  volunteers; therefore, 
co-administration of MDV3100 with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided ,if possible. 
The effects of CYP2C8 inducers on the PK of MDV3100 have not been evaluated in vivo. 
Co-administration of MDV3100 with strong or moderate CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may 
decrease the plasma exposure of MDV3100 and should be avoided if possible. Selection of a 
concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP2C8 induction potential is recommended.

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4Drugs that Induce CYP3A4
The effects of CYP3A4 inducers on the PK of MDV3100 have not been evaluated in vivo. 
Co-administration of MDV3100 with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, phen ytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine) may  decrease the plasma exposure 
of MDV3100 and should be avoided if possible. Sele ction of a concomitant medication with 
no or minimal CYP3A4 induction potential is recommended. Moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
(e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) and St John’s Wort may also 
reduce the plasma exposure of MDV3100 and sho uld be avoided if possible.
5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  drug accountability  will be performed to document compliance with the dosing 
regimen. Subjects will be asked to bring back all remaining stud ydrug and all study  drug 
packaging at each stud y visit for drug accountability .
5.1.5 Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose
Neither the effects of overdose of MDV3100 nor an antidote to overdose are known. In case 
of overdose of MDV3100, sy mptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring is recommended.

Subjects with AEs of hepatic origin accompanied by  Liver Function Test (LFT)
abnormalities should be carefully  monitored.
5.4.3 Laboratory Assessments
Please refer to Appendix 2(Liver Safety  Monitoring and Assessment) for additional DILI 
labora tory testing requirements and timing. Routine laboratory  assessments for hematology
andchemistry will be collected and anal yzed at the local laboratory .Laboratory  assessments 
will be assessed at every  clinic visit including the safet y follow- up visit, see also the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section V, Table 1). A maximum of 18 mL  of blood will be taken 
at every  visit. See also Appendix 1  
If the results of clinical laboratory
 tests are outside the normal range and considered clinicall y 
significant, the investigator may  decide to repeat tests on new samples.
Any changes in laboratory  values will be evaluated by  the investigator. Clinically  important 
changes from the time of signing the informed consent will be reported as AEs.
5.4.3.1 Abnormal Liver Function Tests
If  laboratory  testing for a subject enrolled in a study  and receiving stud y drug reveals an 
increase of serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3x ULN, or bilirubin > 2x ULN, at least all 
four of the usual serum measures (ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin [ TBL]) should be 
repeated within 48 -72 hours of notification of the test results. See Appendix 2(Liver Safety 
Monitoring and Assessment) for additional information on monitoring and assessment of 
abnor mal liver function tests.
Laboratory  assessments must be obtained prior to study  drug administration.

examination and w eight will be recorded at every  clinic visit including the safet y follow-up 
visit, see also the Schedule of Assessments ( Section V, Table 1).
5.4.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
The 12-l ead ECG measurements will be performed at every  time point according to the 
Schedule of Assessments after the subject ha s been in supine position for 5 minutes.
The investigator will review, sign and date the ECGs im mediately  after recording to ensure the 
subject’s safet y. The time and heart rate of the ECG, as well as an overall conclusion, will be 
recorded in the eCRF. This overall conclusion will be recorded as normal, abnormal not 
clinically  significant, or abnorm al clinically  significant.  If the overall conclusion is abnormal, 
the applicable abnormality code (provided in the eCRF) must be recorded in the eCRF.
Per time point, the ECG will be stored electronically , printed (photocopied to prevent fading 
of origina l print outs) and timely  reviewed b y the investigator. The original printout will be 
stored with the subject’s source data. ECGs that have technical failures will not be stored.
5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
administered a stud y drug or has undergone study procedures and which does not necessarily  
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
following criteria:
●Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  drug
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the 
investigator.
An AE observed after starting administration of the study  drug is called a "treatment 
emergent adverse event" and usuall y summed up as the AEs in the clinical study  report. If a 
diagnosis is made from the sign and/or s ymptom, the diagnosis should be recorded in 
preference to the listing of individual signs and s ymptoms. I f not, the investigator should 
record each sign and s ymptom as an individual AE. 
All AEs occurring after visit Day  1 should be recorded in the eCRF. All observed or 
spontaneously  reported AEs will be recorded in the eCRF. Data to be recorded include a

-CONFIDENTIAL -
20Jun2016 Astellas Page 32of 64
Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4description of the event, date and time of onset and end of the event, severity, action with 
respect to study  drug , treatment required, relationship to study  drug, and outcome of the 
event. All subjects who experience an AE will be followed up at appropriate time intervals 
until resolved or stabilized to the sa tisfaction of the investigator.
If an event recurs after it had resolved, it should be handled as a new AE. However, AEs that 
occur intermittently  can be recorded as one AE. When the severit y of an AE increases, the 
worst severit y of that AE should be reco rded for the entire duration.
5.5.2 Disease Progression 
It is anticipated that a proportion of subjects will experience disease progression. Disease 
progression should not be reported as an AE . Clinical signs and s ymptoms due to disease 
progression will be collected as AEs. Individual signs and s ymptoms will be listed rather than 
the term “disease progression” with the following exception: if disease progression is the 
cause of death, this event may  be recorded as an AE with “disease progression” as the 
reported term.
5.5.3 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, 
it results in any  of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life threatening (an event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death)
●Results in pe rsistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
● R esults in congenital anomaly, or birth defect
● Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospital ization for treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
●Other medicall y important events.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not resu lt in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Safety  events of interest on a Sponsor medicinal product that may  require expedited reporting 
and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:

20Jun2016 Astellas Page 33of 64
Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4● Overdose of a Sponsor medicinal product
● Suspected abuse/misuse of a Sponsor medicinal product
●Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Sponsor medicinal product
●Medication error involving a Sponsor product (with or without subject exposure to the 
Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name conf usion)
All of the events of interest noted above should be recorded on the eCRF. Any  situation 
involving these events of interest that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF and marked ‘serious’ and the SAE workshe et.
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as ‘alway s serious’ events. If an adverse 
event is reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as ‘alway s serious’, 
additional information on the event may  be requested.
5.5.4 Criteri a for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as " AEs
whose relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out". The following table describes 
the criteria for determining c ausal relationship of AEs.
Table 3 Criteria for Causal Relationship
Causal relationship
to the 
study drugCriteria for casual relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
temporal  relationship to drug administration, which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and /orin  which other drugs, chemicals or 
underly ing disease provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reaso nable time sequence to administration of the drug, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may  be lacking or 
unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormal ity, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikel y to be 
attributed to concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically  reasonable response on re -administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechalle nge).
5.5.5 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event 
Severity  of AEs will be graded according to the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0 of the National Cancer Institute (NCI )Cancer Therapy  Evaluation 
Program (CTEP) . For terms not specified within NCI-CTCAE , the following guideline should 
be used to determine grade as below in Table 4

5.5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
In the case of a serious adverse event (SAE), the investigator must contact the Sponsor by 
telephone or fax immediately  (within 24 hours of awareness) . The investigator should complete 
and submit a report/report form containing all information that is required by the Regulatory  
Authorities to the Sponsor by  fax immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) .If the faxing of
the report/report form or an SAE Worksheet is not possible or is not possible within 24 hours, 
the 24h contact for SAEs should be informed b y phone. For contact details, see Section II

●Causal relationship to the study  drug .
SAEs will be collected from the time of study  drug administration on Day  1through 30 day s 
after the last dose of study  drug.
The Sponsor will notify  allinvestigators responsible for ongoing clinical studies with the
study  drug of all SAEs which require submission to their I RB/IEC within timelines set by
regional /country regulations.
The investigators should provide written documentation of I RB/IEC notification for each 
report to the Sponsor.
For Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) from a blinded trial, 
unblinded CI OMS -I report will be submitted to the authorities and IRB/IEC where required . 
All SAEs recorded up to 30 day s after the last study  drug intake should be reported, i.e. even 
if they  occur after the end of study  visit.
5.5.7 Follow -up to Adverse Events
All adverse events occurring during treatment are to be followed up until resolved or judged 
to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they become chronic to the extent that they can 
be fully  characterized (all follow -up results are to be reported to the sponsor or delegated 
CRO).
For tho se subjects that transition to S tudy , it is not needed to collect AEs and 
SAEs after the last dose within this study , as these will be collected as part of the extension 
study .
For sub jects who do not transition to S tudy , any  adverse event that progresse s
to an“SAE ”or if a subject experiences a new SAE, the investigator must immediately  
report 
the information to the sponsor .
Please refer to Appendix 2(Liver Safety  Monitoring and Assessment) for detailed 
instructions on DILI follow -up responsibilities related to history  of symptoms, concomitant 
drug use, alcohol use, and recreational drug use.
5.5.8 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4Any changes to this list will be communicated to the participating investigational sites. 
Investigators must report individual occurrences of these events [Section 0].
5.5.9 Procedure in Case of Pregnancy
If during the conduct of theclinical trial, a male subject impregnates his partner, the subject 
should report the pregnancy  tothe investigator. The investigator should report the pregnancy  
to the sponsor as an SAE within 30days from discontinuation of dosing . The expected date 
of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, estimated fertility  
date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this information.
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother ,as well as the fetus ,as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome to the sponsor.
When the outcom e of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s [spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y (including anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus)], the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedu re 
for SAE s. Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  (which is 
categorized as an SAE ) is mentioned below.
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes abortion and missed abortion.
●Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug. 
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as " possible "by 
the investigator .
●In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "normality "of the infant is evaluated at 
the 
birth.
●"Normality "of the miscarried fetus is evaluated by  visual examination unless te st results 
which indicate a congenital anomaly  are obtained prior to miscarriage.
5.5.10 Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Study
When new information becomes available , including "Dear Doctor Letters" but not limited to 
that, necessary  for conducting the clinical study  properly  will lead to a protocol amendment, 
the sponsor should inform regulatory  authorities, as well as all investigators involved in the 
clinical study , who will then inform the IRB/ IEC of such information, and when needed, 
should amend the subject information.

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 45.8 Total Amount of Blood
The total amount of blood for each subject will vary  depending on how long they  stay on 
treatment. The maximum amount of blood collected at each clinic visit is approximately  18ml.
Furthermore, if an y laboratory  abnormalities are found for a subject, additional blood may  be 
drawn for monitoring.
6 DISCONTINUATION
6.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subject(s)
A discontinuation is a subject who enrolled in the study  and for whom study  treatment is 
permanentl y discontinued prematurel y for an y reason. 
A safet y follow- up visit will be performed approximately  30 day s after the last dose of study  
drug, or prior to the initiation of another anti -neoplastic therap y, whichever occurs first.
For subjects who enroll into Study  ,a safet y follow -up visit is not required.
For these subjects
,the final visit for S tudy 9785 -CL-0121 will serve as Day  1 for S tudy 
 (±7 day s).
The subject is free to withdraw from the study  treatment and/or study  for any  reason and at 
any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty  or prejudice. The 
investigator is also free to terminate a subject 's involvement in the study  at any  time if the 
subject 's clinical condition warrants it.
If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory  result that is significantly  outside of the reference range, the investigator w ill attempt 
to provide follow-
up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinicall y significant. 
Subjects who choose not to participate or are not eligible for Stud y  will 
complete their participation in Study  9785- CL-0121 by  completing the safety  follow -up visit 
upon activation of Study   at the institution.
6.2 Discontinuation of the Site
If an investigator intends to discontinue participation in the study , the investigator must 
immediately  inform the sponsor of the discontinuat ion and the reason for it.
6.3 Discontinuation of the Study
The Sponsor may terminate this study  prematurely , either in its entirety  or at any  study  site, 
for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination. Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the Sponsor terminates the study  for safet y reasons, the Sponsor will immediately  notify  the 
investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for study  termination .

Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 412.2 Appendix 2:  Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment
If laboratory  testing for a subject enrolled in study and receiving stud y drug reveals an increase 
of serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3X ULN, or bilirubin > 2X ULN ,at least allfour of the 
usual serum hepatic measures (ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin [TBL ])  ) should be repeated. 
Testing should be repeated within 48-72 hours of notification of the test results. For studies for 
which a central laboratory  is used, alerts will be gen erated b y the central lab regarding moderate 
and marked liver abnormality  to inform the investigator, study  monitor and study  team. Subjects 
should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of L iver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and marked where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3 x ULN or > 2 x ULN
Marked > 3 x ULN and > 2 x ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have marked hepatic abnormalities for any  of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8X ULN
●ALT or AST > 5X ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3X ULN and INR > 1.5
●ALT or AST > 3X ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tender ness, fever, rash and/or eosinoph ilia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or marked abnormalities and require additional monitoring and 
follow -up. Discontinuation of treatment must occur if subject has marked abnormalities. In 
addition, if closed monitoring for a subject with moderate hepatic laboratory tests is not 
possible, drug should be discontinued.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and m arked abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , phy sical 
examination andlaboratory tests. The site should complete the L iver Abnormality  Case Report 
Form (LA -CRF) or an appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function 
testing should be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) should be repeated 2- 3 times 
weekl y then weekl y or less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued 
and the subject is as ymptomatic.  
Marked hepatic liver function abnormalities, in the absence of another etiology , may be 
considered an important medical event and reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). The

20Jun2016 Astellas Page 53of 64
Version 5.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 4sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom marked hepatic liver 
function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are observed.
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, t he investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Sy mptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ’adverse events’ on the AE page of eCRF . 
Illnesses and conditions such as h ypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease 
thatmay lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medicat ion page of eCRF .  Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet should 
be entered on the LA-CRF or an appropriate document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents
●Based on the subject ’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including: 
oacute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) 
oultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin.
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre-existing or 
acute live r disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may  be 
discontinued from the study . The investigator may determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment. 
Discontinuation of treatment must occur if:
●ALT or AST > 8X ULN
●ALT or AST > 5X ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3X ULN and (TBL > 2X UL N or IN R> 1.5)
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 3X ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophi lia (> 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or marked hepatic laboratory tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

All adverse events occurring during the stud y are to be followed up until resolved or judged 
to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they become chronic to the extent that they can
be fully  characterized (all follow -up results are to be reported to the sponsor or delegated 
CRO).
Since it is unpredictable how long such a follow- up will take, data from this follow -up 
generated after the subject's end of the stud y visit will be recorde d by the investigator. Full 
details regarding this follow -up will be described in the study  report, whenever necessary .
If during adverse event follow -up, the adverse event progresse sto an“SAE” or if a subject 
experiences a new SAE, the investigator must immediately  report the information to the 
sponsor .

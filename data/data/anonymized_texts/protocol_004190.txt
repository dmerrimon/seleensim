Title of Study:  
A Phase 3, Double- Blind, Randomized, Multicenter, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy 
and Safety of TNX-102 SL Taken Daily at Bedtime in Patients with Fibromyalgia (Protocol No. TNX-
CY-F306) 
Study center(s):  30 to 4 0 centers in the United States  (US)  
Estimated Studied period: 1 5 months  
Estimated date first patient enrolled:  Aug  2020 
Estimated date last patient completed: Oct 2021 
 Phase of development: 3  
Objectives:  
 
Primary  
To evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) 5.6 mg in the treatment  
of patients with fibromyalgia.  
Secondary  
To evaluate the safety of TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) 5.6 mg in the treatment 
of patie nts with fibromyalgia.  
 Methodology:  This is a Phase 3, randomized, parallel-group, double- blind, placebo -controlled, 14-week study designed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) taken daily at bedtime for 
the treatment  of fibromyalgia.  The study is to be conducted at approximately 30-40 investigational sites 
in the US . 
 
The study will consist of a Screening V isit (Visit 1, Days −35 to −8), a washout and screening period of at 
least 7 days (for those patients not requiring washout) and no more than 35 days, inclusive of a 7-day 
baseline data collection phase immediately preceding the Baseline visit.  For extenuating circumstances, 
the duration of the Screening period may be increased to up to 49 days with Medical Monitor approval.  
Note , this trial is being initiated  during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the exceptional 
circumstances caused by t he COVID-19 pandemic, we are providing an option f or a remote ( telephone) 
visit for Weeks 2, 6, 10 (Visit 3, 4, 5), and , only with Medical Monitor approval, Week 14/Visit 6  (or 
Early T ermination)  for those unable to attend an in- clinic visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In cases in 
which it is feasible for a site’s own research staff , with  or without a research clinician , to make a home 
visit for Week 14 /Visit 6 (or E arly T ermination ), a home visit should be conducted rather than a telephone 
visit in order to collect greater safety data  than the telephone visits allow . The Screening phase will be 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 5 of 92  followed by the Baseline/Randomization Visit (Visit 2, Day 1), and 4 treatment visits at Weeks 2, 6, 10, 
and 14 (or E arly Termination).  The total duration of the study, including Screening, will be 
approximately 15-19 weeks.  The maximum treatment duration will be 1 4 weeks.  
 
Eligible patients who provide written informed consent will have study assessments performed at 
Screening and will stop all excluded medications during the washout period through the Week 14 visit 
(Visit 6) .  Patients will record their average pain intensity for the previous 24 hours in the evening every 
day from Visit 1 through Visit 6 on a n electronic  diary system.  After recording Baseline Diary scores for 
at least 7 day s, patients will return to the investigative site for Baseline assessments and randomization 
(Day 1), where they will be randomly assigned to receive TNX-102 SL or matching placebo sublingual 
tablets in a 1:1 ratio . 
 Patients will take the study drug sublingually daily at bedtime, starting on the day that they are randomized (Day 1), for 14 weeks.  For the first two weeks of treatment, patients will start on TNX -102 
SL 2.8 mg (1 tablet) or placebo. Upon return to the site
1 for the Week 2 visit (Visit 3), al l patients will 
have the dose increased to TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) or two placebo tablets.  Patients will 
return to the site1 for assessment of efficacy and safety, as well as dose tolerability , at Weeks 6, 10, and 14 
(or E arly T ermination) . 
 In scenarios in which TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, or 2 placebo tablets,  is considered intolerable  due to adverse 
event(s) and would otherwise lead to study discontinuation, with Medical Monitor approval , the 
Investigator may lower the dose back to 1 tablet every  night ( TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg  or one placebo tablet) .  
Re-challenge with 2 tablets TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg  (5.6 mg dose) /placebo may be attempted at a  later date 
if/when it is deemed clinically  warranted  by the Investigator , or the patient may remain on the lower dose 
for the remainder of the study.  
 
Patients who wish to withdraw from the study may do so at any time. 
 
Patients will be trained on use of the diary system and will be asked to complete a brief online training a t 
each study visit starting from the Screening visit.  Each evening, when the patient utilizes the diary, the 
system will prompt the patient regarding daily average pain intensity, sleep quality from the previous 
night, and study drug dosing the previous n ight (post-randomization). 
 At Screening Visit 1 and after signing the written informed consent, any required washout should be 
discussed with the patient and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stopping any excluded medications.  This down titration and discontinuation of excluded medications  must be accomplished so 
that the patient is medication -free for at least 21 days prior to randomization.  This will provide 14 days 
off the excluded medication before the patient starts the 7 -day run-in phase during which critical baseline 
daily diary efficacy data are collected.  Any additional time required for down-titration would be in addition to this 21-day washout requirement.  For this reason, patients can remain in screening for up to 35 days, which provides an additional 2 weeks for down-titration, if required. 
 
Number of patients (planned):  
Approximately 670 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with TNX-102 SL or placebo 
tablets.  Randomized patients who withdraw will not be replaced.  
 
1 All references to a site/study center  visit for Weeks 2, 6, 10, and 14 include telephone visits for Weeks 2, 6, and 10, 
and home visit or telephone visit for Week 14/ET that are being allowed due to the circumstances of the COVID- 19 
pandemic.

simultaneously and sublingually (under the tongue ) each day at bedtime.  
 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 9 of 92  Duration of treatment:  
14 weeks  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Name: Placebo  
Dose, route, frequency: For Days 1-14, 1 tablet of placebo taken sublingually (under the tongue ) each day 
at bedtime. For Days 15-98, 2 tablets of placebo taken simultaneously and sublingually each day at bedtime.  
 
Treatment Regimens:  
Patients will take 1  tablet of randomly assigned study drug sublingually at bedtime starting on Day 1 for 2 
weeks; then patient will take 2 tablets of assigned study drug simultaneously and sublingually starting on 
Day 15 for 12 weeks. If necessary, a drink of water is recommended prior to dosing for patients with a dry 
mouth.  Patients will be asked to keep the tablet(s) under the tongue until dissolved (approximately 90 
seconds) and not to crush or chew the tablets.  Patients should not eat, drink or chew gum for at least 15 
minutes after dosing, and preferably not to drink any hot, cold or acidic beverage until morning.  Patients 
should also refrain from talking for at least 5 minutes after dosing.  
 
In scenarios in which the dose of 2 tablets ( 5.6 mg) is considered intolerable and would otherwise lead to 
study discontinuation, with Medical Monitor approval the Investigator may lower the dose back to 1 tablet 
(2.8 mg) per day.  Re -challenge with 2 tablets (5.6 mg) may be attempted at a later date if/when deemed 
clinically  warranted  by the Investigator .

Concomitant Medications:  
Patients who are taking certain medications to manage their FM are eligible for the study if they are 
willing and able, and it is medically reasonable, for them to be withdrawn from these medications prior to 
randomization and then refrain from usage during this study.  The specific medications that must be 
withdrawn include milnacipran, pregabalin, duloxetine, tramadol, tapentadol, gabapentin and other 
anticonvulsants (aside from those used as migraine prophylaxis), any form of cyclobenzaprine (AMRIX®, 
or generic equivalents), amitriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants, trazodone, narcotics/opioids, 
naltrexone (including CONTRAVE®) and benzodiazepines. 
 Due to the exclusion of all opioids (including tramadol and tapentadol) during the treatment phase  of the 
study, patients requiring opioids on a regular or frequent basis for any indication should not be considered.  In addition, patients who are taking gabapentin, pregabalin or any other anticonvulsant due to neuropathic pain should not be considered. 
 
Other prescription or over- the-counter medication not specifically excluded by entry criteria may be 
continued during the study, provided that the patient has been on this medication for at least 30 days at a stable dose (except for allowed antidepressan ts, which require 90 days at stable dose) prior to the date of 
randomization , and usage is expected to remain stable throughout the study. 
 
In addition, certain other medications will also be prohibited and may require washout, or exclusion of the 
patient if washout is not appropriate (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine, levomilnacipran, nefazodone, 
benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine sleep aids, stimulants, sodium oxybate, ketamine, etc.).  Patient s 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 11 of 92  using teeth -whitening products such as whitening strips or pres cription whitening products must agree to 
discontinue their use from the day of randomization until the end of their study participation. 
 
After randomization, sedating antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) can be used as needed 
for insomnia ; however, patients must be able to discontinue them during the screening phase and must 
refrain from their use during the week of baseline data collection preceding V isit 2.  The use of sedating 
anti-histamines after randomization should always be  under the  direction of the Investigator, and such use 
should be minimized to no more than a few  nights in a row, followed by attempts to refrain from use.   
 
The use of melatonin, ramelteon, and valerian root is not restricted.    
 
New medications that are deemed required, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or another 
physician, will be allowed, including medications needed to treat adverse events.  If there is a requirement for acute opioids, corticosteroids , or other treatments that could confound the evaluation of pain at critical 
times (defined as the week prior to Clinic Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6), the Investigator may consult with the 
Medical Monitor to potentially delay the study visit until the medication is no longer needed.  At a 
minimum, no opioid/narcotic should have been utilized within 2 days of a study visit, and ideally there 
will have been no usage during the 7 days prior to any visit since important efficacy data will be collected 
on the diary during the week leading up to each clinic visit.   
   
 
Statistical methods:  
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The pr imary efficacy parameter will be the contrast between TNX -102 SL and placebo in the weekly 
mean change from baseline pain score at the endpoint visit.  The weekly pain score will be based on the 
weekly average of the daily diary patient self -reported 24-hour recall average pain severity scores using 
an 11-point (0-10) NRS.   
 
The primary ITT analysis will provide the following causal estimand  for the primary analysis:  the 
difference in the weekly mean change from Baseline of the daily patient self -reported 24- hour recall 
average pain severity rating using an 11- point (0-10) NRS evaluated at the Week 14 endpoint in all 
randomized patients attr ibutable to the initially randomized treatment assignment.  The primary analysis 
will use a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM ) approach with multiple imputation for missing 
data.  Covariates in the model will include the fixed categorical effects of trea tment, center, study week, 
and treatment by study week interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score by study week interaction.
  Please see the separate S tatistical A nalysis P lan (SAP)  for more

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized overall and by preferred term and system organ class.  Adverse e vents will also be 
summarized by severity and relationship to study drug.  Serious AEs, AEs involving the oral cavity and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will also be summarized.  Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory  test results and vital signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  The number of patients with baseline and treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior or self-injurious behavior, based on the C- SSRS, will 
be summarized by treatment group. 
 
Sample Size:  
The study is planned to enroll approximately 670 patients total in a 1:1 randomization ; that is, 335 
patients in each of the TNX -102 SL and placebo arms.  

Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 15 of 92  b Patients who discontinue from the study before completing the Week 14 visit will b e asked to return to the site for an E arly Termination (ET) visit to have 
Week 1 4 assessments completed.  
c A brief physical examination will be performed at Baseline and Week 1 4/ET. For patients where a telephone visit is being conducted  for Week 14/ET , the brief 
physical exam will not be required.  
d Clinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum biochemistry) will be performed at Screening and Week 1 4/ET.  For patients where a telephone visit is being 
conducted for Week 14/ET, the laboratory tests will not be required. TSH will be tested at Screening only.  Optional HCV/HB sAg testing may be performed at 
Screening  at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor.  Medical Monitor approval is required prior to testing.   
e A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening, followed by in -clinic urine pregnancy tests at Baseline, Week 2 , Week 6 , Week 10 and Week 1 4/ET for 
women of child- bearing potential.  For p atients where a telephone visit is being conducted, the urine pregnancy test will be performed at home  by patient for 
women of child- bearing potential.  
f Vital signs ( temperature, weight and sitting blood pressure and heart rate  [obtained after resting for 5 minutes in a sitting position]) will be measured at each 
visit.  Height will be measured at Screening only.  For patients where a telephone visit is being conducted, the vital signs will not be required. 
g A 12 -lead electrocardiogram will be obtained at Screening.  All electrocardiograms will be performed and interpreted locally.  
h Clinic staff m embers will train the patient on how to take the study drug and how to complete the diary.  In addition, patients will be asked to complete  a brief 
online training on accurate pain reporting and placebo response  at each study visit. Patients will be asked to complete their diary every evening.  Diary 
completion will start on the evening of Visit 1 and continue through Week 1 4.  Diary responses will be monitored during the study.  
i The study drug will be dispensed to patients at Baseline on Day 1 (following randomization) and at Weeks 2 , 6, and 1 0.  One bottle will be dispensed on Day 1 
and two bottles will be dispensed at Weeks 2, 6 and 10. For patients where a telephone visit is being conducted, the study drug will be mailed via courier to their 
home. Patie nts will be instructed to take one tablet of study drug sublingually every evening at bedtime for 2 weeks starting the evening of Day 1, and then 2 
tablets sublingually every evening from Week 2 to Week 14 . 
j Patients will assess their average daily pain over the last 24 hours every evening using an 11- point (0 -10) numerical rating scale.  Patients should be instructed 
to complete  their diary responses in the evening, but before taking their bedtime dose of study drug.  The 24- hour recall interval will assess  the previous night’s 
sleep and symptoms of pain since bedtime the previous night.  
k Any additional (pre -screening) medical findings or medications discovered after the Screening Visit are to be noted in the  Medical History, Prior/Concomitant 
Medication Page or Lifetime FM pharmacotherapy page, respectively.  
l PROMIS scales for sleep disturbance and fatigue.  
m The urine drug screen is mandatory  at Visit 1 .  If the screening UDS is positive for opioids, benzodiazepines , or amphetamines  and washout is appropriate , the 
patient will need to return to the clinic for an unscheduled UDS prior to the beginning of the 7 -day baseline data collection phase leading up to V2.  Opioid   and 
stimulant retesting can be perform ed with an in -clinic UDS, whereas the UDS must be analyzed centrally in patients washing off  of benzodiazepines.   Urine 
drug screening may be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion at any time.  
 n There will be a thorough examination (visual and palpation) of the oral cavity at the Screening visit and then visual examina tions at all other in -clinic visits. 
For visits  in which  a visual exam is not possible ( i.e. telephone visit), the visual oral cavi ty exam is not required; in lieu of the in -clinic (or home visit) oral cavity 
exam , after conclusion of “any changes in your medical condition”, ask specifically if there have been any changes or problems in the oral cavity . Patients 
reporting any concerni ng lesion description or painful processes  in the oral cavity possibly related to study drug exposure should be strongly urged to come into 
clinic for an U nscheduled Visit for oral cavity exam . In circumstances in which , due to the COVID -19 pandemic it is not possible for the patient to return to the 
clinic for the U nscheduled Visit exam, a clinician certified by the Sponsor to conduct oral cavity examination should contact the patient by phone and obtain 
greater history  and description  of the oral cavity AE by patient, potentially augmented with images of oral cavity taken by the patient and sent to the site for the 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 16 of 92  examining clinician to textually  document in the source.   In addition to the regularly scheduled in -clinic examination s, an unscheduled examination of the oral 
cavity in -clinic should be performed any time a patient contacts the clinic to report an oral cavity lesion or other oral AE possibly related to study drug exposure, 
other than oral numbness, tingling or noticeable taste (eg, bitter, metallic, or unpleasant) after dosing which do not require unscheduled examinations.  
*/o The blood draw for the pharmacogenomic assessment can be obtained at any study visit post -Screening (including an Early Termination visit).  D ue to 
circumstances caused by the COVID -19 pandemic and possibility of no further in -clinic visits after Baseline visit (Visit 2), it is strongly recommended that the 
pharmacogenomics blood sample be o btained at the Baseline visit (Visit 2).  It should only be obtained one time during the study.  Separate written, signed 
informed consent is required if the patient is to participate in the optional pharmacogenomic assessment.  
p Weekly recall of daily ave rage pain intensity on the NRS  scale is required at the Screening Visit. Patients should only continue screening if they score ≥4 and 
≤9. A score outside this range will require  Medical Monitor approval  in order to continue  in screening .  
q For telephone visits, the patient will be mailed all the applicable patient reported outcomes  for a given visit. T he res ults of the BDI -II will be reviewed wi th the 
patient (specifically Question #9 which will allow further exploration  of any suicidal thoughts or wishes  implied by the patient’s self -reported  response , if 
applicable ) during the phone call . C-SSRS interview should only be conducted after the BDI -II Question #9 inquiry, as any discrepancy between Question #9 
response and C -SSRS suicidal id eation types endorsed for the same assessment period must be resolved to avoid presence of occult suicidal ideation n ot 
recognized by site staff.  
r Week 2, W eek 6, and the W eek 10 visits may be performed via telephone  only when an in-clinic  visit is not feasible  due to the COVID -19 pandemic . Select 
safety assessments  specifically  required in- clinic will not be required  for the telephone visits  (e.g. vital signs  and oral cavity exam ). Telephone visits for Week 
14/ET visits are to be strongly discouraged due to inability to obtain several safety measures (e.g. vital signs, physical exam, oral cavity exam, chemistry and 
hematology labs) , but telephone visits will be permitted for Week 14/ ET visit if attendance of an in -clinic visit is absolutely impossible or refused by the patient 
as a result of  the COVID- 19 pandemic  and it is not feasible for the site  to conduct a home visit .

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 31 of 92  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, parallel -group, double-blind, placebo -controlled, 14-week study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) taken 
daily at bedtime for the treatment  of fibromyalgia.  The study is to be conducted at 
approximately 30-40 investigational sites in the United States.  
The study will consist of a Screening V isit (Visit 1, Days -35 to -8), a Baseline/Randomization 
Visit (Visit 2, Day 1),  a Week 2 Visit (where the dose will be increased to 5.6 mg/day), and 3 
more treatment visits (Weeks 6, 10 and 14 or Early Termination).  The period between the 
Screening and Bas eline Visit wills be at least 7 days, in order to allow for at least one week of 
daily pain data collection, and up to 35 days, to accommodate any necessary scheduling 
challenges or prohibited medication washout time. For extenuating circumstances, the duration of the Screening period may be increased to up to 49 days with Medical Monitor approval, and 
an option for a telephone visit will be available for Weeks 2, 6, and 10 for those unable to attend 
an in -clinic visit due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 pandemic. Additionally , a Week 
14/ET telephone visit or home visit by site staff may be allowed on a case-by- case basis , 
approved by the M edical Monitor, if the only other choice is losing the patient completely from 
the study if patient absolutely cannot come in  to the clinic  for the visit.  The total duration of the 
study, including Screening, will be approximately 15-19 weeks.   The maximum treatment 
duration will be 14 weeks.  
Eligible patients who provide written cons ent will have study assessments performed at 
Screening and will stop all excluded medications during the washout period, as required, through 
the Week 14 visit (Visit 6). An in -clinic 7- day recall NRS average daily pain intensity score at 
Screening must be ≥ 4 and ≤ 9 in order for the patient to remain eligible.  
Patients will be trained on the use of the electronic daily diary and will be asked to complete a brief online training at each study visit starting from Screening Visit 1.  Patients will be asked to 
record their average daily pain intensity on the 11-point (0-10) NRS scale using 24-hour recall, and to provide an assessment of sleep quality from the previous evening, also using an 11-point 
NRS scale. Each evening, when the patient completes the diary, the system will prompt the 
patient regarding daily average pain intensity, sleep quality from the previous night, and study drug dosing (post-randomization). Due to limitations in the diary completion window, patients 
that are planning on international travel during the study period should not be considered for the 
study.  Patients whose employment involves overnight shifts also should not be considered for the study due to the restricted completion window and the requirement for consistent bedtime dosing.   
After completing any required washout of excluded therapies (see next paragraph) and recording 
Baseline Diary scores for at least 7 days, patients will return to the investigative site for Baseline 
assessment s and randomization (Day 1, Visit 2), where they will be randomly assigned to receive 
TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) or matching placebo sublingual tablets in a 1:1 ratio. 
The mean of the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2 (Baseline Randomization  Visit; Day 1) 
will serve as the baseline pre- treatment pain score.

be discussed with the patient and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stopping 
any excluded medications.  This down titration and withdrawal must be accomplished so that the patient is medication -free for at least 21 days prior to randomization.  This will provide 14 days 
off the excluded medication before the patient starts the 7-day run-in phase during which critical baseline efficacy data are collected  by means of the daily diary.  Any additional time required for 
gradual dose reduction/ down -titration would be in addition to this 21-day washout requirement.  
For this reason, patients can remain in screening for up to 35 days, which provides an additional 2 weeks for down- titration , if required.  
Patients will take the study drug sublingually daily at bedtime, starting in the evening of the day 
that they are randomized (Day 1, Visit 2), for 14 weeks.  Patients will be instructed to take one 
tablet (2.8 mg) sublingually daily  at bedtime for the first 2 weeks (Days 1 -14). Patients will then  
return to the clinic
1 at Week 2 (Visit 3) for efficacy and safety assessments, assessment of s tudy 
drug compliance, and the study drug dose will be increased to two tablets (2 x 2.8 mg ) taken 
sublingually and simultaneously daily at bedtime. Patients will next return to the clinic1 at Week 
6 (Visit 4) for efficacy and safety assessments, assessment of study drug compliance, and an 
assessment of dose tolerability at the 5.6 mg dose.  If the patient reports intolerable side effects at 
this visit (Visit 4), the Investigator may consider a reduction in dose to one tablet sublingua lly 
every night (with Medical Monitor approval), either temporarily or for the remainder of the 
study, depending on what the Investigator considers clinically appropriate. It will be emphasized 
to Investigators that such dosage reduction should only be considered when the patient’s 
intolerability is sufficient to cause the patient to consider discontinuing from the study. It will be 
emphasized to participating patients that they should only make changes in study drug dose upon 
consultation with the Investig ator, and they should notify the clinic immediately if they think the 
dosage needs to be adjusted. Ideally, any changes in dose should only be made at a scheduled 
visit, but, if necessary to change dose between visits, the change should only be made upon t he 
recommendation of the Investigator after discussion between the patient and the Investigator.  
Patients will return to the study center1 for safety and efficacy assessments, and assessments of 
study drug compliance and tolerability at Weeks 10 (Visit 5), and 14 (Visit 6) or E arly 
Termination.  
An interim analysis will be performed to assess whether the study should be halted for 
overwhelming efficacy, stopped for futility, or the sample size should be increased; see S ection 
13.6.  In the case of an early stop (for either efficacy or futility), all ongoing patients  will be 
asked to return to the clinic and complete an early termination visit, and the study will be halted once all patients  have completed their termination visit.  
 
Patients who wish to withdraw from the study may do so at any time.  
The study timeline and events schedule is provided in Table 2.

8.4. Randomization Criteria  
Only those patient s meeting all of the following randomization criteria are eligible for 
randomization: 
1. Continues to meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including urine and blood test results and is successfully and consistently utilizing the diary system. 
2. Patient’s FM pain satisfies the following criteria, as assessed by diary pain scores (24 hour recall):  
a. A mean pain intensity score ≥4 and ≤9 on the 11-point (0-10) NRS scale for the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2, and 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 39 of 92  b. No more than 2 individual days with a score <4 on the 7 days immediately 
preceding Visit 2, and 
c. No score of 10 on any of the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2, and  
d. Pain scores recorded on at least 5 out of the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2. 
If the patient does not satisfy these randomization criteria, the patient has failed to qualify for this study and should be considered a screen failure, with the reason documented.  With Sponsor approval, if the patient is otherwise considered a qualified and compliant patient, Visit 2 may be 
delayed to accommodate situations in which the patient has been unable to record 5 of 7 days of 
pain scores due to acceptable extenuating circumstances.  There is no requirement for a Follow-
Up visit for screen failures. 
8.5. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
In accordan ce with the Declaration of Helsinki, human subjects have the right to withdraw from 
the study at any time for any reason.  The Investigator and Tonix also have the right to remove 
patients from the study.  Additional information regarding withdrawal or discontinuation of patients is described in detail in Section  11.5.2. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 40 of 92  9. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
9.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Patients who are taking ce rtain medications to manage their FM are eligible for the study if they 
are willing and able (and it is medically reasonable  for them ) to be withdrawn from those 
medications that are specifically excluded by the protocol and they agree to refrain from further 
usage during this study.  The specific medications  that must be withdrawn  include milnacipran, 
pregabalin, duloxetine, tramadol, gabapentin, any form of cyclobenzaprine (AMRIX®, 
FEXMID® or generic cyclobenzaprine), t apentadol, amitriptyline and other tricyclic 
antidepressants,  trazodone, narcotics/opioids and  naltrexone (including CONTRAVE®).  In 
addition, certain other medications are prohibited and may require washout, or exclusion of 
patients for whom washout is not appropriate (e.g., benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants (except 
when used as migraine prophylaxis), levomilnacipran, mirtazapine, nefazodone, St. John’s wort, phentermine, diethylproprion, muscle relaxants (e.g., methocarbamol, baclofen, carisoprodol), 
and systemic use of  strong  CYP3A4 inhibitors as defined in Appendix 1 (i.e., topical use is not 
excluded). 
All patients undergoing washout must complete a 3- week drug -free interval prior to the 
Baseline/Randomization visit (Visit 2); this will provide two weeks of washout prior to the 7 
days leading up to V isit 2 when baseline efficacy data will be collected on the daily diary. Any 
patient with a positive screening UDS who is washing off an opioid, amphetamine, or 
benzodiazepine must return to the clinic for a repeat UDS before they begin their 7- day baseline 
data collection period leading up to V isit 2.   
In general, patients utilizing benzodiazepine s on a chronic or regular basis should not be 
considered for the study; however, washout may be considered for those patients utilizing them 
only on an occasional or as-needed basis  (e.g, three times per week or less, on average).  
Buspirone for anxiety is allowed  during the trial. 
Several benzodiazepines are not eas ily detected by the in -clinic urine dipstick; therefore, patients 
positive for benzodiazepines at Screening  and deemed appropriate for washout will require a 
centrally -interpreted repeat UDS  conducted prior to the beginning of the 7-day baseline data 
colle ction period prior to V2.  All other repeat urine drug screens can be conducted on- site.   All 
repeat UDS results must be confirmed negative before the patient can be randomized.   
Patients using non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone, zaleplon) on a 
chronic, nightly basis should not be enrolled; however, patients utilizing these medications on an infrequent or occasional basis only (e.g., three times per week or less, on average) may be considered.  Similar to the benzodiazepines, drugs in this class of medication can negatively 
impact sleep architecture; therefore, patients utilizing either non -benzodiazepines or 
benzodiazepines should be discussed with the Medical Monitor early during the screening 
process to determine their suitability  for the study and to determine whether washout is clinically 
advisable.   Patients washing off non-benzodiazepines should not be randomized if they are 
unable to discontinue their use and remain drug-free through their 7- day baseline data collection 
period leading up to V isit 2. The patient’s ability to successfully discontinue their use of 
excluded sleep therapies should be carefully assessed, since UDS testing is not available for non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 41 of 92  After randomization, sedating antihistamines (e .g., diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) may  be used 
as needed for insomnia; however, patients will need to refrain from their use during the week of 
baseline data collection leading up to V isit 2.  Patients should track their use of sedating 
antihistamines in  between study visits so that changes in usage during the course of the study can 
be tracked and recorded.   
The use of melatonin, ramelteon, and valerian root is not restricted.  Similarly, the use of 
cannabidiol (CBD) products is not restricted, but like all other allowed concomitant medications, 
its usage should have been stable for at least 30 days prior to randomization, and usage should 
remain stable during the study.  Additionally, the use of CBD products should not be started after randomization.  All CBD products should be added to the concomitant medication source and case report form (CRF).  
Due to the exclusion of all opioids during the T reatment Phase of the study, patients requiring 
opioids on a regular or frequent basis for any indication should not be considered.  In addition, 
patients with neuropathic pain in addition to fibromyalgia should not be washed off of 
gabapentin, pregabalin or any other anticonvulsant, and therefore should not be considered for the study. 
At Screening Visit 1 and after signing the written informed consent, any required washout should 
be discussed with the patient and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stopping any excluded medications.  This down titration and withdrawal must be accomplished so that the 
patient is medication free for at least 21 days prior to randomization.  This will provide 14 days 
off the excluded medication before the patient starts the 7-day run- in phase during which critical 
baseline efficacy data are collected  by means of the daily diary.  Any additional time required for 
down-titration would be in addition to this 21-day washout requirement.  For this reason, patients can remain in screening for up to 35 days, which provides an additional 2 weeks for down-titration , if required.  For extenuating circumstances, the duration of the Screening period may be 
increased to up to 49 days with Medical Monitor approval.   
Other chronic prescription or over-the-counter medication not specifically excluded by an 
exclusion criterion may be continued in the study, provided that the patient has been on this 
medication for at least 30 days at a stable dose (except for allowed antidepressants, which require 
90 days at stable dose)  from the date of randomization, and usage is expected to remain stable 
throughout the study.  Allowed medications include , but are not limited to, hormonal therapy 
(contraceptives and replacement therapy), anti -hypertensive agents, lipid-lowering medications, 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor s (SSRI ) and other allowed antidepressants (e.g., 
venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, bupropion, vilazodone).   
Acetaminophen (up to 3000 mg/day) and  non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may 
be continued in a stable fashion for osteoarthritis  or other allowed indications (e.g., aspirin for 
cardioprophylaxis), or used as needed for other sources of acute, minor pain.  Note that 
acetaminophen and NSAIDs may be taken either on a regular basis, or on an as-needed (prn) 
basis; however, if used as-needed, the Investigator should ascertain the patient’s typical pattern of usage (e.g., average dosage and frequency per defined time interval) so that this information 
can be recorded on the CRF.  Any significant change in the patient’s usage of any medication, 
including those taken only as needed, should result in an update to the CRF.  The CRF entry for any prn medication is expected to include an estimation of the patient’s average dosage and 
frequency per defined time interval.   
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 42 of 92  Patients on allowed antidepressants due to a history of depression should only be considered for 
the study if no changes in antidepressant agent or dose have occurred during the 90 days leading 
up to randomization, and no changes are antic ipated or planned during the treatment phase of the 
study.  In addition, FM patients with comorbid depression who are being treated with duloxetine, 
milnacipran, levomilnacipran, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressants should 
in general not be considered for the study since washout of these agents could destabi lize their 
psychiatric status.  
NOTE: Participating patients receiving treatment with antidepressants should be cautioned about the possibility of serotonin syndrome, which has been reported in patients receiving cyclobenzaprine with SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRI ) and related 
agents. This will be included in the ICF. 
New medications that are deemed required, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or another 
physician, will be allowed, including medications needed to treat adverse events.  After 
randomization, if there is a requirement for treatment with an acute opioid or other treatment that 
may confound the evaluation of pain at critical times during the study (defined as the week prior to Visits  3, 4, 5 or 6), the Investigator may consult with the Medical Monitor to potentially delay 
the study visit until the medication is no longer needed.  At a minimum, no opioid/narcotic 
should have been utilized within 2 days of a study visit, and ideally there will have been no usage during the 7 days prior to these visits.  While it is understood that opioid usage will occasionally be necessary and unavoidable, it could  have consequences on the patient’s data.  
Similarly, if there is a requirement for acute , short- term opioid usage during the screening phase, 
the start of the 7-day run-in phase should be delayed to ensure at least 2 days between the last 
opioid dose and the beginning of the 7-day run-in phase.  In other words, there may be some 
circumstances when the unexpected requirement for short-term opioid usage, specifically due to an acute  medical, dental or surgical condition, does not require the full 21-day washout.  This 
provision only applies to acute  pain conditions – not to opioid usage due to a flare in patient’s 
FM or other chronic pain condition.  Any requirement for acute opioid usage during the 
screening phase should be brought to the attention of the M edical Monitor to ensure adequate 
wash out prior to randomization. 
Patients should refrain from drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruit during the study due to its ability to inhibit CYP 3A4 activity.  Aside from this restriction, there are no other food or fluid 
restrictions in this stud y except for the instructions pertaining to dosing ( Section  10.2).  
Patient s using teeth-whitening products such as whitening strips or prescription whitening 
products must agree to discontinue their use from the day of randomization until the end of their study participation. 
Any concomitant medications or other treatments must be recorded in the patient’s medical 
record and case report f orm along with the dose and dates of treatment. 
 
9.2. Cannabis /THC  Use 
 
Patient s utilizing cannabis /THC  are to be excluded if MINI 7.0.2 criteria are met for greater than 
MILD Cannabis Use Disorder during the preceding 12 months (prior to the Screening visit), OR  
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 43 of 92  if the investigator is concerned that the patient’s use of cannabis/THC  could interfere with 
patient ’s ability to provide reliable data or comply with the protocol. Cannabis /THC  use is 
otherwise allowed, with  caution .  The screening drug screen will also test for THC to provide the 
investigator with information regarding exposure, and to ensure that all usage is disclosed and 
taken into consideration when conducting MINI Module J.    
9.3. Enrollment of Patients  
Before undergoing any study-related screening procedures, each potential patient must provide 
written informed consent.  The Investigator will then determine the potential patient’s suitability 
for the study by interviewing the patient and by performing per-protocol screening assessments.  If excluded medications  are to be withdrawn for the explicit purpose of participation in this 
study, the patient must have already provided consent and signed  an informed consent form 
before the withdrawal or down titration of any medication  is initiated .

10.1. Study Drug Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Study drug supplies will be packaged identically so as to  maintain the integrity of the study 
blind.  The study drug bottles will be labeled minimally with the following information:  study 
number TNX- CY-F306, sponsor name and address, bottle number, quantity, storage conditions, 
usage instructions, and caution statements for investigational new drug, i.e., Caution: New Drug 
– Limited by United States Law to Investigational Use, and Keep Out of Reach of Children and Pets.   
Each study drug bottle will contain 40 tablets.  One bottle will be dispensed to each patie nt at 
Visit 2 (Baseline) and then two bottles will be dispensed at Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 
6), and Visit 5 (Week 10).  Study drug will be mailed via courier to a patient’s home where a 
telephone visit is scheduled to be conducted. This will provide the patient with enough tablets to 
cover the 2 or 4 weeks of dosing between visits, plus additional tablets to cover loss and/or visit 
window variability.  The patient should be instructed to take all the tablets in one bottle before 
opening the second bottle.   The patient should be instructed to keep this study drug in a safe 
location out of extreme environmental conditions and out of the reach of children and pets, and 
be instructed that this drug is not to be taken by any individual other than the study patient.   Each 
patient will also be instructed that they are expected to return both bottles (even if empty) and all 
unused study drug at each clinic visit
1; unused drug will be counted to assess compliance with 
study drug treatment.  
Storage of the study drug at the investigational site should be under locked and secure conditions 
with limited staff access.   Study drug should be stored at 20-25°C/68-77°F in a 
temperature/humidity -monitored room; however, brief excursions (15-30°C/59-86°F) as defined 
in the Study Reference Manual (Investigational Product Receipt and Storage) are permitted without the sponsor’s approval. 
 
10.2. Dosing Instructions  
Patients will be instructed to take 1 tablet of randomly assigned study drug TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg or SL placebo tablet sublingually, under the tongue, each evening at bedtime starting at bedtime on Day 1 (Day of Visit 2) and continuing through Day 14. At  the Week 2 visit, patients will be 
instructed to increase the dose to 2 tablets at bedtime, adminis tered simultaneously and under the 
tongue beginning on Day 15 and continuing through the end of the study.    
The study drug should be taken at bedtime after teeth brushing and other oral care has been 
completed.  The mouth/sublingual area should be moist at the time of dosing, so the patient 
should drink a few sips of water prior to dosing, especially if prone to dry mouth.  Patients will be instructed to place the one or two SL tablets under their tongue (if two, placed simultaneously 
under tongue) and keep them there until they have dissolved (approximately 90 seconds).  They 
should not swallow, crush or chew the tablets.  Patients should not eat or drink (or chew gum) for at least 15 minutes after dosing, and preferably not to drink any hot, cold or acidic beverage until 
 
1 All references to a site/study center  visit for Weeks 2, 6, 10, and 14 include telephone visits for Weeks 2, 6, and 10, 
and home visits or telephone visit for Week 14/ET that are being allowed due to the circumstances of the COVID- 19 
pandemic.  
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 46 of 92  10.5. Study Drug Accountability and Reconciliation  
All patients will be expected to bring their bottle s of study drug with them to all study visits  
(including empty bottles), unless a telephone visit, where patie nts will be asked to count the 
number of tablets remaining in their  current bottles, document this on a form provided to patient, 
and return this form and study drug (with bottles) via courier to the site .  At each study visit, the 
site staff will inspect the drug bottle s, and perform a count of the tablets remaining in the bottles 
and document this in the patient’s record.  For telephone visits, drug accountability by the site 
staff will occur  after the study drug is returned to the site via courier.  For home visits  (Week 14 
or ET only) , site staff will collect bottles and conduct accountability upon return to the site . An 
assessment of drug adherence should be done by the study staff to ensure that the patient understands all dosing instructions and is taking the drug as prescribed. Patients will be asked for 
an explanation if the count of returned study drug tablets indicates a discrepancy between the 
expected number of tablets dosed and the number returned in the bottles. If it is found that the patient is not taking the study drug as expected, the patient will be re-counseled with 
instructions, and this should be noted in the patients’ records. A deviation should be recorded on 
any patient who is less than 70% compliant with dosing between visits and one of the Medical Monitors should be contacted.    
Tonix or its  designee will perform drug accountability which entails reconciliation between the 
amount of drug shipped to the study site, study drug assigned and dispensed to the patient 
(including returned unused assigned study drug), and study supplies that were never dispensed and/or assigned to patients.

The overall  and detailed  schedule for study procedures and visits  is provided in Table 2.  
11.1. Visit 1 (Day -35 to Day -7) 
11.1.1. Informed Consent  
Before the potential patient has undergone any study-related screening procedures, including any 
down -titration or withdrawal of medications, the nature of the study and the potential risks 
associated with it will be explained to the patient, and the patient will be given an opportunity to 
ask questions to his or her satisfaction.  After the questions are answered, but before proceeding 
further, the patient must read and sign a written informed consent form.  This signed informed 
consent form will be retained in the Investigator’s study file, and the date the patient signed the form will be entered into the CRF.  The patient will be provided with a copy of his or her signed 
and dated informed consent form.  The patient will be required to sign all updated informed 
consents. 
11.1.2. Screening Overview  
The first study visit, Screening Visit 1, will be where the stu dy is thoroughly explained to the 
prospective study patient, where written informed consent will be obtained and documented, and 
where certain protocol -specified study procedures and assessments will be completed.  Screening 
Visit 1 will start a variable length screening period.  The length of the screening period is to be 
no shorter than 7 days (since the “run-in” period during which baseline diary data are collected 
must be at least 7 days in duration), but may be as long as 35 days in order to accommodate medication wash -out or other study requirements. For extenuating circumstances, the total 
duration of the Screening period may be increased to up to a maximum of 49 days with Medical Monitor approval.   
If the patient does not need to complete any medication wash-out, and assuming all screening 
procedures have been successfully completed and initial eligibility has been confirmed, then the 
patient may begin the 7-day run-in period as soon as the screening visit has been completed.  Yet, d ue to potential delays in the issuance of a final laboratory report (e.g. when a confirmatory 
analysis is required , typically  on a urine drug screen analyte that is preliminarily positive) , it is 
recommended that the Baselin e Visit is scheduled at least 10 days from the Screening Visit. If 
the patient needs to complete medication wash -out prior to the start of the run-in period, the 
down titration schedule for the patient and the date on which the patient should start the run-in period should be provided in writing to the patient.  It is acceptable if another clinic visit is deemed necessary by the Investigator before initiating the run -in period (and should be recorded 
as an unscheduled visit).  It is important to remember th at any patient with a positive urine drug 
screen (for a drug requiring washout) must return to the site for a repeat UDS prior to beginning 
their 7 -day baseline data collection period.  The repeat UDS for benzodiazepines must be 
centrally analyzed; all others may be performed on site.  Patients who test positive for cannabis/ THC at the screening visit but are deemed eligible to continue are not required to 
undergo repeat UDS testing.

The following screening assessments/procedures will be completed in the following general order:  
• Obtain written informed consent to participate  
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Demographics 
• Medical history  
• Confir mation that patient satisfies the 2016 Revisions to the 2010/2011 fibromyalgia 
diagnostic criteria  (2010 American College of Rheumatology provisional diagnostic 
criteria /2011 self-report modification for survey and clinical research) 
• Prior medication history  
• Lifetime fibromyalgia pharmacotherapy history  
• NRS assessment of 7- day recall of average daily pain . Patients should only continue 
screening if they score ≥4 and ≤9.

Episode), C (Manic and Hypomanic Disorders), I (Alcohol Use Disorder), J 
(Substance Use Disorder), and K (Psychotic Disorders) 
• MSI-BPD  
• BDI-II.  Any patient with a BDI- II total score > 24 or a response of 2 or 3 to item #9 
(suicidal ideation) is n ot eligible for randomization. 
• “Baseline/Screening” version of the C- SSRS.  Any patient with C- SSRS Type 3, 4 or 
5 ideation during the preceding 6 months or any suicidal behavior during the preceding 12 months should be screen failed. 
a. Results of the C- SSRS and BDI -II should be reviewed together at each visit to 
ensure (1) the patient  is not experiencing suicidal ideation or worsening 
depression that requires intervention and (2) both scales are providing a consistent 
clinical picture of the patient with regard to suicidality.  
• Physical examination, including vital signs, height, weight and BMI . Patients with 
BMI>45 is not eligible.  
• Thorough exam ination  of the oral cavity.  This examination should include a careful 
visual examination of the sublingual area, tongue, buccal mucosa, lips, palate and gums, aided with a tongue depressor, as well as palpation of the lips, hard palate, and floor of the mouth. Any abnormalities should be noted on the oral cavity examination source document.

• Drug screening 
• Serum  pregnancy test (for women of child- bearing potential)  processed at central lab  
• 12-lead electrocardiogram  
• Only those patients meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will 
be eligible to continue.  Eligible patients will:  
a. Be asked to complete the online Accurate Pain Reporting and Placebo Response Reduction training. 
b. Be instructed regarding the questions that will be asked of them on the daily diary 
and receive in formation and materials necessary t o initiate their daily diary 
record, along with information of what they are to do if they have difficulties 
recording their information.  Patients will be asked to start the diary that evening.  
Due to limitations in the reporting window, patients that ar e planning on 
international travel during the study period, or who work night shifts, should not 
be considered for the study. 
c. Receive an appointment to return to the clinic for Visit 2.  
d. Receive a schedule for down -titration (if required) of any prohibited medications 
to be discontinued. 
11.2. Visit 2 ( Baseline: Day 1) 
Visit 2 should be scheduled after the patient has completed their medication wash-out and completed  at least 7 days of diary  data entries .  If the patient meets randomization criteria, the 
patient w ill be authorized to continue in the study, will undergo several baseline assessments at 
this visit, and will be randomized via the randomization system to receive double-blind study drug. 
If the patient does not satisfy randomization criteria, the patient has failed to qualify for this 
study and should be considered a screen failure, with the reason documented.  There is no 
requirement for a follow-up vi sit for screen failures.  
11.2.1. Randomization Criteria  
Only patients meeting all of the following randomization criteria are eligible for randomization: 
1. Continues to meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including urine and blood test results, 
and is familiar with the diary system.  
2. Patient’s FM pain satisfies the following criteria, as assessed by diary pain s cores (24 -hour 
recall):  
a. A mean pain intensity score ≥4 and ≤9 on the 11-point (0- 10) NRS scale for the 7 days 
immediately preceding Visit 2; and  
b. No more than 2 individual days with a score <4 on the 7 days immediately preceding 
Visit 2; and  
c. No score of 10 on any of the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2, and

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 50 of 92  d. Pain scores recorded on at least 5 out of the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2.  
11.2.2. Baseline Visit  
For patients who have qualified for randomization, these assessments and procedures will be 
completed in the following general order: 
• Confirm patient’s eligibility based on the diary data collected during the preceding 7 days   
• Review completed diary data with the patient 
• Update medical history (with any changes noted since screening)  
• Assess chan ges in medication history and concomitant medications 
• Have the patient complete the BDI -II.  If the BDI score is >24, the patient is not 
eligible for randomization and should be screen failed.  In addition, a score > 1 on item #9 (suicidal ideation) is exclusionary. 
• Administer the “Since Last Visit” version of the C- SSRS.  Any patient exhibiting 
Type 3, 4, or 5 suicidal ideation or any suicidal behavior since the Screening visit should be screen -failed and assessed for appropriate follow- up care.  
a. Results of the C- SSRS and BDI -II should be reviewed together to ensure (1) the 
patient is not experiencing suicidal ideation or worsening depression that requires intervention and (2) both scales are providing a consistent clinical picture of the patient with regard to suicidality.  
• Assess occurrence of adverse events  
• Conduct a brief physical examin ation, including vital signs and  weight 
• Conduct a visual exam ination  of the oral cavity.  This examination should include a 
careful  visual examination of the sublingual area, tongue, buccal mucosa, lips, palate 
and gums.  Any abnormalities should be noted on the oral exam source document.  It is recommended that both non-significant as well as significant findings be noted so 
that there is a complete and accurate baseline assessment available for comparison to 
findings at later visits.  
• Perform u rine pregnan cy test (for women of child -bearing potential) 
• Patients should complete the online training on accurate pain reporting and placebo 
response. 
• Patient should complete the following patient-reported outcomes (PRO):

• Once it has been confirmed that the pa tient remains eligible, r andomize patient via 
IRT Randomization System 
• Dispense bottle of double-blind study drug as assigned via the IRT 
• Review patient instructions regarding study drug dosing and diary completion 
(Section  10.2 and  Section  12.2.6).  
11.2.3. Study Drug  Dispensing  
Qualified patients will be assigned a treatment bottle  number via the randomization system 
(Section  10.3).  The treatment bottle  numbers are random and unique and will not necessarily be 
dispensed in any particular order.  The treatment bottle  number will be recorded in the patient’s 
records. 
11.2.4. Patient Instructions  
After all assessments have been completed and before leaving the clinic at Visit 2, patients should: 
• Be dispensed a single unopened bottle of double-blind study drug.  The patient should be instructed to begin dosing with study drug at bedtime, starting the night of Visit 2.  
• Receive instruction regarding proper sublingual dosing technique and the time of expected dosing. 
• Receive reinforcement about the importance of completing all questions that will be 
asked on the daily diary and receive re-instruction, if necessary, on what they are to 
do if they have difficulties recording their information.  NOTE:  Patients should be instructed that they should complete their diary within the required time window. 
• Receive an appointment for Visit 3.  
• The patient should be instructed to call the site if they develop a lesion under the 
tongue or any other localized AE in the oral cavity thought potentially related to study 
drug exposure,  specifically to determine if  an unscheduled visit for an oral cavity 
examination is necessary prior  to the next scheduled visit.  Reports of oral numbness, 
tingling or noticeable taste (e .g., bitter, metallic , unpleasant ) after dosing do not 
require unscheduled examinations.   
11.3. Visit 3 (Week 2)  
Visit 3 should occur after 2 weeks of treatment, on Day 15 -4/+ 7 days.  For those patients unable 
to return to the site  (i.e. extenuating circumstances due to COVID-19 pandemic), a telephone 
visit is an option. All ass essments should be performed with exceptions of the ones specifically 
noted with comments in parenthesis.

PROs and study drug (and bottles) to the site via courier.   
11.5. Visit 6 (Week 1 4 or Early Termination ) 
11.5.1. Visit 6 (Week 1 4) 
Visit 6 should occur after 14 weeks of double-blind study drug treatment, scheduled at Day  99    
-4/+7 days.  At this visit, the patient will return all study drug and be instructed that there is no 
longer any need to complete the diary.  I f circumstances in volving the COVID -19 have resulted 
in the patient being reluctant to attend  this visit at the clinic , it should be strongly emphasized 
that a complete safety assessment at end of study necessitates the in -person visit.  If the patient 
absolutely refuses or it is impossible to attend the clinic  because of a COVID-19 pandemic-
related “stay at home” order or similar , the PI should discuss the case with the Medical Monitor . 
Approval f or a Week 14  telephone visit may be granted by the Medical Monitors on a case by 
case basis.   In cases in which it is feasible for a site’s own research staff, with or without a 
research clinician,  to make a home visit for Week 14/Visit 6 (or ET), a home visit should be 
conducted rather than a telephone visit in order to collect greater safety data than the telephon e 
visits allow . Home visits may be conducted by any qualified staff member and will allow , in 
addition to all procedures conducted in a telephone visit, collection of vital signs and  weight, and

11.5.2. Early Termination (Post-Randomization) 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, patients have the right to withdraw from t he 
study at any time for any reason, and they will be advised of this right.  The Investigator and 
Tonix also have the right to remove patients from the study.  Specific reasons for removal of a 
patient from the study could include, but are not limited to: 
• An AE  
• An illness that, in the judgment of the Investigator or T onix, might invalidate the 
study data or place the patient at risk  
• The request of the patient, Investigator, or Tonix, whether for administrative or other reasons - including halt of the study for efficacy or futility  at the interim analysis  
• Pregnancy  
Patients who wish to terminate their participation in the study should be instructed to come to the 
clinic for an Early Termination Visit.  The purpose of the Early Termination visit is to obtain 
critical information about the patient’s participation and should be scheduled preferably before there has been a substantial lapse in study drug usage.  However, even if there has been a drug 
lapse, the patient should be encouraged to return to the clinic for this visit and should be 
instructed to return all study drug and bottles.  NOTE:  These visit procedures are not intended for patients who fail to qualify for randomization or for patients who withdraw from the study prior to receipt of a dose of double-blind study drug. 
The following assessments and procedures are completed at this visit as ordered below: 
• Document reason for early termination 
• Assess changes in medication history and concomitant medications 
• Assess study drug compliance (Telephone visit exception - patient will be instructed 
to count the number of tablets remaining in their current bottles, document this on a patient provided form, and return this form with the study drug (including bottles) to the site for assessment of compliance in a p re-paid pre- addressed courier envelope

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 59 of 92  Once these assessments have been completed, the patient may be discharged from the study, 
provided that there is no need for additional follow-up to continue to monitor an adverse event or 
other condition. 
11.6. Unscheduled Visit  
Patients may need to be seen at other times than the scheduled study visits for additional safety 
assessments or to follow-up, as medically necessary, on clinical laboratory, physician 
examination, or other findings.  If an additional study visit is warranted, or occurs, the date and nature of the visit will be documented in the CRF and in the source documents. 
Patients should contact the investigative site as soon as possible if they experience a lesion under 
the tongue or any other oral cavity AE potentially related to stu dy drug exposure (other than 
transient numbness, tingling or bitter /metallic/unpleasant taste  after dosing), specifically to 
determine if they should return to the clinic for an unscheduled oral cavity examination.

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 60 of 92  12. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Screening Assessments Not Discussed Elsewhere  
12.1.1. Diagnosis of Fibromyalgia (2016 Revisions to the 2010/2011 Fibromyalgia 
Diagnostic Criteria) 
The patient is eligible for this study if he/she has a diagnosis of primary FM as defined by the 
2016 Revisions to the 2010/2011 Fibromyalgia Diagnostic C riteria  (2010 American College of 
Rheumatology provisional diagnostic criteria/2011 self-report modification for survey and clinical research ) (Wolfe et al, 2016
) (Inclusion Criterion # 2).  This diagnosis is determined by 
satisfaction of all  of the following: 
• Generalized pain, defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions, and  
• Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months; and  
• WPI score ≥7 and SSS score ≥5; OR WPI between 4-6 and SSS scor e ≥9 
• The patient does not have another disorder that would otherwise explain his/her pain. 
The 2016 Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria will be assessed at Visit 1.    
12.1.2. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Visit 1 and reviewed by the Investigator for the purpose of 
excluding from participation patients who have either a history of or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g., significant arrhythmias or heart block , left bundle 
branch block (LBBB), heart failure, symptomatic  coronary artery disease,  myocardial infarction  
within the preceding 2 years ) or a QTcF at Screening >450  msec if male or 470 msec if female.  
The ECG interpretation by the Investigator will be recorded in the CRF as normal, abnormal but clinically insignificant, or abnormal and clinically significant.  In addition, the standard ECG 
parameters including rhythm, heart rate, and intervals for RR, QT, PR, QRS, and QTcF 
(Fridericia’s correction) will be recorded.  
If the Investigator has any concerns about the e ligibility of a patient or wishes to confirm his/her 
assessment, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor for this study. 
12.2. Efficacy Assessments 
The primary efficacy endpoint and many of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints in this study are derived from subjective patient- completed assessments.  Therefore, it is critical 
that these assessments are conducted in the specified order, according to specific instructions, and in a setting where the patient has minimal distractions and sufficient time to complete them.  After completion of these assessments, the study coordinator should review the responses for completeness with the patient.  
12.2.1. Daily 24- hour pain recall using 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  
Patients will provide a nume ric assessment of their pain (24 -hour recall), via the diary, using an 
11-point (0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain) NRS scale.  Patients will be asked to complete 
this assessment on a daily basis starting from the Screening Visit and throughout the double-
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 61 of 92  blind treatment period.  Additional information regarding the patient diary is provided in 
Section  12.2.6. 
12.2.2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
The PGIC is a FM -specific validated instrument to gauge the patient’s assessment of change in 
condition.  This form will be completed by the patient at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6.  The patient will answer a single question:  
Since the start of the study, overall my fibromyalgia is: 
1 = Very much improved 
2 = Much improved 3 = Minimally improved  
4 = No change 5 = Minimally worse  
6 = Much worse 7 = Very much worse  
12.2.3. Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire - Revised (FIQR)  
The patient’s total score on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (revised version) will be 
assessed at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and  6.  The FIQR is made up of 3 domains: functional (9 questions), 
overall  impact  (2 questions) and symptoms (10 questions). 
12.2.4. Clinic Assessment of Pain (24 -hour and weekly recall)  
In addition to the diary  assessments of 24 -hour pain recall ( Section  12.2.1), patients will be asked 
to rate their average pain on paper using the 11-point (0- 10) NRS scale at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
using both a 24-hour and 7- day recall interval.  There is no requirement to reconcile the pain 
responses obtained from these paper assessments to the 24 -hour daily diary assessments.  
12.2.5. PROMIS Scales  
PROMIS is the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 
(www.nihpromis.org), an NIH -funded initiative to develop instruments to be used across chronic 
conditions. 
Two PROMIS Scales will be assessed in this study, including the sleep disturbance scale 
(version 8a) and the fatigue scale (version 8a).  Each of these two  scales will be assessed at 
Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
12.2.6. Diary Assessments 
The daily diary is an important aspect of this study, and all patients must receive training 
explaining what is being asked of them, when to complete the diary, and how to use the diary system effectively.  This includes a brief online training on accurate pain reporting and placebo 
response. Patients will need to receive instructions and a password that uniquely identifies them 
when they log into the diary system along with instructions about what to do if they have difficulty completing the diary . 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 62 of 92   
The diary should be started the evening of Visit 1 and completed daily until Visit 6 (Week 14). 
Patients should be instructed to complete the diary in the evening before  dosing. Once the pati ent 
has properly identified themselves, the diary will prompt answers to the following: 
• Rate your average pain during the past 24 hours on a scale from 0- 10, where zero is 
no pain and 10 is worst possible pain. 
• Rate your sleep quality last night on a scale from 0 -10 where 0 is the best possible 
sleep and 10 is the worst possible sleep. 
After randomization to study drug at Visit 2, the following questions will be added  to the daily 
diary (starting in the evening of the day after randomization, Day 2):  
• Did you take your study drug last night? (Yes/No)  
• If yes, how many tablets of study drug did you take last night? (1 tablet/2 tablets) 
 
The study staff will be expected to monitor patient adherence in completing the diary throughout 
the study, and will be instructed to call the patient should any problems or significant non-
adherence be observed.  During the screening period, there are dia ry compliance requirements 
that must be met in order for the patient to qualify for randomization.  Patients who have been 
randomized should be encouraged to continue to complete their diary.  Patients will receive a 
reminder to c omplete their diary if the y miss diary entries .  Patients who miss two diary entries  
will be flagged by the IRT system, and site staff will be alerted to contact patients for re -training 
and to instruct the patient on the importance of routine completion of their diary. 
12.2.7. Assessment of Changes in Sexual Function: Changes in Sexual Functioning 
Questionnaire Short -Form (CSFQ -14) 
The CSFQ -14 ( Keller et al. 2006 ) is validated scale with internal reliability designed to allow a 
patient to self -evaluate his or her sexual behaviors or problems in a number of areas.  The CSFQ-
14 will be administered at Baseline (Visit 2) and Week 14/ET (Visit 6).  It yields a total score, 
three subscales corresponding to phases of the sexual response cycle (i.e. desire, arousal, orgasm), and five subscales corresponding to important dimensions of sexual functioning.  It is 
considered a useful scale for assessing sexual side effects of medications.  For all items, higher 
scores reflect higher sexual functioning.  For 12 of the 14 items, higher sexual functioning corresponds to greater frequency or enjoyment/pleasure (e.g. 1=never to 5 = every day).  For two 
items (item 10, assessing loss of interest after arousal for women and priapism for men, and item 
14, assessing painful orgasm), higher sexual functioning corresponds to lower frequency (e.g. 1=every day; 5=never). Items 10 and 14 are included in the total score but not in any subscale scores.  
12.3. Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, responses on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, responses on the BDI- II, and by clinical laboratory and physical 
examination findings, including visual inspection of the oral cavity. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 63 of 92   
12.3.1. Adverse Events  
Patients will be monitored for AEs throughout the study.  Any clinically significant abnormal 
findings at screening should be recorded in medical history.  Adverse Events will be recorded 
after the informed consent is signed.  AEs that are spontaneously reported or elicited or observed are to be recorded on the CRF with the date, time of onset, date and time of resolution, severity, 
seriousness, causality (relationship to study drug), actions required, and outcome.  Additional 
questions will be triggered for AEs involving the oral cavity.   
To elicit AEs, non-leading, simple questions with minimal connotations should be used as the 
initial questions at all evaluation points during the study.  Examples of these questions can be: 
• How have you felt since your l ast visit?  
• Have you had any health problems since your last visit? 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as deemed appropriate.  
If an AE is unresolved on the last day of the study, an effort should be made to follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the patient is lost to follow -up, or there is some other resolution 
of the event. 
There are many symptoms associated with fibromyalgia that can vary in intensity and frequency 
over time.  Only symptoms that worsen or become more frequent, and in the opinion of the patient are outside of their normal experience, should be reported as adverse events. 
Additional information regarding definition and reporting requirements for adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and pregnancies is provided in Section  14. 
12.3.2. Oral Adverse Events  
Patients should contact the investigative site as soon as possible if they experience a lesi on under 
the tongue or any other AE thought to be due to study drug exposure (other than transient numbness, tingling or bitter/metallic/unpleasant taste after dosing),  specifically to determine 
whether an unscheduled visit is necessary prior to the next scheduled visit.  If the patient does not call the site to discuss the oral cavity adverse event, the oral cavity exam should be performed at the next regularly scheduled visit and any findings noted.  If a telephone visit, the 
patient  should be queried  if there have been any changes or problems in the oral cavity. Patients 
reporting any concerning lesion description or painful processes in the oral cavity possibly 
related to study drug exposure should be strongly urged to come into the clinic for an 
unscheduled visit for an oral cavity exam . This exam must be performed by a qualified licensed 
medical professional who has been specifically trained and certified by the Sponsor to conduct 
this exam.  In circumstances in which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it is not possible for the 
patient to return to the clinic for the Unscheduled Visit exam, a clinician certified by the Sponsor to conduct oral cavity examination should contact the patient by phone and obtain greater history and description of the oral cavity AE by patient, potentially augmented with images of oral 
cavity taken by the patient and sent to the site for the examining clinician to textually  document 
in the oral exam source document. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 64 of 92  12.3.3. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II) 
The BDI -II is a 21 -item measure of the severity of current depressive symptoms, extensively 
validated for use in both medical and mental health populations.  While this instrument does not 
provide a psychiatric diagnosis of depression, it does provide a continuous scale for measuring the severity of depressive symptomatology.  Scoring allows for the identification of mild, 
moderate, and severe levels of depressive symptoms, and for the quantification of change in 
status over ti me. 
The patient will be asked to complete this questionnaire at all in -clinic study visits , and for all 
telephone visits.  The BDI -II will be  sent by courier to the patient in advance of the phone call . 
At Visit 1 and Visit 2, patients whose responses are indicative of suicidal ideation, as defined by a response to Item #9 of >1, will be excluded from participation, and appropriate intervention 
prescribed.  In addition, patients whose total BDI score is > 24 at either Visit 1 or Visit 2 will not 
be eligible  for randomization and should be screen failed (and referred for appropriate 
psychological evaluation or care, if indicated).  After Visit 1, the responses to Question #9 
should be monitored to ensure that there is no increase in suicidal ideation during the study (and 
to assess correlation with C -SSRS findings) and the total score also followed to ensure the 
patient’s psychological status remains stable. 
12.3.4. Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a questionnaire developed by researchers at Columbia University to assess and 
track suicide risk and behavior.  This scale is intended to be used by individuals who have 
received training in its administration.  The questions contained in the Columbia- Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale are suggested probes.  Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual administering the scale. 
Two versions of this questionnaire will be utilized in this study.  At Visit 1, the 
“Baseline/ Screeni ng” questionnaire will be administered , and the recall periods will be “lifetime” 
and “within the past 6 months” for suicidal ideation and “within the past 1 year” for suicidal 
behavior. Patients whose responses are indicative of suicidal ideation with intent and/or plan 
(e.g., Type 3, 4 or 5 suicidal ideation) within the past 6 months or a history of suicidal behavior 
within the past year will be excluded from participation, with recommended referral for appropriate intervention. 
At all subsequent visits ( Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), the “Since Last Visit” version of the 
questionnaire will be administered, and the recall period on this will be “since the last visit”.  
Note that if there has been appropriate intervention should be prescribed. 
12.3.5. Physical Examinati on and Vital Signs  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Visit 1.  The complete physical 
examination may exclude rectal, genitourinary, and breast examinations. 
Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and heart rate, temperature, and weight) wil l be assessed at 
Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (unless a telephone visit , in which case vital signs will not be assessed at 
Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6/ET) .  Height will be measured without shoes at Visit 1 only.  The BMI will 
be a derived variable, based  on height and weight entries (but a Week 14/ET weight will not be 
assessed , if approved by the Medical Monitor for a telephone visit) . 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 65 of 92  12.3.6. Visual Examination  of the Oral Cavity 
A thorough examination (visual plus palpation) of the oral cavity will be completed at Visit 1, 
with visual examinations performed at each subsequent study visit (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6/ ET). 
Visual exam of the oral cavity will not be performed if  it is a t elephone visit. This examination 
should include a careful visual examination of the sublingual area, tongue, buccal mucosa, lips, palate and gums, aided with a tongue depressor, as well as palpation of the lips, hard palate, and 
floor of the mouth.  
Each examination must be performed by a qualified medical professional who has been 
specifically trained and certified by the Sponsor for this exam ination .  An oral cavity  
examination may also be required at an unscheduled visit if a patient reports an oral AE t hat 
requires follow-up prior to the next scheduled visit. 
 
12.3.7. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The clinical laboratory evaluations to be performed in this trial are listed in Table 3.  Those 
marked as screening tests will be performed at Screening only.  All other tests will be performed at Screening Visit 1 and at Visit 6 (Week 14) or Early Termination, aside from urine pregnancy tests and ad hoc urine drug screens.  
With the exception of the urine pregnancy test or an ad hoc urine drug screen, all clinical 
laboratory evaluations will be analyzed via a central clinical laboratory, and information 
regarding appropriate sample volume, collection tubes, sample labeling and handling, and 
shipment will be provided in the clinical laboratory manual. 
As per exclusion criterion #14, any patient with evidence during the preceding year of drug or 
alcohol use disorder by MINI or hist ory is ineligible.   
A centrally analyzed urine drug screen (UDS) will be performed at Visit 1.  If the patient has a 
positive drug screen at Visit 1 due to a drug of abuse (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy) or due to a non-disclosed opioid, amphetamine or benzodiazepine, then he/she should be screen failed.   As discussed in Section 9.2, patients utilizing cannabis /THC  are to be excluded if MINI 
criteria are met for  greater than MILD Cannabis  Use Disorder during the preceding 12 months, 
OR if the investigator is concerned that the patient’s use of cannabis/THC  could interfere with 
patient ’s ability to provide reliable data or comply with the protocol.  Otherwise, patients 
utilizing cannabis or THC products are allowed, w ith caution .   
 The screening drug screen will test for THC to provide the investigator with information regarding exposure, and to ensure that all usage is disclosed and taken into consideration when conducting MINI Module J. Repeat testing of THC  is not necessary for patien ts testing positive 
for cannabis/THC at screening . 
Any patient deemed appropriate for washout of a prescription opioid, benzodiazepine or 
amphetamine will require a repeat UDS before the beginning of their 7 days of baseline data 
collection leading up to V isit 2, the results of which must be negative and available for review 
before randomization may occur.  Therefore, these patients will need to return for an 
unscheduled visit after the first 2 weeks of washout have been completed.  All benzodiazepine 
drug screening must be sent to the central laboratory for analysis, hence results may be delayed; 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 66 of 92  all other repeat urine drug screening may be conducted on -site.  Patients do not have to wait for 
confirmation of negative centralized benzodiazepine results befor e starting their 7 -day baseline 
data collection phase, but all results must be confirmed negative prior to randomization.   
Patients with a positive screening UDS due to an allowed prescription drug (e.g., headache 
remedies containing butalbital) do not require further drug screening.   
Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality 
should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely 
to resolve.  If such abnormalities do not return to normal within a reasonable period, their 
etiology should be identified and Tonix or designee should be notified.  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory values after the Screening visit labs will be recorded as AEs . 
 
NOTE:  A screening TSH level greater than 1.5 times higher than the upper limit of normal, or ALT or AST level > 2 times the upper limit of normal, is exclusionary; however, the patient may 
remain in screening to undergo repeat LFT assessments if a transient  abnormality (eg, viral illness; 
effects of a medication being discontinued, etc) is thought to be responsible for their initial elevation.    Table 3: Clinical Laboratory Assessments

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 67 of 92  d Urine drug screening will be conducted on all patients at Screening and, if necessary, prior to the beginning of the 7-day 
baseline data collection phase in patients washing off opioids, amphetamines , or benzodiazepines  and who otherwise qualify 
for the study.  
12.3.8. Pharmacogenomics Testing  
For pharmacogenomic analysis, a single blood draw collected in one PAXgene DNA tube will be 
obtained from each patient after they have provided separate written, signed informed consent 
for pharmacogenomic analysis. Due to circumstances caused by the COVID -19 pandemic and 
possibility of no further in- clinic visits after Baseline visit (Visit 2), it is strongly recommended 
that the pharmacogenomics blood sample be obtained at the Baseline vi sit (Visit 2). The purpose 
of this testing is to allow exome sequencing and analysis for genetic variants related to treatment response to TNX-102 SL. It is presumed that unused extracted DNA sample will be stored up to 
fifteen years, and potentially utilized to develop a pharmacogenomic test for determining 
likelihood of treatment response to TNX-102 SL.  A decision not to participate in optional pharmacogenomic testing will not affect the patient’s eligibility for the main study. Patients have 
the right to stop participating at any time during the study or during the time of sample storage, 
and, if a patient decides to withdraw from the pharmacogenomics portion of this study, any remaining sample will be destroyed and not used for further research.  Data c ollected before a 
patient’s withdrawal from the pharmacogenomics portion of this study will remain in the research database and included in the sponsor’s analyses and reports.

13.4. Efficacy Analyses  
13.4.1. Efficacy Endpoints  
 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
• Change from Baseline to the Week 14  endpoint in the diary NRS weekly average of 
daily self -reported average pain severity scores.  
 
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
 The six  secondary efficacy endpoints listed below are considered key secondary endpoints 
and will be tested in that order: 
• Proportion of patients with a PGIC rating of “very much improved” or “much improved” at the Week 14  endpoint  
• Change from baseline in the FIQR symptoms domain score at the Week 14  endpoint 
• Change from baseline in the FIQR function domain score at the Week 14 endpoint 
• Change from baseline in the PROMIS score for sleep disturbance at the Week 14  
endpoint 
• Change from baseline in the PROMIS score for fatigue at the Week 14 endpoint 
• Change from baseline in the weekly average of the daily diary assessment of sleep quality at t he Week 14  endpoint 
 
 Exploratory efficacy endpoints: 
• Change from baseline in the in- clinic assessment of pain - 24- hour recall  
• Change from baseline in the in- clinic assessment of pain - weekly recall  
• Proportion of patients with a ≥30% improvement from baseline to Weeks 1 -14 in the 
daily self -reported average pain severity score  
• Proportion of patients with a ≥50% improvement from baseline to Weeks 1 -14 in the 
daily self -reported average pain severity scores  
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 70 of 92  • Proportion of patients with a PGIC rating of “very much improved” or “much 
improved” at all post- randomization clinic visits  
• Change from baseline in the FIQR total score, overall impact domain score, and individual item scores at all post- randomization clinic visits  
• Change from baseline in the FIQR symptoms domain score and function domain scores at all post -randomization clinic visits  
• Change from baseline in the PROMIS score for sleep disturbance at all post-randomization clinic visits  
• Change from baseline in the PROMIS score for fatigue at all post-randomization 
clinic visits  
• Change from baseline in the weekly average of the daily diary assessment of sleep 
quality at Weeks 1 -14 
• Change from baseline in the weekly average of the daily self -reported average pain 
severity scores at Weeks 1 -14 
• Changes from baseline in patient-rated Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short- Form (CSFQ -14) in females and in males, analyzed separately  
13.4.2. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy parameter will be the contrast between active and placebo in the weekly mean change from baseline pain score at the Week 14 endpoint.   The weekly pain score will be based on the weekly average of the da ily patient self -reported 24- hour recall average pain 
severity scores using an 11-point (0-10) NRS.   
The primary ITT analysis will provide an estimate of the following causal estimand for the 
primary analysis:  the difference in the weekly mean change fro m Baseline of the daily patient 
self-reported 24-hour recall average pain severity rating using an 11-point (0-10) NRS evaluated 
at the Week 14 endpoint in all randomized patients attributable to the initially randomized treatment assignment.  
The primary analysis will use a MMRM approach with multiple imputation for missing data.  Covariates in the model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, center, study week , and treatment by study week interaction, as well as the continuous fixed cova riates of 
baseline score and baseline score by study week interaction.  Please see the separate SAP for more details on the primary and secondary analyses. 
13.4.3. Sensitivity Analyses 
The primary analysis will be followed by several sensitivity analyses.  The SAP will include full 
details of the sensitivity analyses planned for this study. 
13.4.4. Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population only.  For PGIC, patients with a 
“very much improved” or “much improved” response at the Week 14 endpoint will be 
considered responders. Patients with results in any other category or who discontinue early will 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 71 of 92  be considered non-responders.  PGIC responder status (yes/no) will be analysed using logistic 
regression with treatment and site  as categorical effects.  In addition, odds ratios and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
Analysis of continuous secondary endpoints and adjustments for missing data will be described in detail in the SAP.  Significance tests of treatment differences will be tested at the two -sided 
0.05 level and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  
To adjust for multiplicity and to control for overall type I error, a sequential test procedure will be applied to the efficacy endpoi nts.  If the primary analysis produces a result that is statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level, a significance level of 0.05 will be used for comparing the secondary 
endpoints in an ordered fashion.  If the analysis for a secondary endpoint does not produce a 
statistically significant result at the 0.05 level, then the remaining secondary endpoint analyses 
will automatically be considered non -significant regardless of the p-value produced. The order in 
which the secondary endpoints are to be tested wil l be specified in the SAP.  
No other adjustments for multiplicity will be made and other p -values displayed in the output 
will be considered for descriptive summary purposes only and will not be used for formal inference.  Full details regarding the statistical analyses for the listed endpoints, including 
graphical presentations, can be found in the SAP.  
13.4.5. Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
Exploratory efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population.  Details on exploratory efficacy analyses can be found in the SAP. 
13.5. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population.  The analysis of safety assessments in this study will include summaries of the following safety and tolerability data collected for each patient:  
• Incidence of Adverse Events  
• Changes from baseline in c linical laboratory tests  
• Changes from baseline in vital signs 
• Changes from baseline in physical examination findings including examination of the oral cavity  
• Monitoring suicidality using the C- SSRS  
• Changes from baseline in BDI -II scores  
All AEs, treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAE ), and serious adverse events ( SAE ) will be 
coded using the MedDRA . 
An AE summary table will be presented for the following: 
 
• All TEAEs  
• TEAEs  by severity 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 72 of 92  • TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation  
• TEAEs by relationship 
• SAEs  
• Oral cavity TEAEs  
• Oral cavity TEAEs by severity 
Summaries of incidence rates (frequencies and percentages), of individual AEs by MedDRA 
SOC and preferred term will be prepared.  Such summaries will be displayed for all TEAEs, oral cavity TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severity, and TEAEs by strongest relationship to study drug. 
Each patient will be counted only once within each summation level (SOC; preferred term).  If a 
patient experiences more than one TEAE within each summation level, the TEAE with the 
strongest relationship or the maximum severity, as appropriate, will be included in the summaries of relat ionship and severity. 
In the AE data listings, all AEs w ill be displayed. 
Laboratory data include analytes for Chemistry and Hematology, and these will be summarized 
by treatment and visit for the Safety Population.  Descriptive summaries of actual values and 
changes from baseline will be presented by study visit and last on- treatment assessment for each 
clinical laboratory analyte and each treatment  group.  95% confidence intervals will be presented 
for change from baseline.  
Laboratory values will be displayed in the data listings with their corresponding normal ranges, and those values that are outside the normal range will be flagged.  For each laboratory analyte, 
shifts in assessments of abnormality from baseline to each scheduled time point will be presented 
in shift tables.  
A by -patient listing of all clinical laboratory data will also be provided.  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from baseline at each assessment time point and last on -treatment assessment will be 
calculated for vital signs including weight, BMI, body temperature, pulse rate, systolic blood 
pressure and diastolic blood pressure. 95% confidence intervals will be presented for change 
from baseline.  
Based on the C- SSRS results, the overall number of patients with lifetime and/or current suicidal 
ideation (by item and category), suicidal behavior (by item and category), or s elf-injurious 
behavior at the screening and baseline visit will be summarized by visit and treatment group.  Additionally, the overall number of patients with any suicidal ideation or behavior (by type and 
in total) or self -injurious behavior while on- treatment will be provided by treatment group. 
Patients will only be counted once for on- treatment at the worst- case response for each item.  
Physical examination data and oral examination data will be presented in data listings.  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD , median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from baseline at each assessment time point and last on -treatment assessment will be 
calculated for BDI -II scores. 95% confidence intervals will be presented for change from 
baseline.

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 73 of 92  13.6. Interim Ana lyses  
An interim analysis will be completed after the first 50% of patients have completed the study 
(or early terminated) for the purpose of sample size re-estimation, early stop for efficacy and early stop for futility.  This will be evaluated by an independent data monitoring committee; only recommendations on early stopping or the sample size adjustment will be communicated to the sponsor.   In the case of an early stop (for either efficacy or futility), all ongoing subjects will be asked to return to the clinic and complete an early termination visit, and the study will be halted once all subjects have completed their termination visit.  
 
Full details of the  interim  analysis will be included in the SAP and finalized prior to execution of 
the interim anal ysis.

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 74 of 92  14. DEFINITIONS, RECORDING, AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
14.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
According to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidance E2A, Clinical Safety 
Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administe red a pharmaceutical 
product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
A TEAE is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study treatment or was present 
prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following initiation of study 
treatment.  
14.2. Adverse Event Recording  
14.2.1. Coding the Adverse Event  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs.  MedDRA® will be used as the 
standard coding dictionary for AEs and in describing the patient’s medical history, and the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to code concomitant 
medications.  Informal descriptions should be avoided. 
14.2.2. Severity of Adverse Event  
AEs should be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the following definitions. 
• Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of minor irritant type 
causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a 
medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
• Moder ate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by simple therapeutic measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe: Ev ents interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious “and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severi ty) of a specific event 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, maybe of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcom e or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 75 of 92  14.2.3. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the following 
descriptions. 
• Not Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related to the study 
drug beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is, another cause of the event is most plausible; 
and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the 
event and the administration of study drug and/or a causal relationship is considered 
biologically implausible.  
• Unlikely Related:  This category applies to an AE that could reasonably be considered 
caused by something else, and where there is no known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug. 
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from  administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected study drug, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
14.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Drug Reactions  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically significantly abnormal 
laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) so that T onix may comply with regulatory obligations.  If the SAE is life -threatening or fatal, it 
must be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) immediately, by facsimile and telephone.  For these 
and all other SAEs, an SAE report form must be completed and sent by facsimile or email to 
Tonix or its designee(s) within 1 working day of the site’s initial awareness of the event.  These requirements apply equally to all patients, regardless of the study phase or the at- risk patient’s 
treatment assignment or dosage. 
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untow ard medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening, 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth def ect, or  
• Is an important medical event 
 
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

for this study, in light of t he nature of the study drug.   
14.4. Pregnancy  
The active pharmaceutical product in TNX -102 SL is cyclobenzaprine HCl, which is in 
Pregnancy Category B (See Appendix 2 for AMRIX® Package Insert ).  All pregnancies 
occurring during the study (after exposure to study drug) or within 28 days after discontinuation of study drug must be followed until resolution (i.e., birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the pregnancy).  Any patient found to be pregnant at any time during the study 
will be withdrawn from the study immediately.  Any pregnancy outcome that meets the criteria 
for an SAE will be reported as an SAE.

TERMINATING THE STUDY  
15.1. Protocol Modifications and Deviations  
The Investigator will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the written protocol and 
protocol amendments.  All protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the 
appropriate EC/IRB before the revised protocol can be implemented.  Emergency revisions that 
eliminate an apparent hazard to patients do not require preapproval by the EC/IRB.  However, the EC/IRB must be notified, in writing, as soon as possible after the modification has been made.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to Tonix. 
15.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time at the discretion of Tonix, its designee, or the P rincipal Investigator.  Should premature termination be considered necessary, written 
notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided, and specific 
procedures for termination will be arranged.  Circumstances that may warrant premature study 
termination include, but are not limited to, the following. 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients 
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate  
• Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol  
• Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data 
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug 
• Either halting the study for success or futility from the results of the interim analysis  
In the event that the study is terminated prematurely, all study materials must be returned to Tonix or its designee.

16.1. Ethical Cond uct of the Study  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by the 18th World Medical 
Assembly General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and amendments and clarifications adopted by 
subsequent General Assemblies.  The I nvestigator will make sure that the study described in this 
protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, the protocol, current FDA 
regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) 
guidelines, local ethical and regulatory requirements, including the Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act, US applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any EC requirements relative to clinical studies. As required by the US FDA, the study drug may not be shipped to any participa ting Investigator until the requisite study documentation has been submitted to the IND. 
Should a conflict arise, the Investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the greater protection to the individual patient.  The Investigator will also make sure he or she is 
thoroughly familiar with the appropriate administration and potential risks of administration of 
the study drug, as described in this protocol and the Investigator’s Brochure, prior to the initiation of the study. 
16.2. Ethics Committee/In stitutional Review Board (EC/IRB) Review  
The EC/IRB must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 21 CFR Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards.”  This protocol, any protocol amendments, the associated informed consent forms, and the informed consent procedures must be submitted to the EC/IRB for review and approved before the enrollment of any patient into the trial. 
All types of patient recruitment or advertising information must be submitted to T onix or its 
designee and to the EC/IRB for review and approval prior to implementation.  EC/IRB approval 
of any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes outlined in the 
amendments are put into effect, except when the amendment has been enacted to eliminate a potential hazard to study patients.  In such cases, the chair of the EC/IRB should be notified immediately and the amendment forwarded to the EC/IRB for review and approval. 
16.3. Written Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain signed written informed consent from each potential study patient prior to the conduct of any screening or other study procedures.  This written informed consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives, and potential risks of the 
study have been fully explained to the potential patient.  The Investigator must explain to each 
patient that he or she is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time.  NOTE:  Patients on antidepressant therapy should be warned of a potential serious drug 
interaction and should be advised to contact their study site immediately if they experience any 
symptoms that might represent possible serotonin syndrome, including fever, confusion or agitation, hallucinations, sweating, high or low blood pr essure, rapid heart rate, tremor, muscle 
rigidity or nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 80 of 92  The patient should also be asked in the ICF for permission for the P rincipal Investigator or his 
designee to contact the patient’s other personal physicians, as appropriate, concerning 
participation in the study. 
The method of obtaining and documenting informed consent and the contents of the ICF will 
comply with ICH GCP guidelines, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 50, “Protection of Human 
Subjects,” the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, and all other applicable regulatory requirements.  A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, 
and dated by each patient prior to entering the trial or prior to performing any study procedure.  
The original signed and dated ICF will be kept on file at the study site.  Patients will be given a copy of the signed ICF and will be informed of any new developments during the course of the study that might influence their continued participation in the study. 
The Investigator or a qualified designee will be available to answer each patient’s questions 
throughout the study, and all questions must be answered to the patient’s satisfaction.  If the 
protocol is amended and a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each patient ’s further 
consent must be obtained.  The new version of the ICF must be approved by the EC /IRB , prior to 
subsequently obtaining each patient’s consent. 
Receipt of written informed consent will be documented in each patient’s or potential patient’s 
CRF.  T he signed ICF must remain in each patient’s study file and must be available for 
verification by study monitors at all times.  
Separate written, signed informed consent must be obtained if the patient is to participate in the optional pharmacogenomic assess ment.

AUDITS  
17.1. Maintaining Privacy and Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability records, and other 
documents, including communications between the study site and Tonix, will identify patients 
only by their initials and their assigned study identification numbers.  If required, the Investigator 
will grant monitors and auditors from Tonix or its designee and/or regulatory authority’s access to patients’ original medical records for verification of the data gathered on the CRFs and to 
audit the data collection process.  Patients’ confidentiality will be maintained and will not be 
made publicly available unless mandated by applicable laws and regulations. 
17.2. Maintaining Essential Clinical Documents  
Study site files for the retention of regulatory documents will be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to FDA and ICH/GCP 
guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements.  The records maintained must be adequate to 
fully document appropriate protection of study subjects/patients, the validity of the study, the integrity of the data, and the manner in which the study was conducted. 
The Investigator ’s site file, copies of protocols, CRFs, originals of test result reports, drug 
disposition logs, correspondence, records of written informed consent, and other documents 
pertaining to the conduct of the study must be kept on file by the Investigator and in readily 
accessible order for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application, until at 
least 2 years have elapsed after formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational product, or according to local regulatory requirements.  No study document may 
be destroyed without prior written consent from Tonix or its designee.  Should the Investigator 
wish to withdraw from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility.  Tonix must be notified in writing in 
advance if a custodial change is to occur.  It is important that the Investigator remain ready to 
provide background information from the archived study records on request. 
The sponsor or designee will maintain adequate study records for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after clinical development of the study 
drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  After that period, the sponsor will be contacted to determine whether the study records will be forwarded to the sponsor, destroyed, or kept at the location of the designee or another facility for a longer period of time. 
17.3. Data Handling  
Unless otherwise specified, procedures, data collection and evaluation will be conducted as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the contract research organization ( CRO ).  The 
Investigator will assume the responsibility of ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the clinical data.  All data will be verified for quality control and will also be subject to audits from Tonix or designee to ensure quality. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 82 of 92  All laboratory results will be analyzed by an accredited and licensed clinical laboratory facility.  
Clinical laboratory data will be tran sferred from the central laboratory to the clinical database 
maintained by the CRO using systems which are validated and Part 11-compliant. 
The responsible clinical study monitor(s) will check data at the monitoring visits to the clinical 
study site.  The Investigator will ensure that the data collected are accurate, complete, and legible.  Any changes made to the clinical data will be documented with a full audit trail.  
Aspects of the clinical and statistical phases of the study, including all associated d ocumentation 
may be reviewed by the Quality Assurance Unit of the contract research organization using a 
risk-assessment approach.  The final clinical and statistical report will be audited to ensure that, 
as far as can be reasonably established, the methods described and the results reported accurately reflect the raw data generated during the study.  
17.4. Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study patient.  
Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by Tonix or its designee.  Data (including AEs) will be 
recorded on raw data sheets and/or electronic or paper source documents. 
If selected data is collected vi a paper (patient questionnaires, etc.), the data must be entered into 
the eCRF and verified that it has been transcribed correctly.  
17.5. Clinical Laboratory Certification  
A central clinical laboratory will be used to analyze all samples in this study, with the exception 
of the post- screening urine pregnancy tests and ad hoc urine drug screens.  The Investigator must 
maintain, on file, written evidence that the central clinical laboratory to be used is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act or equivalent certification (depending on local regulations).  Further, the Investigator will maintain a copy of the certification, the range of 
normal values, the effective dates for the ranges, and the units of measurement for all laboratory 
tests requested i n the protocol.  If any of the laboratory measurements will be transformed and/or 
categorized in any way, a description of the procedures(s) used should be included.  The Investigator is expected to receive these documents before the shipment of clinical s upplies. 
17.6. Site Monitoring and Tonix’s Right to Review Records  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Tonix and/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP and GLP guidelines. 
Tonix’s designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact the Investigator and 
conduct regular visits to the clinical site.  In extenuating circumstances  related to the COVID -19 
pandemic, remote monitoring will be permissible . The monitor will be expected and allowed to 
verify the Investigator ’s qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study 
records, including proof of EC/IRB review, with the stipulation that patient confidentiality will 
be maintained  in accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements.  
The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  CRFs will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source

uninterpretable data will be resolved in coordination with the Investigator. 
The monitor/auditor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory 
requirements.  Any administrative concerns will be clarified and followed.  The monitor will 
maintain contact with the site through frequent direct communications with the study site by e -
mail, telephone, facsimile, and mail.  The Investigator and all other site personnel agree to 
cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and 
all questions raise d and difficulties detected by the monitor. 
17.7. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the EC/IRB, and/or Tonix or their 
designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study documentation 
for on -site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the study to at least 2 
years after the last approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after clinical 
development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  The 
Investigator is required to guarantee access to these d ocuments and to cooperate with and support 
such audits and inspections.

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 84 of 92  18. CONFIDENTIALITY  
18.1. Protection of Patient Anonymity  
The Investigator must make sure that each patient’s anonymity is maintained.  On CRFs or other 
documents submitted to Tonix or its agent, patients should not be identified by their names, but 
rather by their initials and the assigned study identification numbers.  The Investigator should 
keep a separate record of the patient initials, randomization codes, patient names, address, and contact information.  Documents that contain the names associated with these initials and codes 
are not for submission to Tonix or its agents (e.g., written informed consent forms).  These 
records should be maintained by the Investigator in strict confidence exc ept to the extent 
necessary to allow auditing by regulatory authorities, Tonix, or its agents.  These records should be kept in compliance with HIPAA regulations. 
18.2. Confidentiality of Study Information  
All information relevant to this study, whether supplied by Tonix or its agents to the Investigator or collected by the Investigator in support of this study, is privileged and confidential.  The 
Investigator agrees to use this information to carry out the study and will not use it for other 
purposes without written consent from Tonix.  It is understood that the Investigator is under obligation to provide Tonix with all data obtained during the study.  The information obtained 
from this study will be used by Tonix towards the clinical development of the indicated 
investigational drug and may be disclosed by Tonix to regulatory authorities, other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants as required. 
18.3. Publication of Data and Protection of Trade Secrets  
No presentations, abstracts (including meeting abstracts), or other publications based on the 
conduct or results of this study will be permitted without the express written permission of Tonix 
or its designated agent.  All such presentations or publications will proceed only as collaborations between Tonix and the Investigator s. 
If the Investigator wishes to publish the results of this study, a copy of the proposed manuscript 
or abstract (including meeting abstracts) will be provided to Tonix or its designee for review, revision, and approval at least sixty (60) days before the expected date of submission for 
publication, unless otherwise arranged with Tonix in writing.  This will enable Tonix to protect 
its proprietary information and augment the publication with insights or information of which the Investigato r may not be aware.  
Patient names and other identifiers, such as photographs or audio or video recordings, may not be disclosed in any publication or public forum without prior written authorization from the patients involved or their legal guardians.

Abbreviation:  CYP3A 4 = cytochrome P450 subtype 3A4  
(a) Strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.  Moderate inhibitor of CYP3A and Weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.  
(f) Strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A.  
(h) Inhibitor of P -gp (defined as those increasing AUC of digoxin to ≥1.25-f old). 
(j) Ritonavir is usually given in combination with other anti -HIV or anti -HCV drugs in clinical practice. Caution should be used 
when extrapolating the observed effect of ritonavir alone to the effect of combination regimens on CYP3A activities.  
(k) The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation- dependent. Studies 
have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double 
stren gth) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength).  
(l) The classification is based on studies conducted with intravenously administered conivaptan.  
(m) Diltiazem increased AUC of certain sensitive C YP3A substrates (e.g., buspirone) more than 5-fold.

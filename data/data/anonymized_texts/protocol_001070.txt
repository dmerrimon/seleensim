Protocol Study Details  
Study Rationale 
and Objective  In this clinical trial , clinical performance of LID# 223194  Multifocal 
contact lens and a commercially available Air  Optix plus 
HydraGlyde Multifocal contact lens will be assessed.

Organizations  Not Applicable  
Planned Duration 
of Exposure  ~ 4 days total  (test and comparator)   
Test Product ( LID223194 ): 2 days (+ 3 days)  
 Comparator Product (AirOptix HydraGlyde MF [AOHG MF]): 2 
days (+3 days)  
Exposure of study lenses in 2 different periods over 3 visits  
Number of Subjects  Planned to enroll: ~35 Target to complete: 25 - 30 
Study Population  • Habitual soft Multifocal contact lens wearers aged ≥ 40 years 
with normal eyes ( not needing ocular medication, other than 
correction for refractive error). Subjects should have at least 3 
months wearing experience, wear these lenses at least 5 days per 
week and at least 8 hours per day.  
• To qualify, subjects must require cylindrical correction ≤ 0.75D, 
be able wear study contact lens with sphere power ranging 
between +3.00D and -7.00D  and requiring a near ADD of LO, 
MED or HI  
Lens Assignment  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive one of 2 lens 
sequences:  
• Sequence 1: LID223194 /AOHG MF  
• Sequence 2: AOHG MF/ LID223194

Inclusion Criteria  1. Subject must be at least 40 years of age.  
2. Subject must be able to understand and must sign an informed 
consent form (ICF) that has been approved by an Institutional 
Review Board  (IRB).  
3. Subject must be willing to stop wearing their habitual contact 
lenses for the duration of study participation.  
4. Currently wears multifocal soft contact lenses in both eyes for a 
minimum of 5 days per week and 8 hours per day during the 
past 3 months.  
5. Manifest cylinder ≤ 0.75 D in each eye.  
6. BCV A 0.1 logMAR  or better in each eye.  
7. Able to fit with available contact lenses  : within a range of 
powers from +3.00D  to -7.00 and requiring a near ADD of LO, 
MED or HI  
8. Subject must possess spectacles tha t provide a corrected visual 
acuity of 20/40 or better OU  
Exclusion Criteria  1. Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, or abnormality or 
disease (including systemic) that contraindicates contact lens 
wear, as determined by the investigator . 
2. Any use o f systemic or ocular medications for which contact 
lens wear could be contraindicated, as determined by the 
investigator . 
3. History of refractive surgery or plan to have refractive surgery 
during the study or irregular cornea in either eye.  
4. Ocular or intraoc ular surgery (excluding placement of punctal 
plugs) within the previous 12 months or planned during the 
study.  
5. Biomicroscopy findings at screening that are moderate (Grade 3) 
or higher and/or corneal vascularization that is mild (Grade 2) or 
higher, and/or  any infiltrate.  
6. Current or history of pathologically dry eye in either eye that, in 
the opinion of the investigator , would preclude contact lens 
wear.  
7. Current or history of herpetic keratitis in either eye.  
8. Eye injury in either eye within 12 weeks immediately prior to 
enrollment for this trial.  
9. Current or history of intolerance, hypersensitivity , or allergy to 
any component of the study products.  
10. The investigator , his/her staff, family members of the 
investigator , family members of the investigator ’s staff, or

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209374
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3b/4 Safety Trial of Nivolumab (BMS -936558) in Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic 
Renal Cell Carcinoma 
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):  Nivolumab (BMS -936558), 240 mg every two weeks as a 30 minute (minutesIV infusion. 
Subjects may continue to receive treatment for a maximum of 24 months or until confirmed disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal of informed consent or the study  is discontinued by the Sponsor . Treatment can 
continue beyond initial assessment of progression as specified in Section 4.5.3.  
Study Phase:  3b/4
Research Hypothesis:  The frequency of high grade (CTCAE vs 4.0 Grade 3-5) immune-mediated adverse events 
(IMAE s) observed in patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are treated with nivolumab
monotherapy will not differ from historical adverse event data in this patient population .
Objective:  
Primary Ob jective: 
To assess the incidence of high grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs in subjects with advanced 
or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who are treated with nivolumab monotherapy .
Secondary Objective: 
To characterize the outcome of all high grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 4 and Grade 5) IMAEs in subjects with 
advanced or metastatic RCC who are treated with nivolumab monotherapy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3b/4 safety study of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced or 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Approximately 180 subjects will undergo screening evaluatio ns to deter mine 
eligibility within 28 days prior to first dose. Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be treated with 
240mgnivolumab IV, over 30minutes (minutesevery 2weeks. Each 28-day dosing period will constitute a 
cycle.
Subjects will be enrolled into 1of 3treatment groups as follows:
Group 1: Subjects with predominant clear cell histology :  75 subjects (approximate )

Group 2: Subjects with non-clear cell histology:  50 subjects (approximate , with a minimum of 50 
subjects with non -clear cell histology ).
Group 3: Subjects with brain metastases regardless of histology: 25 subjects (approximate) .
Note:  If enrollment of 25 patie nts with brain met astases cannot be reached, the number of patients with non-clear 
cell (preferred) or clear cell histology group willbe increased .
Subjects who are found on screening CT/MRI to have brain metastases will be enrolled to Group 3,if they do no t 
require active treatment (radiation treatment/corticosteroids). Sub jects who are found on screening CT/MRI to have 
brain metastases that require immediate treatment with radiation treatment/corticosteroids will be re-enrolled to 
Group 3 after completing active treatment. Subjects who develop brain metastases while on treatment with 
nivolumab will not be re-assigned to Group 3 but will remain in the group assigned at enrollment (See 
Section 3.4.3.2 for recommendations on palliative brain radiotherapy  and resumption of treatment with nivolumab.) 
Brain lesions will be assesse d only  as non- target lesions.
After screening and enrollment, subjects will be treated for a maximum of 24 months on study, or until confirmed 
progression, unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal of consent, or the study is discontinued by the sponsor. Study 
treatment can continue beyond initial investigator assessed progression as specified in Section 4.5.3. The study  will 
close after the last enrolled subject completes 5 years of follow up from the date of first treatment (LPFT).  
Subjects treated in the study who continue to derive benefit from the study treatment after 24 months of treatment or 
subjects who have not completed 24 months of treatment at discontinuation of the study by the Sponsor, should 
continue to be treated according to standard of care foll owing completion of the study.

Clinical Protocol CA209374
BMS -936558 nivolumab
Study Population :  The study will enroll subjects with a dvanced ( i.e., not amenable to curative surgery  or radiatio n 
therapy) or metastatic (AJCC Stage IV) RCC with histo logical confirmation of predominant clear -cell or non-clear 
cell (papillary , chromophobe , translocation associated or unclassified ) RCC as defined in Appendix 4.  Subjects with 
brain metastases are eligible if they are asymptomatic, without edema, and not on corticosteroids or receiving 
radiation treatment. Subjects with favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories per MSKCC Prognostic Score
(Appendix 5)areeligible for the enrollment.
Eligible subjects with clear cell histology must have received at least 1but no more than 2 prior anti-VEGF 
therap iesin the advanced metastatic setting , and no more than 3prior systemic therapies , which may include an 
mTOR inhibito r per Ame ndment 02 . Subjects with non -clear cell histology  are eligible with up to 3prior systemic 
therapies (including m-TOR inhibitor) orwith no prior systemic therapy .
No prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy is allowed for subjects with either RCC histology .   
 
 
 
Subjects with uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency , known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) ,known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) , or any positive test for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis 
C virus indica ting acute or chronic infection are not eligible for this study.
Study Drug: includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Products (IP/IMP) and Non-investigational 
[Medicinal] Products (Non -IP/Non-IMP) as listed:
Study Drug for CA209374
Medication Potency IP/Non -IP 
Nivolumab ( BMS -936558 )
Solution for Injection100 mg (10 mg/mL) IP
Study Assessments:  
Assessments for safety include contin uous monitoring for all adverse events using NCI CTCAE v. 4.0, including the 
IMAEs specified in Section 8.3.1.  Additio nal safety  assessments include vital signs and oxygen saturation, physical 
measurements and target physical exam, performance status, laboratory  evaluat ions (complete blood counts ,serum 
chemistry , liver function, thy roid functio n)and pregna ncy test as applicable and review of concomitant medications. 
To assess tumor response, CT/MRI will be performed at baseline and throughout the treatmen t and follow up 
periods as specified in Section 5. Additional study procedures include assessments for biomarkers, patient reported 
outcomes as evaluated by FKSI -19 and EQ -5D, and healthcare resource utilizat ion.  
All study procedures /assessments performed during screening, during treatment with nivolumab and during follow 
up must be completed in accordance with Table 5.1 -1, Table 5.1 -2,and Table 5.1 -3.
Statistical Considerations: 
Sample Size:  Approximately 150subjects will be treated with niv olumab in this study . This sample size 
will allow for estimating an incidence rate of 0.67% (n=1 subject with events) with a 95% CI (confidence 
interval) of (0. 02%, 3.7%), or an incidence rate of 2% (n= 3subjects with events) with a 95% CI of (0. 4%, 
5.7%).Furthermore, the sample size will allow for enough events to compare incidence with historical 
adverse event data.

Endpoints:   
Primary Endpoint: The primary  objective of the study will be assessed by measuring the incidence for 
high grade (Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAE s. 
The IMAEs are the following: skin, endocrinopathy, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and 
neurologic adverse events .
Secondary Endpoint s: The secondary objective of the study will be assessed by measuring the following:
 medi an time to onset, median time to resolution (Grade 3 -4)IMAEs.
 percentage of subjects who received immune modulating medication (e.g. corticoidsteroids, 
infliximab, cyclophosphamide , IVIG, and  mycophenolate mofetil), or hormonal replacement 
therapy , the p ercentage of subjects who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, total duration of 
all immune modulating medications given for the immune -mediated event.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analyses:
Demographics, baseline disease characteristics and baseline laboratory  results will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics for all treated subjects and all s ubjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3 .
Primary Endpoint : The number and percentage of subjects who report high grade (Grade 3-4 and 
Grade 5) IMAEs will be summarized for all treated subjects. High grade (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs
will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria by system organ class and Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) preferred term.
Second Endpoint s:  Additional descriptive statistics for high grade (Grade 3 4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will 
include median values using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method with 95% CI using Brookmeyer 
and Crowley of time to onset and time to resolution of IMAEs , and will be presented for all treated subjects 
in Groups 1, 2, and 3 . Time to onset is calculated from first dosing date to the event onset date. If a subject 
never experienced the given AE, the subject will be censored at the last contact date. Time to resolution is 
calculated from the AE onset date to AE end date. If an AE is ongoing at the time of analy sis, the time to 
resolution will be censored at the last contact date.
Management of high-grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will be characterized by 
measuring percentage of subjects who received immune modulating medication (or ho rmonal replacement 
therapy ), percentage of subjects who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, and total duration of all 
immune modulating medicatio ns given for the event, in all treated subjects who have experience high -grade 
(CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs and all subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3.

1.7 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Subjects wi th advanced or metastati c renal cell  carcino ma with clear cell histol ogy who progress 
after prior anti-VEGF therapy andsubjects wit h non -clear cell histology with prior treatment or no 
prior treatm entrepresent a continued unmet medical need as progression free survival  remains 
modest with subsequent or first-line therapi es that may include everolimus or further anti-
angiogenic therapy .11The clinical activi ty of nivol umab observed to date in RCC suggests the 
potenti al for improved clinical  outc omes as monothe rapy. Nivol umab does have the potenti al for 
clinically- relevant adverse events including liver toxicit ies, thyro iditis, pneumo nitis, and diarrhea. 
However, the activit y and manageable AEs profile observed with nivolumab supports the 
treatm ent of patients w ith advanced or metastatic renal cell carcino ma.
2 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS
2.1 Good Clinical Practice
This study  will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP), as defined by the 
International Conference on Harm onisati on (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical principles

and thesubject informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinio n prior to init iation of the study .
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediately. A serious breach is a breac h 
of the conditions and principles of GCP in connecti on with the study  or the protocol, which is 
likely  to aff ect, to a si gnificant degree, the safet y or physical or mental integrit y of the subjects of 
the study  or the sci entific value of the study .
Personnel involved in conducting this study  will be qualified by educat ion, training, and 
experience t o perform their respective tasks .
This study  will not use the services of study personnel where sancti ons have been invoked or where 
there has been scient ific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
2.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study  initiation, the invest igator m ust have obtained written and dated approval /favorable 
opinio n from the IRB/IEC for theprotocol, consent form, subject recruitment materials (eg, 
advert isements), and any other written informat ion to be provided to subj ects. The invest igator or 
BMS shoul d also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigat or Brochure or product labeling
inform ation to be provided to subjects and any  updates. 
The investigator or BMS shoul dprovide the IRB/IEC with reports, upd ates and other informat ion 
(eg, expedited safet y reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory 
requi rements or i nstitution procedures .
2.3 Informed Consent
Invest igators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other crit ical issues regarding clinical studies in which they  volunteer to parti cipate. 
In situat ions where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fu lly informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical s tudies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provi de the invest igator with an appropri ate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements requi red by ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory 
requi rements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declarat ion of Helsinki .
Invest igators must:
1)Provi de a copy  of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study part icipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily  understood. 
2)Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about 
the details of the study .
3)Obtain an inform ed consent si gned and personally dated by  the subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussio n.

6)Revise the informed consent whenever important new informat ion becom es available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The invest igator, or a person designated by the invest igator, 
shoul d fully inform the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardi an, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new inform ation relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participat ion in the study . This communicat ion shoul d be 
docum ented. 
The confidentialit y of records that could ident ify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and c onfident iality rules applicable to regulatory  requi rements, the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorizat ion.
The consent form must also include a statem ent that BMS and regul atory  authori ties have direct 
access to subject records. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects with or severe dement ia) may 
only be enrolled in the study  with the consent of a legally acceptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit  wish of a subject who is unable to gi ve his or

females under the age of 55 y ears must have a serum follicle st imulat ing horm one, (FSH) l evel > 
40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) ,are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their judgment  
in checking serum  FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the 
washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as lo ng as 6 months.

specified as ≤ 16 mg dexamethasone PO daily tapered in ≤ 4 weeks is allowed only for the 
treatm ent of brain edema. 
Concomitant palliat ive and supportive care for disease related symptom s (including 
bisphosphonates and RANK -L inhibitors) is allowed if init iated prior to first dose of study therapy.
3.4.3.1 Focal Palliative Radiation
The potenti al for overlapping toxi cities wi th radiotherapy and nivolumab current ly is not known. 
Therefore, palliative radiotherapy is not recommended while receiving nivolumab. If palliat ive 
radiotherapy  is required for bone metastases then nivo lumab should be wit hheld for at least 1 week 
before, during, and 1 week after radiat ion. Subjects should be closely mo nitored f or any  potenti al 
toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy , and AEs shoul d resolve to Grade 1 prior to 
resuming nivo lumab.  Only bone lesio ns may receive palliat ive radiotherapy. Details o f palliat ive 
radiotherapy  shoul d be docum ented in the source records and electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Details in the source records should include: date s of treatment, anatomical site, dose administered 
and fractionat ion schedule, and adverse events. Subjects receiving limit ed field palliat ive radiat ion 
therapy  will be considered to have unequivocal progressi on of disease in the non-target lesion.

3.4.3.2 Palliative brain radiation
The potenti al for overl apping toxicities with brain radiotherapy  and nivolumab is not known. 
Therefore palliat ive brain radiotherapy is not recommended while receiving nivo lumab.
Subjects receiving limited field palliat ivebrain radiation therapy  will be considered to have 
unequivocal progressi on of disease in the non-target lesion.Administr ation of additional 
nivolumab to subjects who received limited field palliat ive radiat ion shoul d follow guidelines 
specified in Section 4.5.4 , Treatmen t bey ond Disease Progression .
If subjects requi re palliat ive brain radiat ion, nivo lumab will be held for at l east one week pri or to

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug 
Subjects MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Subject’s request to stop study  treatm ent
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormali tyor intercurrent illness which, in 
the opinio n of the invest igator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study  is not in 
the best interest of the subject
Terminat ion of the study  by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily
incarcerat ion for treatm ent of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious disease) illness
Study  specific c riteria for discont inuat ion of treatment with nivolumab are presented in 
Secti on 4.5.4.1 .
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of  this event. In most cases, the study  drug will  be permanen tly discont inued in 
an appropri ate manner. If the invest igator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuat ion of study  drug, a di scussio n between the invest igator and the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee m ust occur.
All subjects who discont inue study  drug should comply with protocol  specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only excepti on to this requi rement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the 
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  drug is discont inued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for the 
discontinuat ion must be docum ented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
NOTE: A 4- week washout (minimum) ofnivolumab is recommended for subjects who are 
discontinued from treatment with nivolumab for any reason and are being considered for 
treatment with mTOR inhibitor. 
3.6 Post Study Drug Study Follow up
In this study , safet y is a key endpo int of the study. Post study  follow-up is of critical importance 
and is essential to preserving subject safet y and the int egrity of the study. Subjects who discontinue 
study  drug m ust con tinue to be fo llowed for collecti on of  outcom e and/or survival fo llow-up data 
as requi red and in line wit h Section 5until death or the conclusio n of the study .
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discont inue study drug will remain in the study  and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified fo llow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authori zedby subject to provide this informat ion. Subjects shoul d notify the investigator of the 
decisio n to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The

to whether the withdrawal  is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study fo llow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the 
event that vi tal status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
inform ation shoul d be used to determine vi tal status only as appropriately  directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up wi th persons authori zed by  the subjec t as noted above. Lost to fo llow-up 
is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum  of three docum ented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. All attem pts 
shoul d be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investi gator’s use of third -party  representative to assist in the fo llow-up porti on of the study has 
been included in the subjec t’s inform ed consent, then the i nvest igator may use a Sponsor -retained 
third-party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up porti on of the study .The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public healt h registries and 
databases, in or der to obtain updated contact informat ion. If after all attempts, the subject remains 
lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator shoul d be 
reported and documented in the subject’s medical records .
4 STUDY DRUG

4.5.1 Management Algorithm for Nivolumab related adverse events
Immuno-oncol ogy (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on 
from AEs caused by other therapeuti c classes. Nivo lumab is considered an immuno -oncol ogy 
agent in this protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with 
immuno -oncol ogy agents m ay mit igate severe toxicit y.
Management Algorithms have been devel oped to assist invest igators in assessing and managing
the following groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulm onary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
The above algorithms are found in the nivo lumab Investigator Brochure, and can also be found in 
Appendix 6of this protocol .
For subjects expected to requi re more than 4 weeks of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants 
to manage and adverse event, consider recommendations provided in Adverse Event Management 
Algori thms in Appendix 6.
4.5.2 Dose Delay Criteria
Tumor assessments for all subjects should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed.
4.5.2.1 Nivolumab Dose Delay Criteria
Nivo lumab administration should be delayed for the fo llowing:
Any Grade 2 non -skin, drug- related adverse event, with the fo llowing except ions:
Grade 2 drug-related fat igue or laboratory abnormalit ies do not require a treatment delay
Any Grade 3 skin, drug- related adverse event
Any Grade 3 drug-related laboratory  abnormalit y, with the following except ions for 
lymphopenia, leukopenia, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin:
Grade 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require dose delay
If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT or total  bilirubin that is within norm al limit s, delay 
dosing for drug- related Grade 2 toxicit y
If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug -related Grade 3 toxicit y
Any adverse event, laboratory  abnormalit y, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the invest igator, warrants delaying the dose of study medicat ion.

4.5.3.1 Criteria to Resume Treatment with Nivolumab
Subjects may resume treatment wi th nivolumab when the drug -related AE(s) resolve(s) to Grade 
1 or baseline, with the fo llowing except ions:
Subjects with baseline AST/ALT or total  bilirubin in the Grade 1 toxicit y range who require

treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total bilirubin 
Subje cts with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuat ion parameters should have treatment permanent ly discont inued
Drug -related pulmo nary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatm ent is resumed. Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately  controlled with only 
physio logic horm one replacement m ay resume treatm ent
If treatm ent is delayed > 6weeks, the subject must be perm anent ly discont inued from study 
therapy , except as specified in Treat ment Discont inuat ion criteria
4.5.4 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
As described in Sect ion 1.3.3 ,accumulat ing evidence indicates a minorit y of subjects treated wit h 
immunotherapy  may derive clinical benefit despit e initial evidence of PD. Subjects treated with 
nivolumab will be permitted to continue treatment beyo nd init ial RE CIST 1.1 defined progres sive 
disease (PD) as l ong as the fo llowing cri teriaare met :
1)Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit
2)Tolerance of study  drug
3)Stabl e performance status
4)Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
5)Subject provi des wri tten informed consent pri or to receiving addi tional nivolumab treatm ent, 
using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomf orts, or other alternative 
treatm ent opti ons.
The decisi on to continue treatm ent bey ond initial progression shoul d be discussed wi th the BMS 
medical Monitor and documented in the study  records.
A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within 8 weeks of original PD to determine 
whether there has been a decrease in the tum or size, or continued PD. The assessment of clinical 
benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the subject is clinically deteriorating 
and unlikely  to receive any benefit from cont inued treatment with nivo lumab.
If the invest igator feels that the nivolumab subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by 
continuing treatment, the subject shoul d remain on the trial and cont inue to receive monitoring 
according to the Time and Events Schedule on Table 5.1 -2.

For the subjects who continue nivolumab study  therapy beyo nd progressi on, further progressio n 
is defined as an additional 20% increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial PD. This 
includes an increase in the sum of all target lesions and/ or the development of new measurable 
lesions. Treatment shoul d be discont inued permanent ly upon docum entati on of further disease 
progression
New lesions are considered measureable at the time of initial progressi on if the longest diameter 
is at least 10mm (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progressi on may 
beco me measureable and therefore included in the tum or burden volume if the longest diameter 
increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of 
at least 15 mm).
Subjects withglobal deteri oration of  heal th status (as determined by the invest igator) who requir e 
discontinuat ion of treatment without objective evidence of disease progressi on at thetime of 
treatm ent discont inuat ion shoul d be reported as ‘symptomat ic deteri oration’. Every  effort should
be made to document objective progressi on (ie,radiographi c confirmat ion) even after 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent.
4.5.4.1 Treatment Discontinuation Criteria for Nivolumab
Tumor assessments for all subjects should cont inue as per protocol even if dosing is discon tinued.
Nivolumab treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following:
oAny Grade 2 drug-related uveit is, eye pain or blurred visio n that does not respond to 
topical therapy  and does not improve to Grade 1 severit y within the retreatment period 
OR requi res systemic treatment
oAny Grade 3 non -skin, drug -related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the fo llowing

Invest igator, presents a substant ial clinical risk to the subject with continued nivo lumab dosing .
4.5.5 Treatment of Nivolumab -Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusi on or hy persensi tivity react ions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, arthralgias, 
hypotension, hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like react ions. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusio n react ions shoul d be reported within 24 hours to the study  medical  monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusio n react ions shoul d be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Versi on 4.0) gui delines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptom s: (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated).
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicati ons are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-

medica tions indicated for 24hours).
Stop the nivo lumab infusio n, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect until resolution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further co mplications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusio n rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptom s recur, then no further 
nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
shoul d be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab infusio ns. If necessary , 
corticosteroi ds (up to 25 m g of SoluCortef or equivalent) m ay be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive 
to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms 
following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for ot her clinical sequelae [eg, renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).
Immediately discont inue infusio n of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusio n of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows : Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1000 
solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution injected 
slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylpredniso lone 100 
mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the Invest igator is 
comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be perm anently discont inued. 
Invest igators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatm ent of anaphyla xis. 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  of the symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersensit ivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a l ocalized or generalized 
pruri tus within 1 week after treatm ent), symptomat ic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding

5.3.4 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Any incidental findings of potenti al clinical relevance that are not direct ly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol  should be evaluated and handled by the Study  Investigator as per 
standard m edical/clinical judgment.
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
5.4.1 Screening (Baseline visit) and On -Study Efficacy Assessments
Study  evaluati ons will take place in accordance with Table 5.1-1andTable 5.1-2, according to 
RECIST 1.1 criteria.35High resolution CT with oral/intravenous contrast or contrast -enhanced 
MRI is the preferred imaging modalities for assessing radiographic tumor response. If a subject  
has a known allergy  to contrast material, please use local prophylaxis standards to obtain the 
assessment with contrast if at all possible, or use the alternate modalit y. In cases where contrast is 
strictly contraindicated, a non-contrast scan will suffice. Screening assessments shoul d be 
perfor med within 28 days of start of study  treatment. Brain MRI is the preferred imaging method 
for evaluat ing CNS metastasis, and assessment is required during screening in all eligible subjects. 
All known or suspected sites of disease (including CNS) should beassessed at screening and at 
subsequent assessments using the same imaging method and technique. If more than one method 
is used at screening, then the most accurate method according to RECIST 1.1 should be used when 
recording data, and should again be us ed for all  subsequent assessments. Bone scan, PET scan, or 
ultrasound imaging are not adequate for assessment of RECIST response. In selected 
circumstances where such modalit ies are the sole modalit y used to assess certain non- target organs, 
those non-target organs may be evaluated less frequent ly. For example, bone scans may need to 
be repeated only when complete response is identified in target disease or when progressi on in 
bone is suspected. Previously  treated CNS metastases are not considered measurabl e lesio ns for 
purposes of RECIST determined response. Subjects with a history of brain metastasis should have 
surveillance MRI approximately  every  12weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated.

5.7 Outcomes Re search Assessments
Patient reported outcom es will be captured through the use of 2 validated self-reported 
questionnaires: the NCCN Funct ional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Kidney Symptom  Index 
(FKSI -19) and the five dimensio n (EQ -5D) and visual analog sca le (EQ -VAS).
The NCCN FKSI -19 is a 19-item scale that measures tumor specific HrQoL in kidney cancer 
patients. The FKSI -19 uses five Likert -type response categori es that range from “not at all” to 
“very much”. Patients are asked to circle the response category  that best characterizes their 
response over the last 7 days on 19 items that include symptom s such as lack of energy, fatigue,  
appeti te, coughing, shortness of breath, pain, nausea and abilit y to work. 
General health status will be measured using the EQ -5D. The E Q-5D is a standardized instrument 
for use as a measure of self-reported general health status. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions 
(mobilit y, self -care, usual act ivities, pain/discomfo rt, and anxiet y) and a visual analog rating scale 
(VAS). The utilit y data generated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and commo nly used in 
healt h econo mics research analysis.
5.8 Other Assessments 
In addition, healt hcare resource utilizat ion (HRU) data (e.g., hospi talizat ions, non-protocol 
specified medical visits, etc) will be collected for all enrolled or treated subjects. Specifically, 
healt hcare resource utilizat ion is evaluated based on the number of medical care encounters such 
as hospi tal admissi ons and their durati on, outpati ent visits, diagnosti c tests and procedures, 
concom itant medicat ions and reasons for the encounters.

does notnecessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The ca usal relati onship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regardin g the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
resul ts in persistent or signi ficant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scien tific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE .
Although pregnanc y, ove rdose , cancer ,and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory  definit ion, these events mustbe handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with protocol -
specified procedures. All SAEs must be co llected that occur during the screening period and within 
100 days of discontinuation o f dosing. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later 
protocol -specified procedure (eg, a fo llow-up skin biopsy). 
The invest igator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be co mpleted for any  event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies ,must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hour s. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). The preferred method for SAE data 
reporting collect ion is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only 
intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system  is not functioning.  In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmissio n to:

SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number : Refer to Con tact Informat ion list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electroni c submissi on is the 
requi red method for reporting. The paper forms shoul d be used and submi tted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmissio n. When paper forms are used, the 
original  paper form s are to rem ain on si te.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting) : Refer to Contact 
Inform ation list.
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up 
SAE reports should include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new inform ation 
beco mes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) u sing th e same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs should be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilizat ion.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse e vent is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collect ion of nonseriousAE informat ion should begin at ini tiation of study  drug. Non serious 
AEinformat ion shoul d also be collected from the start of a  placebo lead-in period or other 
observat ional period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or d iscont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All ident ified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be co llected 
continuously during the treatm ent period and for a minimum of 100 days following the last dose 
of study  treatm ent.
Com pletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies that 
are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
6.2.2 Adverse Events of Interest
IMAEs are specific events occurring within 100 days of the last dose of study drug (which includes 
pneumo nitis, diarrhea/co litis, hepat itis, nephritis/renal dysfunct ion, rash, and endocrine 
abnorm alities [adrenal insufficiency, hypothy roidism/thyroi ditis, hyperthy roidism , diabetes

It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting invest igator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  drug, it is subsequent ly discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 5 half 
lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event and co mplete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS 
Designee wi thin 24 hours and in accordance wi th SAE reporting procedures described in Section 
6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary  for subject safety ).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study  drug is thought to outwei gh the risk, after 
consultation wit h BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussio n 
of benefits and risk with the subject 
Protocol -requi red procedures for study discont inuation and follow-up must be perform ed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.
The invest igator must immediately notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Moni tor of  this event 
and com plete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  to BMS (or desi gnee) wi thin 24 hours 
and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section 6.1.1 . 
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcom e and, where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
BMS . Information on this pregnancy will be co llected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a pro duct that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng details).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1.AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potenti al safet y assessment required or not required by protocol  should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
In general, for nivolumab monotherapy , the safety profile to date is similar across tumor types, 
while IMAEs of high grade (Grade 3 -4) are rather unco mmo n. Their overa ll incidence was 6% in 
a previous Phase 1 trial that tested nivolumab at doses between 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in 306 
subjects wi th different recurrent or refractory  malignancies (MDX -03).36,37
In order to further characterize the frequency and outcom e of such apparent ly infrequent safet y 
events, the current study  will treat approximately 150 subjects with nivolumab. This sample size 
will allow for estimat ing an incidence rate of 0.67% (n=1 subject with events) with a 95% CI 
(confidence interval) of (0. 02%, 3.7%), or an incidence rate of 2% (n= 3subjects with events) wit h 
a 95% CI of (0. 4%, 5.7%). Furthermore, the sample size will allow for enough events to compare 
incidence in large co mmunit y pract ice wit h historical adverse event data.

The number of subjects who are evaluable for AEs in the study will be150. We make the 
conservative assumpti on based on Motzer29that the rate of IMAEs of grades 3-5 is 13%. The 
primary  goal  of the present study  is to address whether the rate is consistent with the rate reported 
in the Motzer study in the sense that th e final 95% confidence interval is wholly less than 20%. As 
indicated in Table 8.1 -1, this would happen if the observed rate is less t han 1 3.3% or l ess (20/150 
or fewer grade 3-5 IMAEs ). The trial has 61% power to demonstrate consistency of rates in the 
sense that the probabilit y is 61% of showing the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is 
less than 20% when the true rate is 13%.   The trial has 80% power to demonstrate the consistency 
of rates when then true rate is 11.5%
The observed rate may be somewhat larger than 13.3% and will still be consistent with 
expectati ons regarding safet y, although it may raise concerns that the present popul ation may be 
different fro m that of the Motzer study or that the assessment of AEs is different in the two studies. 
Only if the 95% confidence interval extends beyond 25% would the resul ts of the study  raise

serious safet y concerns. This woul d happen if the observed rate is at least 18% (27/150 or more 
grade 3-5 STRAEs) ,seeTable 8.1-1. Again assuming that the true rate is 13%, the power of  the 
study , the probabilit y that the 95% confidence interval is wholly less than 25% (and so the 
observed rate is less or equal  to18%) i s 95%. Also, if the true rate in the present study  is actually
15%, the probabilit y of showing that the 95 % confidence interval is who lly less than 25% is 82%.
8.2 Populations for Analyses
All enrolled subjects: all subjects who signed an informed consent form and were registered 
into the IVRS. 
All treated subjects: all subjects who received any nivo lumab. This i s the primary  popul ation 
for safet y and efficacy analyses. Subpopulat ion analyses will be conducted for subjects in 
Groups 1 -3.
All response evaluable subjects: all treated subjects who have baseline and at least one on -
study  evaluable tum or measurement.
8.3 Endpoint s
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary object ive of the study  will be assessed by measuring the incidence for high grade 
(Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs .
The IMAEs of interest are the following: skin, endocrinopathy , gastroi ntestinal, hepat ic, renal, 
pulmo nary, and neuro logicadverse events .
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The secondary  objective of the study  will be assessed by  measuring the fo llowing:
median time to onset, median time to resolution of high grade (Grade 3 -4)IMAEs
percentage of subjects who received immune modulating medicat ion (e.g. cortico idsteroi ds, 
infliximab, cyclophosphamide , IVIG, and  mycophenol ate mofetil), or horm onal replacement 
therapy , the percentage of subjects who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, total 
durati on of  all immune m odulating medicat ions given for the IMAE and summary  of subjects

values using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method with 95% CI using Brookm eyer and 
Crowl ey method of time to onset and time to resol ution, and will be presented for all treated 
subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3. Time to onset is calculated from first dosing date to the event onset 
date. The IMAEs of interest are the following: skin, endocrinopathy , gastrointestinal, hepat ic, 
renal, pulm onary, and neuro logical adverse events .If a subject never experienced the given AE, 
the subject will  be censored at the last contact date. Time to resol ution is calculated from the AE 
onset date to AE end date. If an AE is ongoing at the time of analysis, the time to resol ution will 
be censored at the last contact date.
Management of high-grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will be characterized 
by measuring percentage of subjects who received immune modulating medicat ion (or horm onal 
replacement therapy ), percentage of subjects who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, and 
total duration of all immune modulat ing medications given for the event, in all treated subjects 
who have experience high -grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs and all subjects in 
Groups 1, 2, and 3.

Com plete Abst inence If one form  of contracepti on is requi red, Com plete 
Abstinence is defined as co mplete avo idance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form o f contraceptio n for all 
study  drugs. Female subjects must continue to have 
pregnancy tests.  Acceptable alternate methods of highly 
effect ive contraception must be discuss ed in the event that 
the subject chooses to forego complete abst inence.
If two forms of contraception is required, Co mplete 
abstinence is defined as co mplete avo idance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form o f contraceptio n for all 
study  drugs. Subjects who choose complete abst inence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly  effect ive 
contraception must be discussed in the even t that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abst inence.
Expanded definition Com plete abst inence as defined as 
complete avoi dance of heterosexual intercourse is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs. This 
also m eans that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifest yle 
of the pati ent. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovul ation, symptothermal, professio n of abstinence 
for entry  into a clinical trial, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal , which are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Subjects who choose complete abst inence are 
not requi red to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly  effect ive 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject

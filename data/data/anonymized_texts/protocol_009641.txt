 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study  Design  
 
This is a phase II, open label, non -randomized, multi -institutional study of nivolumab (anti -PD-1) 
incorporated into a definitive immunoradiotherapy program following modified induction chemotherapy 
using nivolumab for locoregionally advanced larynx and hy popharynx squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head  and neck  (SCCHN).  Patients  with confirmed  locoregionally  advanced  SCCHN  arising  in the larynx 
or hypopharynx  will receive  2-3 cycles  of induction  docetaxel  (T), cisplatin  (P) and nivolumab  (N) every 
3 weeks fol lowed by clinical and radiologic assessment of response. Patients with at least a partial 
response (PR) defined by RECIST 1.1 will proceed with immunoradiotherapy concurrently with 
nivolumab. This will then be followed by an adjuvant phase of nivolumab dos ed every 28 days for up to 
6-cycles or until disease progression or recurrence. Those patients with less than a PR to induction TPN 
will be offered salvage laryngectomy and/or pharyngectomy. The primary objective of this study is to 
improve  efficacy  with respect  to the endpoint  of laryngectomy -free survival  (LFS)  in this population.  The 
primary endpoint  is to evaluate LFS at 2 -years from study registration. Secondary  endpoints will  include 
overall  survival  (OS),  locoregional  control  rate (LRC),  and laryngo -esophageal  dysfunction -free survival 
(LEDFS).  
 
We hypothesize that the combination of nivolumab and radiotherapy used as definitive treatment 
following induction TPN in patients with locoregionally SCCHN arising in the larynx or hypopharynx 
will im prove 2 -year LFS relative to sequential induction TP + 5 -fluorouracil (F) followed by platinum - 
based chemoradiotherapy.  
 
1.2 Primary  Objectives  
 
• To improve efficacy with respect to laryngectomy -free survival (LFS) at 2 -years from time of  
study registration as the primary endpoint.  
 
1.3 Secondary  Objectives  
 
• To evaluate  clinicopathologic  and radiologic  response  
• To estimate  OS 
• To estimate  LEDFS  
• To evaluate  safety  and toxicity,  and quality  of life scores  
• To characterize  distinct  tumor  immunophentoypes  and correlate  these  findings  with outcomes  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study  Disease  
 
There are roughly 13,000 cases of laryngeal cancer each year in the United States, the majority of which 
arise in the supraglottic or glottic region [1]. Hypopharyngeal cancers arise in the pharyngeal wall, 
piriform  sinuses,  and post-cricoid  region  which  encompasses  the lateral,  inferior,  and posterior  borders  of 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652

5  
  
the larynx, respectively – but overall are less common. While cancers arising along the vocal cords or 
glottic  region  can present  with early -stage  disease  due to the recognition  of dysphonia  or voice  hoarseness, 
supraglottic and hypopharyngeal cancers are often detected in the locoregionally advanced stages given 
the delay in symptom development and the rich lymphatic drainage of this anatomic region.  
 
The treatment approach to locore gionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers is complex: 
with treatment guided by the anatomic location and extent of the tumor, along with patient -specific 
circumstances (such as age, functional status, psychosocial elements, and comorbid medica l conditions). 
Input from a multidisciplinary team that includes a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and head & 
neck surgeon is crucial to individualizing the treatment strategy [2]. Functional organ preservation has 
been favored in recent years, o wing to several landmark studies demonstrating that larynx preservation 
rates  (LPR)  are favorable  with a non-surgical  treatment  approach  without  jeopardizing  survival  outcomes 
[3-4]. A series  of trials  have  clarified  that definitive  concurrent  platinum -based  chemoradiotherapy  (CRT) 
or a sequential treatment approach using induction chemotherapy followed by definitive CRT offers 
similar outcomes in locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers [5]. The favored 
regimen  for induction  chemotherapy  has been  established:  a combination  of a taxane  added  to a platinum - 
fluoropyrimidine backbone [6 -9]. While neither definitive CRT nor sequential therapy are superior, 
induction  chemotherapy  might  be favored  in those  with bulky  primary  tumors  or in those  with low cervical 
neck adenopathy owing to the risk of distant metastatic spread [10]. Despite the treatment options 
summarized  above, 5 - and 10 -year overall survival (OS) rates  for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and 
hypopharyngeal  cancer patients  are guarded  (5-year OS: 54-58%,  10-year OS: 28-39%).  These  outcomes 
speak to the significant rate of locoregional failure in this population, with surgery offered as a salvage 
strategy in appropriate patients [11].  
 
2.2 IND Agent  
 
2.2.1 Nivolumab  
 
2.2.1.1  Mechanism  of action  and pharmacology  
 
It has become evident that tumor progression is promoted by immune evasion and abrogation of an 
effective immune response against cancer cells [6]. Mechanisms of tumor evasion include the 
development of T cell tolerance, modulation of inflammatory and angi ogenic cytokines, downregulation 
of antigen -processing machinery, and changes in immune checkpoint receptor ligands or receptors that 
can all facilitate tumor immune evasion [7 -9]. These mechanisms serve to define immunotherapy targets 
for clinical  develop ment. Immune checkpoint  receptors block normal T  cell activation and costimulation 
to maintain a homeostatic immune response [10]. Programmed cell death protein -1 (PD -1, CD279), one 
such receptor,  is expressed  on the surface  of immune  cells and interact  with its cognate  ligands  on antigen - 
presenting or tumor cells. High tumor expression of the ligands of PD -1 (PD -L1 or B7 -H1/CD274 and 
PD-L2 or B7 -DC/CD273) and/or PD -1 expression by T lymphocytes can attenuate T cell activation and 
drive T cell exhaustion t o favor tumor immune evasion [11]. By modulating these inhibitory immune 
receptor -ligand  interactions,  the goal is to overcome  tumor  mediated  immunosuppression  and facilitate  an 
anti-tumor response. Preclinical evidence to support the negative regulatory effects of PD -1 comes from 
murine models. PD -1 knockout mice develop organ -specific autoimmunity which can mimic known 
autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) 
– but this can present  at various  time points  and relies  on host genetic  factors  [12].  Beyond  PD-1 deficient  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A

6  
  
models, antibody blockade in several mouse models have demonstrated the emergence of simi lar 
autoimmune phenomena [13]. These findings strengthen the argument that PD -1 inhibition permits 
enhancement of antigen -specific T cell response, but also indicate that responses can be variable and 
depend largely on underlying host biology.  
 
Efforts  have focused  on understanding  PD-1/L1 expression  patterns  among  various  tumor  types,  in order 
to predict  benefit  from  PD-1 blocking  mechanisms.  While  estimates  of tumor  cell PD-L1 expression  vary 
considerably based on tumor type [14, 15], studies have estimated PD -L1 expression in SCCHN at 30 – 
70% with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive tumors more frequently harboring infiltrating immune 
cells that express PD -1 [16, 17]. Upregulation of PD -L1 expression by tumor cells may offer a strategy 
for evasion  and protect  the cell from  apoptotic  demise  mediated  by T cells,  and itself  may facilitate  T cell 
apoptosis [18]. Additionally, elevated PD -L1 expression levels correlate with a poor prognosis in some 
solid tumor malignancies [19]. However, several studies have demonstrated that even tumors with 
minimal PD -L1 expression may respond to PD -1 focused inhibitory mechanisms, and thus PD -1:L1 
interactions  are only one component  that dictate  response  to these  inhibitory  immune  signals  in a complex 
tumor immune microenvironment [20, 21].  
 
Nivolumab (BMS -936558, MDX -1106) is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the PD -1 or 
CD279 cell surface receptor that binds to PD -1 with nanomolar affinity and a h igh degree of specificity. 
This therefore precludes binding to cognate ligands, PD -L1 or PD -L2 [22]. In chronic simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques, studies have shown that PD -1 blockade using an 
antibody to PD -1 was well tolerated an d resulted in rapid expansion of virus -specific CD8 T cells [23]. 
PD-1 blockade also resulted in proliferation of memory B cells and increases in SIV envelope -specific 
antibody. These improved immune responses were associated with significant reductions in  plasma viral 
load and also prolonged the survival of SIV -infected macaques. In vitro assays have demonstrated the 
ability  of nivolumab  to potently  enhance  T-cell response  and cytokine  production  (such  as interferon  alpha 
release);  when  later given  to cyno molgus  macaques  at high concentrations,  there  were  no adverse  immune - 
related events, independent of circulating levels of anti -nivolumab antibodies [24]. In intravenous (IV) 
repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus macaques, nivolumab was well tolerat ed at doses up to 50 
mg/kg, administered weekly for  5 weeks, and at doses up to  50 mg/kg,  administered twice weekly  for 27 
doses.  
 
The pharmacokinetics  of nivolumab  have  been  reported  in human  subjects  over a dose range  of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg  administered  as a single  dose or as subsequent  doses  at 2 or 3 week  intervals.  The geometric  mean 
(% CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vss) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometric mean elimination hal f-life (t1/2)  was 26.7 days (101%).  Steady - 
state concentrations  of nivolumab  were  reached  by 12 weeks  when  administered  at 3 mg/kg  every  2 weeks 
and systemic accumulation was approximately 3 -fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose 
proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. The clearance of 
nivolumab increased with increasing body weight. The popul ation pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis 
suggested that the following factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the clearance of nivolumab: 
age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline LDH, and PD -L1 expression. Although patient performance 
status,  baseli ne glomerular filtration  rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and mild hepatic  impairment did 
have a mild effect on nivolumab clearance, the effect was not clinically meaningful [22]. Additionally, 
PPK and exposure response analyses have been performed to sup port the use of 240 mg IV flat dosing 
every  2 weeks  in addition  to the 3 mg/kg  every  2 week  regimen.  Using  the PPK model,  exposure  to 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
7  
  
nivolumab  at 240 mg IV flat dose was identical  to a dose of 3 mg/kg  for subjects  weighing  80 kg. 
 
2.2.1.2  Clinical  safety  
 
In an early phase I study investigating a single IV infusion of anti -PD-1 (MDX -1106) in dose -escalating 
six-patient  cohorts  at 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg,  followed  by a 15-patient  expansion  cohort  at 10 mg/kg  (for a 
total of 39 patients), treatment was well tolerated. There was one serious adverse event, inflammatory 
colitis, observed in a patient with melanoma who received five doses at 1 mg/kg [25].  
 
In a large registration trial which randomized advanced, platinu m-refractory SCCHN patients to either 
nivolumab  or single -agent  standard  chemotherapy,  treatment -related  grade  3 or 4 adverse  events  occurred 
in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group versus 35.1% of those in the standard arm [26]. In the 
nivolumab  treated  group,  the most  common  adverse  events  were  fatigue,  nausea,  rash,  decreased  appetite, 
and pruritis. Gastrointestinal events were less common than with standard chemotherapy. Pneumonitis 
was observed  in 2.1%  of nivolumab -treated  patients  and two treatment -related  deaths  occurred  (one from 
hypercalcemia and one from pneumonitis).  
 
The overall safety experience with nivolumab as monotherapy is based on experience from more than 
8,000  subjects  treated  to-date in patients  with varied  cancer  types.  The safety  profile  appears  similar  across 
cancer types [27, 28]. Treatment -related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 7% of patients 
treated with nivolumab in advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of squamous histology and in 
16.3% of unres ectable, advanced stage melanoma patients.  
 
The safety of combining PD -1 inhibition with radiation therapy (RT) has been demonstrated in several 
reports and is being investigated in several ongoing clinical trials. Fiorica and colleagues showed the 
safety  of nivolumab  with definitive  RT retrospectively  in 35 patients  treated  with anti-PD-1 therapy  after 
hypofractionated RT at an interval of at least 1 week from the end of RT [34]. Toxicity rates between 
patients receiving RT alone and the combination of nivolumab -RT were similar.  
 
2.2.1.3  Clinical  efficacy  
 
Results from an early phase I trial demonstrated a  wide range of clinical activity, including complete, 
partial and mixed response rates in advanced solid tumor patients; including individuals with colorectal 
cancer, NSCLC, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [25]. Thirty -nine patients received a sin gle 
IV infusion of anti -PD-1 (MDX -1106) in dose -escalating six -patient cohorts at 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, 
followed by a 15 -patient expansion cohort at 10 mg/kg. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit at 3 
months  were  eligible  for repeated  therapy.  One durable  complete  response  (CR)  and two partial  responses 
(PRs; melanoma, RCC) were observed. Two additional patients (melanoma, NSCLC) had significant 
tumor regression not meeting defined PR criteria. Following this early signal, numerous clinical trials 
emerged to investigate the clinical efficacy of nivolumab in advanced solid tumor and hematologic 
malignancies – with nivolumab (Opdivo ™) now approved in multiple cancer types owing to its 
demonstrated clinical efficacy.  
 
In a randomized phase III study (Ch eckmate -141) of patients with recurrent or metastatic, platinum - 
refractory  SCCHN,  361 patients  were  assigned  to nivolumab  or standard  chemotherapy  in a 2:1 ratio with 
a primary  endpoint  of overall  survival  (OS)  [26].  Nivolumab  (at a dose of 3 mg/kg  body  weight  IV) every  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
8  
  
2 weeks or standard, single -agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab) was 
administered. Additional end points included progression -free survival (PFS), objective response rate 
(ORR), safety, and pat ient-reported quality of life (QOL). The median OS was 7.5 months (95% 
confidence  interval  [CI],  5.5 to 9.1) in the nivolumab  group  versus  5.1 months  (95%  CI, 4.0 to 6.0) in the 
group that received standard therapy. OS was significantly longer with nivolum ab than with standard 
therapy  (hazard  ratio [HR]  for death,  0.70;  97.73%  CI, 0.51 to 0.96;  p = 0.01),  and the estimates  of the 1- 
year survival rate were approximately 19 percentage points higher with nivolumab than with standard 
therapy (36.0% vs. 16.6%). Median PFS was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) with nivolumab versus 2.3 
months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1) with standard therapy (HR  for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.70 to 1.13;  p = 0.32).  The rate of PFS at 6 months  was 19.7%  with nivolumab  versus  9.9%  with standard 
therapy.  The response  rate was 13.3%  in the nivolumab  group  versus  5.8%  in the standard -therapy  group. 
Additionally, individuals in the study who were PD -L1 (≥ 1% of tumor or immune cells by 
immunohistochemistry [IHC]) or HPV positive appeared to have improved outcomes. That said, 
regardless of PD -L1 expression or HPV status, patient s treated with nivolumab experienced a reduction 
in the risk of death  compared  with standard  chemotherapies.  This study led  to the approval  of nivolumab 
in this setting in November of 2016.  
 
2.3 Other  Agents  
 
Multiple trials have clarified the three -drug combination of cisplatin, fluorouracil, plus a taxane as the 
preferred approach when using induction chemotherapy in SCCHN. Early clinical trials found that 
cisplatin (100 mg/m2 IV) and 5 -fluorouracil (1000 mg/ m2/day IV continuous over a 24 -hour infusion for 
five days) given for three cycles as induction achieved higher overall response rates and improved 
outcomes  compared  with other  two-drug platinum  based  regimens  [28].  Later  trials  found  that the addition 
of a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) to the platinum -doublet backbone with 5 -fluorouracil enhanced 
efficacy.  The most  extensive  data was from  the TAX -324 trial where  TPF (docetaxel  75 mg/m2 IV day 1, 
cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV day 1, and continuous i nfusion 5 -fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day for  days 1-4) was 
the studied regimen, which showed improved survival compared with a doublet platinum -based regimen 
[6,7].  Additionally,  a combined  meta -analysis  incorporating  data from  1,772  patients  in 5 trials  confirmed 
that adding  a taxane  to the induction  regimen  improved  survival  and decreased  rates  of locoregional  failure 
[29]. 
 
Data from the locoregionally advanced, recurrent or metastatic setting supports the combination of 
cisplatin with docetaxel (or taxanes) without infusional 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU). The EORT C performed a 
multicenter  phase  II study  using  cisplatin  (75 mg/m2 IV day 1) and docetaxel  (100 mg/m2 IV day 1) every 
21 days and noted objective response rates of 54%, with 5 complete responses and 14 partial responses 
(overall response rate of 86%) among the untreated locoregionally advanced or metastatic subgroup (n = 
22) [36]. Glisson and colleagues similarly de monstrated that the TP (docetaxel, cisplatin) combination 
yielded a 40% response rate among advanced, incurable SCCHN patients [37]. The combination of 
cisplatin -docetaxel  has been  prospectively  studied  as induction  and has demonstrated  a 70% response  rate 
(26%  CRs,  44% PRs)  but with 34% of patients  experiencing  grade  3+ neutropenia  [38].  Even  in an elderly 
population,  response  rates of up  to 88% have been described  with the TP induction backbone, without 5 - 
FU (F) [39]. These data support the choice of drugs and schedule of administration for TP in the current 
study, combined with nivolumab (N) at standard dosing to replace the 5 -fluorouracil infusion which 
requires port-a-cath placement or inpatient admission with added toxicity concerns.

2.4 Radiation  Therapy  
 
A combined  multimodality  approach  that incorporates  both chemotherapy  and radiation  therapy  (RT)  has 
long been  established  as the backbone  of definitive  treatment  based  on the results  of multiple  clinical  trials 
in SCCHN  and specifically  in larynx  and hypopharynx  cancer  [3, 27]. RTOG  0129  clarified  that an altered 
RT fractionation  schedule  when  combined  with chemotherapy  did not improve  outcomes . In fact, standard 
RT fractionation as part of a concurrent chemoradiation program appears superior [30,31]. RTOG 0129 
outlined  a total dose of 70 Gray  (Gy)  in 35 fractions  over seven  weeks,  which  is the schedule  of radiation 
proposed in the current study – which will be concurrently administered with nivolumab as part of 
definitive immunoradiotherapy.  
 
Preclinical data, particularly in melanoma, have highlighted the potential synergism when utilizing 
immune checkpoin t blockade with RT. In fact, cases of immunotherapy exposure followed by targeted 
RT has shown reductions in distant tumor sites, the abscopal effect [32]. Studies have shown that tumor 
PD-L1 expression can increase following RT exposure and that the combi nation enhances anti -tumor 
immunity [33].  
 
2.5 Rationale  
 
The primary rationale for the use of induction chemotherapy (IC) in locoregionally advanced larynx and 
hypopharynx cancers is to avoid radical surgery. With a goal of organ preservation, two initial la ndmark 
trials published in the 1990s investigated the role of IC followed by radiation [3 -4]. In both studies, 
patients  were  randomized  to a platinum -5-fluorouracil  (PF) IC regimen  followed  by radiation  (permitting 
salvage surgery) vs. conventional larynge ctomy and radiation alone. These studies demonstrated that 
larynx preservation was feasible (larynx preservation rate [LPR] between 40 -60%) without jeopardizing 
long-term survival  [5]. This was followed  by the RTOG  91-11 study  comparing  a PF IC regimen  followed 
by radiation,  concurrent  chemoradiation  (CRT),  and radiation  alone  which  showed  comparable  long-term 
survival among all three treatment arms [11 -12]. Of note,  
the composite endpoint of laryngectomy -free survival 
(LFS) was similar in both c hemotherapy -containing arms 
(5-year LFS, IC: 44.1% vs. CRT: 47%, p = 0.68);10 -year 
LFS, IC: 28.9% vs. CRT: 23.5%, p = 0.68) [ Figure right].  
It should be noted that the RTOG 91 -11 study utilized PF 
(cisplatin, 5 -FU) and not TPF for induction therapy. A 
similar study compared PF IC followed by radiation to an 
alternating platinum -based CRT schedule and 
demonstrated similar 3 -year LFS rates [13].  Larynx 
preservation  was an important  milestone  achieved  with the 
use of IC, and these  early  trials  led to updated  national  
guidelines  supporting  the role of IC as an initial  approach  in these patients.  
 
Early observations with taxanes in head and neck cancer then led to trials combining these agents with a 
PF backbone as IC. In addition, there was significant interest in using IC followed by concurrent CRT 
given the increase in locoregional control offere d by a concomitant treatment program [12]. The TAX - 
324 study  randomized  patients  with locoregionally  advanced  head  and neck  cancer,  including  larynx  and 
hypopharynx  tumors,  to receive  docetaxel  plus PF (TPF)  followed  by concurrent  CRT  vs. PF followed  by 

NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652

10  
  
the same concurrent regimen. Results showed improved 
overall survival in favor of the TPF arm (5 -year OS, TPF:  
52% vs. PF: 42%)  with a manageable  side effect  profile  [6- 
7], establishing  TPF as the preferred  IC regimen  in SCCHN.  
Two additional trials utilized the TPF regimen specifically 
in larynx and hypopharynx patients: GORTEC 2000 -01 
randomized  patients  to TPF vs. PF followed  by radiation  if 
they had any initial response to IC [8] and the LPR was 
significantly  improved  favoring  TPF (70.3%).  TREMPLIN 
was a phase  II study  using  TPF for organ  preservation  with 
responders randomly assigned to either concurrent CRT or 
cetuximab with radiation [9 ]. LPR exceeded 90% overall  
with no difference in larynx function preservation or survival among each arm. In the GORTEC study, 
larynx dysfunction -free survival (LDFFS) rates favored the TPF arm in long -term follow -up (5 -year 
LDFFS, TPF: 67.2% vs. PF: 46.5 %) [14]. TPF followed by either radiation or concurrent CRT is an 
acceptable  approach  for organ  preservation  based  on these  results,  with TPF followed  by radiation  favored 
in Europe.  
 
It is now widely recognized that tumors harbor immune checkpoint receptors to escape immune 
recognition, and immune checkpoint receptor inhibitors that block inhibitory immune cell interactions 
have  demonstrated  efficacy  in advanced  head  and neck  cancer  [16-17] prompting  clinical  trials  to explore 
their potential in other head and neck cancer populations. Recognizing that the risk of toxicity can be 
significant  with TPF IC followed  by chemoradiotherapy  (so-called  sequential  treatment),  and in the hopes 
of improving  LFS here we propose  a multicenter,  non-randomized  phase  II study  replacing  5-fluorouracil 
in TPF with the anti -PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab as TPN followed by definitive intensity -modulated 
radiation  therapy  (IMRT)  with nivolumab  and subsequent  adjuvant  PD-1 blockade.  The rationale  for using 
2-3 induction doses of immunotherapy with a TP backbone stems from early studies showing that few 
doses  of checkpoint  blockade  may be all that is necessary  to trigger  immunomodulation  prior  to definitive 
therapy  [35].  Maintaining  a platinum -taxane  based  IC regimen  and adding  active  immunotherapy  is aimed 
at decreasing cytotoxic side effects while preserving response rates and improving patient tolerability 
(such as avoiding a port -a-cath or committing the patient to infusional therapy). Several trials have 
combined taxane -platinum co mbinations alone (specifically docetaxel, cisplatin or TP) in the advanced 
setting and untreated, locoregionally advanced setting with favorable efficacy [37, 40 -41]– including an 
86% overall  response  among  untreated  locoregionally  advanced  and metastatic  patients  [36].  More  recent 
studies have investigated docetaxel -cisplatin (TP) induction and together have shown overall response 
rates to induction TP of 70 -88%, but with notable rates of neutropenia [38 -39]. Given rates of grade 3+ 
neutropenia  in many  docetaxel -cisplatin  (TP) trials,  we favor  the option  of granulocyte -colony  stimulating 
factor (GCSF) support in combination with PD -1 blockade in the current study.  
 
Posner  and colleagues  published  a further  analysis  of the TAX -324 data in 2009  [42] which  was aimed  at 
characterizing LFS rates among TPF treated patients. Among operable stage III and IV larynx or 
hypopharynx cancer patients in their analysis (n = 123), the 3 -year LFS rate was significantly higher 
among patients who received induction TP F (52%) vs. PF (32%) in TAX -324 [ Figure below right]. 
Further, the 2 -year LFS rate among the TPF arm was 58% vs. 37% in the PF arm. The authors note they 
chose the operable TAX -324 subgroup and not the entire cohort because they wanted to more closely 
represent the populations studied in prior trials (RTOG 91 -11, EORTC 24594, and GORTEC 2000 -01). 

NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652

They make the point that TAX -324 included patients with more advanced primary tumors and nodal 
disease  than these  other  trials.  They  also suggest  that using  the LFS endpoint  in an inoperable  population 
is not feasible  since  inoperable  patients  don't  have  a surgical  salvage  option  and would  present  with more 
advanced disease characteristics. Finally, the authors point out that the lower 2 -year LFS results in this 
TAX -324 subanalysis  for the PF arm (37%)  as compared  to RTOG  91-11 (2-year LFS for the PF arm was 
60%) resulted from the more liberal entry crit eria for TAX -324 which allowed patients with borderline 
operable or more advanced disease. Since the proposed trial using induction TPN will not select patients 
based  on upfront  operability  (and therefore  may enroll  a more  advanced  stage  cohort)  and will select  HPV 
negative participants, we consider a 2 -year LFS estimate of 55% for induction TPF both reasonable and 
conservative for comparison.  
 
In summary,  we hope  to demonstrate  an improvement  in the 2-year LFS rate compared  with the preferred 
sequential therapy approach of TPF followed by CRT. Secondary endpoints will include OS at 2 -years 
and the important composite endpoint of laryngo -esophageal dysfunction -free survival (LEDFS) at 2 - 
years which attempts to capture long -term, patie nt-focused functional outcomes. If this immunotherapy - 
based sequential treatment program proves beneficial, it could stand next to or replace TPF followed by 
definitive chemoradiotherapy.  
 
2.6 Correlative  Studies  Background  
 
Given  that response  rates  to PD-1 blockade  in the advanced,  platinum -refractory  SCCHN  setting  approach 
20%,  there  is strong  interest  in identifying  biomarkers  that predict  clinical  benefit.  In a NSCLC  population, 
PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor cells yielded a response rate of 45.2%, compared with an 
objective  response  rate of 19.4%  among  all treated  patients  [17].  More  recently,  whole -exome  sequencing 
of NSCLC tumors treated with PD -1 blockad e revealed that higher mutational burden correlated with 
improved objective response rates [18]. Somatic alterations in tumor cells yield neoantigens which are 
thought to facilitate antigen -specific CD8+ T cell responses – suggesting that the genomic lands cape of 
the tumor  impacts  PD-1 response.  In SCCHN,  stromal  or tumor  PD-L1 expression  does appear  to partially 
impact response, but even PD -L1 negative patients may respond to treatment – suggesting important 
mechanisms beyond PD -1:L1 interactions [15, 19].  
 
Early preclinical and clinical studies have also demonstrated potential synergy between high dose per 
fraction radiotherapy and immunotherapy [20]. Radiation delivered in a limited number of fractions has 
been shown to impact circulating immunologic cytokines and have local immunologic effects on the 
primary tumor [21]. Some reports even suggest that h ypofractionated radiation can potentiate 
immunologic  effects  following  PD-1/L1  exposure  leading  to responses  outside  the targeted  radiation  field 
(so-called  abscopal  effect)  [22-23]. Curiously,  circulating  levels  of activated  T cells appear  increased  and 
myeloid -derived  suppressor  cells (MDSCs)  decreased  among  melanoma  patients  with abscopal  responses 
following radiation [22].  
 
More  recent  work  has sought  to use more  comprehensive  immune -based  metrics  to characterize  the tumor 
microenvironment. Cytometric profiling has identified immunologically ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ 
immunophenotypes which may identify tumors more likely to respond to immunotherapies [24 -25]. We 
have demonstrated similar findings in head and neck cancer patient s: showing that a robust CD8+ T cell 
infiltrate and pattern of immune checkpoint co -expression may predict clinical benefit to PD -1 blockade 
in an advanced  SCCHN  population  [26].

The participating site will then call or e -mail the Study Coordinator to verify eligibility. The Study 
Coordinator will follow DF/HCC policy (REGIST -101) and register the participant on  the protocol.  The 
Study Coordinator will fax or e -mail the participant  study number, and if applicable the dose treatment 
level, to the participating site. The Study Coordinator will also contact the participating site and verbally 
confirm registration.  
 
 
5. TREATMENT  PLAN  
 
Eligibility  and exclusion  criteria  are provided  in Section 3. These  criteria  will be assessed  21 days prior 
to study registration to establish eligibility and baseline values.  
 
Informed  consent  will be obtained  after the study  has been  fully  explained  to the subject  and before  the 
conduct of any screening procedures or assessments.  
 
Demographic information and baseline characteristics will be collected at the Screening Visit.  Standard 
demographic parameters include age, sex, and race/ethnicity (recorded in accordance with prevailing 
regulations). Baseline characteristics will include ECOG PS (Appendix A), disease status, and medical 
histories.  
 
5.1 Treatment  Regimen  
 
5.1.1 C1D1  of TPN  Induction  Therapy  
 
No investigational  or commercial  agents  or therapies  other  than those  described  below  may be 
administered with the intent to treat the participant's malignancy.  
 
The induction  TPN  cycle  will be 21 days  long, and nivolumab  cycles  thereafter  will be 28 days  long. 
 
Below  are the specific  laboratory  criteria  patients  will need  to meet  in order  to begin  a subsequent  cycle 
of TPN (docetaxel, cisplatin and nivolumab):  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
16  
  
• Leukocytes  ≥3,000/mcL  
• Absolute  neutrophil  count  ≥1,500/mcL  
• Platelets  ≥100,000/mcL  
• Total  bilirubin  ≤2.0 g/dL 
• AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  ≤2.5 × institutional  upper  limit  of normal  
• Creatinine  within  normal  institutional  limits  
OR 
• Creatinine  clearance  ≥60 mL/min/1.73  m2 for participants  with creatinine  levels  above 
institutional normal  
• Thyroid function tests (TSH) should be reviewed prior to the start of TPN therapy. If abnormal 
then replacement hormone therapy can be utilized without delaying the start of induction TPN. 
Thyroid  function  test abnormaliti es generally  should  not interrupt  dosing  on protocol  unless  the 
patient is severely symptomatic from hypo - or hyperthyroidism.  
• Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum 
sensitivity 25 iu/l or equivalent uni ts of hcg) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab.  
 
5.1.2 Dose  and schedule  of TPN  Cycles,  and Pre-medications  
 
Patients with confirmed locoregionally advanced SCCHN arising in the larynx or hypopharynx will 
receive 3 cycles of induction docetaxel, cisplatin and nivolumab (TPN) every 3 weeks (or 21 days ), 
followed by clinical and radiologic assessment of response.  
 
TPN dosing will consist of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV day 1, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV day 1, and nivolumab 
240 mg IV flat dose day 1 of a 21 day cycle . 
 
Standard pre -medications including dexamethasone, palonosetron or ondansetron, and fosaprepitant are 
permitted  for anti-emetic  effect.  Pre-medication  with dexamethasone  prior  to taxane  exposure  is permitted 
and strongly encouraged.  
 
5.1.2.1  Antibiotic  prophylaxis  and GCSF  support  
 
Following each TPN cycle administered, patients will receive oral levofloxacin 500 mg daily by mouth 
on day 5 through day 15 of the cycle for antibiotic prophylaxis.  
 
In addition, granulocyte -colony stimulating factor (GCSF) support can be administered (at the treating 
physician’s discretion, see Section 2.5 ) at least 24 hours (but no later than 72 hours) after completion of 
the TPN  infusion  in the form  of pegfilgastrim  6 mg subcutaneously  once  or as tbo-filgastrim  administered 
subcutaneously daily at least 24 hours after the completion of the TPN infusion (but no later than 72 
hours).  Tbo-filgastrim  should  be given  for at least 5 days and continued  for a maximum  of 14 days or until 
the ANC is at or above 1000. Tbo -filgrastim should not be given with 24 hours of the start of the next 
cycle of TPN.

5.1.2.2  Dose  Reductions  and Delays  for TPN 
 
• If laboratory criteria are not met or patient experienced toxicity prohibits the administration of a 
subsequent TPN cycle, the next cycle can be delayed up to 14 days (2 weeks) and then resumed 
at chemotherapy dose attenuation (at the discretion of the tre ating physician and per protocol 
standards in Section 6.0 ). 
• If laboratory criteria or treatment -related side effects limit the administration of cycle 2 of TPN 
for more than 14 days, the subject should be removed from the study treatment.  
• If administration  of cycle  3 of TPN  is delayed  more  than 14 days,  the treating  physician  or PI may 
allow  the subject  to proceed  to the definitive  radioimmunotherapy  phase  of treatment  (i.e. 2 cycles 
of TPN are required to proceed to the definitive radioimmunotherapy phase of treatment).  
• Individual cytotoxic agents (docetaxel or cisplatin) can be modified or dose reduced at the 
discretion of the treating physician (see Section 6.0 ), but should not be individually omitted from 
the TPN regimen. Nivolumab should not be dose reduced but rather held for patient experienced 
toxicity during the induction TPN phase.  
 
5.1.3 Post-TPN  Imaging  for Response  Assessment  
Subjects  will undergo  repeat  neck  CT or MRI  or PET-CT following  the completion  of the induction  phase 
of treatment ( at least 10 days after the completion of the last TPN infusion).  
• Partial or Complete Response: Patients with a radiographic partial response (PR) defined by 
RECIST 1.1 following 2 -3 cycles of induction TPN, w ill proceed with immunoradiotherapy 
concurrently with nivolumab.  
• Stable  Disease  or Progression : Those  patients  in whom  at least a radiographic  PR is not achieved 
will be offered  surgical  salvage  comprised  of laryngectomy  and/or  pharyngectomy  at the discretion 
of the involved head & neck surgeon, if their disease is deemed resectable. In the case of salvage 
surgery, the patient will not proceed with further study treatments and will receive standard post - 
operative radiation with or without chemothera py off protocol. If the patient has less than a 
radiographic PR to induction TPN and declines salvage surgery or is deemed unresectable, the 
patient is likely to be considered palliative or incurable and may continue cytotoxic therapy or 
immunotherapy,  or even  consider  radiation  or chemoradiotherapy,  at the discretion  of the treating 
physician.  
 
5.1.4 Concurrent  Radioimmunotherapy  with Nivolumab  
At least 21 days or 3 weeks after completion of the last cycle (cycle 2 or 3) of TPN and after completion 
of reimaging, patients will start concurrent radioimmunotherapy. Intensity -modulated radiotherapy 
(IMRT) is preferred, and proton beam radiotherapy is  not permitted. If a patient completes the induction 
phase of the study but elects to come off protocol for proton beam radiotherapy, this will be logged and 
tracked,  and annually  reported.  Six months  after study  initiation,  the PI and co-investigators  should review 
proton use data.  
 
Treatment planning CT scans should be performed with neck and shoulder immobilization that will also 
be used during daily treatment.  Treatment planning scans should at least encompass the region from the 
orbits to below the cla vicles. CT scan thickness should be 0.3 cm or thinner in the area of the target 
volumes.

5.1.4.1  Radiation  Therapy  Planning  and Delivery  
 
Target volumes should be delineated on each CT slice where present. The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) 
is specifically defined as all known gross disease determined from pre -chemotherapy evaluations 
including  clinical  information  and imaging  (CT, MRI  or PET).  Clinical  target  volumes  (CTV)  are defined 
as either  the GTV  with an anatomical  margin  or areas  at risk of harboring  microscopic  disease.  Generally, 
these  volumes  will include  a high-risk clinical  target  volume  (CTV1)  including  volumes  of potential  tumor 
extension  (adjacent  to primary  or nodal  GTV)  and nodal  areas  at highest  risk for microscopic  involvement 
abutting areas of gross disease. The  exact margins will be determined on  a case by case basis. There will 
also generally be a CTV2 including lymp h node or other regions at lesser risk of nodal involvement. In 
general,  the entire  larynx  and both sides  of the neck  (including  most  or all of levels  2-4) should  be treated 
as part of GTV, CTV1 or CTV2 in all cases, and depending on the location of primary tumor and/or 
involved lymph nodes, consideration should be given to include nodal levels VI, and the upper 
mediastinum a tracheostomy/stoma if present, as well as l evels 1b and 5 and the lateral retropharyngeal 
lymph nodes in the node positive neck. The planning target volumes (PTV) will provide a margin to 
account  for variation  in daily  set up and are in general  expected  to be approximately  3-5mm.  The following 
norm al structures  should  also be defined  and delineated  in all cases:  spinal  cord,  brainstem,  right  and left 
parotid  and submandibular  glands,  larynx,  mandible,  oral cavity,  esophagus,  left and right  brachial  plexus, 
left and right cochlea, constrictor muscles, or postcricoid.  
 
The GTV should be prescribed either 70 Gy in 35 fractions or 69.96 Gy in 33 fractions and CTV1 and 
CTV2 should be prescribed approximately between 59 -63 Gy, and 46 -54 Gy, respectively. D efinitive 
immunoradiation should be delivered in 33 -35 fractions with intensity -modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). 
Either dose -painting IMRT or a sequential boost approach are permitted. No more than 20% of the PTV 
should  receive  >110%  of the prescription  dose. In most  cases,  no more  than 5% of the PTV  should  receive  
< 95% of the prescription  dose.  
 
The following  normal  tissue  limits  are recommended:  
Brainstem  maximum  < 54 Gy 
Spinal  Cord  maximum  < 45 Gy 
Mandible  maximum  < 70 Gy 
Cochlea  maximum  < 30 Gy 
Brachial  plexus  maximum  < 66 Gy 
Parotid  mean  dose to one of the  parotid glands  < 26 Gy 
 
Note : In cases  with a conflict  and/or  overlap  between  target  and normal  tissue,  target  dose considerations 
should take priority at the discretion of the treating physician. Exceptions to this include the brainstem 
and spinal cord, which take priority.  
 
Treatment should be delivered with megavoltage equipment capable of delivering static or dynami c 
intensity modulation or other techniques capable of meeting dose specifications and constraints and 
delivering highly conformal radiation. Treatment should generally be delivered once daily, Monday - 
Friday,  over a period  of approximately  7 weeks.  Treatme nt breaks  are strongly  discouraged.  Images  should 
be obtained  prior  to the first treatment  to verify  the treatment  position.  During  treatment,  imaging  should 
be repeated  at least once  per week  for setup  verification,  although  daily  image  guided  radiation  therapy  is

suggested.  
 
Real time radiation plan review is not required. However, for verification purposes, it is requested that 
sites submit digital radiation data within two weeks following the completion of radiation therapy.  This 
should  be transferred  via secure  Partners  Healthcare  Interface  (transfer.partners.org).  Participating  centers 
will be invited  to create  an account  within  this system  by study  staff.  These  data should  include:  treatment 
plan in DICOM  format  including  the complete  radiation  structure  set and radiation  dose matrix  in absolute 
dose, as well as supportive diagnostic imaging used to create the radiation treatment plan (e.g. imaging 
performed prior to induction chemotherapy); a dose volume histogra m (DVH) including all treatment 
targets and organs at risk; and summary document(s) which includes: the date of first and last treatment, 
the prescribed  dose to each target  (GTV,  CTV1,  CTV2),  treatment  planning  system,  and method  of IGRT, 
if applicable.  
 
5.1.4.2  Radiation  Timing  and Schedule  
 
The first fraction of RT should be administered no later than 6 weeks (or 42 days) after the last cycle of 
TPN. The planned 33 -35 fractions of RT are to be administered on a continuous weekday schedule for a 
total of approximately 7 weeks (permitting holid ay and weekend day interruptions).

These  events  and rates  will be continuously  monitored  and decisions  made  regarding  the overall  status  of 
the trial.  
 
5.2 Pre-Treatment  Criteria  
 
5.2.1 Cycle  1, Day 1 
If screening assessments occur within a week before start of study treatment, then they may serve as the 
baseline  or cycle  1 day 1 visit.  Laboratory  evaluations  do not need  to be repeated  to meet  eligibility  criteria 
on cycle 1 day 1, if they were done within 3 days of the first treatment dose.  
 
5.3 Chemotherapy  Administration  
 
When administering TPN cycles, the T (docetaxel) should be administered per standard institutional 
guidelines  first, followed  by a 30 minu te wait period  to evaluate  for infusion  reaction.  P (cisplatin)  should 
be administered second per institutional standards, followed by a 30 minute wait period. Nivolumab 
should be administered last as outlined in Section 5.4 below, and given over 30 minute s. 
 
For both docetaxel and cisplatin, standard operating procedure should be applied when recalculating 
weight -based dosing at the beginning of each cycle. Nivolumab is to be used at a flat dose.  
 
5.4 Nivolumab  Administration  
 
5.4.1 Description  of the Dosage  Form  
Nivolumab injection, 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL): Nivolumab  injection,  100 mg/10  mL (10 mg/mL)  is 
a clear  to opalescent,  colorless  to pale yellow  liquid,  which  may contain  light (few)  particulates.  The drug 
product is a sterile, non -pyrogenic, single -use, isotonic aqueous solution formulated at 10 mg/mL in 
sodium citrate, sodium chloride, mannitol, diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (pentetic acid), and

holdup. It is supplied in 10 -cc Type I flint glass vials, stoppered with butyl rubber stoppers and sealed 
with aluminum seals.  
 
5.4.2 Drug  Product  Preparation  
Nivolumab Injection, 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL): Nivolumab injection is to be administered over 30 
minutes (± 10 minutes) as an IV infusion through a 0.2 to 0.22 micron pore size, low -protein binding 
(polyethersulfone membrane) in -line filter at the protocol -specified doses and infusion times. It is not to 
be administered as an IV push or bolus injection.  Dilute nivolumab with either 0.9% sodium chloride 
injection, USP or 5% dextrose injection, USP to prepare an infusion with a final concentration ranging 
from  1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL.  The total infusion volume must not exceed 160 mL.  
 
During  drug product  preparation  and handling,  vigorous mixing  or shaking  is to be avoided.  
 
Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solution as the product does not con tain any 
antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent. Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) or polyolefin containers and infusion sets, and glass bottles.  
 
5.4.3 Recommended  Storage  and Use Conditions  
Nivolumab Injection, 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL): Vials of nivolumab injection must be stored at 2°C 
to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and protected from light and freezing.  
 
The administration of nivolumab infusion must be completed within 24 hours of preparation. If not used 
immediately,  the infusion  solution  may be stored  under  refrigeration  conditions  (2°C  to 8°C, 36°F  to 46°F) 
for up to 24 hours, and a maximum of 8 hours o f the total 24 hours can be at room temperature (20°C to 
25°C, 68°F to 77°F) and room light. The maximum of 8 hours under room temperature and room light 
conditions includes the product administration period.  
 
5.5 General  Concomitant  Medication  and Supportive  Care  Guidelines  
 
5.5.1 CYP  450 Drug  Interactions  
 
Because there is a potential for interaction of nivolumab with other concomitantly administered drugs 
through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other 
drugs, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapies.  
 
The Overall  PI should  be alerted  if the participant  is taking  any agent  known  to affect  or with the potential 
to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes.  
 
5.5.2 Prohibited  and/or  Restricted  Treatments  
 
The following  medications  are prohibited  during  the study  (unless  utilized  to treat a drug related  adverse 
event):  
• Immunosuppressive  agents  
• Immunosuppressive  doses  of systemic  corticosteroids  with the exception  of during  the induction  phase 
of treatment for pre -medication and anti -emetic purposes

− Note : In regards to cisplatin anti -emetic prevention: dexamethasone is permitted on days 1 -4 of 
the induction  or TPN  cycle  (up to 12 mg IV/po  on day 1) and reduced  to a total dose of 8 mg daily 
for up to 3 days after cisplatin  dosing.  Delayed  emesis  can be managed  in a subsequent  TPN  cycle 
using dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily x 2 -days followed by 4 mg twice daily x 2 -days starting 
the day after chemotherapy dosing.  
• Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non -palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents  
 
5.5.3 Other  Restrictions  and Precautions  
 
Participants with a condition requiring sys temic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 20 mg daily 
prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 7 days of the first dose of 
nivolumab  treatment  are excluded.  Inhaled  or topical  steroids,  and adrenal  replacement  steroid  doses  ≤ 20 
mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.  
 
5.5.4 Permitted  Therapy  
 
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic  absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 20 mg daily 
prednisone are permitted. A course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for 
treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction cause d by a contact 
allergen) is permitted.

6.1 Dose  Delays  or Modifications  for TPN  
 
Dose  modifications  for the docetaxel -cisplatin  (TP) component  of the TPN  regimen  are permitted  and 
should follow institutional standards based on toxicity, with the following suggested modifications:  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
24  
  
• When dose reductions in TP (docetaxel and cisplatin) occur they should include the appropriate 
dose level reductions of both or either agent as specified in Table B below (each row of Table B 
indicates the recommended single or dual agent reduction). In Ta ble B, the toxicity listed in the 
first column on the left corresponds to the recommended dose attenuation in the middle and right 
columns.  
• A maximum of 2 dose reductions per individual study chemotherapy drugs are permitted: if 
additional reductions are r equired, the induction TPN regimen should be discontinued.  
• If this occurs  in cycle  3 of the TPN  phase,  the patient  may proceed  to definitive  radioimmunotherpy 
on protocol.  
• If this occurs  during  cycles  1 or 2 of induction  TPN,  the patient  will be removed  from  the protocol.  
• Once  a dose has been  decreased,  it should  remain  reduced  for all subsequent  dosing  unless  dose is 
further reduced. No dose escalations will be allowed.  
• If one or more  of the study  drugs  is delayed  due to drug related  toxicities  during  a treatment  cycle, 
the other study drugs (TP or N) in the regimen may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator;  when  dosing  is resumed,  dose reduction  should  only be applied  to the study  drug that 
was withheld.

6.2 Dose  Delays  for Nivolumab  
 
There will be no dose reductions for nivolumab permitted. Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, 
delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the participant tolerates the treatment. Dosing visits are 
not skipped, only delayed.  
Administration  of nivolumab  should  be delay ed for the following  adverse  events:  
• Grade  2 non-skin,  drug-related  adverse  event,  with the exception  of fatigue  
• Grade  2 drug-related  creatinine,  AST,  ALT  and/or  Total  Bilirubin  abnormalities  
• Grade  3 skin,  drug-related  adverse  event  
• Grade  3 drug-related  laboratory  abnormality,  with the following  exceptions:  
− Grade  3 lymphopenia  or asymptomatic  amylase  or lipase  does not require  dose delay  
− Grade   3 AST,  ALT,  Total  Bilirubin  will require  dose discontinuation  
• Any adverse  event,  laboratory  abnormality,  or intercurrent  illness  which,  in the judgment  of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.  
Note:  see Appendix  C for guidelines  on managing  immune -related  toxicities  
 
Participants  who require  delay  of nivolumab  should  be re-evaluated  weekly  or more  frequently  if clinically 
indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when re -treatment criteria (as described below) are met. 
Participants with a delay in dosing beyond 6 weeks should be considered for discontinuat ion of protocol 
treatment and discussed with the Overall PI.  
 
Subsequent  dosing  may be re-started  if subjects  continue  to meet  laboratory  criteria  (baseline  values).  The 
investigator  will determine  if subsequent  dosing  is appropriate  for subjects  who have  laboratory  or clinical 
abnormalities that do not meet dose discontinuation criteria (described below). All related grade 2 
toxicities should be discussed with the Overall PI, prior to subsequent dosing.  
 
6.2.1 Administration  of nivolumab  should  be permanent ly discontinued  for the 
following adverse events:  
 
• Any grade  encephalitis,  grade  3 adrenal  insufficiency,  and grade  3 myocarditis,  or any reoccurrence 
of the same grade 3 adverse reaction will require discontinuation of nivolumab.  
• A grade  3 pneumonitis  and grade 3  uveitis  will require  permanent discontinuation.  
• Any grade  4 adverse  event  will require  permanent  discontinuation  with the followi ng 
exceptions:  
− Grade  4 electrolyte  abnormalities  that < 72 hours  in duration  
− Grade  4 neutropenia  or lymphopenia  < 5 days in  duration  
− Grade  4 increase  in amylase  or lipase  that is not associated  with clinical  or radiographic 
evidence of pancreatitis  
 
The consideration to re -initiate study therapy under these exceptions will be made on a case by 
case basis  after considering  the overall  benefit/risk  profile  and in consultation  with the Overall  PI.

7. ADVERSE  EVENTS:  LIST  AND  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse  event  (AE)  monitoring  and reporting  is a routine  part of every  clinical  trial. The following  list of 
reported  and/or  potential  AEs and the characteristics  of an observed  AE will determine  whether  the event 
requires expedited reporting in addition to routine reporting.  
 
7.1 Adverse  Event  Characteristics:  
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Eve nts (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web 
site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Probable  – The AE  is likely  related  to the  study  treatment.  
- Possible  – The AE may be related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unrelated  – The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the study  treatment.  
 
7.2 Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
7.2.1 In the event of an unanticipated problem or life -threatening complications treating investigators 
must immediately notify the Overall PI.  
 
7.2.2 Investigators  must  report  to the Overall  PI any adverse  event  (AE)  that occurs  after the initial  dose 
of study treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days of the last dose of treatment.  
SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be accessed at: 
http://www.accessdata.fd a.gov/scripts/medwatch/.  Send  the SAE  forms  as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.2.3 For Multi -Center  Trials  where  a DF/HCC  investigator  is serving  as the Sponsor,  each participating 
institution must abide by the reporting requirements set by the DF/HCC. This applies to any 
medical event equivalent to an unexpected grade 2 or 3 with a possible, probable or definite 
attribution, unexpected grade 4 toxicities, and grade 5 (death) regardless of study phas e or 
attribution.

the event.  
 
The Overall PI will submit AE reports from outside institutions to the DFCI OHRS according to 
DFCI IRB policies and procedures in reporting adverse events.  
 
7.3 Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
A Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  that at any dose:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening  (defined  as an event  in which  the participant  was at risk of death  at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or causes  prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  (see NOTE  
below)  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
28  
  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropria te medical and scientific 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent 
one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, 
but are not limited to, intens ive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.)  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug 
is an SAE.  
 
Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI), and cancer are not always 
serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs.  
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy shoul d be reported as an 
SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported).  
 
7.4 Expected  Toxicities  
 
Expected  adverse  events  are those  that have  been  previously  identified  as resulting  from  administration  of 
the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the 
current adverse event list  in the Investigator’s Brochure or is included in the informed  consent document 
as a potential  risk. Most  common  adverse  events  or expected  toxicities  are listed  below.  Details  are found 
in the respective IBs. Management of expected toxicities is described in Appendix C.  
 
Toxicities  related  to cisplatin  and docetaxel  will be managed  according  to their respective  USPI.  
 
7.5 Adverse  Events  List 
 
Most common adverse reactions (>20%) related to nivolumab alone were: fatigue, rash, 
musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, decreased 
appetite, back pain, arthralgia, upper respiratory t ract infection, pyrexia.  
 
The following  hospitalizations  are not considered  SAEs  in BMS  supported  clinical  studies:  
 
− A visit to the emergency  room  or other  hospital  department  < 24 hours,  that does not result  in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
− Elective  surgery,  planned  prior  to signing  consent  
− Admissions  as per protocol  for a planned  medical/surgical  procedure  
− Routine  health  assessment  requiring  admission  for baselin e/trending  of health  status  (eg, routine 
colonoscopy)  
− Medical/surgical  admission  other  than to remedy  ill health  and planned  prior  to entry  into the study. 
Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.

7.6 Routine  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
Investigators will assess  the occurrence of AEs  and SAEs at all participant evaluation time points during 
the study.  
 
All AEs and SAEs  whether  reported  by the participant,  discovered  during  questioning,  directly  observed, 
or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be recor ded in the participant’s 
medical record and on the appropriate study -specific case report forms.  
 
The descriptions  and grading  scales  found  in the CTEP  Active  Version  of the NCI Common  Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) will be uti lized for AE reporting. The CTEP Active 
Version of the CTCAE version 4.0 is identified and located on the CTEP website at:  
 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
All appropriate  treatment  areas  should  have  access  to a copy  of the CTEP  Active  Version  of CTCAE.  
 
All Adverse Events must be reported in routi ne study data submissions to the Overall PI on the toxicity 
case report forms.  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., reported to the IRB, FDA, etc.) 
must also be reported in routine study data submissions.

All SAEs  must  be collected  that occur  during  the screening  period.  If applicable,  SAEs  must  be collected 
that relate to any protocol -specified procedure (e.g., a follow -up skin biopsy). The sponsor -investigator 
should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods that is believed to be related to s tudy drug or 
protocol -specified procedure.  
 
The sponsor -investigator will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases (case level only) transmitted to 
BMS Global Pharmacovigilance  Frequency  of reconciliation  should  be every 
3 months and prior to the database  lock or final data summary. BMS GPV&E will email, upon request 
from  the Investigator,  the GPV&E  reconciliation  report.  Requests  for reconciliation  should  be sent to 
a The data elements  listed  on the GPV&E  reconciliation  report  will be used 
for case identification  purposes.  If the Investigator  determines  a case was not transmitted  to BMS  GPV&E, 
the case should be sent immediately to BMS.

Biopsy  confirmed  squamous  cell carcinoma  of the larynx  or hypopharynx  is a requirement  to be enrolled 
on this study.  
 
 
Tumor  biopsies  and/or  surgery  should  not generally  be performed  on Friday  afternoons,  as there  may not 
be time for  If a biopsy or surgical resection is performed  
, of the Belfer  Center  for Applied  Cancer  Science  should  be notified  ahead  of 
time to ensure that there will be adequate time for processing fresh tissue or serum samples, since these 
should not be stored over the weekend.  
 
Each  tumor  and blood  sample  obtained  will be assigned  a unique  coded  ident ifier in order  to preserve  the 
confidentiality of the participant. The coded samples will be linkable to the participant, but the key that 
links that person to the unique identifier will be stored in a database housed on a server at the DFCI. 
Access to par ticipant identity will be provided only to the principal investigator and study staff (not 
laboratory staff). There are multiple firewalls and passwords protecting the data from unwanted viewers. 
Patient privacy will be maintained by strictly curtailing ac cess to the electronic file via passwords and 
firewalls.  The coded  samples  will be cryopreserved  and stored  in secure  locked  freezers.  Once  all research 
is complete, the link between the coded samples and patient identifiers will be destroyed.  
 
If only an archival  pre-treatment  biopsy  sample  is obtained,  the formalin -fixed  paraffin -embedded  (FFPE)

11. MEASUREMENT  OF EFFECT  
 
11.1 Antitumor  Effect  – Solid  Tumors  
 
For the purposes  of this study,  participants  
 
following  initial  documentation  of objective  response.  
 
Response  and progression  will be evaluated  in this study  using  the new international  criteria  proposed  by 
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca 45:228 - 
247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the 
shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for Target Disease response.  Only those participants w ho have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re - 
evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response. These participants will have 
their response  classified  according  to the definitions  stated  below.  (Note:  Participants  who exhibit 
objective  disease  progression  prior  to the end of cycle  1 of induction  TPN  will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response . Participants who have lesions present at baseline that 
are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one 
cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non - 
target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal 
progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease  Parameters  
 
Measurable disease . Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longe st diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm by chest x -ray or ≥10 mm 
with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
39  
  
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situ ated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant  lymph  nodes.  To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  node 
must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardia l 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not 
followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all considered non -measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cy sts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic  lesions’  thought  to represent  cystic  metastases  can be considered  as measurable  lesions,  if 
they meet the defini tion of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Targ et lesions.  All measurable  lesions  up to a 
representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified  as target  lesions  and recorded  and 
measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selec ted. A sum of the diameters 
(longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  axis for nodal  lesions)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will  be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression  in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded  at baselin e. Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the presence,  absence,  or 
in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods  for Evaluation  of Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, or a 
digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to 
the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before th e beginning of the treatment.  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
40  
  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being  followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules  and palpable  lymph  nodes)  and ≥ 10 mm in diameter  as assessed  using  calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions,  documentation by color  photography,  including  a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are cl early 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung; however, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional  CT and MRI.  This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions  on CT scan based 
on the assumption  that CT thickness is 5mm or  less. If CT scans have  slice thickness gre ater than 
5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).  
 
Use of MRI  remains  a complex  issue.  MRI  has excellent  contrast,  spatial,  and temporal  resolution; 
however,  there  are many  image  acquisition  variables  involved  in MRI,  which  greatly  impact  image 
quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the tec hnical specifications of the scanning 
sequences  used should  be optimized  for the evaluation  of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse seque nce parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol  should  be followed  as closely  as possible  to prior  scans.  Body  scans  should  be performed 
with breath -hold scannin g techniques, if possible.  
 
FDG -PET.  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable  to incorporate  the use of FDG -PET scanning  to complement  CT scanning  in assessment 
of progression  (particularly  possible  'new'  disease). New  lesions  on the basis  of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
(b) No FDG -PET at baseline  and a positive  FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive  FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease  confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the  positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up 
CT scans are ne eded to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if  so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progr essing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
(c) FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. 
The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A

and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG - 
PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
PET-CT. At present, the  low dose or attenuation  correction CT portion of  a combined  PET-CT is 
not always  of optimal  diagnostic  CT quality  for use with RECIST  measurements.  However,  if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be use d for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine). The following is recommended, to assure high quality 
images are obtained.  
 
Patient preparation: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), are 
administered  to reduce  thyroidal  accumulation  of free radioiodine,  preferably  beginning  the 
day prior to injection and continuing for 3 additional days (4 days total). For infants and  
children, one drop t.i.d. is sufficient, for adolescents 2 drops t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d. 
Participants and/or parents are asked about exposure to potential interfering agents. If none is 
noted,  an indwelling  intravenous  line is established.  The dose of MIBG  is administered  by 
slow intravenous injection over 90 seconds.  
 
Images  from  the head  to the distal  lower  extremities  should  be obtained.  
 
I-123MIBG  scintigraphy  is performed  to obtain  both planar  and tomographic  images.  
 
Planar: Anterior and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower extremities 
are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours and occasionally at 48 hours following injection of 10 
mCi/1.7  square  meters  of body  surface  area (~150  μCi/kg,  maximum  10 mCi).  Anterior  views 
of the distal  lower  extremities  are adequate.  A large  field of view  dual head  gamma  camera 
with low energy collimators is preferred.  
 
SPECT: Most participants receiving I -123 MIBG also undergo SPECT at 24 hours, using a  
single  or multi -headed  camera  with a low energy  collimator.  The camera  is rotated  through 
360 degrees, 120 projections at 25 seconds per stop. Data are reconstructed usin g filtered back 
projections with a Butterworth filter and a cut off frequency of 0.2 -0.5. SPECT/CT may be 
performed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method  of measurement.  Ultrasound  examinations  cannot  be reproduced  in their entirety  for 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652

42  
  
independent review at a later data and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from  one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions  are identified  by ultrasound  in the course  of the study,  confirmation  by CT or 
MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure from CT, MRI may be used instead 
of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy,  Laparoscopy.  The utilization  of these  techniques  for objective  tumor  evaluation  is not 
advised.  However,  such techniqu es may be useful  to confirm  complete  pathological  response  when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor  markers.  Tumor  markers  alone  cannot  be used to assess  response.  
 
Cytology,  Histology.  These  techniques  can be used to differentiate  between  partial  responses  (PR) 
and complete  responses  (CR)  in rare cases  (e.g., residual  lesions  in tumor  types,  such as germ  cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandat ory to differentiate  between  response  or stable  disease  (an effusion  may be a side effect  of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
11.1.4  Response  Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR) : Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD) : At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the diameters  of target  lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is 
also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
11.1.4.2  Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR) : Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization  of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC  Protocol  #: 18-652 
Protocol  Version  Date:  January  28, 2020  
43  
  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above th e normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall di sease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a la ter time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3  Evaluation  of New  Lesions  
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning 
technique,  imaging  modality,  or findings  thought  to represent  something  other  than tumor  (for 
example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). 
However,  a lesion  identified  on a follow -up scan in an anatomical  location  that was not scanned 
at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of 
small  size etc.),  follow -up evaluation  will clarify  if it truly  represents  new disease  and if PD is 
confirmed,  progression  should  be declared  using  the date of the initial  scan on which  the lesion 
was discovered.  
 
11.1.4.4  Evaluation  of Best Overall  Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best re sponse assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred  over ‘stable  disease’  for non-target  disease  since  SD is increasingly  used as 
an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be 
measured is not advised  
 
11.1.5  Duration  of Response  
 
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started,  or death  due to any cause. 
Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation).  
 
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measu red from the time 
measurement  criteria  are first met for CR until the first date that progressive  disease  is objectively 
documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the 
last disease evaluation.  
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria  for progression  are met, taking  as reference  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Time -to-event  Endpoint  Definitions  
 
Laryngectomy -Free survival : defined  as time from  study  registration  to earlier  of surgical  removal 
of larynx  and/or  hypopharynx,  or death  due to any cause.  Participants  alive  with intact  larynx  and 
hypopharynx are censored at date of last disease evaluation.  
 
Laryngo -Esophageal  Dysfunction -Free Survival : defined  as time from  study  registration  to earlier 
of surgical removal of larynx and/or hypopharynx, non -functioning larynx and/or hypopharynx 
(inability to swallow, speak, and/or breath on own), or  death from any cause. Participants alive   
** See RECIST  1.1 manuscript  for further  details  on what  is evidence  of a new lesion.  
Note : Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.” 
Every  effort  should  be made  to document  the objective  progression  even  after discontinuation  of treatment.

with intact and functioning larynx and hypopharynx and esophagus are censored at date of last 
disease evaluation.  
 
Disease -free survival : defined as time from study registration to earlier of removal of 
larynx/hypopharynx (i.e. local/locoregional recurrenc e), distant disease recurrence, invasive 
second primary, or death due to any cause. Participants alive without one of these events are 
censored at date last know event -free. 
 
Overall  Survival : Overall  Survival  (OS)  is defined  as the time from  study  registr ation  to death  due 
to any cause, otherwise, participants are censored at date last known alive.  
 
11.1.7  Quality  of life Assessment  
 
Quality  of Life Assessment : The EORTC  QOL  Module  for Head  and Neck  Cancer  (QLQ -C30 and 
HN35, see Appendix D ) will be used to assess the effect of cancer treatment on physical, social 
and emotional well -being and function. The survey consists of 30 and 35  items, respectively.

Reports to all participating institutions for submission to their individual IRBs for action as 
required.  
 
• Mechanisms  will be in place  to ensure quality  assurance,  protocol compliance, and  adverse  event 
reporting at each site.  
 
• Except in very unusua l circumstances, each participating institution will order the study agent(s) 
directly from supplier. A participating site may order the agent(s) only after the initial IRB 
approval for the site has been forwarded to the Coordinating Center.  
 
 
13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a one arm phase  II trial. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary  efficacy  population  includes  all eligible  patients  who begin  protocol  treatment(the  evaluable 
population).  
 
 
Adverse events will be classified and graded according to the CTCAE v.4.0. and frequencies will be 
summarized among patients who begin protocol therapy.  
 
In addition  to the continuous  routine  toxicity  monitoring  by the study  team  throughout  the duration  of the 
trial, the following

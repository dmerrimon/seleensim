VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  2.0 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title of Clinical 
Trial: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Compare the Effects of VI-0521, Phentermine, and  Placebo on Ambulatory Blood 
Pressure in Overweight or Obese Subjects  
Sponsor:  VIVUS LLC (VIVUS)  
Phase of Development:  4 
Trial Rationale:  Qsymia® (known as VI-0521 in investigational studies) has been 
approved in the US since 2012 as an adjunct to a reduced -calorie diet 
and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m
2 or greater 
(obese) and 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least 
one weight-related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 d iabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), or dyslipidemia.  
Clinical data from the VI -0521 phase 2 and 3 studies indicate that 
VI-0521 is associated with a clinically meaningful decrease in blood 
pressure in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Blood pressure 
changes reached their respective peaks within 4 -8 weeks of treatment 
initiation and remained stab le for up to one year. 
A large body of evidence indicat es that blood pressure measured in an 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) setting throughout the 
day has predictive value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over and above measureme nts obtained in-clinic. Although 
blood pressure measurements obtained in- clinic have been utilized in 
clinical trials demonstrating improved blood pressure control as well as improved outcomes, ABPM can offer a broader assessment of blood pressure responses. Given that blood pressure data collected to date for VI-0521 has been obtained only at clinic visits, assessment of changes 
in ambulatory blood pressure over a 24-hr period could provide additional insight into the  potential implications of this treatme nt on 
the risk for MACE.  Such blood pressure issues are particularly relevant 
given the common association of hypertension and borderline blood pressures in overweight and obese patients as well as the improvements seen in blood pressure with weight loss. The effects of VI-0521 would be best placed in the context of comparison to placebo, 
and to phentermine, which in addition to being a component of VI -
0521, is also commonly used alone for the short- term treatment of 
obesity. 
Trial Objectives:  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of VI-0521 on 
blood pressure as measured by 24-hr ABPM, compared to both placebo 
and an active control (phentermine 30 mg). 
Trial Design:  This randomized, double-blind, placebo  and active comparator -
controlled study will be conducted at about 35 sites in the US . 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 7 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Approximately 555 subjects will be randomized, stratified by gender, 
age, and hypertensive status, to daily treatment with top -dose VI-0521 
(phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules 15 mg/92 mg), 
phentermine 30 mg , or placebo (185 subjects per group). Subjects will 
undergo a four-week titration period with dose increases until the randomized dose is reached . 
Following randomization, subjects will receive diet and exercise counseling on maintaining an appropriate healthy diet with a recommended initial caloric deficit of approximately 500 kcal per day and at least 30  minutes of regular physical activity on most days of the 
week. The  total duration of study treatment will be 8 weeks (4 weeks 
of dose titration and 4 weeks of treatment at the assigned dose) with 24-hr ABPM recording s performed at baseline/randomization and 
again at Week 8/end of study or early termination . Clinic visits will 
occur at Screening, Baseline ( 2-day outpatient visit), Week 4, and 
Week 8/end of study (2-day outpatient visit). The 24 -hr ABPM data 
will be read  and analyzed in a blinded manner by a central reader, 
using validated software. 
Study Population:  Key Inclusion Criteria (see Section 8.1 for a complete list):  
• Overweight or obese adult males and females 18 -75 years of 
age with a BMI  ≥ 27 kg/m2; 
• Medical diagnosis of at least 1 weight- related comorbidity (i.e., 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus or prediabetes, or obstructive sleep apnea).
 
Study Population:  Key exclusions include ( see Section 8.2 for a complete list):  
• Screening blood pressure of > 140/90 mmHg; 
• Type 1 diabetes; type 2 diabetes mellitus  treated with insulin, 
sulfonylureas (SFUs), GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT 
inhibitors; or not on stable diabetic medications for at least 3 months prior to  randomization;  
• Clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, or 
thyroid disease; 
• History of bipolar disorder, psychosis, greater than one lifetime 
episode of major depressive disorder, or presence or history of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation with intent to act;  
• History of glaucoma; 
• Night shift workers;  
• Obesity of known genetic or endocrine origin; recent history of weight instability, or recent participation in a formal weight loss program within 3 months prior to  screening; and  
• Smoking cessation within 3 months prior to screening.

Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 8 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Primary Endpoint 
Evaluation: The primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline to Week 
8 in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) as measured by 24- hr ABPM.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  The secondary endpoints of the study are: 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP) as measured by 24 -hr ABPM;  
• Mean change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as 
measured in clinic.  
Exploratory Endpoints:  The exploratory endpoints of the study are: 
• Mean hourly change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8; 
• Change in mean daytime and nighttime SBP as measured by 24-hr ABPM from baseline to Week  8; 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dipping” of SBP, and the percentage of subjects with a normal SBP “dipping” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dipping” pattern of SBP will be defined as a reduction of mean nighttime SBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean daytime SBP during the same 24- hr recording;  
o SBP dipping is calculated as: 100 x [(mean daytime SBP – mean nighttime SBP)/ mean daytime SBP] 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dipping” of DBP, and the percentage of subjects with a normal DBP “dipping” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dipping” pattern of DBP will be defined as a reduction of mean nighttime DBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean daytime D BP during the same 24-hr recording. 
o DBP dipping is calculated as: 100 x [(mean daytime DBP – mean nighttime DBP)/ mean daytime DBP]  
For assessment of daytime and nighttime blood pressure, “night” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure values recorded between 24:00 and 05:00 (inclusive) and “day” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood pressure values recorded between 07:30 and 21:30 (inclusive);  
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean 24- hr heart rate, mean 
daytime heart rate, mean nighttime heart rate, and mean hourly heart rate;  
• Mean percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 8.  
Safety Evaluation: Safety will be evaluated by analyses of adverse events, changes in laboratory parameters, changes in ECG, physical exam findings, vital signs, and requirement for rescue therapy for blood pressure and T2DM. 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 9 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical 
Considerations  All analyses will be performed on the intent- to-treat (ITT) population. 
For the primary endpoint, and all other endpoints evaluating continuous variables, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to evaluate between group differences in changes from baseline (top -dose VI-0521 vs. placebo, top-dose VI-0521 vs. 
phentermine 30 mg, and phentermine 30 mg vs. placebo) in mean 24-hr SBP. Factors included in the model are treatment (VI-0521, 
phentermine, and placebo), gender (male; female), age (< 50; ≥ 50 years), and hypertensive status  (no medical diagnosis of or treatment 
for hypertension; medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 0-2 antihypertensive agents; or medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents). Baseline values of the dependent variable will be adjusted in the model as a covariate. Multiple imputation method will be applied to impute missing Week 8 measurements. Adjusted means (LS Mean ± standard error) with associated two -sided 95% confidence intervals for the between-
treatment comparisons and for the changes from baseline will be reported. 
To claim success for a non -inferiority test, the upper bound of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the between -treatment group 
difference (VI-0521 minus placebo or phentermine) in mean change from baseline in 24 -hr SBP should be less than 3 mmHg. If the upper 
bound of the two- sided 95% confidence interval is less than 0 mmHg 
(i.e., p-value less than 0.05 significance level), superiority will be 
claimed. 
A hierarchical gatekeeping approach will be used to control the family-wise type 1 error o f the primary and secondary endpoints. The order of 
the hypothesis testing will be: (1) the comparison between top-dose VI-0521 and placebo for non- inferiority, (2) the comparison between 
top-dose VI-0521 and placebo for superiority, (3) the comparison between top-dose VI- 0521 and phentermine for non- inferiority, and (4) 
the comparison between top -dose VI-0521 and phentermine for 
superiority. The comparison between phentermine and placebo will be for assay sensitivity and will not be included in the hierarc hical testing 
procedure. 
If the superiority of top -dose VI- 0521 versus phentermine is achieved 
for the primary endpoint, the same testing order will be applied in the 
same manner to the secondary endpoints: change from baseline to Week 8 in mean DBP as measured by 24-hr ABPM, and then mean change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as measured in clinic, respectively. In this hierarchical testing procedure, only when testing of a given hypothesis is successful will the subsequent 
hypothesis tests will be evaluated; otherwise, the subsequent 
hypothesis tests will be considered exploratory. 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 10 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Subgroup ABPM analyses will be performed on subjects within each 
baseline stratum for hypertensive  status. All analyses will be described 
in further detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Sample Size 
Determination:  Approximately 555 subjects (185 per group) will be randomized to top-dose VI-0521, phentermine 30 mg, or placebo. Assuming a standard deviation of 10 mmHg for change in mean 24- hr SBP as 
measured by ABPM, the intended sample size of 185 subjects per treatment group will provide 80% power to detect superiority of VI-
0521 to comparator treatments (placebo or phentermine) if the 
comparator subtracted change in mean SBP has a value of less than -
3.0 mmHg, and will provide 80% power to demonstrate non- inferiority 
based on a non- inferiority margin of 3 mmHg if the comparator 
subtracted change in mean SBP is less than 0.0 mmHg. The above -
mentioned calculations were based on two -sample equal variance t -test 
at 2-sided alpha=0.05 for demonstrating superiority and at 1-sided 
alpha=0.025 for demonstrating non- inferiority. This sample size 
estimate also accounts for a 5% drop -out rate over the course of the 
study.

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  4.0 BACKGROUND  
4.1 VI-0521 
Qsymia® (known as VI-0521 in investigational studies) has been approved in the US since 2012 
as an adjunct to a reduced -calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight 
management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese) and 
27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight -related comorbidity such 
as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia. 
VI-0521 is a combination product for oral administration that contains VIVUS’ proprietary 
formulations of immediate -release phentermine hydrochloride beads and extended- release 
topiramate beads in a hard gelatin capsule. The clinical development program of VI-0521 for the treatment of obesity enrolled more than 
5,000 subjects in multiple studies, including two large pivotal studies in which over 3,500 subjects were treated for 1 year , and an extension study in which more than 600 subjects were 
treated for up to 2 years.
1 Data from these pivotal studies demonstrated  that Qsymia® produces 
significant weig ht loss averaging approximately 10% at one year in conjunction with 
improvements in obesity -related co -morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and 
dyslipidemia.2,3 
Several of the most commonly observed adverse events, notably paresthesia, dry mouth, dysgeusia, and insomnia, are well known and characterized side effects of one or the other individual components and do not represent the new onset of side effects arising from  the 
combined pharmacology of the two component drugs. There was no evidence of any new or unexpected safety issues with Qsymia
® relative to phentermine or topiramate monotherapy. 
Phentermine, as a sympathomimetic agent, has been a subject of concern for possible 
cardiovascular adverse reactions such as tachycardia or elevation of blood pressure. Although 
mechanistically, these effects could be caused by an imbalance of cardiovascular autonomic 
function due to increased sympathetic nerve tone , it is likely that the selective release of 
norepinephrine within the hypothalamus with little or no dopamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine 
activity provides a rational basis for it having minimal cardiovascular  effects at therapeutic 
doses.4 In a clinical trial evaluating multiple dose levels of phentermine, topiramate, and 
combinations of these agents, phentermine given at daily doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg for 6 months produced modest increases in heart rate compared to placebo, but no increases in systolic 
or diastolic blood pressure.
5 When phentermine was given in combination with topiramate, 
increases in heart rate were still observed  at the top dose level, but clinically  meaningful 
decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) compared to placebo were achieved.
2,3,5,6 
4.2 Cardiovascular Risk and Blood Pressure Changes  
The association between blood pressure and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) has been extensively evaluated, and it is now recognized that in adults of middle age or older, increased blood pressure is associated with an increased risk for MACE.
7,8 This association , 
along with the benefits of blood pressure-lowering agents for  reducing the risk of t hese events 
has been acknowledged in FDA guidance documents.9 Additionally, evidence indicating that 
blood pressure measur ed in an ambulatory setting throughout the day has predictive value for 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 14 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  MACE over and above spot measurements obtained in clinic has also been assembled .10 Given 
that blood pressure data collecte d to date for VI-0521 has been obtained only at clinic visits, 
typically in the morning, assessment of changes in ambulatory blood pressure over a 24-hr 
period could provide a useful insight to better understand potential implications of this treatment 
on the risk for MACE. 
5.0 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of VI -0521 on blood pressure as measured by 
24-hr ABPM, compared to both placebo and an active control (phentermine 30 mg). 6.0 TRIAL DESIGN 
This randomized, double-blind, placebo  and active comparator -controlled study will be 
conducted at about 35 sites in the US . Approximately 555 e ligible subjects will be randomly 
assigned with equal probability, to daily treatment with top -dose VI-0521 (phentermine and 
topiramate extended- release capsules 15 mg/92 mg) , phentermine 30 mg, or placebo 
(1:1:1 ratio;185 subjects per group). Stratification factors include gender (male; female), a ge 
(< 50; ≥ 50 years), and hypertensive status (no medical diagnosis of or treatment for 
hypertension; medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 0 -2 antihypertensive agents; or 
medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents).
 
Subjects will undergo a four-week titration period with weekly dose increases until the 
randomized dose is reached  (Section 9.4.1). 
Following randomization, subjects will receive diet and exercise counseling on maintaining an appropriate healthy diet with a recommended initial caloric deficit of approximately 500 kcal per day and at least 30 minutes of regular physical activity on most days of the week. The total 
duration of study treatment will be 8 weeks (4 weeks of dose titration and 4 weeks of treatment 
at the assigned dose) with 24 -hr ABPM recording s performed at baseline/randomization and 
again at Week 8/end of study or early termination . Clinic visits will occur at Screening, Baseline 
(2-day outpatient visit), Week 4, and Week 8/end of study (2-day outpatient visit). The 24 -hr 
ABPM data will be read  and analyzed in a blinded manner by a central reader, using validated 
software. 
In order to minimize the potential confounding of study results by changes in other medications, all concomitant medications, particularly those for management of blood pressure or other 
weight-related comorbidities , will be fixed in number, dose, and frequency for the duration of the 
study unless specific “rescue” criteria are met for blood pressure (≥ 160/100 mmHg, or ≤ 100/60 mmHg and symptoms of hypotension ). Any changes in concomitant medication will be fully 
documented.

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  7.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
7.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline to Week 8 in mean systolic blood 
pressure ( SBP) as measured by 24- hr ABPM . 
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints of the study are : 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean DBP as measured by 24 -hr ABPM;  
• Mean change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as measured in clinic.  
7.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
The exploratory endpoints of the study are: 
• Mean hourly changes in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8, defined as the mean change 
from baseline at each hour ; 
• Change in mean daytime and nighttime SBP as measured by 24- hr ABPM from baseline to 
Week 8; 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dipping” of SBP, and the percentage of 
subjects with a normal SBP “dipping” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dipping” pattern of SBP will be defined as a reduction of mean nighttime SBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean daytime SBP during the same 24- hr recording ; 
o SBP dipping is calculated as: 100 x [(mean daytime SBP – mean nighttime SBP)/ 
mean daytime SBP]  
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dipping” of DBP, and the percentage of 
subjects with a normal DBP “dipping” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dipping” pattern of 
DBP will be defined as a reduction of mean nighttime DBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean daytime SBP during the same 24- hr recording ; 
o DBP dipping is calculated as: 100 x [(mean daytime DBP – mean nighttime DBP)/ mean daytime DBP]  
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean 24- hr heart rate, mean daytime heart rate, mean 
nighttime heart rate, and mean hourly heart rate;  
• Mean percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 8. 
For assessment of daytime and nighttime blood pressure, “night” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood pressure values recorded between 24:00 and 05:00 (inclusive) and “day” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood pressure values recorded between 07:30 and 21:30 (inclusive).

VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 19 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Reason(s) for subject withdrawals as well as details relevant to the subject withdrawal  will be 
documented. If a subject is withdrawn from the clinical trial prior to trial completion, the subject 
will undergo all end of study procedures. 
9.0 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
9.1 Study Treatment  
Eligible subjects will receive either top-dose VI-0521 (phentermine and topiramate extended-
release capsules 15 mg/92 mg) , phentermine 30 mg capsules, or placebo capsules for daily use . 
The duration of treatment will be 8 weeks, and the total duration of participation will be a total of 
approximately 12 weeks.  
9.2 Allocation to Treatment 
Subjects will be assigned to study treatment via an electronic data capture (EDC)/ Randomization 
and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) System. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned with 
equal probability, to daily treatment with top-dose VI -0521, phentermine 30 mg, or placebo 
(1:1:1 ratio). Randomization will be stratified by gender (male; female), age (<  50; ≥ 50 years), 
and hypertensive status (no medical diagnosis of or treatment for hypertension; medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 0- 2 antihypertensive agents; or medical diagn osis of 
hypertension treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents).  For hypertensive patients who are 
being treated with fixed -dose combinations, these should be counted as 2 antihypertensive 
agents. 
Sites will be pre -stocked with study drug corresponding to each treatment group. When study 
subjects qualify for randomization, site personnel will contact the EDC/RTSM through a 
designated website and provide the requested information about the study subject. The randomization assignment will be made, and si te personnel will be instructed to dispense a 
specific titration blister card or treatment bottle  corresponding to the treatment assignment to the 
study subject. Additional study drug will be shipped to sites to replace those dispensed. 
9.3 Breaking the Blind 
Study drug must not be unblinded during the study unless it is considered necessary by the 
investigator for the management of an adverse event or other medical emergency . In the event of 
such medical emergency, the site should contact the study designated medical monitor. The 
identity of the study treatment will be obtained through the EDC/RTSM and VIVUS or designee 
will be notified of the unblinding . Any subject whose treatment assignment has been unblinded 
must be discontinued from the study. 
Investigators are also required to ensure that any potential serious adverse events (SAEs) are 
reported according to the requirements outlined in Se ction 12.4.1 and provide a written report to 
VIVUS or designee within 7 days to document the reason for unblinding. 
9.4 Drug Supply  
Clinical supplies will be manufactured for VIVUS by  in 
accordance with current Good Manufacturing  Practices. All clinical supplies will be labeled with 
information required by national regulations .

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.1 Formulation and Packaging  
Study drug will consist of #0 elongated capsules filled with beads containing phentermine and 
topiramate extended- release, phentermine, or placebo. Doses specified for each treatment group 
will be achieved by varying the amounts of phentermine beads, topiramate beads, or placebo beads added to each capsule. All study treatments will be administered as a single capsule of medication to be taken in the morning. 
Study drug will be packaged into t itration blister cards (first 4 weeks) and treatment bottles (last 
4 weeks). Each titration blister card  will contain 4 columns of 8 capsules each . Each column on 
the blister card will be labeled with the week number (1 through 4) and will contain capsules 
with the dose specified for that week of treatment, as outlined in Table  1. Each treatment bottle 
will contain 35 capsules of study drug  at the treatment dosages  (top dose VI -0521, phentermine 
30 mg, or placebo). Each blister card or bottle will be labeled with the study number, a unique kit 
number, storage instructions, and spaces for the subject number and initials. 
Subjects will undergo a four- week titration period with dose increases as described below until 
the randomized dose is reached.

9.4.2 Preparation and Dispensing  
Clinical supplies provided by the Sponsor are to be dispensed only by or under the direct 
supervision of qualified investigators to subjects meeting the criteria for study entry and in accordance with this protocol . Assignment of  study drug to study subjects will require the use of 
the EDC/RTSM. No other preparation of clinical supplies is required of the site staff. 
9.4.3 Administration  
Investigators will instruct subjects to take 1 capsule of study drug every morning with or without food. Capsules must be taken whole, and should not be broken or split apart in any manner. 
When dispensing titration blister cards, investigators should ensure that subjects understand that each blister  card contains a 4 -week supply of study drug, and that the capsules must be taken in a 
specific order (i.e., Week 1 before Week 2, and Week 3 before W eek 4). 
When dispensing study drug bottles, investigators should ensure that subjects understand that each bottle contains a 4 -week supply of study drug and that each bottle contains extra capsules 
that should only be taken for special circumstances (e.g. capsule is accidently dropped and cannot be retrieved or subject cannot return to the end of study visit within window). Study drug will not be dispensed unt il the morning of Day 2 after the ABPM device is removed following 
the baseline 24- hr recording  and data has been confirmed to be compliant. 
Subjects will be instructed to withhold dosing of study drug on study visit days until after certain 
procedures are completed . 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 21 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.4 Compliance  
Subject compliance with dosing of study drug will be assessed by counting capsules that are 
returned by subjects at each study visit. Subjects whose actual medication consumption differs from their expected capsule consumption should be queried by site personnel about reasons for not using study drug as directed, and site personnel should implement any corrective action as necessary.  Trough blood samples will also be collected at study completion, and may be used to 
identify subjects with compliance levels that are unacceptable for inclusion in per-protocol 
analyses. 
Study drug must be dispensed and administered according to the procedures described herein. In accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, only subjects who are enrolled in the study 
may receive study drug, and only authorized members of the site staff may supply or administer the study drug. 
9.4.5 Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
All unused study drug must be stored in its packaging at room temperature, 15 to 25°C (59 to 
77°F), in a dry, secure area. Access to drug storage areas should be limited to the investigator and designated staff involved with the study. All used and unused drug must be maintained at the study site and made available for audits by VIVUS perso nnel or their designee. 
It should be noted that phentermine and VI-0521 are Schedule IV controlled substances. The investigator should take all appropriate measures to control access to and dispensing of study drug. 
The investigator must maintain records d ocumenting the amount, condition and date of delivery 
of all study drug received from the sponsor. In addition, all drug dispensed to study subjects 
during the course of the study must be recorded on the appropriate accountability forms. Subjects must be instructed to return all study drug ( blister cards and the bottle, even if empty) in its 
original packaging at each study visit and sites must make an accounting of drug use by each 
subject. No study drug or packaging, used or unused, may be discarded. All packaging and used 
and unused study drug must be returned to the sponsor upon completion of the study. 
9.5 Lifestyle Counseling  Guidelines  
All randomized subjects will receive diet and exercise counseling at the baseline visit with 
support and reinforcement provided at follow -up visits. Guidelines  should include advice on 
maintaining an appropriate healthy diet with a recommended initial caloric deficit of approximately 500 kcal per day, and at least 30  minutes of regular  physical activity on most days 
of the week . On days when ABPM is attached, subjects should refrain from heavy exercise. 
9.6 Concomitant Medications  
9.6.1 Excluded Medications 
Use of any of the following medications during participation in this study is prohibited : 
• Tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, lithium, levodopa, and dopamine receptor agonists;  
• Insulin, sulfonylureas (SFUs), GLP -1 receptor agonists, SGLT inhibitors for subjects 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus ; or 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 22 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  • OTC, prescription medications, herbal agents and dietary supplements used to lose body 
weight. 
9.6.2 Management of Blood Pressure  
Concomitant medications used for management of blood pressure, must be fixed in number, 
dose, and frequency for the duration of the study unless specific “rescue” criteria are met f or 
blood pressure. 
Rescue criteria are defined as:  
• Blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mmHg, or; 
• Blood pressure ≤ 100/60 mmHg, and subjects exhibiting symptoms associated with low 
blood pressure, concomitant antihypertensive medications should be withdrawn or doses 
should be reduced. 
As this study has a short (8 -week) duration, and as the first post-randomization evaluation occurs 
after 4 weeks of treatment (half way through the study), if rescue criteria for blood pressure are met at the Week 4 visit, sites sho uld make all reasonable efforts to keep the subject on the study, 
to continue taking study drug, and to have them return within 1-2 weeks for re- evaluation of their 
blood pressure. If rescue criteria are still met at the repeat visit, then sites should complete the 
final ABPM evaluation  and end of study procedures . Once the final ABPM evaluation and end of 
study procedures have been completed, rescue therapy should be initiated, and the subject discontinued from the study. 
Adverse events that require initiation or modification of antihypertensive therapy are considered 
events of special interest and should be clearly documented and explained to enable narratives . 
9.6.3 Management of Diabetes Medication  
If subject s require addition of therapy with insulin , SFUs, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or SGLT 
inhibitors during the study, investigators should discontinue the se subjects from the study, 
making all reasonable attempts to collect ABPM and assessments that are scheduled to occur at 
study completion prior to stopping study drug and changing these concurrent therapies. 
9.6.4 Documentation of Concomitant Medication Use  
All concomitant medications, including OTC products and nutritional/herbal supplements, must 
be listed on the appropriate case report form (CRF ) at study entry . Any changes in concomitant 
medication use during the course of the study must also be noted on the appropriate CRF.  
10.0 STUDY PROCEDURES

Vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, 
temperature) will be assessed at Screening, Randomization, Week 4, and Week 8/end of study or 
early termination. Subjects should be seated comfortably for at least 10 minutes prior to 
assessing vital signs. Heart rate and respiratory rate measurements should be made by counting 
events (heartbeats or breaths) for a period of 30  seconds and multiplying these value s by 2 to 
obtain the rates per minute . A calibrated  blood pressure monitor  should be employed for blood 
pressure measurements. The same cuff should be used for the same subject across multiple visits 
when blood pressure is performed. T he same person should perform all assessments for a given 
subject. 
Clinic blood pressure for determining hypertension should be the average of three successive BP 
readings, collected at least 2 minutes apart . The mean of the three values will be recorded as the 
subject’s blood pressure. 
11.4 24-hr Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (24 -hr ABPM)  
At Baseline and at Week 8/end of study or early termination , 24-hr ABPM will be performed 
non-invasively using a  validated  oscillometric  monitor provided by a central vendor. Blood 
pressure and heart rate will be measure d every 20 minutes from  6:00 to 22:00 hours, and every 
30 minutes from  22:01 to 5:59 hours for 24 consecutive hours, while subjects continue normal 
routine activities . The monitor will be attached in the morning and removed after at least 24 
hours. Data will be uploaded to a computer at the end of the recording session  and prior to 
discharging the subject from the study visit , site staff will review the data to assure that : (1) at 
least 80% of the readings are valid, (2) there are at least 24 hours of data, and (3) there are no 
more than two consecutive hours of missing data. If any of these criteria are not satisfied, 
subjects will be asked to repeat  the assessment for an add itional 24 hours. ABPM hook up will 
be done by qualified staff. 
The accuracy of ABPM reading is highly dependent upon proper use of the equipment. Using a 
correct cuff is vital to the accuracy of monitoring data . Site staff must ensure at the Screening 
visit that the ABPM cuff size used is appropriate for the patient’s upper arm circumference, and 
the same size cuff must be used for both the screening, and end of study visits. The cuff will be 
placed on the subject’s non -dominant upper arm . Fresh batteries should be installed prior to 
hooking up the ABPM monitor. 
With reference to the ABPM operating manuals, clinical site personnel will ensure appropriate 
hook-up and safe use of the monitor by explaining the following instructions  to the subjects, 
including but not limited to:  
• The importance of proper cuff fitting and data quality; 
• Wear loose fitting clothes  on days when ABPM is performed; 
• Keep their arm steady during measurement ; 
• Keep the cuff  at heart level during measurement ; 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 27 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  • Maintain normal activities between measurements; 
• Avoid swimming, showering, or bathing during monitoring; 
• The frequency of inflation and deflation as per protocol; 
• Avoid strenuous activities,  or operating heavy equipment or power tools, as 
vibrations may functionally disrupt the monitor; 
• Keep the monitor attached at night ; and 
• Place the monitor under a pillow or on the bed at night , making sure the hose 
connecting the cuff to the monitor is not kinked. 
Diurnal and nocturnal blood pressure variation will be assessed during the study; therefore 
subjects should be reminded to go to bed and rise about the same time during the study. 
A central 24 -hr ABPM reading laboratory will perform data collection, reading, quality 
evaluation and data analyses. Software for the ABPM device  will use default settings for 
exclusion of outliers (including failed inflations) from the overall averaged statistics on the final 
ABPM report for each recording. Additionally, readings that are not acceptable will contain error codes asso ciated with failed inflations specifying what happened (i.e., too much movement, 
kinked hose, etc.). Data transfers will include all data, including data excluded from analyses for errors. Excluded data will be labeled with error codes. 
All readers will be  blinded to treatment.  Quality control w ill be monitored by the central reader. 
11.5 Laboratory Tests 
Safety laboratory tests will be performed at a licensed, certified central testing laboratory 
approved by the Sponsor. Testing will be conducted according to the schedule of study activities 
(Appendix 1 ). Clinical laboratory tests will be used to determine eligibility for study 
participation, for safety monitoring and to determine which subjects may progress to later phases 
of the study. 
Subjects should be fasting for at least 8 hours prior to obtaining blood samples for analyses. For WOCBP, a urine pregnancy test will be performed locally at in- clinic study visit per 
Appendix 1. A blood sample for trough pharmacokinetic evaluations will be collected at the end of study to  
assess treatment compliance.

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
12.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrences in subjects administe red study 
treatment, whether or not they have a causal relationship to the treatment . All observed or 
volunteered adverse events regardless of suspected causal relationship to the investigational 
product must be reported as described in the following secti ons. 
Investigators must pursue and obtain information adequate to describe adverse events, their 
severity, relationship to study treatment, and their  outcomes. For adverse events with a causal 
relationship to the investigational product, follow -up by the i nvestigator is required for up to 
28 calendar days after the last dose of study drug or until the events or their sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and VIVUS  concurs with that assessment . 
Investigators must also assess whether any adverse event s meet the criteria for classification as 
an SAE (see Section 12.1.4), which requires immediate notific ation to VIVUS  or its designated 
representative.  
12.1.1 Severity Assessment  
Investigators will assess the severity of all adverse events using the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of each adverse event. For purposes of consis tency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
• MILD: Does not interfere with the subject’s usual function; 
• MODERATE: Interferes to some extent with the subject’s usual function; or 
• SEVERE: Interferes significantly with the subject’s usual function.  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. A severe event is not necessarily a serious event . For example, a headache may be severe (interferes 
significantly with subject’s daily function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs  (see Section 12.1.4). 
12.1.2 Causality Assessment  
Investigators are required to provide an assessment of causality, for all adverse events (serious 
and non-serious) observed during this study. This assessment will provide a determination of 
whether, in the investigator’s judgment, there exists a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event. For this assessment, 
investigators must categorize the causality as either “related” or “not related.” For an adverse event to be considered “related” to the study treatment, there should be evidence that the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of study treatment, or that the event follows a known response pattern to the drug. Causality would be further confirmed by improvement in an adverse event upon stopping the study treatment, and reappearance of the event upon rechallenge. 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 30 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12.1.3 Abnormal Test Findings  
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the conditions described below, does 
not constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event. 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
adverse event are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms ; 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or 
• Test result is considered by the investigator or Sponsor to represent a clinically 
significant finding. 
12.1.4 Serious Adverse Events or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions  
As defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 312.32), an adverse event or suspected adverse d rug reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening adverse event (Note: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “life-t hreatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject in immediate risk of death . It does not include an adverse 
event or suspected adverse event that, had it occurred in more severe form, might have caused death . The determination of whether an adverse event is life-threatening can be 
based on the opinion of either the investigator or Sponsor.); 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or sub stantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition . 
For this study, blood pressure values that exceed 180 mmHg (systolic) or 110 mmHg (diastoli c) 
should be reported as serious adverse events. 
If either the Sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be 
considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 31 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12.1.5 Definition of Hospitalization  
Adverse events reported from clinical trials that result in hospitalization or prolong an existing 
hospitalization are considered serious. Any  initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healthcare facility meets this definition . 
Outpatient ambulatory surgical procedures (same -day surgeries) and routine emergency room 
treatment do not qualify as hospitalizations . Additionally, hospitalization in the absence of a 
precipitating clinical adverse event is not in itself an SAE . Examples i nclude, but are not limited 
to, the following:  
• Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the development 
of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the pre-existing condition (e.g., for work-
up of persistent pre- treatment abnormality);  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical examination); 
• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical adverse event (e.g.,  for 
elective cosmetic surgery); and  
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical proced ures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event, and the resu lting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the adverse 
event. 
12.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously reported by the study subject. In addition, study subjects should be questioned by site personnel about adverse events at each scheduled in -clinic and scheduled telephone study 
visit using a standard non- leading question, such as “Have you experienced anything new or 
different since your previous study visit? ” 
Certain adverse events require prompt and specific action by the investigator in any clinical trial. 
12.3 Reporting Period  
The reporting period for adverse events begins when the subject provides written informed consent and extends until 28 calendar days after the last dose of the investigational product is administered . All adverse events that occur during this period and are known to the investigator 
must be reported according to the requirements outlined in Section 12.4. 
12.4 Reporting Requirements  
All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page of the CRF. In addition, serious adverse events information must also be reported on a designated  section of the AE Form. For 
cases in which the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner . 
For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms. Adverse events should 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 32 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection 
of serious adverse events or suspected adverse reactions information.  
12.4.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
If an SAE occurs, VIVUS  or designee is to be notified within 1 business day of awareness of the 
event. In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to VIVUS or designee 
must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information. 
This timeframe a lso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously reported 
SAEs. 
In the event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 1 business day after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.  
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to VIVUS or designee in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by VIVUS or designee to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an expedited fashion. This information may be more detailed than that captured 
on the adverse event CRF. In general, this will include a description of the SAE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality . Information on other possible ca uses of the event, such as concomitant 
medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to VIVUS or designee. 
12.4.2 Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Non-serious adverse events meeting the reporting requirements described above ( Section 12.4) 
are to be reported on the Adverse Event CRFs, which are to be submitt ed to VIVUS  or designee. 
12.4.3 Pregnancy  
If any study subject becomes or is found to be pregnant while receiving the investigational 
product, the investigator must immediately discontinue study treatment and report the pregnancy to VIVUS or designee within 1 business day of learning of the pregnancy. 
The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination 
(i.e., elective pregnancy termination) and then notify VIVUS or designee of the outcome. The investigator will provide this information as a follow- up to the initial pregnancy report.  
For reported pregnancies that result in a live birth, the status of the newborn should be assessed at the time of birth . The status of an aborted fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection , 
unless pre-abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
If pregnancy outcomes meet the criteria for classification as SAEs (i.e.,  stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs . 
Similarly, any pregnancy outcomes that are considered to be adverse events should be reported 
as such on the appropriate CRF. However, pregnancy in itself need not be reported as an adverse event if there is no associated adverse outcome.  
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 33 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  For reporting purposes, ectopic pregnancies should be reported as SAEs, but because the fetus is 
not potentially viable, they need not be reported as a pregnancy. 
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Statistical Analysis and Methods  
All analyses will be performed on  the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized subjects 
who received at least one dose of study drug). Analyses of a per-protocol population may also be 
utilized to confirm the presence or absence of a pressor signal.  Subject demographic data and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects enrolled in the study.  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this clinical 
trial will be documented in a prospectively developed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). This 
document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or i ts analysis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment. Additional statistical analyses other than those described in this section may be performed if deemed appropriate and included in the plan. 
13.1.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the study is change from baseline to Week 8 (or imputed Week 8 values 
for early termination subjects) in mean SBP obtained from 24 -hr ABPM . The primary hypothesis 
is that VI-0521 does not have deleterious effects on SBP as measured by mean 24- hr ABPM in 
overweight or obese subjects. A deleterious effect of study treatment may be ruled out if the 
upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the between- treatment comparison 
with placebo is less than 3 mmHg . This study will also attempt to demonstrate  differences 
between the top- dose of VI -0521 and phentermine 30 mg with respect to changes from baseline 
to Week 8 in mean 24-hr SBP. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the intent- to-treat (ITT) population. An 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to evaluate between -group differences in 
changes from baseline (top -dose VI-0521 vs. placebo, top- dose VI-0521 vs. phentermine, and 
phentermine vs. placebo) in mean 24-hr SBP. Factors included in the model are treatment (VI 
0521, phentermine , and placebo ), gender (male and female), age (< 50; ≥ 50 years), and 
hypertensive status ( no medical diagnosis of or treatment for hypertension; medical diagnosis of 
hypertension treated with 0-2 antihypertensive agents; or medical diagnosis of hypertension 
treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents ). Baseline values of the dependent variable will 
be adjusted in the model as a covariate. Multiple imputation method will be applied to impute missing Week 8 measurements . Adjusted means (LS Mean ± standard error) with associated 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the between -treatment comparisons and for the changes 
from baseline will be reported.  
To claim success for a non -inferiority test, the upper bound of the two -sided 95% confidence 
interval for the between -treatment group difference (VI-0521 minus placebo or phentermine) in 
mean change from baseline in 24 -hr SBP should be less than 3 mmHg. If the upper bound of the 
two-sided 95% confidence interval is less th an 0 mmHg (i.e., p- value less than 0.05 significance 
level), superiority will be claimed.  
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 34 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Subgroup ABPM analyses will be performed on subjects within each baseline stratum for 
hypertensive status. Details will be described in the SAP.  
13.1.2 Method for Prevention and Treatment of Missing Values  
For subjects who discontinue treatment prior to study completion, every attempt will be made to 
obtain end of study ABPM assessments prior to their discontinuation of treatment or initiation of changes to concomitant antihypertensive medications.  
Several sensitivity analyses will be considered to explore any deviations from statistical 
assumptions and the impact of missing data on the conclusion of the primary analysis. The details of the sensitivity analyses will be included in the SAP . 
13.1.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same methods as described above for the primary endpoints. 
The secondary endpoints will be: 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean DBP as measured by 24 -hr ABPM;  
• Mean change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as measured in clinic. 
13.1.4 Multiplicity Adjustment to Control Family -wise Type 1 Error Rate  
A hierarchical gatekeeping approach will be used to control the family- wise type 1 error of the 
primary and secondary endpoints. The order of the hypothesis testing will be: (1) the comparison 
between top-dose VI-0521 and placebo for non- inferiority, (2) the comparison between top-dose 
VI-0521 and placebo for superiority, ( 3) the comparison between top- dose VI-0521 and 
phentermine for non-inferiority, and (4) the comparison between top- dose VI-0521 and 
phentermine for superiority. The comparison between phentermine and placebo will be for assay sensitivity and will not be included in the hier archical testing procedure . 
If the superiority of top-dose VI-0521 versus phentermine is achieved for the primary endpoint, the same testing order will be applied in the same manner to the secondary endpoints: change from baseline to Week 8 in mean DBP as measured by 24-hr ABPM, and then mean change in 
SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as measured in clinic, respectively . 
In this hierarchical testing procedure, only when testing of a given hypothesis is successful will  
the subsequent hypothesis tests will be evaluated; otherwise, the subsequent hypothesis tests will be considered exploratory. 
13.1.5 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
Exploratory endpoints that are continuous measurements will be analyzed using the same 
methods as described above for the primary en dpoint. For categorical outcomes, differences 
between treatments will be evaluated using a non -parametric method. Details will be provided in 
the SAP. 
The exploratory endpoints will be the difference between treatment groups (top-dose VI-0521 vs. placebo, top-dose VI-0521 vs. phentermine, and phentermine vs. placebo ) in the change from 
baseline in:  
VI-0521   15 October 2021

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  • Mean hourly changes in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8, defined as the mean change 
from baseline at each hour.  
• Change in mean daytime and nighttime SBP as measured by 24- hr ABPM from baseline to 
Week 8; 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dipping” of SBP, and the percentage of subjects with a normal SBP “dipping” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dipping” pattern of SBP will be defined as a nighttime reduc tion of mean nighttime SBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean 
daytime SBP during the same 24- hr recording.  
o SBP dipping is calculated as: 100 x [(mean daytime SBP – mean nighttime SBP)/ mean daytime SBP].  
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dipping” of DBP, and the percentage of subjects with a normal DBP “dipping” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dipping” pattern of DBP will be defined as a nighttime reduction of mean nighttime DBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean daytime SBP during the same 24-hr recording. 
o DBP dipping is calculated as: 100 x [(mean daytime DBP – mean nighttime DBP)/ 
mean daytime DBP].  
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean 24- hr heart rate, mean daytime heart rate, mean 
nighttime  heart rate , and mean hourly heart rate ; 
• Mean percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 8. 
For assessment of daytime and nighttime blood pressure, “night” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood pressure values recorded between 24:00 and 05:00 (inclusive) and “day” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood pressure values recorded 
between 07:30 and 21:30 (inclusive). 
13.1.6 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be performed on the ITT population (all randomized subjects who received 
at least one dose of study drug). 
The incidence of adverse events will be summarized . The summary will be repeated for events 
considered related to study drug and for any serious adverse events. Laboratory results and vital 
signs will be summarized by timepoint and change from baseline. Changes to physical exam and ECG and requirement for rescue therapy for blood pressure and T2DM will be compared across 
treatment groups. The number of subjects taking concomitant medications will be summarized by medication. The primary reason for any early discontinuation will be summarized . The results 
of laboratory tests will be included in the safety analysis.  
Adverse events will be coded according to MedDRA and summarized for each treatment group . 
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing advers e events in each treatment group will 
be tabulated by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term . 
13.2 Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 555 subjects (185 per group) will be randomized to top- dose VI-0521, 
phentermine 30 mg, or placebo. Assuming a standard deviation of 10 mmHg for change in mean 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 36 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  24-hr SBP as measured by ABPM, the intended sample size of 185 subjects per treatm ent group 
will provide 80% power to detect superiority of VI-0521 to comparator treatments (placebo or 
phentermine) if the comparator subtracted change in mean SBP has a value of less than -3.0 
mmHg, and will provide 80% power to demonstrate non- inferiority based on a non- inferiority 
margin of 3 mmHg if the comparator subtracted change in mean SBP is less than 0.0 mmHg. The 
above-mentioned calculations were based on two -sample equal variance t -test at 2-sided 
alpha=0.05 for demonstrating superiority and at 1-sided alpha=0.025 for demonstrating non-inferiority. This sample size estimate also accounts for a 5% drop -out rate over the course of the 
study. 
14.0 TRIAL TERMINATION CRITERIA  
Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory au thority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, or drug safety problems. In addition, VIVUS retains the right 
to discontinue this trial at any time.  
If a clinical trial is prematurely terminated or discontinued, VIVUS  will promptly notify the 
investigators . After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects within 
2 - 3 days. As directed by VIVUS  or designee, all study materials must be collecte d and all CRFs 
completed to the greatest extent possible.  
15.0 DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTATION  
Data generated by this clinical trial must be available for inspection by the FDA, by the Sponsor or a designate acting on behalf of the Sponsor, by applicable foreign health authorities, and by the IRB or IEC as appropriate . At a subject’s request, medical information may be given to their 
personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for their welfare. 
Subject medical information ob tained during the course of this study is confidential and 
disclosure to third parties other than those noted above is prohibited. 
16.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
During trial conduct , VIVUS or its designee will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines are being followed . The monitors 
may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The 
investigator and institution will allow VIVUS  monitors or its agen ts and appropriate regulatory 
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  
The study site and trial-related documents may be subject to review by the IRB/IEC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by VIVUS  or its agent s, and/or to inspection by appropriate 
regulatory authorities.  
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  17.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
17.1 Institutional Review Board /Independent Ethics Committee  
Regulations require that an IRB/IEC oversee all investigational drug clinical trials . This board or 
committee, the makeup of which must conform to local and regional regulations, will approve all 
aspects of the trial, including the protocol, advertising and written informed consent form to be used prior to initiation of the trial. It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the clinical t rial protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other 
relevant documents, e.g., advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the investigator f ile. Copies of IRB/IEC approvals sh ould 
be forwarded to VIVUS or its designee.  
Amendments to the protocol must be reviewed and approved by VIVUS and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation . The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to 
IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and VIVUS or designee in writing within 5 working days after the implementation.  
The investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/IEC advised of the progress of the study and of any changes made to the protocol as deemed appropriate. 
17.2 Ethical Conduct of the Clinical Trial 
The clinical trial will be performed in accordance with the protocol, Inte rnational Conference on 
Harmoniz ation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP ) guidelines, and applicable local regulatory 
requirements and laws.  
17.3 Subject Information and Consent  
The informed consent form and any changes to the informed consent form during the course of 
the trial must be agreed t o by VIVUS  or designee, and the IRB/IEC and must be in compliance 
with ICH, GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
The investigator or designee(s) must ensure that each clinical trial subject is fully informed about the nature and obje ctives of the clinical trial and possible risks associated with participation . The 
investigator or designee(s) will obtain written informed consent from each subject before any trial-specific activity is performed . The informed consent form used in this clinical trial, and any 
changes made during the course of the trial, must be prospectively approved by both the IRB/IEC and VIVUS  or designee before use. The original signed copy of the informed consent 
form must be maintained by the investigator and is subject to inspection by a representative of VIVUS, their representatives, auditors, the IRB/IEC and/or regulatory agencies . A copy of the 
signed informed consent form will be given to the subject.  
18.0 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
18.1 Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this clinical trial. 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 38 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  A CRF is required and should be completed for each subject . The completed original CRFs are 
the sole property of VIVUS and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except 
for authorized representatives of VIVUS or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from VIVUS.  
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRFs. 
CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member. These signatures serve to attest that the information containe d on the CRFs is true. At all times, the investigator 
has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs. Subject source documents are the physician ’s subject records 
maintained at the study site . In most cases, the source documents will be the hospital ’s or the 
physician’ s chart. In cases where the source documents are the hospital or the physician ’s chart, 
the information collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document . In these cases, VIVUS  and the 
investigator must prospectively document which items will be recorded in the source documents 
and for which items the CRF will stand as the source document.  
18.2 Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or VIVUS, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), al l original signed informed consent forms, 
copies of all CRFs, SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition . 
The records should be retained by the investigator according to ICH, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinica l Trial Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, VIVUS should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigato r, another institution, or to VIVUS . The investigator must obtain written 
VIVUS’ written permission before disposing of any records prior to completion of the 
required/stipulated  retention period. 
19.0 PUBLICATION PLAN 
Publication of study results is addressed in the Clinical Trial Agreement with each site . 
All information and data, including the terms of this protocol, and all data, clinical results, and research conducted hereunder concerning VIVUS’s products and operations including VIVUS patent applications, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, and formulation 
information that has been supplied by VIVUS and not previously published are considered confidential by VIVUS and will remain the sole property of VIVUS. The investigator understands and agrees that said proprietary and/or confidential information disclosed to or produced by him/her there under is highly valuable to VIVUS and will be used exclusively by the Investigator in accomplishing this clinical trial and will not b e used for any other purposes.

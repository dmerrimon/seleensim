 Protocol synopsis  
Title of study : A prospective, randomized, single center pilot study comparing patient and graft 
survival, adverse events and tolerability of Zortress® (everolimus) versus Rapamune® (sirolimus) in 
combination with low dose Neoral® (cyclosporine) dosed by C2 monitoring, in deceased and living 
donor renal transplant recipients under a Thymoglobulin® (antithymocyte globulin) and rapid steroid 
induction protoco l. 
Purpose  and rationale : Our center’s renal transplant immunosuppression protocol has consisted of 
Thymoglobulin and steroid induction for 5 doses only, with early initiation of Rapamune® (sirolimus) 
and then Neoral for nearly a decade now.  We do observe  a significant amount of adverse events in 
our patient population, with many of these potentially related to the sirolimus.  The combination of 
“half-dose” cyclosporine (early C2 levels around 800 to 1000 ng/ml) allows us to minimize calcineurin 
inhibitor toxicity and its combination with the mTOR drug sirolimus provides excellent protection 
against acute rejection in our renal transplant recipients.  Our earlier experience with everolimus and 
the recent publications describing renal recipients’ outcomes wi th this drug, suggest to us that our 
patients may do better on everolimus than sirolimus.  For our center, this pilot study would be very 
straightforward as the only difference in medication from our current well established protocol would be 
the randomiza tion to either Rapamune®, our current standard of care, or Zortress®, the study drug.  
Objectives : The primary objective of this pilot study will be to determine equivalency of Zortress® as 
compared to Rapamune® when used in our de novo immunosuppression re gimen following renal 
transplantation. The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint  of graft survival (non -death 
censored) and biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year. The primary outcome of immunosuppressive 
protection would be studied in our Thymogl obulin and rapid steroid discontinuation protocol, with “half -
dose” Neoral as described above.  
Secondary outcomes would include factors involved with adverse events and tolerability and would 
include: renal graft survival (non -death censored) and biopsy pr oven acute rejection at 6 months, 2 
and 3 years, as well as the number and grade of acute rejection episodes and responsiveness to 
treatment, serum creatinine and estimated GFR, results of renal biopsies at 12 months post -transplant 
to look for histologica l evidence of graft injury, early and late wound complications, infections including 
CMV, EBV and BK infections as monitored by serum PCR testing, lipid panel testing, particularly 
triglycerides, cardiac events such as acute myocardial infarctions or Conge stive Heart Failure 
episodes, and tolerability of the Neoral and mTOR combination as determined by the patients who 
required conversion off of the intended randomized drug combination, with attempt to document why 
the patient did not tolerate the drug comb ination.   
Exploratory objectives would include molecular markers indicative of kidney and vascular endothelial 
function.  
Population : The patient population will be all adults (18 -75 years of age ) who receive a living donor or 
deceased donor renal transpl ant as a first or subsequent renal transplant procedure only (no extra -
renal organ transplant recipients).  We will invite any patient who would normally be considered for our 
current Sirolimus®/ Neoral® protocol with Thymoglobulin® and steroid induction t o consent for this pilot 
study and then undergo randomization post -operatively if the transplant surgeon anticipates normal 
early graft function.  We would propose to enroll a total of 60 patients.  
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria :  
 Inclusion Criteria  
 Primary renal transplant recipients between ages 18 and 75 years of age.  
 Females capable of becoming pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test prior to 
transplantation and practice an effective form of birth control for the duration of the study.  
 
7 
  Exclusion Cr iteria  
 Total cholesterol > 300 mg/dl or triglycerides > 400 mg/dl despite lipid lowering therapy  
 Pre-existing bone marrow suppression (WBC < 3000, platelets < 100,000)  
 Positive crossmatch or ABO incompatible  
 Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pr egnancy is defined as the state of a female 
after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive serum human 
chorionic gonadotrophin laboratory test (>5 mIU/mL)  
 Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologica lly capable of becoming 
pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse 
with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other 
means, UNLESS they are using two birth control me thods. The two methods can be a double 
barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method.  
 Adequate barrier methods of contraception include: diaphragm, condom (by the 
partner), intrauterine device (copper or hormonal), sponge or spermicide. Hormona l 
contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive agent that includes an estrogen 
and/or a progestational agent.  
 Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the study and for 12 weeks  
after study drug discontinuation.  
 Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they 
have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical 
profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol 
< 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when 
the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow u p hormone level 
assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.  
 Active infection (HBV, HIV)  
 Malignancy (except for adequately treated squamous or basal cell skin carcinoma) unless 
patient has written clearance from an Oncologist or if patient has had no malignancy for at 
least 2 years prior to the transplant  
 Allergy or intolerance to sirolimus, everolimus, cyclosporine, or ATG  
Investigational and reference therapy : Zortress® bid for goal levels of 3 to 8 ng/ml by approved 
testing methods;  Rapa mune® goal levels of 10 to 18 ng/ml by Architect assay, or 8 to 12 by LC -MS 
methodology;  Neoral® goal levels of 800 to 1000 ng/ml by immunoassay until 3 months Post -
transplant, 600 -800 ng/ml 3 -6 months post -transplant, 400 -600 ng/ml 6 -12 months post -trans plant, and 
400 ng/ml > 12 months post -transplant.  Induction agents: Thymoglobulin 1.25 mg/kg for 4 to 5 doses 
adjusted for white blood count and platelet count, as well as appropriate levels of the two maintenance 
immunosuppressive agents, and steroids gi ven as methylprednisone IV for two doses, then oral 
prednisone at: 500 mg, 200 mg, 125 mg, 50 mg, and 25 mg.   
Study design : Randomized, single center parallel -group, open -label study . 
Pilot study with exploratory objectives.  
Eligibility:  All primary or r etransplant recipients of deceased donor or living donor grafts with negative 
crossmatch who are felt to have good expectations for renal function recovery after surgery will be 
offered entry into the  study . 
Treatment scheme is as described above, with Sol umedrol 500 mg IV in OR as induction, then 5 
doses of Thymoglobulin starting morning of POD 1 at 1.25 mg/dose (rounded to nearest 25 mg) with 
8 
 rapid steroid taper over five doses.  The mTOR inhibitor drug will be started on POD 0 and Neoral 
introduced as re nal function recovers, usually starting on POD 2.  
Measurement/Assessments: as described above, graft and patient survival per standard definitions, 
clinically indicated biopsies for determination of acute cellular or antibody mediated rejection, renal 
function as estimated from serum Cr based on MDRD, clinic visits for wound assessment, standard of 
care labs for renal function, bone marrow function (WBC and platelet count), liver function, lipid panel, 
donor specific antibody determination during any signif icant increase in serum Cr, drug levels routinely 
monitored for need of number of dose adjustments and compliance, Emergency Room and 
hospitalizations, as well as unscheduled clinic and other physician visits.  For the pilot study, we would 
perform schedul ed CMV, EBV and serum BK PCRs monthly for the first year, then quarterly or with 
any viral symptoms.  
Potential study participants will be approached for consent immediately prior to transplantation by the 
transplant surgeon or appointed representative  if they meet the inclusion criteria above and do not fit 
the exclusion criteria above . If the transplant candidate agrees to participate he/she will be categorized 
as a living or deceased donor kidney recipient category and as primary or subsequent kidney 
transplant recipient. The candidate will then be randomized, in a 2:1 fashion, to either the Zortress or 
Rapamune study arm. Following transplantation all recipients will receive daily Thymoglobulin doses of 
1.25 mg/kg starting on POD #1 for 4 to 5 doses adjus ted for white  blood count and platelet count.  All 
recipients will be administered steroids as methylprednisone IV for two doses, then oral prednisone at: 
500 mg, 200 mg, 125 mg, 50 mg, and 25 mg  and will receive delayed  Neoral® on POD #2 -3 dosed to 
achieve  serum  levels of 800 to 1000 ng/ml  by immunoassay until 3 months p ost-transplant, 600 -800 
ng/ml 3 -6 months post -transplant, 400 -600 ng/ml 6 -12 months post -transplant, and 400 ng/ml > 12 
months post -transplant. Zortress® will be started on POD #0 for Zortre ss study arm recipients, 
administered bid and dosed to achieve target  levels of 3 to 8 ng/ml by approved testing methods;  
Rapamune® study arm recipients will receive Rapamune once daily, dosed to achieve target  levels of 
10 to 18 ng/ml by Architect assay,  or 8 to 12 by LC -MS methodology.  Neoral and Rapamune/Zortress 
levels will be monitored twice weekly for the first 3 months, once weekly for months 3 -6, every other 
week months 6 -12, and monthly thereafter. This pilot study is estimated to take one year fo r enrollment 
and three years from the date of last patient enrollment for completion of last patient visit, then several 
months for completion of paper work.  This will be about 4.5 to 5 years.  
Efficacy assessments :  
 Incidence of graft loss in the first po st-transplant year  
 Incidence of patient death in the first post -transplant year  
 Incidence of acute rejection at 1 year post -transplant  
 
Other assessments :  
 Incidence of non -death censored graft loss at 6 months, 2 and 3 years after transplantation  
 Number a nd grade of acute rejection episodes at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after 
transplantation  
 Tolerability of Zortress at 1 year post -transplant  
 Estimated GFR at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after transplantation  
 Incidence of CMV, EBV and BK infections  1 year a fter transplantation  
 Results of 12 month surveillance biopsies  
 Lipid panels and use of lipid lowering medications at 1 year after transplant  
 Incidence of MI and CHF at 1 and 3 years after transplant  
9 
  Incidence of wound infection at 1 year after transplanta tion 
 Incidence of lymphocele at 1 year after transplantation  
 Plasma concentrations of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and S -adenosyl methionine 
(SAM) Plasma concentrations of endothelial dysfunction markers (symmetric and asymmetric 
dimethyl arginine (SDMA, A DMA), L -arginine, L -citrulline, L -ornithine cysteine, and 
homocysteine over the observation period  
 Plasma concentrations of bioactive lipids (HODEs, HEPEs, HETEs, and prostaglandins) over the 
observation period  
 Plasma protein patterns  
Data analysis : The in cidence of graft loss, patient death, and acute rejection will be compared by chi 
squared analyses. Patient and graft Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be compared by log rank test.  
We hypothesize there will be no statistically significant difference betwe en the treatment arms. As this 
is a pilot study, it was not statistically powered to detect subtle differences in outcome. All continuous 
variables such as serum creatinine, cGFR, serum lipids, WBC, platelets, etcetera will be compared by 
student’s t test.  Any other dichotomous variables will be compared by chi squared analysis.

 1 Background  
Two prospective randomized trials (A2306 and A2307) have demonstrated that everolimus 
combined with steroids and low dose Neoral with (A2307) or without (A2306) basilixim ab 
induction result in  excellent 1 year outcomes (1). In 2002 we adopted an immunosuppressive 
regimen using Rapamune and reduced dose Neoral without steroids using induction therapy 
with Thymoglobulin . Since employing this regimen our acute rejection rate within the first 
year post -transplant has been between 7% and  10% for any given calendar year. However, 
many patients need to have their Rapamune discontinued due to drug related side effects or 
compliance difficulties related to the noon dosing (when most  other medications are taken at 8 
am and 4 pm). We feel strongly that use of an alternative drug to Rapamune in such cases is 
necessary . Use of Zortress in this setting would be ideal, however, no data currently exists 
concerning the use of Zortress with N eoral in a steroid free maintenance immunosuppression 
regimen following Thymoglobulin  induction. Thus we propose this pilot study primarily to 
verify Zortress efficacy using our established immunosuppressive protocol. Secondarily we 
are interested in chara cterizing the Zortress drug related side effect profile to enable us in the 
future to exploit any favorable differences between Zortress and Rapamune.  
2 Purpose and rationale  
Our center’s renal transplant immunosuppression protocol has consisted of Thymoglob ulin 
and steroid induction for 5 doses only, with early initiation of Rapamune® (Sirolimus) and 
then Neoral for nearly a decade now.  We do observe a significant amount of adverse events 
in our patient population, with many of th ese potentially related to the S irolimus.  The 
combination of “half -dose” cyclosporine (early C2 levels around 800 to 1000 ng/ml) allows us 
to minimize calcineurin inhibitor toxicity and its combination with the mTOR drug Sirolimus 
provides excellent protection against acute rejecti on in our renal transplant recipients .  Our 
earlier experience with E verolimus and the recent publications describing renal recipients’ 
outcomes with this drug, suggest to us that  our patients may do better on Everolimus than 
Sirolimus  (1,2) .  For our cent er, this pilot study would be very straightforward as the only 
difference in medication from our current well established protocol would be the 
randomization to either Rapamune®, our current standard of care, or Zortress®, the study drug.  
3 Objectives  
3.1 Primar y objectives  
The primary objective of this pilot study will be to determine equivalency of Zortress® as 
compared to Rapamune® when used in our de novo immunosuppression regimen following 
renal transplantation. The primary endpoint will be a composite endpo int of graft survival 
(non-death censored) and biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year. The primary outcome of 
immunosuppressive protection would be studied in our Thymoglobulin and rapid steroid 
discontinuation protocol, with “half -dose” Neoral as describ ed above.  
11 
 3.2 Secondary objectives  
Secondary outcomes would include factors involved with adverse events and tolerability and 
would include: renal graft survival (non -death censored) and biopsy proven acute rejection at 
6 months, 2 and 3 years, as well as the number and grade of acute rejection episodes and 
responsiveness to treatment, serum creatinine and estimated GFR, results of renal biopsies at 
12 months post -transplant to look for histological evidence of graft injury, early and late 
wound complications, infections including CMV, EBV and BK infections as monitored by 
serum PCR testing, lipid panel testing, particularly triglycerides, cardiac events such as acute 
myocardial infarctions or Congestive Heart Failure episodes, and tolerability of the Neoral 
and mTOR combination as determined by the patients who required conversion off of the 
intended randomized drug combination, with attempt to document why the patient did not 
tolerate the drug combination.  All objectives are exploratory in nature as this is a pilot study.  
3.3 Exploratory objectives  
4  To explore the kidney and vascular endothelial function 
assessed by a panel of molecular markers over the 
observation period. Study design  
Randomized, single center parallel -group, open -label study.  
Pilot study with exp loratory objectives.  
Eligibility:  All primary or retransplant recipients of deceased donor or living donor grafts 
with negative crossmatch who are felt to have good expectations for renal function recovery 
after surgery will be offered entry into the study. 
Treatment scheme is as described above, with Solumedrol 500 mg IV in OR as induction, then 
5 doses of Thymoglobulin starting morning of POD 1 at 1.25 mg/dose (rounded to nearest 25 
mg) with rapid steroid taper over five doses.  The mTOR inhibitor drug w ill be started on 
POD 0 and Neoral introduced as renal function recovers, usually starting on POD 2.  
Measurement/Assessments: as described above, graft and patient survival per standard 
definitions, clinically indicated biopsies for determination of acute cellular or antibody 
mediated rejection, renal function as estimated from serum Cr based on MDRD, clinic visits 
for wound assessment, standard of care labs for renal function, bone marrow function (WBC 
and platelet count), liver function, lipid panel, dono r specific antibody determination during 
any significant increase in serum Cr, drug levels routinely monitored for need of number of 
dose adjustments and compliance, Emergency Room and hospitalizations, as well as 
unscheduled clinic and other physician vis its.  For the pilot study, we would perform 
scheduled CMV, EBV and serum BK PCRs monthly for the first year, then quarterly or with 
any viral symptoms.  
A subset of patients will have coded plasma samples sent to clinical research and development 
at the Uni versity of Colorado. These biomarker samples will be used to assess vascular 
endothelial dysfunction and inflammation markers as well as kidney dysfunction markers.  
12 
 Plasma samples are collected and stored at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center 
tissue typing lab per standard of care.   
5 Population  
The patient population will be all adults (18 -75 years of age ) who receive a living donor or 
deceased donor renal transplant as a first or subsequent renal transplant procedure only (no 
extra -renal organ  transplant recipients).  We will invite any patient who would normally be 
considered for our current Sirolimus®/ Neoral® protocol with Thymoglobulin® and steroid 
induction to consent for this pilot study and then undergo randomization post -operatively if 
the transplant surgeon anticipates normal early graft function.  If there were significant 
concerns for prolonged graft dysfunction, then the patients will not be invited into the pilot 
study.  Invited patients would include anyone currently not on steroid s prior to transplantation, 
and those with no known intolerance to any of the drugs mentioned.  Patients must also be 
willing to perform the expectations of the study protocol reliably.  
This will be a single center pilot study performed at The Ohio State U niversity 
Comprehensive Transplant Center.  Our center performs approximately 100 to 110  living 
donor and 90 to 100 deceased donor renal transplants per year.  If we assume that at least 150 
patients per year qualify for the study, then a conservative esti mate of 75 enrolled patients a 
year is possible.  We would propose to enroll a total of 60 patients over 12 months, and then 
follow these patients for a complete 3 years.  We will randomize 2:1 Zortress to S irolimus  
using a random number generator . 
5.1 Inclusi on criteria

 Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if 
they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an 
appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor 
symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels > 
40 mIU/mL and estradiol <  20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral 
oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the 
case of oophorectomy alone, on ly when the reproductive status of the woman 
has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered 
not of child bearing potential.  
 Active infection (HBV, HIV)  
 Malignancy (except for adequately treated squamous or basal cell skin carcin oma) 
unless patient has written clearance from an Oncologist or if patient has had no 
malignancy for at least 2 years prior to the transplant  
 Allergy or intolerance to sirolimus, everolimus, cyclosporine, or ATG  
6 Treatment  
6.1 Investigational and control drugs  
Zortress will be started on P OD #0 and initially dosed at 0.75  mg BID (12 hours apart) dosed 
simultaneously with Neoral and the dose adjusted thereafter to achieve a target trough serum 
level between 3 ng/ml and 8 ng/ml. Sirolimus will be dosed per our sta ndard approach, 
specifically started on POD #0 at 5  mg/d , decreasing to 3 mg/d on POD #2,  and adjusted 
thereafter at achieve a target trough serum level of 10 to 18 ng/ml by Architect assay, or  8 to 12 by 
LC-MS methodology.  
14 
 6.2 Treatment arms  
Patients will be assigned to one of the following “n” treatment arms in a ratio of 2:1; Zortress 
or Sirolimus  started on POD 0 , with Solumedrol 500 mg IV in OR as induction, then 5 doses 
of Thymoglobulin starting morning of POD 1 at 1.25 mg/dose (rounded to nearest 25 mg) 
with rapid steroid taper over five doses.  Neoral  will be introduced as renal function recovers, 
usually starting on POD 2.  We will enroll a total of 60 patients.  
 Zortress and Neoral, with Thymoglobulin induction and perioperative steroids  
 Rapamycin and Ne oral, with Thymoglobulin induction and perioperative steroids  
6.3 Treatment assignment  
Randomization will be stratified by  type of donor kidney received (living or deceased donor 
kidney) and primary versus retransplant recipient.  Randomization will be performe d using a 
random number generator.  
6.4 Treatment blinding  
This is an open -label study and thus there will be no blinding.  
6.5 Treating the patient   
Patients enrolled in this study will receive our normal standard of post -transplant follow up 
care.  
6.5.1  Patient numberin g 
As this is an open -label study there will be no blinding and thus no need for patient 
identifying numbers as part of a blinding strategy.  
6.5.2  Dispensing the study drug  
As this is an open -label study utilizing currently commercially available drugs, the drugs  
under study will be dispensed utilizing standard operating procedures.  
6.5.3  Study drug supply, storage and tracking  
As this is an open -label study utilizing currently commercially available drugs, special 
arrangements for study drug supply, storage and tracki ng will not be necessary.  
6.5.4  Permitted study drug dose adjustments and interruptions  
Zortress and Sirolimus dose adjustments and interruptions will be allowed and will be made at 
the discretion of the treating physician. All drug adjustments and interruptions  will be 
recorded and monitored for this study, which requires little additional effort as this is already 
our current practice.  
15 
 6.5.5  Study drug discontinuation and premature patient withdrawal  
As we currently do for Sirolimus, Zortress dosing will be decreased  or discontinued  when the 
transplant physician deems appropriate due to deleterious side effects or the presence of 
infection or malignancy where a reduction in overall immunosuppression in desirable.  
 
6.5.6  Early study termination   
Early study termination will be considered if there is a statistically significant difference in 
primary outcome between the 2 study arms and it is the opinion of the treating physicians that 
this is likely due to differences in efficacy

Legend : 
1: If still inpatient  
2: Females capable of childbearing  
3: Cyclosporine and Zortress  levels are monitored twice weekly for 0 -3 months post -transplant, every 
two weeks for 3 -12 months post -transplant, and monthly greater than 1 year post -transplant.  
4: Plasma for biomarkers will be  assessed at the University of Colorado in a subset of patients using 
existing plasma samples.  
 
Patients will be followed as per the standard of care at this transplant center (The Ohio State 
University Medical Center, Division of Transplantation).  Addit ional study procedures include a protocol 
biopsy at month 12 and some additional laboratory work at screening/baseline and at months 6, 12, 
24, and 36.  
7.2 Information to be collected on screening failures  
No information will be collected on patients failing t he screening process.  
 
7.3 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics  
Patient demographics are routinely captured within our transplant database and as such will be 
available for anal ysis. Demographic data collection   includes, but is not limited to, name, age, 
gender, race, cause of renal failure, years on dialysis, sensitization status (PRA),  
7.4 Treatment exposure and compliance  
Zortress serum trough levels will be monitored twice weekly for the first 3 months after 
transplant, once weekly between mont hs 3 and 6, every other week between months 6 and 12, 
and monthly thereafter. Compliance with Zortress can be determined based on serum trough 
levels.  
7.5 Efficacy   
7.5.1  Efficacy assessment 1  
 Incidence of graft loss in the first post -transplant year  
 Incidence of patient death in the first post -transplant year  
 Incidence of biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year post -transplant  
 Tolerability of Zortress at 1 year post -transplant  
 Renal function at 1 year post -transplant

 8 Safety monitoring  
8.1 Adverse events  
Adverse events t hat the investigators consider to be clinically significant and associated with the use of 
Zortress® or Rapamune® will be recorded at each study visit.  Serious adverse events will be reported 
to Novartis w ithin 24 hours of discovery or notification.  An a dverse event will be considered serious if 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening: if, in the view of  
the investigator , its occurrence places the subject at imme diate risk of  
death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form,  
might have caused death),  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of the  
ability to conduct normal life func tions,  
 Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect,  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization  
(hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused by AE is to be considered  
as serious).  
 Other medically impor tant events  
Follow -up information for serious adverse events will be collected, recorded, and reported to Novartis .   
Adverse events that meet IRB reporting requirements will be submitted to the IRB for review.  
8.2 Serious adverse event reporting  
To ensure pat ient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study 
participation (defined as time of last dose of study drug taken or last visit whichev er is later) . 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 day period should only be reported to Novartis  if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.  
8.3 Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study drug must be r eported to 
Novartis  within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, 
and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or materna l and/or 
newborn complications.  
 
20 
 9 Data review and database management  
9.1 Data collection  
Patient data will be collected/retained within our transplant patient database as per our normal 
operating procedure and thus immediately available  and retrievable for subsequent analyses. 
The data is housed within the Ohio State University Medical Centers Transplant server 
located in a locked, secure facility.  
9.2 Database management and quality control  
Permanent patient electronic records will be store d and maintained on the Transplant server 
housed in a locked, secure facility. Study patient data will be subject to the same quality 
controls already in place for all patients treated by the Ohio State University Medical Centers 
Transplant Program.  
10 Data analysis  (Any or all sections may be included based on 
type of study)  
10.1 Analysis of the primary objective(s)  
10.1.1  Variable  
The primary endpoint  consists of non -death censored graft survival and biopsy proven acute 
rejection at 1 year post -transplant. These events  will be directly measured and not calculated.  
10.1.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of  graft survival (non -death censored) and 
biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year.  
Secondary endpoints a t 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years will include: graft survival and patient 
survival/death at 2 and 3 years, rate and grade of acute cellular rejection, rate of acute 
antibody mediated rejection, rate of new donor specific antibody formation, estimated CrCl by 
MDRD, lipid control as determined by requirement for anti -lipid medications and average 
levels with and without medications, ability to maintain initial immunosuppressive 
medications and reason for switch if required, wound complications as determined by ne ed for 
wound packing, infection treatment with antibiotics, presence of hernia on exam and 
requirement for hernia repair, as well as presence of symptomatic lymphocele, and New Onset 
Diabetes After Transplant as determined by need for new oral or sustained  Insulin medication.  
Statistical analysis will  be performed on SPSS or STATA software with dichotomous 
variables evaluated by Chi -Squared analysis, continuous variables by Student’s T -Test, non -
parametric outcomes will be assessed by Wilcoxon rank sum test  (Mann -Whitney U test).  
Kaplan -Meier survival curves with log rank tests will be used to determine a difference in 
graft and patient survival over time.  
Safety data will include patient and graft survival, biopsy proven acute rejection, and hospital 
admis sions.  
 
21 
 10.1.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
Patients lost to follow -up or discontinued from the study will be censored from further 
analysis at the time of their withdrawal from the study.  
10.2 Analysis of secondary objectives  
10.2.1  Efficacy (seconda ry) 
Secondary endpoints at 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years will include: graft survival and patient 
survival/death at 2 and 3 years, rate and grade of acute cellular rejection, rate of acute 
antibody mediated rejection, rate of new donor specific antibody forma tion, estimated CrCl by 
MDRD, lipid control as determined by requirement for anti -lipid medications and average 
levels with and without medications, ability to maintain initial immunosuppressive 
medications and reason for switch if required, wound complica tions as determined by need for 
wound packing, infection treatment with antibiotics, presence of hernia on exam and 
requirement for hernia repair, as well as presence of symptomatic lymphocele, and New Onset 
Diabetes After Transplant as determined by need for new oral or sustained Insulin medication.  
Statistical analysis will be performed on SPSS or STATA software with dichotomous 
variables evaluated by Chi -Squared analysis, continuous variables by Student’s T -Test, non -
parametric outcomes will be assessed by Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann -Whitney U test).  
Kaplan -Meier survival curves with log rank tests will be used to determine a difference in 
graft and patient survival over time.  
 
10.2.2  Safety  
Safety will be assessed by reviewing hospital admissions and graft an d patient survival on a 
monthly basis as we currently do for our center’s quality assurance reviews.  Any apparent 
differences in outcome showing a disadvantage to the patient’s in the Zortress group will be 
reviewed by our Renal Transplant surgical and me dical directors and they will decide if the 
study needs to be halted or amended.  
10.3 Sample size calculation  
Due to the fact that the sample size is 60 patients, this will be a pilot study that is exploratory 
in nature, and therefore not powered to show statis tical difference.  
 
10.4 Power for analysis of critical secondary variables  
Due to the fact that the sample size is 60 patients, this will be a pilot study that is exploratory in nature, 
and therefore not powered to show statistical difference.  
 
 
22 
 10.5 Interim analysis  
Interim analyses will be performed at 6 months post -transplant to assure patient safety. We 
expect to demonstrate non -inferiority of the primary endpoint for patients in the Zortress 
study arm.  
11 Ethical considerations  
11.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance  
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with 
the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local 
regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regul ations Title 
21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid 
down in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
11.2 Informed consent procedures  
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnes sed, where 
required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC/REB -approved informed consent, or, if incapable of 
doing so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the 
patient.  In cases where the patient’s representative gives co nsent, the patient should be 
informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding.  If the patient is 
capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by personally signing and dating the written 
informed consent document or a separ ate assent form.  Informed consent must be obtained 
before conducting any study -specific procedures ( i.e. all of the procedures described in the 
protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient 
source documents.   
Wome n of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study medication may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that 
in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception re quirement for the 
duration of the study.  If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they 
should not be entered in the study.  
11.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC/REB  
The protocol and the proposed informed consent form m ust be reviewed and approved by a 
properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research 
Ethics Board (IRB/IEC/REB) before study start.  A signed and dated statement that the 
protocol and informed consent have been approved by  the IRB/IEC/REB must be given to 
Novartis before study initiation.  
11.4 Publication of study protocol and results  
Study data in preparation for publication will be made available to Novartis for review prior 
to submission.  
 
23 
 12 Protocol adherence  
12.1 Protocol Amendment s 
Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment that 
must be approved by Novartis , Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC/REB. 
Only amendments that are required for patient safety may be implemented pri or to 
IRB/IEC/REB approval. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol 
amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety 
of any patient included in this study, even if this action represents a devia tion from the 
protocol.

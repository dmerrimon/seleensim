CONFIDENTIAL  Change and Rationale  Sections Changed  
A specific definition of chronic hypercapnic 
respiratory failure has been added in response to 
Health Authority feedback  Section  5.1 Demog raphics and Baseline 
Characteristics  
Updated inclusion criteria to accept a positive PCR 
result within 2 weeks of randomization, a range 
typically associated with the disease, to not exclude 
critical patients as a result of testing delays.   In 
addition, p atients develop the severe/critical 
complications of COVID -19 on average during 2nd 
week after symptom onset (and PCR testing 
typically done at that time) and because this is the 
target population for the study, PCR tests conducted 
up to 2  weeks from enrol lment will be accepted. A 
sample will be collected at baseline and analyzed to 
confirm infection but will not be used to determine 
study inclusion.   Section  7.2.1  Inclusion Criteria (#3)  
Patients with a known systemic hypersensitivity to 
sarilumab or the  excipients of the drug product are 
excluded from the study, per the protocol template.  Section  7.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #11  
The exclusion of patients with a past history of, or 
current, autoimmune or inflammatory systemic or 
localized disease(s) other t han rheumatoid arthritis 
was removed as inclusion of these patients does not 
impact safety or efficacy assessments of these 
patients in this study population.   Section  7.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #6

CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 3  
The secondary efficacy objectives for the Phase 3 portion of the study are 
to: 
Phase 3 Cohort 1 :  
• Determine whether sarilumab improves respiratory outcomes in 
patients with critical COVID -19 
• Determine whether sarilumab reduces mortality in patients with 
critical COVID -19 
• Determine whether sarilumab shortens hospitalization in patients 
with critical COV ID-19 
Phase 3 Cohort 2 :  
• Determine whether sarilumab improves respiratory outcomes in 
patients with COVID -19 receiving mechanical ventilation  
• Determine whether sarilumab reduces mortality in patients with 
COVID -19 receiving mechanical ventilation  
• Determine  whether sarilumab shortens hospitalization in patients 
with COVID -19 receiving mechanical ventilation  
 
 Safety (Phase 2 and 3)  
The secondary safety objectives of the study are to  evaluate the safety of 
sarilumab through hospitalization (up to Day 29 if patient is still hospitalized) 
compared to the control arm as assessed by incidence of:  
• Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC<500/mm3) 
• Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC<500/mm3) with concurrent severe or 
life-threatening bacterial, invasive fungal,  or opportunistic infection  
• Grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions  
• Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions  
• Increase in alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) ≥3X ULN (for patients with normal 
baseline) or >3X ULN AND at least 2 -fold increase from baseline 
value (for patients with abnormal baseline)  
• Invasive bacterial or fungal infections of clinical significance with 
confirmed diagnosis based on the investigator’s assessment with 
appropriate diagnostic workups and consultations  
Study  Design  This study is an adaptive Phase 2/3, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sarilumab in 
hospitalized adults with COVID -19.  The study will be conducted in the 
United States (US) in up to 1 50 sites .  As part of the Phase 3 adaptation plan, 
the Phase 3 portion of the study will include 3 cohorts. In Phase 2 and in 
Cohort 1 of the Phase 3 portion of the study, patients will be randomized in 
a 2:2:1 allocation ratio to sarilumab 400 mg IV, sarilumab 20 0 mg IV, or 
placebo in a stratified manner up to 26 Apr 2020 .  As of 27 Apr 2020  (as per

CONFIDENTIAL  into Cohort 1 closed  when approximately 170 patients in the critical stratum 
receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline who were randomized to receive 
either sarilumab 400  mg or placebo were enrolled.  In Cohort  2, patients 
receiving  mechanical ventilation at baseline will be randomized 1:1 to 
receive sarilumab 800 mg IV or placebo.  In the Phase  3 portion of the study, 
Cohorts 2 and 3  began enroll ing patients in parallel when Cohort 1 
enrollment completed .  Following safety concerns raised by the Independent 
Data Monitoring  Committee (IDMC), the Sponsor determined that the 
benefit/risk assessment was not favorable in patients who were not receiving 
mechanical ventilation. Based on this assessment, as of 06 Jun 2020, patients 
in Cohort  3 will no longer receive study drug. In addition, new patients will 
no longer be enrolled into Cohort  3. 
All patients will continue to be monitored and complete all assessments per 
protocol .    
Patients receiving mechanical ventilation will receive a single dose of study 
drug on Day 1.  In Phase  3 Cohorts 1 and 2 , patients will be re -dosed on 
Day  2 if the patient  is receiving mechanical ventilation and  meets 1 of the 
following criteria:  
1. Remains febrile OR  
2. Fails to improve gas exchange (eg, as measured by ventilator settings 
or O2 requirements) OR  
3. Is hemodynamically unstable OR  
4. Exhibits other objective evidence of clinical worsening (eg, mental 
status change, etc)  
Additional doses will be administered weekly only for patients receiving 
mechanical ventilation at the time of re -dosing  and whose ANC is >500/mm3 
and ALT is ≤5x  ULN. For Cohort  1, a maximum of 6  doses of study drug in 
total can be administered during the study . For Cohort 2,  a maximum of 
4 doses of study drug can be administered during the study .  There  is no 
dosing after Day 21  in Cohort  2.  Throughout the study, study drug should 
be withheld if there is a high degree of suspicion of active bacterial or fungal 
infection.  Patients who receive a prohibited medication will not be eligible 
for re -dosing.  
Study Duration  An individual patient will complete the study approximately 60 days from 
screening to follow -up on Day 60 ±7 days.  Patients will not be required to 
return to the hospital once discharged.   
End of Study Definition  The end of study is defined as the date the last patient completes the last study 
assessment (in the hospital or via a follow -up phone call if the patient was 
discharged from the hospital before Day 60), withdraws from the study, or is 
lost to follow -up (ie, the study patient can no longer be co ntacted by the 
investigator).  
Population   
 Target Population:  Hospitalized adult (≥18 years old) male and female patients with COVID -19.

CONFIDENTIAL   Sample Size:  Total sample size for Phase 2 is expected to be approximately 460 to include 
patients with all baseline IL -6 levels.  Based on results from Phase 2 data, 
sample size for Phase 3 was re -calculated.  For Cohort 1 of the Phase 3 
portion of this study, the tot al sample size will be approximately 
1,400  patients.  Enrollment into Cohort 1 closed  when approximately 
170 patients  in the critical stratum receiving mechanical ventilation at 
baseline who were randomized to receive either sarilumab 400  mg or placebo 
were enrolled.  The total sample size s for Cohort 2 will be approximately 
225 patients. The planned sample size for Cohort 3 was 225  patients, 
however, enrollment ended on 06  Jun 2020 at which time 9  patients enrolled .

Endpoints  Note that for the primary and secondary endpoints, patients will not be 
required to return to the hospital once discharged.  A follow -up phone call 
will occur on Days 29 and/or 60, depending on when the patient is  
discharged.  All patients will be contacted for an end of study (EOS) 
follow -up at Day 60.  
 Primary:  Phase 2 : 
The primary endpoint is the percent change from baseline in C -reactive 
protein (CRP) levels at Day 4 in patients with serum IL -6 levels greater than 
the upper limit of normal.  
Phase 3 Cohort 1 : 
Proportion of patients with at least  a 1-point improvement in clinical status

Phase 3 Cohort 2 : 
Proportion of patients with at least a 1 -point improvement in clinical status 
from baseline to Day  22 using the 7 -point ordinal scale in patients with 
COVID -19 receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline    
Separate analyses of Co horts 1 and 2 are planned.  
 Secondary:  The 7 -point ordinal scale will be assessed as a secondary endpoint in Phase  2 
and will be used for both Primary and Secondary endpoints in Phase 3.  The 
ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status.  The scale is as follows:  
• Death;  
• Hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO);  
• Hospitalized, requiring non -invasive ventilation or high flow 
oxygen devices;  
• Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen;

Safety procedures and assessments include laboratory testing, vital signs,

Statistical Plan  For the Phase 2 portion of the study, a total of approximately 460 patients 
were planned to be randomized (2:2:1) to sarilumab 400 mg  IV, sarilumab 
200 mg IV or placebo. This sample size was estimated to provide at least 
90% power to detect a treatment effect in the Phase 2 endpoint of reduction  
in CRP levels as well as allow adequate estimation and improve precision for 
selection of Phase 3 efficacy endpoints . 
The study analysis plan for Phase 2 is based on the analysis of 2  populations; 
modified intention -to-treat (mITT) population defined as r andomized and 
treated patients with high baseline IL -6 levels (>ULN) and intention -to-treat 
(ITT) population defined as all randomized and treated patients.  For Phase  3 
portion of the study the primary analysis population for efficacy will be the 
ITT popu lation, unless otherwise specified. Supportive analyses in Phase 3 
may also be performed using the per protocol set (PPS) population.  
For the Phase 2 portion of the study, the primary efficacy analysis will be a 
pairwise comparison between sarilumab 400 mg  IV and placebo with respect 
to percent change from baseline in CRP levels at Day 4, in patients with 
COVID -19 disease. Missing values of CRP levels at Day 4 will be imputed 
by Day 3 or Day 5 levels when available, in this order of priority.  Hypothesis 
test of superiority of sarilumab versus placebo will be done using an analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, severity of illness 
and systemic corticosteroid use as fixed effects, and baseline log(CRP) as a 
covariate.  Treatment effect wi ll be reported as difference in mean percent 
change from baseline in CRP levels at Day 4.  P -values will be compared to 
0.05 (2 -sided) level of significance and 95% confidence levels reported.  
The data lock point for the first interim analysis of the Phase  2 portion of the 
study was set at 15 days after the last of the approximately 460 patients in 
Phase 2 had been randomized.  These data were used to determine the 
adaptations and analysis plan for the Phase 3 portion of this adaptive 
Phase  2/3 study.  Base d on the Phase 2 interim results, the sample size for 
Phase 3 was recalculated  using the  chosen Phase 3 endpoint of the proportion 
of patients with at least 1-point improvement in clinical status on the ordinal 
scale in patients in the critical stratum who  were on mechanical ventilation .  
In the Phase 3 Cohort 1, approximately 450 patients in critical stratum are 
planned to be enrolled in order to have approximately 170 critical patients 
who are on mechanical and randomized to receive either sarilumab 400 mg 
or placebo (sarilumab 400 mg n=113 and placebo n=57).  This sample size 
would provide >99% power to detect a treatment difference of 40% in 
                                        VV-RIM-00114290-1.0 Approved - 11 Jun 2020 GMT-5:00

that observed in Phase 2).   
Additional adaptations were  made to Phase  3 to enroll 2 new cohorts  in Phase 
3 randomized 1:1 to sarilumab 800  mg or placebo.  Cohort 2 will enroll 
patients being treated with using mechanical ventilation.  In Cohort  2, a total 
of 225 patients will be enrolled.  This sample size is  estimated to provide at 
least 92% (>99%) power in patients receiving ventilation at baseline to detect 
a treatment difference of 20% (40%) between  sarilumab 800  mg and placebo  
in Cohort 2 .    Sample size re -estimation may occur after Phase 3 Cohort  1 
results are determined.  
The primary hypotheses are to test the superiority of sarilumab 400 mg IV to 
placebo in Cohort 1 critical patients with mechanical ventilation at baseline 
and to test the su periority of sarilumab 800 mg IV to placebo in Cohort 2 , 
with respect to the final primary endpoint of proportion of patients with at 
least 1 -point improvement in clinical status on the ordinal scale at Day 22.  
Interim analysis for the Cohort  1 primary analysis populations will be based 
on analysis of all patients enrolled up to the date when approximately 
110 patients have been enrolled on mechanical ventilation at baseline  who 
are randomized to 400  mg or placebo , with a data lock point 22 day s later.  
The interim analyses will provide for hypothesis  testing for the primary 
endpoint at α=0.005 (2 -sided) and the final analysis with data after 
approximately 170 patients in Cohort 1 on mechanical ventilation at baseline 
reach Day 22 will be tested  at α=0. 049 (2-sided).  Similar interim analyses 
are planned for Cohort 2  .  Primary endpoint for each comparison will be 
proportion of patients with a 1 -point improvement in clinical status from 
baseline to Day  22 using the 7 -point ordinal scale.  Hypothe sis tests of 
superiority of sarilumab (400 or 800  mg dose) versus placebo will be done 
using the stratified  Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test for differences in 
2 proportions  using stratification factors a t randomization .  Estimation of the 
treatment effe ct will be provided as differences in proportions and confidence 
intervals calculated using the strata -adjusted CMH  method.   
Key secondary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint 
and testing of key secondary endpoints will be done in a  hierarchical order 
while preserving the overall Type 1 error rate at 0.05 (2 -sided) level.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) is a novel enveloped RNA 
betacoronavirus that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The term COVID -19 is the 
disease caused by SARS -CoV -2 with symptoms that manifest a median of 5 days and up to 14  days 
after infection. The most frequent clinical presentation of severe COVID -19 is pneumonia with 
symptoms including fever, cough, and  dyspnea. Although fever and cough are the most common 
presenting symptoms of COVID -19, not all patients with pneumonia present with fever (43%) on 
admission to the hospital, although the majority will develop fever later in their hospital course. In 
a rep ort from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included 
44,500  confirmed infections, the majority of infections (80%) are mild (with no or mild 
pneumonia), 14% were severe (defined as dyspnea, hypoxia or >50% lung involvement on 
imagin g) and 5% were critical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan failure ) (Wu, 2020 ). 
Approximately 20% to 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID -19 and pneumonia have required 
intensive care for r espiratory support  (Chen, 2020 )(Huang, 2020 ). In patients with COVID -19, the 
most common laboratory abnormalities in the peripheral white blood cell counts include 
lymphopenia (63%), leukocytosis (24 -30%) and leukopenia (9 -25%). Procalcitonin seru m levels 
are generally not elevated in COVID -19 and were <0.5 in 95% of patients in one study. However, 
COVID -19 is associated with increases in C -reactive protein (CRP) and CRP levels appears to 
track disease severity and outcome. In one study of 150 pati ents with COVID -19 in China, patients 
who died had a significantly higher serum level of CRP (126.6 vs 34.1 mg/L). The overall case 
fatality rates can range from 1.0% to 3% with the majority of fatal cases occurring in critically ill 
patients with advanced  age or underlying medical conditions (Guan, 2020 )(Young, 2020 ).  
Patients with COVID -19 infection are at risk for the development of pneumonia and the acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a clinical syndrome 
of severe impairment of gas exchange due  to widespread alveolar epithelial cell and pulmonary 
capillary endothelial injury resulting from a variety of etiologies, including respiratory viral 
infections. Clinically, ARDS presents with severe hypoxemia (PaO 2/FiO2 ratio <300 mm Hg) 
evolving over da ys to a week in combination with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X -ray 
(or other lung imaging) not entirely attributable to elevated pulmonary venous pressure (ie, heart 
failure or fluid overload). ARDS carries a high mortality rate, ranging from 27% for “mild” ARDS 
to 45% for severe ARDS (defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <100 mm Hg). ARDS is a common 
complication of severe viral pneumonia, including pneumonia due to highly pathogenic 
coronaviruses. In one report of 1,099 patients hospitalized with COV ID-19, ARDS was reported 
to occur in 15.6% of patients with severe pneumonia. In a smaller case series of 138 hospitalized 
patients, ARDS occurred in 19.6% of patients and in 61.1% of patients admitted to an intensive 
care unit (ICU).  
There are currently no specific treatments for COVID -19. Clinical management of hospitalized 
patients with COVID -19 includes supportive therapy: supplemental oxygen therapy to target SpO 2, 
empiric antimicrobials, empiric neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza when  there is 
local circulation and intensive care as required.  The routine use of systemic corticosteroids is not 
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of COVID -19 
pneumonia or ARDS, although, in practice, corticosteroids are re ported to be used in patients with 
severe COVID -19 (WHO, 2020a ). The median duration of hospitalization for mild cases is 12 to 
14 days and approximately 3 to 6 weeks for patients with more severe disease (WHO, 2020b ). The 
decision to discharge patients from a hospital or to discontinue transmission -based precautions is

CONFIDENTIAL  made on a case -by-case basis but the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends waiting until 
there is resolution of fever without use of antipyretic m edication, improvements in illness signs 
and symptoms and negative results of COVID -19 PCR from 2 consecutive sets of nasopharyngeal 
and throat swab specimens collected >24 hours apart  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), 2020 ).  Among patients who have died, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranges 
from 2 to 8 weeks.  
Data on progression of disease in hospit alized patients are available from a limited number of 
hospitalized cases. In one report describing 1,099 COVID -19 patients in China, approximately 5% 
were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died. Among 
patients wi th severe disease on admission (defined as pneumonia, hypoxemia and tachypnea), 19% 
were admitted to the ICU, 38.7% underwent invasive or non -invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
8.1% died (Guan, 2020 ). 
Triggers for severe illness with SARS -CoV -2 are not completely understood. The initial 
inflammatory responses to an infection are rapid and non -specific and regulated by inflammatory 
mediators including cytokines such as interleukin -6 (IL-6). IL -6 is a chief mediator in the early 
response to infection including fever (Gabay, 1999 ). However, IL -6 has been implicated in many 
pathogenic inflammatory states including the cytokine storm following infection with avian 
influenza A H5N1, SARS and MERS -CoV infection  (de Jong,  2006 ) (Huang, 2005 ) (Zhang, 
2004 ). Although the consequences of IL -6 production has been associated with both pro -
inflammatory and anti -inflammatory effects, in the setting of infections, IL -6 is an important 
mediator of fever induction (Evans, 2015 ). The pyrog enic role of IL -6 was delineated in patients 
receiving T cell based -immunotherapy (specifically, chimeric antigen receptor -expressing T cells 
or a CD19/CD3 -bispecific antibody) where treatment with the IL -6 receptor antagonist, 
tocilizumab, quickly reversed the high fevers and other symptoms that developed as part of a 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) over several days (Teachey, 2013 ). 
While the majority of patients with COVID -19 have mild infection despite having pneumonia, 
approximately 20% of patients develop severe disease. Of note, lik e MERS -COV, in patients with 
severe COVID -19, the onset of dyspnea, fever and progressive hypoxia can occur late, often during 
the second week after onset of symptoms suggesting a late pro -inflammatory process associated 
with the deterioration. For example , in one report, while only 43% of patients had fever on hospital 
admission, 88% of patients developed fever during hospitalization (Guan, 2020 ). In another report, 
dyspnea occurre d 8 days (IQR: 5 to 13 days) after onset of symptoms, and ARDS occurred 9  days 
after onset of symptoms (IQR: 8 to 14 days). The delayed pro -inflammatory clinical presentation 
of COVID -19 is similar to what has been shown in primary lung epithelial cells in fected with 
MERS -CoV where induction of IL -6 and IL -1b occurs late (30 hours after infection) (Lau, 2013 ) 
(Margulis, 2015 ). Interestingly, MERS -CoV patients who had severe infection, defined as need 
for oxygen supplementation, had higher IL -6 levels (median 54 pg/mL; range 5 to 228) compared 
to mild cases (median 3  pg/mL; range 0 -44), especially during the 2nd and 3rd week af ter symptom 
onset, indicating a delayed pro -inflammatory process associated with severe MERS -CoV infection 
(Margulis,  2015 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  Currently, few data exist on serum IL -6 levels in COVID -19 patients, but a median of 27 ng/L  has 
been reported, and in severely ill patients can range widely (4.58 -1182.9 ng/L ) (Huang,  2020). In 
addition, at this time it is not clear how well seru m IL -6 levels functions as a prognostic factor for 
progression of COVID -19. One report from Wuhan, China describe 69 patients with severe 
COVID -19 (defined as having 1 of the following: shortness of breath, respiratory rate >30/min, 
O2sat <93% resting, PaO 2/FiO2 ratio <300 mm  Hg) and 11 patients with non -severe COVID -19. 
Baseline serum IL -6 level was increased in the severe COVID -19 cases compared to the 
non-severe cases (median 35 pg/mL versus <5 pg/mL), as was the (CRP ) levels (Liu, 2020 ).  
One hypothesis is that IL -6 is a modifiable driver of progression of disease with COVID -19 among 
patients with severe COVID -19. A potential therapeutic approach for patients with severe 
COVID -19 pneumonia th erefore would be to temporarily attenuate the localized pulmonary 
“cytokine storm” in severe patients through blockade of the IL -6 receptor (IL -6R).  
Kevzara® (sarilumab) is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to both soluble 
and membr ane-bound IL -6Rs (sIL -6Rα and mIL -6Rα) and has been shown to inhibit 
IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. Sarilumab is formulated for subcutaneous (SC) 
injection at doses of 150 and 200 mg Q2W and was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in the US on 22 May 2017, EU on 23 Jun 2017, and Japan on 27  Sep 2017. Sarilumab 
is not currently approved for use in CRS.  
Actemra® (tocilizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL -6R and was approved 
for use in CRS associated with CAR -T cell therapies at a dose of 8 or 12 mg/kg, depending on 
weight, administered intravenously (IV) alone or in combination with corticost eroids. Symptoms 
of CRS can include high fevers, hypotension, respiratory and renal insufficiency, cytopenias and 
coagulopathy, although milder cases of CRS can present with only high fevers and myalgias. 
Several aspects of the CRS mirror those of severe C OVID -19, including fever, respiratory 
insufficiency, and elevated markers of systemic inflammation, such as CRP. The experience with 
tocilizumab treated patients with CAR -T cell induced CRS reveals rapid defervescence and 
hemodynamic stability (Maude, 2014 ).  The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tocilizumab in these 
patients suggests relatively rapid decline in concentrations following a single 8  mg/kg IV dose.  
An analysis performed by the FDA shows that C max is about 40% lower in patients with CRS.  The 
analysis indicates a linear clearance of 0.50  L/day and volume of distri bution in central 
compartment of 1.8 L, suggesting half -life of 3  to 4 days in serum.  The linear clearance appears 
faster in patients with CRS than in pediatric patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(sJIA) or in adults with RA.  
There are cu rrently no known published reports of IL -6R antagonist for infectious sepsis or 
pneumonia. Because IL -6 contributes to host defense against bacterial and viral pathogens, there 
is concern that the IL -6R inhibitor drug class, including sarilumab and tociliz umab) may 
exacerbate infections thus delaying recovery from sepsis. Patients chronically treated with 
sarilumab are at increased risk for developing serious and opportunistic infections. Most developed 
infections occur while taking other immunosuppressants  with sarilumab. Reported infections 
include active tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections, bacterial and viral infections. While 
decreases in absolute neutrophil count is seen in patients treated with sarilumab, they are not 
reported to be associated wi th increased incidence of infection or serious infections 
(Fleischmann,  2017 ). A clinical study of neutrophil trafficking suggested that this decrease is due 
to redistribution into the marginating pool, rather than a net  decrease in the neutrophil population 
(Lok, 2017 ). Other laboratory abnormalities seen with chronic administration of IL -6R antagonists

risk of gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients with  concurrent diverticulitis, 
concomitant use of NSAIDS or corticosteroids. Finally, hypersensitivity reactions have been 
reported with SC administration of IL -6R antagonists.  
During the current COVID -19 outbreak, tocilizumab has been used in 21 patients wi th severe 
COVID -19 infection and described in a retrospective study (Wu, 2020 ). Patients were treated 
between February 5, 2020 and February14, 2020 if they had severe COVID -19 defined as having 
1 or more of the following criteria: 1) respiratory rate >30 breaths/min; 2) SpO2 <93% on room 
air; 3) PaO2/FiO2 <300  mmHg or had critical COVID -19 defined as respiratory failure requiring 
mechanical ventilation, shock, organ failure or had an ICU admission. Among 21 patients 
17 (81%) were severe and 4  (19%) were critical. Eight een patients received a single dose of 
tocilizumab and 3  patients received a second dose of tocilizumab 12 hours after the first because 
of ongoing fever. All patients had fever prior to treatment, baseline mean CRP was 75±66.80 and 
mean IL -6 level was 132 ±278 pg/mL. One day after treatment with tocilizumab all patients had 
normal body temperature. Before treatment, 20 of 21 patients required oxygen therapy through 
high-flow nasal cannula (n=9), nasal cannula (7), mask oxygenation (1), noninvasive ventilati on 
(1) and invasive ventilation (2). After tocilizumab 15 (75%) lowered oxygen intake after treatment 
and by Day 3 all patients had SpO 2 >94%, including 1 patient who was breathing without 
supplemental oxygen. As of March 5, 2020, a larger clinical trial i s ongoing in 14 hospitals in 
Wuhan, China and 272 patients with severe COVID -19 have been treated.   
Conducting well -controlled, randomized clinical trials in the setting of an outbreak has previously 
been found to be feasible and essential to identify saf e and efficacious therapeutics for emerging 
infections like Ebola Virus Disease (Mulangu, 2019 ). In addition, during a pandemic, drug 
shortages and resource limitations can hinder the outbreak response, therefore, obtaining 
high-quality data on multiple therapeutics, even in the same class of drug, against an emerging 
infection is critical. Sarilumab acts by blocking IL -6R and may constitute a novel therapeutic 
strategy for severe COVID -19 to co ntrol the uncontrolled inflammatory response. If found to be 
safe and effective as monotherapy, sarilumab could be used in conjunction with future COVID -19-
specific antivirals therapeutics.  Risk of worsening or new infections associated with chronic use 
of IL-6R blockers could be mitigated using a single dose that only leads to short -term (<4  weeks) 
exposure to sarilumab and close monitoring and early treatment of worsening or new infections 
that may occur during the recovery period from COVID -19.

CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypotheses  
Phase 2 : Treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID -19 with sarilumab will result in a greater 
reduction in serum CRP compared to the control.  
Phase 3 Cohort 1:  Treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID -19 in the critical stratum on 
mechanical ventilation at baseline  with sarilumab 400  mg will result in a greater proportion of 
patients who improve their clinical s tatus at Day  22 compared to placebo.  
Phase 3 Cohort 2:  In patients hospitalized with COVID -19 who are on mechanical ventilation, 
treatment with sarilumab 800 mg will result in a greater proportion of patients who improve their 
clinical status at Day 22 as compared to placebo.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
Currently, there are no specific COVID -19 treatments. SARS -CoV -2, the betacoronavirus that 
causes COVID -19, results in a similar acute lower respiratory disease caused by SARS -CoV that 
was identifi ed in 2002 and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV). 
Many therapeutic agents have been used to treat patients with SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV, 
including corticosteroids, type 1 IFN agents, convalescent plasma, ribavirin, lopinavir/rito novir, 
proteases, and agents targeting viral entry proteins. However, none have been shown to be 
efficacious in clinical trials. Therefore, the comparator proposed in this study will be placebo.  
Randomization is essential for establishing efficacy of sari lumab compared to placebo. Collection 
of clinical, virologic, and cytokine data using a standardized timeline will provide valuable 
information on the clinical course of severe COVID -19 and the impact of sarilumab on clinical 
recovery from COVID -19. 
The st udy utilizes an adaptive Phase 2/3 design that intends to maximize efficiency of identifying 
early signs of clinical efficacy and to avoid the use of ineffective therapeutics in critically ill 
patients with COVID -19.  Due to the novel nature of the COVID -19 pandemic, efficacy endpoints 
are not well established, and the standard of care is expected to evolve over time. The adaptive 
design allows for the assessment of efficacy endpoints in Phase 2 which are then seamlessly 
confirmed in the Phase 3 portion of the study, as well as evaluating the benefit -risk of multiple  
doses of sarilumab. This study is therefore intended to allow for multiple adaptations, including 
dropping of a sarilumab dose arm, modification of the primary endpoints for Phase 3, and sample 
size re -estimation for Phase 3.  
The study will begin enrollment of all patients, as planned. To maximize safety, the Independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will perform 3 interim data reviews after approximately 12, 
25, and 50 patients have been dos ed and have had at least 7 days of follow -up to determine if a 
treatment arm should be discontinued for safety reasons. These data reviews will include all data, 
including deaths, from all enrolled study participants.  Unblinded Regeneron senior physicians  
who are not directly involved with the study will review data from these 3 interim data reviews 
independently of the IDMC. The IDMC will also meet regularly throughout the course of the study 
to review safety data and make recommendations on study conduct .

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.2.  Rationale for Study Design Adaptation  
Adaptations of the Phase 3 portion of the study are based on interim Phase 2 results of this study 
(Table  1 and Table  2). Sarilumab 400 and 200  mg IV reduced serum CRP by 79% and 77%, 
respectively, compared to 21% in the  placebo arm in the  modified intention -to-treat ( mITT ) 
population (primary endpoint). Sarilu mab did not appear to improve clinical outcomes in patients 
with severe disease.  In patients with critical disease, there were trends toward a benefit of 
sarilumab 400  mg compared to placebo in the proportion of patients who died or did not require 
mechan ical ventilation, had clinical improvement according to the 7 -point ordinal scale, did not 
require supplemental oxygen, and were discharged ( Table  1). Ad ditional analyses did not suggest 
a benefit in patients in the MSOD group. Based on the IDMC recommend ation, as of 27 Apr 2020, 
the severe and MSOD groups will no longer enroll or receive study drug.  The IDMC also 
recommended that the sarilumab 200  mg arm  be discontinued due to lack of benefit .

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.3.  Rationale for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Cohort 1  Dose Selection  
COVID -19 infection can be associated with a degree of pulmonary cytokine release and IL -6 has 
been shown to be a major contributor to the development of fever and hypoxemia.  In the current 
study, both 200 and 400 -mg doses of sarilumab (Kev zara®), an anti -IL-6R mAb, are to be 
administered by a 1 -hour IV infusion. Sarilumab is currently approved for treatment in patients 
with RA at 200  mg Q2W (SC) [with down dosing to 150 mg Q2W (SC) for certain laboratory 
changes]. Sarilumab is analogous to tocilizumab and there is reported evidence that IV treatment 
with 400 mg of tocilizumab (Actemra®), an anti -IL-6R monoclonal antibody (mAb), provides a 
clinically meaningful improvement in clinical symptoms that are thought to be mediated by 
cytokine relea se in patients with severe or critical COVID -19 infection.  
There is limited experience in the use of sarilumab by IV infusion and no experience at the doses 
being studied in this protocol. Sarilumab was initially administered IV in a single dose, dose 
escalation, safety, pharmacodynamic (PD), and PK study of patients with RA 
(Study  TDU10808/6R88 -RA-0703), which was terminated prior to completion due to the 
occurrence of Grade 4 neutropenia (neutrophil count: 400 per mm3) in 1 of 2 patients in the 
2 mg/kg c ohort and the intention to develop the drug for SC dosing in RA patients. Thus, following 
this first -in-human study, the SC route of administration was used in all subsequent studies.  The 
appropriateness for the use of sarilumab by the IV route in this se tting is supported by the high 
degree of similarity between sarilumab and tocilizumab regarding the clinically observed PK, PD 
(to include safety and PD endpoints), many of which were assessed in randomized trials. These 
similarities extend to other clinic ally observed pharmacology properties, in vitro properties, as 
well as the physiochemical properties.   
The PK/PD strategy in dose selection for a mAb directed against IL -6R, whether it be tocilizumab 
or sarilumab, is to maintain local and systemic saturat ion of the target -mediated pathway over an 
identified duration and thereby ensuring saturation or near -saturation of target binding.  
Given the high binding affinity and binding specificity of both tocilizumab and sarilumab, once 
systemic concentrations of the mAb are sufficient to saturate the target -mediated pathway the 
pharmacological response in terms of safety, PD, or efficacy associated with further increases in 
concentration is only increased with respect to the duration of action and, possibly, great er 
penetration into difficult to reach tissues.  
The PK, PD, and safety of sarilumab and tocilizumab were compared in a number of randomized 
trials. In a single -dose, open -label randomized trial the PK and PD were assessed in patients with 
RA randomized 1: 1:1:1 to either 150 mg or 200 mg (SC) of sarilumab, or 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg (IV) 
of tocilizumab (Study 1309) . Also, in a single dose PK/PD study, 150  mg of sarilumab (SC) was 
compared to 162 mg of tocilizumab (SC) in Japanese patients with RA randomized 1:1 (Study 
PDY1419 ) (Huang, 2020 ). In the multiple -dose double -blind study ASCERTAIN (NCT0176857 2) 
the safety and tolerability of sarilumab and tocilizumab were compared in approximate ly 
200 patients with RA randomized 1:1:2 to receive 150 mg Q2W or 200  mg Q2W of sarilumab 
(SC) or 4 mg/kg Q4W of tocilizumab (IV) for 24  weeks (Emery,  2019 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  In the single -dose PK/PD studies, consistent with saturation of the target mediated pathway for 
sarilumab and tocilizumab, all dose l evels regardless of the route of administration demonstrated 
similar maximal effect in suppression in CRP and ANC lowering.  Notably, higher dose levels and 
the associated higher concentrations, beyond that need to achieve saturation, resulted in a longer 
duration of the maximal PD response, but did not result in a deeper response.  Consistent with the 
longer duration of saturation following IV administration of tocilizumab, but consistent with the 
similar PK/PD relationship for sarilumab and tocilizumab, s IL-6R increased in a dose and 
concentration related manner. Subcutaneous single doses of sarilumab (150 mg) or tocilizumab 
(162 mg) resulted in similar concentration time profiles and yielded nearly identical PD response 
in CRP and ANC, as well as changes in sIL -6R and IL -6 over time.  In the ASCERTAIN study, 
similar PD effects were observed with ANC lowering. Additionally, no clinically meaningful 
differences in treatment -emergent adverse events were observed between sarilumab and 
tocilizumab. Laboratory c hanges with sarilumab were within the same range as those with 
tocilizumab (Emery, 2019 ). 
Consistency in PD effects between tocilizumab and sarilumab are also seen in cross -study 
comparison of the radiographic studies performed with the  2 products.  According to their labeling, 
the 162 mg Q2W dose of tocilizumab reduced radiographic progression based on the modified 
total Sharpe score (mTSS) by 50% at 24 weeks; the 150 mg Q2W dose of sarilumab reduced 
radiographic progression based on th e modified total Sharpe score (mTSS) by 68% at 52 weeks.   
The best biomarker for PD effect of IL -6R inhibition is decrease in ANC; ANC decreases and 
remains depressed during the period of receptor blockade and increases after systemic levels of 
drug fall below those necessary to saturate.  Recent publications suggests this lowering in ANC 
may be a result of neutrophil margination and not a result of clearance of the neutrophils, while 
the neutrophils maintain their functionality (Lok, 2017 ). Thus, while a time -dependent increased 
incidence of infection, including serious infection, due to IL -6 receptor blockade has been noted, 
this was not related to the decreases in ANC observed with sarilumab (Kevzara  [package insert],  
2017 ).  It has also been reporte d that the level of a patient’s inflammatory state may result in 
increased clearance of anti -IL-6R mAb (Le, 2018 ). Accordingly , patients with CRS may need 
higher doses of anti -IL-6R antagonist than patients with active RA. Consistent with this, the PD 
effect of sarilumab  as measured by reduction in ANC in RA patients with active inflammation was 
less pronounced and shorter than in otherwise controlled RA patients.  The need to ensure 
saturation systemically and locally in tissue, together with a shorter time to C max suppo rt the use 
of IV administration over that of SC and support the study of higher doses of sarilumab than 
approved for the treatment of RA in conditions of cytokine release resulting from COVID -19 
infection.  
Data from the dose ranging portion of Study EFC11072 (MOBILITY Part A) illustrates the 
relationship between trough concentrations of sarilumab obtained from 100 mg Q2W, 
150 mg Q2W, 200 mg Q2W, and 150 mg QW administration and ANC). These results 
demonstrate a plateau of ANC decline despite a greater  than 2.5 -fold increase in trough 
concentrations with weekly administration. (100 mg QW vs 150 mg QW). This PD effect of IL -6R 
inhibition on neutrophil suppression is clearly on the plateau of the dose -response curve indicating 
that higher exposures would not be predicted to yield a further increase in ANC suppression. 
Furthermore, this expected PD effect on ANC number has not been correlated to an increased risk 
of infection for either the sarilumab or tocilizumab, nor does it interfere with the phagocytos is, 
rate of apoptosis, oxidative burst, or other known neutrophil capacity (Lok, 2017 ). Therefore, the

CONFIDENTIAL  margination effect of IL -6R inhibition has no known clinical relevance for patients without active 
bacterial infection.  
To date there is a plethora of experience with high doses of tocilizumab; notably i t is also approved 
at dose up to 8 mg/kg IV and has been used in clinical practice at these levels for over a decade in 
the treatment of RA and more recently higher IV doses of tocilizumab have been used in cytokine 
release syndrome associated with chimeri c antigen receptor T -cell (CART) therapy. Regeneron 
developed sarilumab for subcutaneous administration and performed a head -to-head study 
comparing the 150 and 200 mg SC doses of sarilumab with IV tocilizumab at 4 and 8 mg/kg IV 
(6R88 -RA-1309). As expecte d, the serum concentrations of tocilizumab are substantially higher 
than those of sarilumab. Yet, despite the higher concentrations of tocilizumab, the magnitude of 
the PD effects as measured by reduction in ANC and CRP are the same at early timepoints 
(ie, when drug concentrations of both drugs are at or above those needed to achieve saturation). 
The only difference between these supra -saturating concentrations of tocilizumab and the lower 
concentrations of sarilumab is in duration of peak PD effect. It ca n also be observed with the loss 
of saturating concentrations there is a temporally rapid decline in these PD effects. These data 
provide strong evidence that higher doses and higher serum concentrations of either of these 
anti-IL-6R antibodies beyond thos e required for saturation do not provide any greater PD effect 
nor any greater safety concern and these higher doses only serve to extend the duration of the PD 
effects.  
Based on available data, on a per mg basis, tocilizumab and sarilumab behave comparab ly in vivo 
with respect to potency, PK, PD, efficacy, and safety. Thus, the safety of sarilumab at doses as 
high as 400 mg IV can be extrapolated from the experience with similar and even higher doses of 
tocilizumab. Nonetheless, this needs to be verified with actual clinical data.  In order to test both 
lower and higher doses of sarilumab to treat severe COVID -19 pneumonia, 2  doses will be studied: 
200 mg IV and 400 mg IV.  In the setting of a pandemic where drug supply may become limiting, 
identifying the  minimum dose necessary could increase the supply.  
Tocilizumab has been approved for use in patients with CRS as a consequence of CAR -T therapy.  
During the FDA review of the sBLA for this indication, a comparison of the observed C max in these 
patients wit h those for patients with sJIA, indicated that C max in patients with CRS was 40% lower 
than for patients with sJIA.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling was performed by FDA, where 
clearance (CL) was estimated to be 0.50 L/day (RSE = 10.8%) and central volume of  distribution 
(VC) was estimated to be 1.8 L (RSE = 11.2%) in patients with CRS.  These estimates are higher 
than CL of 0.17 L/day and V C of 0.94 L in similar aged patients with sJIA.  This analysis indicates 
that the half -life of the decline in tocilizuma b concentrations following IV doses of 8  mg/kg in the 
patients with CRS (>30kg) is 3 to 4 days.  
Assuming a similar PK profile for sarilumab in COVID patients to the tocilizumab data in patients 
with CRS, a repeat dose of sarilumab at 24 hours should produc e approximately the same C max as 
originally predicted based on the PK in active RA patients.  Moreover, assuming the same 
clearance for sarilumab as observed for tocilizumab, sarilumab levels could fall by 75% within 
1 week, which may lead to levels which do not completely block signaling through the IL -6R.  
Given the similarities in the PK characteristics of sarilumab and tocilizumab, these data suggest 
that the proposed dosing interval for sarilumab is appropriate.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.4.  Rationale for Phase 3 Cohort s 2 and 3 Dose Selection  
As discussed above, p reliminary, open -label data from the use of tocilizumab, initially at a 400  mg 
IV dose (Xu, 2020 ) supported assessment of IL -6R inhibition in patients with severe or criti cal 
COVID -19 patients.   Subsequent studies with tocilizumab , however,  are being conducted at a 
higher dose: 8 mg/kg up to 800 mg initial dose, with repeat dosing allowed based on clinical 
criteria.  In these studies, benefit  has been described in COVID -19 both in ventilated patients and 
in patients not on a ventilator.  
Initial results of the open -label, randomized, controlled Phase 2 study, CORIMUNO -TOCI support 
the administration of an 8 mg/kg IV dose of tocilizumab. In this study, 129 patients hospitalize d 
for COVID -19 moderate or severe pneumonia and not requiring intensive care upon admission 
were randomized to standard of care + tocilizumab (8 mg/kg up to a 800  mg maximal dose on 
Day 1 and if no response, with no decrease of oxygen requirement, a second  administration at 
Day 3; n=65) or to SOC alone (n=64). Data showed that a significantly lower proportion of patients 
reached ventilation or death at Day 14 in the tocilizumab + SOC arm vs. SOC alone, however, 
details have not been disclosed ( APHP, 2020 ). 
In an interim analysis of the Phase 2 portion of 6R88 -COV -2040 , based on the prespecified 
analysis of the combined severe and critical strata, there was no evidence of treatment effect with 
either the 200 - or 400 -mg dose.  In  other prespecified analyses , trends in the number of patients in 
the critical stratum who achieved a 2 -point improvement in clinical status on the 7-point ordinal 
scale  suggested  that a single 400 mg dose achieved greater treatment benefit than a single 200 -mg 
dose.   
 
 
These results with sarilumab are not what had be en anticipated.  Either the results of the previous  
uncontrolled or small controlled studies with tocilizumab were misleading OR there is a systematic  
difference in study design  between the tocilizumab and sarilumab studies , the most prominent 
difference b eing dose.  The maximum dose of sarilumab in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 Cohort 1 
portion of the current  study was 400 mg with repeat dosing allowed based on clinical criteria.  With 
obesity being a risk factor for severe or critical COVID -19, it is not surpri sing that the mean 
baseline weight in the 6R88 -COV -2040  study, conducted in the US, is ~91 kg.  Thus , patients are 
being dosed  at approximately 4.4 mg/kg, significantly less than the dose of tocilizumab in recent  
studies.  And, while sarilumab treatment in the current study readily lowered CRP levels, there has 
been almost no effect on  neutrophil counts, another  established pharmacodynamic marker  of IL -6R 
inhibition .  Indeed, only 2 patients in  the Phase 2 portion  of the study had Grade 4 neutropenia . 
IL-6 concentration data are c onsistent  with the notion that higher doses of sarilumab are required 
in COVI D-19 than were being administered .  Mean baseline IL -6 levels across all treatment arm 
and disease severity in the Phase 2 portion of the current study was 356 pg/mL and in the critical 
strata was 373 pg/mL which far exceeds the IL -6 levels observed in the RA studies.  For example, 
in Study 6R88 -RA-1309, which evaluated single dose administration of sarilumab SC (1 50 and 
200 mg) and tocilizumab IV (4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg) in RA patients, the mean baseline IL -6 levels 
ranged from ~7 to 22 pg/mL.  
Taken together, the relatively modest  efficacy signal, the absence of trends in the safety data to 
suggest harm, and the pharm acodynamic  data all suggest that effective blockade of IL -6R in 
                                        VV-RIM-00114290-1.0 Approved - 11 Jun 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  COVID -19 patients may require a  higher dose of sarilumab than has been studied .  In the absence 
of a safety signal to suggest otherwise, the dose was increased to sarilumab 800  mg to maximize 
IL-6R inhibition and determine treatment effects  in Phase 3 Cohorts 2 and 3 .  Therefore, in 
Cohort s 2 and 3 of Phase 3 , an 800-mg dose of sarilumab, with the allowance for repeat dosing 
based on  clinical criteria  will be studied  to determine if this higher  dose results in more robust  
clinical benefit  than has been seen .  Risk mitigation strategies, already in place for the protocol  
were  followed including both expedited reporting of adverse events of special interest ( AESIs ; 
including Grade  4 neutropenia wi th or without concurrent invasive infections), and active 
engagement with the IDMC to provide adequate assurance for patient safety.  
This increase in dose was supported by the PK data.  In an interim analysis of the preliminary 
Phase 2 data , following IV administration of a single  sarilumab dose, mean (SD) C max was 
49.2 (±16.8) mg/L (n=146) for the 200 -mg dose and 105  (±46.6) mg/L (n=140) for the 400 -mg 
dose. Based on the central volume for a typical monoclonal antibody the observed C max values are 
25% to 30% lower than expected.  The subsequent decline in concentrations suggests a n initial  
half-life of sarilumab in serum of about 3 days, indicating that repeat dosing on a weekly interval 
was not expected to lead to significant accumulation , even at the 800-mg dose.  These observations 
appear to be consistent with the findings for tocilizumab in patients with CRS as a consequence of 
CAR -T therapy described in Section  3.2.3 . 
The anticipated mean  sarilumab  Cmax following a single 800 -mg dose , based on 
the preliminary  interim PK analysis  as well as that expected for a typical monoclonal antibody, is 
about 200 to 250 mg/L. The proposed dosing regimen is supported by the safety and efficacy data 
observed at 400  mg in patients with COVID -19 and the toxicology data described in Investigator 
Brochure, where the average C trough at the NOAEL in the monkey following IV dosing ranged from 
504 mg/L (40  mg/kg/week in a 5 -week study) to 1780 mg/L (50  mg/kg/week in a 26 -week study).  
3.3. Risk -Benefit for REGN88 (sarilumab, Kevzara®)  
Sarilumab is currently approved at 200 mg Q2W (SC) for the treatment of RA in multiple 
countries. The risks and adverse reactions are describe d in the approved prescribing information 
for sarilumab.  
There are currently no known published reports of IL -6R antagonists for infectious sepsis or 
pneumonia. Because IL -6 contributes to host defense against bacterial and viral pathogens, there 
is a con cern that IL -6 inhibition may exacerbate infections thus delaying recovery from sepsis. 
Patients chronically treated with sarilumab are at increased risk for developing serious and 
opportunistic infections. Most developed infections while taking other immu nosuppressants or 
disease modifying anti -rheumatic arthritis (DMARDs) with sarilumab. Opportunistic infections, 
including de novo cases of tuberculosis, disseminated candidiasis and pneumocystis have been 
infrequently reported with sarilumab. The most freq uently reported opportunistic infections were 
cases of non -disseminated herpes zoster with an incidence similar in sarilumab+DMARD and 
placebo+DMARD groups. Other serious infections (eg, histoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus) 
have not been reported in sarilumab clinical studies but have been reported in patients receiving 
other immunosuppressive agents. In this study, patients are only receiving corticosteroids if 
indicated for an acute medical indication, and close monitoring in the hospital or ICU setting to 
diagnose and treat infections . The risk to subjects is thus  minimized.

CONFIDENTIAL  While decreases in ANC is seen in patients treated with sarilumab, they are reported not to be 
associated with increased incidence of infection or serious infections in pati ents with RA 
(Fleischmann, 2017 ). A clinical study of neutrophil trafficking suggested that this decrease is due 
to an redistribution into the marginating pool, rather than a net decrease in the neutrophil 
population (Lok, 2017 ).  
Treatment with sarilumab in clinical studies has al so been associated with a higher incidence of 
transaminase elevations. These elevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident 
hepatic injury in clinical studies. Liver function test monitoring will be performed during the study. 
In ad dition, gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in clinical studies, including in patients 
receiving corticosteroids. Patients will be closely monitoring in the hospital or ICU setting with 
daily clinically indicated evaluations by health care profe ssionals in detect this event if it occurs.  
In the Phase 2 safety population of Study  6R88 -COV -2040 (n=457), sarilumab at doses of 200  mg 
and 400  mg IV were not associated with new safety findings. Transaminase levels were higher in 
sarilumab patients compared to placebo.  Grade 4 neutropenia was rare and clinically significant 
bacterial and fungal infections were similar  in sarilumab -treated groups as compared to placebo. 
Serious adverse events were  generally representative  of the underlying patient population.  
Additional information on possible risks and adverse drug reactions is provided in the IB.  
Sarilumab may or may not improve clinical outcomes of a subject with COVID -19 who is enrolled 
in thi s trial. During the current COVID -19 outbreak, tocilizumab (another IL -6R antagonist) has 
been used in 21 patients with severe COVID -19 infection and described in a retrospective study 
(Wu, 2020 ). Data from these patients suggest blockade of the IL -6R may lead to a clinically 
meaningful improvement in symptoms that are thought to be mediated by cytokine release.  
Additionally, tocilizumab is approved for use in CRS associated with CAR -T cell therapies (8 or 
12 mg/kg, based on weight). Several aspects of the CRS mirror those of severe COVID -19, 
including fever, respiratory insufficiency, and elevated markers of systemic inflammation, such as 
CRP.  
In critical patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study,  sarilumab 400  mg IV was associated with a 
numerically lower proportion of patients who had died or required mechanical ventilation at 
Day 21 compared to placebo (32% in sarilumab 400  mg vs. 55% in placebo). There were also 
numerical differences favoring s arilumab 400  mg IV compared to placebo in the proportion of 
patients who experienced clinical improvement and who were discharged by Day  21 (Table  1). 
Among patients receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline, sarilumab 40 0 mg was associated 
with a greater proportion of patients who were alive without mechanical ventilation (57% in 
sarilumab 40 0 mg vs . 17% in placebo) and a greater proportion of patien ts who recovered (47% in 
sarilumab 40 0 mg vs . 17% in placebo) compared to placebo.  
 
 
Based on review of the Phase 2 data , the IDMC recommended , and the Sponsor agreed , that the 
benefit/risk assessment supported continu ed enrollment of only critical COVID -19 patients in 
Phase 3 . These changes were impleme nted in Protocol Amendment 6. 
Based on review of the Phase 3 Cohort 1 data, the IDMC noted a safety concern which led them 
to recommend no further enrollment or dosing of patients who were not on mechanical ventilation 
at baseline.  The Sponsor ’s review of the data in patients not on mechanical ventilation at baseline

CONFIDENTIAL  showed no benefit among those treated with sarilumab compared to placebo, and there were more 
deaths among the sarilumab -treated patients.  The imbalances in mortality observed in  this subset 
of Phase 3 Cohort 1 had not been observed in the smaller Phase 2 400 mg critical patient dataset.   
Although there had been a small trend in favor of sarilumab 400 mg in the Phase 2 data, no 
meaningful trends either for efficacy or harm are seen in the combined Phase 2/Phase 3 Cohort 1 
data in this subset of patients with critical COVID -19 not on mechanical  ventilation .  Consider ing

in critical COVID -19 patients who were not receiving mechanical ventilation at randomization, 
there is also no evidence for benefit.   Thus,  the Sponsor  agreed with the IDMC that the benefit/risk 
assessment is not favorable and continued dosing of sarilumab in this study is not warranted in 
patients with critical COVID -19 who are not receiving mechanical ventilation.   Enrollment will 
continue in Phase 3 Co hort 2 as the IDMC did not note any safety concerns that precludes 
enrollment into this cohort .  Changes to the Phase 3 planned enrollment are implemented with this

CONFIDENTIAL  5. STUDY VARIABLES  
5.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, weight, height, etc), 
disease characteristics, medical history, and medication history for each patient.  
The site investigator will assess th e patient for a history of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure 
(eg, due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) at the screening visit.  Chronic hypercapnic 
respiratory failure is defined as the presence of both of the following criteria:  
1. Documented  current or historical PaCO2 >45  mm Hg (measured from arterial blood gas 
analysis), and  
2. A clinician has documented a history of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in the 
medical record (Note that there are many ways to document this: chronic hypercap nic 
respiratory failure, CO2 retainer, chronic hypercapnia, chronic alveolar hypoventilation, 
etc). 
5.2. Efficacy Variables  
The efficacy variables include serum CRP, body temperature, gas exchange/oxygen requirement, 
requirement for ventilation support, ICU adm issions, days of hospitalization, 7 -point ordinal scale 
score (to assess clinical status), and NEWS2 specified in the study endpoints (Section  4.1.1 ), 
survival/mortality status.  
5.3. Safety Variables  
Safety variables include incidence of AESIs, SAEs, and laboratory safety test results (white cell 
count including ANC, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, total bilirubin, ALT, AST).  
5.4. Pharmacokinetic Variables  
The PK variable is the concentration of sarilumab and sIL -6R in serum at each time point specified 
in Table  5.  
5.5. Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker Variabl es 
Exploratory endpoint variables include measurement of SARS -CoV -2 in OP or NP swabs over 
time using RT -PCR. Qualitative (positive or negative) or relative quantitation of viral copies may 
be evaluated. Pharmacodynamic variables may include the time to re ach a negative OP or NP 
RT-PCR result.  
Additional biomarker testing may include, but not be limited to, evaluation of inflammatory 
cytokines in serum, and ANC.  
Pharmacodynamic variables may include the time to nadir (or peak), mean and median change 
from baseline, mean and median percent change from baseline, and area under the curve (AUC) 
of mean change, median for IL -6 and ANC.  
These results may be reported outside the clinical study report (CSR).

CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
This study is  an adaptive Phase 2/3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of sarilumab in hospitalized adults with severe or critical COVID -19. As 
part of the Phase 3 adaptation plan, the Phase 3 portion of the study wi ll include 3 cohorts. In 
Phase  2 and in Cohort 1 of the Phase 3 portion of the  study, patients will be randomized in a 2:2:1 
allocation ratio to sarilumab 400  mg IV, sarilumab  200 mg IV, or placebo  up to 26  Apr 2020. As 
of 27  Apr 2020 (as per recommendatio n of the IDMC), patients in Cohort 1  of the Phase 3 portion 
of the study will be randomized to sarilumab 400 mg or placebo only in the critical stratum in a 
2:1 manner .  Enrollment into Cohort 1 closed  when approximately 170 patients in the critical 
stratu m receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline who were randomized to receive either 
sarilumab 400  mg or placebo were enrolled.  Cohorts 2 and 3 began enrolling patients in parallel 
when Cohort 1 enrollment  completed .  In Cohort  2, patients  being treated with mechanical 
ventilation at baseline  will be randomized  1:1 to receive sarilumab 800  mg IV or placebo ., In 
Cohort  3, patients receiving  high-intensity oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation were 
randomized 1:1 to receive sarilumab 800 mg IV or placebo .  As of 06 Jun 2020, per 
recommendation of the IDMC, new patients will no longer be enrolled into Cohort  3.  Cohort 2 
will continue to enroll .  All patients will continue to be monitored and complete all assessments 
per protocol .  The study will be conducted in the United States in up to 150  sites.  The Sponsor 
may close enrollment into one or more severity categories , strata, or dose arms  at any time to 
ensure adequate numbers of patients are enrolled into other categories or for other  reasons related 
to safety, efficacy, futility, or new external information.  
Randomization  
For Phase 2 and Phase 3 Cohort 1, randomization will be stratified by:  
• Severity of illness at enrollment  
− Severe disease  
− Critical disease  
− Multi -system organ dysfunction  
− Immunocompromised  
• Systemic corticosteroids (Yes/No)  
The severity categories are:  
1. Severe disease  
• Requires supplemental oxygen administration by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or 
other similar oxygen delivery device  
2. Critical disease:  
• Requires supplemental oxygen requiring delivered by non -rebreather mask or 
high-flow nasal cannula, OR

• Multi -system organ dysfunction : use of va sopressors, extracorporeal life support, or 
renal replacement therapy  
4. Immunocompromised  
• Immunocompromised patients (or on immunosuppressant treatments)  
For Cohort 2, only patients as defined in Section  7.2.1 will be enrolled.  Randomization will be 
stratified by  use of a non -IL6/6R therapy under an Emergency Use Authorization  (EUA ) at 
randomization (Yes/No) and use of systemic corticosteroids at randomization (Yes/No).  
Dosing  
Based on the IDMC recommendation, as of 27 Apr 2020, the severe and MSOD groups will no 
longer enroll or receive study drug.  Based on a 2nd IDMC recommendation, as of 06 Jun  2020, 
patients may only receive study drug while receiving mechanical ventilation . Throughout the 
study, study drug should be withheld if there is a high degree of suspicion of active bacterial or 
fungal infection.  Patients who received a prohibited medication will not  be eligible for re -dosing.   
Phase 3 Cohort 1:  
Patients will receive a single dose of study drug on Day 1.  Patients can be re -dosed at 24 hours 
(±6 hours) if the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and meets 1 of the following criteria:

b. Fails to improve gas exchange (eg, as measured by ventilator settings or O2 
requirements) OR  
c. Is hemodynamically unstable OR  
d. Exhibits other objective evidence of clinical worsening (eg, mental status change, etc.)  
Additional doses may be administered weekly as early as Day 8 only for patients receiving  
mechanical ventilation  at the time of re -dosing  whose ANC is >500/mm3 and ALT is ≤5x ULN. If 
a patient received a 2nd dose other than Day 2, adjust subsequent weekly doses accordingly.  A 
maximum of 6 doses can be administered . 
Phase 3 Cohort 2:  
In Cohort 2, a maximum of 4 doses in total can be administered during the study.  The minimum 
dosing interval between any 2 doses is 18 hours.  
Day 1  
Patients will receive a single dose of study drug on Day 1  only if they are receiving mechanical 
ventilation  at the time of dosing .

CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 3 Cohort 3: 
As of 06 Jun 2020, patients in Cohort 3 will no longer be enrolled or continue to receive study 
drug.  
Safety  
To maximize safety, the first approximately 12 patients who are randomized and receive the study 
drug will be monitored for safety (assuming a total of ~10 patients are dosed on the sarilumab 
doses of 200 mg IV or 400  mg IV).  Safety data on these 12 patients will be reviewed by an IDMC 
after the last of these patients dosed reaches Day 7.  Data on the first ~12, ~25, and ~50 patients 
(regardless of severity of illness ) who reach at least Day 7 will be reviewed by the IDMC and 
Regeneron senior physicians to determine if a treatment arm should be discontinued for  safety 
reasons.  Selected treatment groups in the Phase 2 portion may be continued forward in the 
remainder of the study.  In addition to these specific assessment times, the IDMC will actively 
monitor interim data to make recommendations about early stud y closure or changes to study arms 
throughout the course of the study.  
Assessments  
Patients will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged patients will be contacted by 
telephone on Day 29 to assess status and occurrence of re -admission to a hospit al.  Patients will 
undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments while in the hospital.   Baseline 
serum IL -6 and other cytokines will be collected and analyzed in a central laboratory.  Baseline 
IL-6 levels will not be used as inclusion criteria or used for stratification at randomization. 
Oropharyngeal (OP) or NP samples to monitor viral infection and blood samples will be obtained 
on Day  1 (predose), 3, and 29 (or up until the day of discharge if the patient is discharged from the 
hospi tal before Day 29). The study is expected to last up to approximately 1 year, depending on 
the status of the COVID -19 outbreak.

6.1.1.  Study Stopping Rules  
6.1.1.1.  Individual Patient Stopping Rules  
For an individual patient, an inve stigator should assess potential benefit -risk to determine if study 
drug should be interrupted or discontinued for suspected drug -related events of infusion -related 
reactions.  Refer to Section  8.3 for details . 
6.1.1.2.  Study Level Stopping Rules  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will actively monitor interim data to review 
the ongoing safety of patients and can make recommendations about early study closure or changes 
to the conduct of the study. The Sponsor may decide to stop or make adaptations to the study based 
upon the recommendations by the IDMC.  
A treatment arm may be dropped if there is a clinically meaningful imbalance between treatment  
arms in any of the following criteria:  
1. Incidence of SAEs  
2. Incidence of AESIs  
3. Progression of COVID -19 to more severe, critical, or multi -organ dysfunction  
4. Incidence of clinically significant recurrence of severe or critical disease after clinical 
improvemen t 
5. An obvious risk/benefit imbalance based upon any key efficacy endpoint of the study such 
that one dosing arm appears to be doing substantially better than another with an acceptable 
safety profile without requiring any specific statistical level of preci sion

CONFIDENTIAL  6.1.2.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the date the last patient completes the last study assessment (in the 
hospital or via a follow -up phone call if the patient was discharged from the hospital before 
Day 60), withdraws from the stud y, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the study patient can no longer be 
contacted by the investigator).  
6.2. Planned Timing of Analysis  
The first analysis of data is planned for safety and efficacy monitoring when the first approximately 
12 patients are randomized,  receive a study drug, and have at least 7 days of follow -up. Data, 
including deaths, on these first 12 patients as well as all patients enrolled in the study at that time 
regardless of severity of illness will be reviewed by an IDMC and, separately, by un blinded senior 
physicians at Regeneron. Subsequently, separate reviews of data by the IDMC and Regeneron 
senior physicians will occur after the first 25 and first 50  patients regardless of severity of illness 
are enrolled and complete 7 days of follow -up. These analyses will include data, including deaths, 
from all randomized patients. These analyses will be performed to determine if a treatment arm 
should be discontinued for safety reasons.  
An analysis of the Phase 2 data is also planned when approximately  460 patients with all baseline 
IL-6 levels are randomized and treated, after which the Sponsor will make any appropriate updates 
to the Phase 3 study plan.  
Separate database locks for Cohorts 1  and 2 of the Phase 3 portion of the study  are planned.   
Interim analyses may be performed as described Section  11.5.1 . 
IDMC will continue to monitor the safety of patients throughout the study as specified in t he IDMC 
charter.  
A description of the statistical methods to be employed is in Section  11, and blinding implications 
are discussed in Section  8.5. 
6.3. Study Committees  
6.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC will actively monitor interim data to review the ongoing safety of patients and can make 
recommendations about early study clos ure or changes to the protocol. The IDMC members will 
include 2  to 4 physicians with relevant medical specialty training and 1 statistician.  The operation 
of the IDMC is governed by a charter describing further details such as frequency of meeting, 
proced ures (including but not limited to periodic safety monitoring) and requirements for reporting 
its observations to the Sponsor.

A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the inter est of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures). An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the s tudy uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who have taken study drug should be encouraged to remain in the study to allow for the 
collection of information and biological samples for study purposes.  Patients who opt to withdraw 
from the study may be asked to provide a final blood draw sample for PK analysis before

The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs are observed:  
• sustained/severe cough  
• rigors/chills  
• rash, pruritus (itching)  
• urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
• diaphoresis (sweating)  
• hypotension  
• dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
• vomiting  
• flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the 
original rate.  
If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other 
than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the appropriate response 
according to typical clinical practice.  
8.3.1.2.  Termination of the Intravenou s Infusion  
The infusion should be terminated and NOT restarted if any of the following adverse events occur:  
• anaphylaxis*

of the IV infusion  
*Consider anaphylaxis if the following is observed (Sampson, 2006 ): acute onset of an illness 
(minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized 
hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE 
FOLLOWING:  
• Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak

CONFIDENTIAL  8.4. Method of Treatment Assignment  
In the Phase 2 study and Cohort 1 of the Phase 3 study, patients will be randomized in a ratio of 
2:2:1 to receive sarilumab 400 mg IV, or sarilumab 200  mg IV or placebo, in a stratified manner.  
In Phase 3, Cohort  2, patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive sarilumab 800  mg IV 
or placebo IV stratified by the use of systemic corticosteroids and by non-IL6/6R therapy 
administered under an EUA. Random ization will be performed according to a central 
randomization scheme using an interactive web response system (IWRS).   
Phase 2 and Phase 3 Cohort 1 : 
Randomization will be stratified by:  
• Severity of illness at enrollment  
− Severe disease   
− Critical disease  
− Multi -system organ dysfunction  
− Immunocompromised  
• Systemic corticosteroids (Yes/No)  
For Cohort 2, only patients meeting criteria as defined  in Section  7.2.1  will be enrolled.  
Randomization will be stratified by  use of a non -IL6/6R therapy under an EUA at randomization  
(Yes/No) and use of systemic corticosteroids at baseline (Yes/No) .   
While seru m IL -6 and cytokines will be measured at a central laboratory predose on Day  1 and 
periodically after treatment, patients will not be stratified based on serum IL -6 levels. However, 
analyses will be conducted by baseline IL -6 levels.  
For this adaptive Phas e 2/3 study, based on the planned analyses (see Section  6.2), the IDMC and 
Sponsor may decide to drop an arm due to safety reasons.  Accordingly, the randomization may 
be adjusted during the trial.  
8.5. Blinding  
A pharmacist or qualified personnel at the site, not otherwise associated with the conduct of the 
study, will reconstitute the drug for IV administration. The drug infusion solution must be provided 
in identical form for active and placebo treatments, so that they remain indistinguishable to both 
study personnel and patients. Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel 
will remain blinded to all randomization assignments thro ughout the study. The Regeneron 
Medical/Study Director, Study Monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research 
organization (CRO) personnel who are in regular contact with the study site will remain blinded 
to all patient randomization assignments.  
The study team directly involved with the study conduct will be blinded.  Selected individuals not 
involved in the conduct of the study may have access to unblinded data as needed for safety review 
or other data review.  An independent team at Regeneron, in cluding senior 
physicians/management, will be unblinded and in communication with the IDMC and will make 
decisions for adaptations to the study during the Phase 2 portion of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Blinding of CRP Assessment Results  
The study patients and select Regene ron study team members directly involved in the conduct of 
the study will remain blinded to post -treatment CRP values.  
8.6. Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding  of treatment assignment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event and when a treatment decision is contingent on knowing the 
patient's treatment assignment. Study drug will be discontinued for patient s whose treatment has 
been unblinded (Section  8.2.2 ).  
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind  the treatment assignment.  
− Only the affected patients will be unblinded.  
− The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator. If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site  will unblind the patient. Unblinding is performed using the 
IWRS which will notify Regeneron.   
− The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the patient  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site pers onnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency and when a treatment decision is contingent on knowing the patient's treatment 
assignment.  In the event  that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling that 
role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
8.7. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
8.7.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Sarilumab for injection, 175 mg/mL will be  provided as open -label supplies packaged in boxes. 
Each box will contain 1 prefilled syringe or vial. Each box will be labeled with a 1 -panel, open 
label printed in black. The product identity and strength, container number, directions for use, 
route of a dministration and storage conditions will be indicated.  
Open -label study drug will display the product lot number on the label.  
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manu al. 
8.7.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study. At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring vi sits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by the site monitor, all opened and unopened study drug will be destroyed/returned to the sponsor 
or designee.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.7.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current.  
The investigator must be able to account for all opened and unopened study drug. These records 
should contain the dates, quantity, and study medication  
• dispensed to each patient  
• disposed of at the site or returned to the sponsor or de signee.  
All accountability records must be made available for inspection by the sponsor and regulatory 
agency inspectors; photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion of the study.  
8.7.4.  Treatment Compliance  
All drug compliance records must be k ept current and made available for inspection by the sponsor 
and regulatory agency inspectors.  
8.8. Concomitant Medications  
Any treatment administered from the first dose of study drug  to the final study assessment will be 
considered concomitant medication. Th is includes medications that were started before the study 
and are ongoing during the study.  
If the local standard of care per written policies or guidelines includes lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) 
or other agents, then continuing these during the study is permitted.  
CYP Substrates  
Interleukin -6 has been shown to reduce cytochrome (CY)P1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and 
CYP3A4 enzyme expression in in vitro studies. Therefore, it is expected that for a molecule that 
antagonizes cytokine activity, such as sarilumab, the formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 
enzymes could be normalized, and as a result drugs that are metabolized by these CYP450 isoforms 
may have decreased levels when patients start receiving sarilumab. As a precautionary measure, 
drugs which are metabo lized via these cytochromes and with a narrow therapeutic index should 
be closely monitored and adjusted if needed. Some examples of CYP450 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic index requiring monitoring of effect are warfarin; examples of substrates that require 
monitoring of drug concentration include, but are not limited to, the following: warfarin, CsA, 
theophylline, digoxin, antiepileptics, such as carbamazepine (Carbatrol®, Tegretol®), divalproex 
(Depakote®), phenytoin (Dilantin®), or valproic acid (D epakene®); or antiarrhythmics, such as 
disopyramide (Norpace®), procainamide (Procan®, Pronestyl®), or quinidine (Quinidex®, Quin 
Release Quin - G®).  
Concomitant medications in a hospitalized population change daily and are difficult to collect and 
attribut e to success and failure of therapy and impact on safety. Therefore, only select concomitant 
medications will be captured in this trial. The select list of medications will be assessed Day 1 to 
Day 29 (or until day of discharge from hospital if before Day 29) include corticosteroids, 
remdesivir, lopinavir -ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta, and 
convalescent serum. Refer to Section  9.2.3.4  for a complete list of concomitant medications that 
should be collected.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
Patients who are withdrawn from the study before the primary endpoint assessment (Day 29) may 
be asked to provide a final blood draw sample for PK analysis before withdrawing from the  study 
(Table  5) and to allow for re -contact at the end of the trial (Day 60 follow -up phone call) in order 
to collect data on survival and history of hospital re -admission.  
9.2. Study Procedures   
9.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline characteristics of the study popul ation: demographics, medical 
history, timing of COVID -19 infection, prior therapy, pregnancy status.  
The investigator or sub -investigator will verify that the patient tests positive for SARS -CoV -19 
RT-PCR and record the result, specimen type, date of test, and the type of assay in the eCRF.  
9.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
9.2.2.1.  C-Reactive Protein  
Serum CRP will be measure d at each site’s local laboratory according to the schedule in Table  5.  
See Section  9.2.3.5  for details.   
9.2.2.2.  Body Temperature  
Body temperature measurement will occur before taking antipyretics  or more than 4  hours after 
last dose of antipyretics.  Body temperature will be measured to monitor the patient’s status 
regarding fever per the schedule in Table  5. Temperature may be measured using the following 
methods: axilla, oral, rectal, tympanic, or temporal according to local hospital protocols and 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use of the device. Body temperature should be 
measured using the same method each time. Temperature should be measured after at least 
5 minutes of rest (supine or sitting).  
9.2.2.3.  Oxygen Administration and Oxygenation  
Supplemental oxygen/FiO 2 use will be measured to monitor the patient’s status regarding gas 
exchange per the schedule in Table  5. As applicable, the following will be recorded:  
• Oxygen delivery device (eg, nasal cannula, simple face mask, non -rebreather mask, 
high flow nasal cannula, non -invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, 
extracorporeal life support, etc)  
• Oxygen flow rate in Liters/min (if receiving nasal cannula, simple face mask, 
non-rebreather mask)  
• FiO 2 (if receiving high  flow nasal cannula, non -invasive ventilation, invasive 
mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal life support)  
If a patient is using more than one device (eg, extracorporeal life support and invasive ventilation), 
information from both devices will be rec orded separately.

CONFIDENTIAL  Resting SpO 2 will be measured to assess arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation. SpO 2 will be measured 
using a fingertip or similar non -invasive device following 5 minutes of rest (inactivity) while 
supine, semi -recumbent, or sitting and will only be measured in the presence of a good SpO2 wave 
form. SpO 2 must be measured simultaneously with recorded supplemental oxygen/FiO2 data.  
Additional data to be collected include (when available from the medical record): arterial pH, 
partial pressures of  oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial 
blood (PaCO 2), oxyhemoglobin saturation in arterial blood from arterial blood gas analysis (SaO 2).  
9.2.2.4.  Clinical Status Assessment (7 -Point Ordinal Scale)  
Cohort 1 : A Clinical Sta tus Assessment  (7 -point ordinal scale) (Peterson, 2017 ) should be 
assessed in the morning to consider the worst assessments for the previous day (ie,  midnight to 
midnight; 00:00 – 00:00 [24 -hour clock]). If it is the first assessment and 24 hours  of data are not 
available, report status at randomization.  
Cohort 2:   
• Ordinal Scale will be assessed (1) at the time of randomization and must match the 
stratum assigned by the investigator in the IRT, and (2) at the time of the administration 
of the fir st dose of study drug (which should be administered on Day 1 in most cases) . 
Oxygen delivery device data may be used to calculate the ordinal scale.   
• Beginning on Day 3, the Ordinal Scale should be assessed in the morning to consider 
the worst assessments  for the previous day (ie,  midnight to midnight; 00:00 – 00:00 
[24-hour clock]). Therefore, the Day 3 assessment will reflect the patient’s clinical 
status on Day 2 . 
The 7 -point ordinal scale is:  
• Death;  
• Hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilati on or ECMO;  
• Hospitalized, requiring non -invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices;  
• Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen;  
• Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – requiring ongoing medical care 
(COVID -19 related or otherwise)  
• Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – no longer requires ongoing medical 
care 
• Not hospitalized  
9.2.2.5.  NEWS2 S coring System  
The NEWS2 scoring system ( Table  6) is a composite score derived from respiratory rate (per 
minute), SpO 2 Scale 1 (%) or SpO 2 Scale 2 (%), Use of air or oxygen (?), Systolic blood pressure 
(mm  Hg), Pulse (per minute), Consciousness, and Temperature (°C). 
The NEWS2 score will be asse ssed daily in the morning.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 85 
CONFIDENTIAL  Table  6: The NEWS2 Scoring System  
 
As part of the NEWS2 score , the patient’s mental status (ACVPU) will be assessed and categorized 
into one of the following categories:  
• Alert:  A fully awake patient with spontaneous opening of the eyes, response to voice, 
and has motor function.  
• Confusion:  A patient may be alert but confused or disorientated.  It is not always 
possible to determine whether the confusion is ‘new’ when a patient presents acutely 
ill.  Such a presentation should always be considered to be ‘new’ until confirmed to be 
otherwise. New -onset or worsening confusion, delirium or any other altered mentation 
should always prompt concern about potentially serious underlying causes and 
warrants urgent clinical evaluation.  
• Voice : The patient makes some kind of response when you talk to them, which could 
be in any of the three component measures of eyes, voice or motor – eg patient’s eyes 
open on being asked ‘Are you okay?’. The  response could be as little as a grunt, moan, 
or slight movement of a limb when prompted by voice.  
• Pain : The patient makes a response to a pain stimulus. A patient who is not alert and 
who has not responded to voice (hence having the test performed on th em) is likely to 
exhibit only withdrawal from pain, or even involuntary flexion or extension of the 
limbs from the pain stimulus. The person undertaking the assessment should always 
exercise care and be suitably trained when using a pain stimulus as a meth od of 
assessing levels of consciousness.  
• Unresponsive : This is also commonly referred to as ‘unconscious’. This outcome is 
recorded if the patient does not give any eye, voice or motor response to voice or pain.

9.2.3.5.  Laboratory Testing  
Serum CRP will be measured at each site’s local laboratory according to the schedule in Table  5.  
All patients should have white blood cell count, platelet count, AST, and ALT measured prior to 
randomization (see Section  7.2.2 ). If these laboratory tests were not performed as part of the 
patient’s clinical care, they may be performed as study procedures in the site’s local laboratory.  
After randomization,  when patients enrolled in this study undergo laboratory testing as part of their 
standard -of-care, the results of these tests will be provided to the Sponsor, as indicated.  
Certain tests that are not necessarily part of the patient’s standard -of-care wil l also be collected as 
part of this study, as indicated.  
Laboratory test results that may be recorded are Table  5. Tests may include:  
Blood Chemistry  
All patients should have a hepatic function panel, serum ferritin, and serum LDH at baseline prior 
to administering study drug. The results of blood chemistry testing that is performed as part of the 
patient’s standard -of-care will be shared with the Sponso r. These samples will be analyzed by a 
local laboratory.  LFTs and creatinine are required prior to randomization (standard of care labs 
may be used). After Day 1, LFTs and creatinine will not be performed as a study procedure. When

Screening : 
Patients eligible for study participation will have tested positive for SARS -CoV -19 RT -PCR. This 
test will be performed as part of standard -of-care and the results will be provided to the Sponsor.  
Safety : 
Pregnancy testing will be performed using urine or  serum samples at screening in women of 
childbearing potential. A positive pregnancy test is not exclusionary for study participation but 
will be recorded.  
Culture results (bacterial, fungal, or viral) including specimen source (BAL, tracheal aspirate, 
sputum, blood, urine, etc) performed as part of patients’ workup for new infection should be 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Phase 2 and Phase 3 Cohort 1 :  Surveillance bacterial and fungal blood cultures: Blood samples 
will be collected on Day 7 and Day 15 for blo od cultures. If the patient is discharged before Day  15, 
blood cultures will be collected on the day of discharge.     
Phase 3 Cohort 2 : surveillance blood cultures for bacteria and fungi should be performed weekly 
for patients who have had a sustained ANC <1000/µL for >48 hours post -randomization . 
Biomarkers/Research Samples : 
Serum samples will be collected to measure cytokines and biomark ers such as IL -6, soluble IL -6R 
and will be analyzed by a central laboratory.  
Nasopharyngeal (NP)/oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be used to collect secretions from patients 
to determine presence or absence of SARS -CoV -2 virus and to explore relative quanti tation of 
viral load as an exploratory measure. In addition to RT -PCR to quantify viral load, viral sequencing 
may be performed if sufficient sample is available to determine the sequence and variations.

CONFIDENTIAL  10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
The investigator must promptly record all serious clinical events and AESIs occurring during the 
study data collection , from the tim e of signing the ICF to the end of study . Medical conditions that 
existed or were diagnosed prior to the signing of the Informed Consent will be recorded as part of 
medical history. Abnormal laboratory values and vital signs observed at the time of Informe d 
Consent should also be recorded as medical history.  
Throughout the study, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by 
evaluating the patient. Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the 
patient, or by ques tioning the patient at each study visit.  Patients should be questioned in a general 
way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms. The Investigator must assess 
all AEs to determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance wi th the definitions in 
Section  10.2. The Investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source 
documentation with the Investigator’s signature. The Investigator should follow up on SAEs (and 
AESIs) until the y have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should be followed until 
they are resolved or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term. When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or s ymptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest 
a common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE.   
Laborator y results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
Investigator to determine their clinical significance.   
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the s erious adverse event (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization).  A procedure is not 
an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE. Pre -planned (prior to 
signing the Informed Consent Form) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospita lization for 
pre-existing conditions that do not worsen in severity, and admission for palliative or social care 
should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.2 for Definitions).  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.   
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (end of study) that the Investigator 
assesses as related to study drug s hould also be reported.  
All serious adverse events (SAEs), AESIs, and pregnancy reports are to be reported according to 
the procedures in Section  10.1.3 .

CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All SAEs and AESIs (serious and non -serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of 
the event’s seriousness, severity, and causality to the blinded study drug.  A detailed narrative 
summarizing the course of the eve nt, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be 
provided on the AE CRF. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution 
should be included, when available. Medical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data 
that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative.  For fatal events, the 
narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed and include the results if 
available. Information not available at the time of the initial r eport must be documented in a 
follow -up report. Source documents  (including hospital or medical re cords, diagnostic reports, etc ) 
will be summarized in the narrative on the AE CRF and retained at the  study center and available 
upon request.  
Urgent safety q ueries must be followed up and addressed promptly. Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
• SAEs . 
• Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI; serious and nonserious) : Adverse events 
of special interest for this study include  the following:  
− Grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions  
− Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions  
− Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <500/mm3) 
− Grade 4 neutropenia with concurrent invasive infection (ANC <500/mm3) 
− Invasive bacterial or fungal infections of clinical significance with confirmed 
diagnosis based on the investigator’s assessment with appropriate diagnostic 
workups and consultations  
− Increase in alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥3X 
ULN (for patients with normal baseline) or >3X  ULN AND at least 2 -fold increase 
from baseline value (for patients with abnormal baseline)  
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility

CONFIDENTIAL  10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not ha ve a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered relat ed to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all death s, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does  not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient re -hospitalization  (readmission after discharge) or prolongation 
of existing hospitalization . In-patient hospitalization is defined as a hospital 
re-admission (any duration) or an emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours. 
Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than 
was originally anticipated for the event or is prolonged due to the development of a 
new AE as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medi cal event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment  in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Eve nts of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
interest specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate.  Such an event might warrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.

the telephone, managing money, etc.  
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and 
not bedridden.  
10.2.6.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as whether or not there is a  reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical 
judgment, and the following definitions.  The causality assessment must  be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new inform ation becomes available.  
For double blinded studies using an active comparator, the investigator should consider all study 
drugs in determining event causality.   
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship: t ime to onset versus time drug was administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate versus long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug and same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concur rent illnesses  
• Response to dechallenge (drug discontinuation) or dose reduction  
• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase, when applicable  
• Patient’s medical and social history

CONFIDENTIAL  11. STA TISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plans (SAPs) for the study.  There will 
be 2 separate SAPs for this study; one will be for Phase 2 and second for Phase 3. The SAPs will 
be revised prior to the end of each portion of the study (Phase 2 or Phase 3) to accommodate 
amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in 
study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAPs will be issued before 
the first da tabase lock in each portion of the study (Phase 2 or Phase  3). 
Endpoints are listed in Section  4. Analysis variables are listed in Section  5. 
This adaptive Phase 2/3 study is intended to allow for adaptations such as follows: dropping of a 
treatment group for safety reasons; confirmation or modification of the endpoints for Phase 3; and 
sample size re -estimation in Phase 3.  Therefore, treatment groups in Phase 3 and analyses for 
Phase 3 portion will depend on the final endpoints and treatment groups selected based on Phase  2 
results.   
The P hase 3 portion will be powered and analyzed independently of the Phase 2 portion, in order 
to ensure that the Phase 3 portion is confirmatory and to avoid inflating the Type I error rate of the 
Phase 3 portion of the study.  
As mentioned in Section  3.2.2 , the adaptations to the Phase 3 cohorts include: 1) dropping of the 
sarilumab 200 -mg dose group, 2) modification of the Phase 3 endpoints, 3) addition o f Cohort s 2 
and 3, ie, new cohort s of patients randomized to sarilumab 800 mg or placebo, and 4)  justification 
of sample size for Cohort 1 and establishing sample size s for Cohort s 2 and 3 .  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
Phase 2 Portion of the Study  
For the Phase  2 portion of the study, the hypothesis to be tested is the superiority of sarilumab 
versus placebo with respect to the primary endpoint of percent change from baseline in CRP levels 
at Day 4 (Section  4.1.1  and Section  11.4.3.1 ). 
The statistical hypotheses (null H0 vs. alternative H1) for the primary endpoint are:  
𝐻0: 𝜇1=𝜇2     versus    𝐻1: 𝜇1≠𝜇2 
where μ 1 and μ 2 are mean percent changes from baseline in CRP -levels at Day 4 (based on natural 
logarithm scale) in the 2 treatment groups.  
The statistical hypotheses (null H0 vs. alternative H1) for the Phase 2 key secondary efficacy 
endpoint of time -to-improvement (2 points) in clinical status from baseline using th e 7-point 
ordinal scale, time -to-resolution of fever and time -to-improvement in oxygenation (Section  4.1.2 ) 
are stated below.  
𝐻0: 𝑆1(𝑡)=𝑆2(𝑡) for all time 𝑡     versus    𝐻1: 𝑆1(𝑡)≠𝑆2(𝑡) for some time 𝑡  
where S1 (t) and S2 (t) are the survival probability functions of the above endpoints.

CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 3 Portion of the Study ( Prior to Adaptation)  
For the Phase 3 portion, the study is intended to allow for adaptation of the primary endpoint based 
on results from the Phase 2 data, ie, confirmation or modification of the primary endpoint. Hence 
the fi nal endpoint may be different.  The currently specified primary endpoint for Phase 3 is 
time-to-improvement (2 points) in clinical status from baseline on the 7 -point ordinal scale 
(Section  4.1.1 ).  The statistical hypotheses for this endpoint  are the same as stated  above for 
Phase  2 time -to-event endpoint . 
Phase 3 Portion of the Study ( Post-Adaptations)  
Based on the adaptations to the Phase 3 study design, the null hypotheses to be tested (separately)  
in each of the 3 Phase 3 Cohorts corresponding to the final primary endpoint are:  
Cohort 1  
H10:  Sarilumab 400 mg IV is not different than  placebo in terms of proportion of patients with at 
least a 1-point improvement in clinical status from baseline to Day 22 using the 7 -point ordinal 
scale in patients with critical COVID -19 receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline.  
Cohort 2  
H20:  Sarilumab 800 mg IV is not different than  placebo in terms of proportion of patients with at 
least a 1-point improvement in clinical status from baseline to Day 22 using the 7 -point ordinal 
scale in patients with COVID -19 receiving  mechanical ventilation  at baseline .   
 
The stat istical hypotheses (null H0 vs. alternative H1) for each of these can be stated as:  
𝐻10: 𝑝1(1)=𝑝0(1)     versus    𝐻11: 𝑝1(1)≠𝑝0(1) 
𝐻20: 𝑝1(2)=𝑝0(2)    versus    𝐻21: 𝑝1(2)≠𝑝0(2) 
where 𝑝1(1)(𝑝1(2)) and 𝑝0(1)(𝑝0(2)) are the proportions of responders in the sarilumab and placebo  
treatment groups   within Cohort s 1 and 2, respectively .

CONFIDENTIAL  11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
For the Phase 2 portion of the study, approximately 200 patients (80 in each of the 2  sarilumab 
dose groups  and 40 on placebo) are required in all disease severity strata with high baseline IL -6 
levels  to test for superiority of sarilumab versus placebo with respect to percent change from 
baseline CRP levels at Day 4.  This sample size will provide 90% power using a 2 -sample t -test to 
detect an effect size (ie, difference/SD) of 0.633 at the 0.05 (2 -sided) significance level.  The effect 
size of 0.633 assumes that the mean treatment difference in percent change from baseline using 
natural logarithm of CRP levels (sarilumab minus placebo) would be -6.6% with a standard 
deviation of 10.43% (percent change from baseline in sarilumab is estimated to be mean = -45.98% 
and SD=10.43% based on tocilizumab data from China study in COVID -19; See Figure 2 in 
(Xu, 2020 ).  If the effect in the placebo group is assumed to be negligible (~0%) and variability in 
CRP is high, then the power could be much greater than 90% for larger effect sizes (eg,  treatment 
difference = -50% and SD = 30%, effect size = 1.667).  Total sample size for Phase 2 is expected 
to be larger than 200 to include pat ients with all baseline IL -6 levels.  
Additional patients are being included in Phase 2 to allow for adequate estimation and improve 
precision of the treatment effect using the Phase 3 clinical endpoint —time to improvement 
(2 points) in clinical status (7 -point ordinal scale) —prior to making adaptations to Phase 3 study 
design.  The total sample size for Phase 2 is updated to be approximately 460 patients, to include 
patients with all baseline IL -6 levels.  
Phase 3 Portion of the Study ( Prior to Adaptations)  
Sample size calculations for the Phase 3 portion of the study prior to adaptations were based on 
the Phase 3 primary endpoint of time -to-improvement (2 points) in clinical status from baseline on 
the 7 -point ordinal scale, using the log -rank test of super iority.  Median time -to-improvement 
(2 points) in clinical status was assumed to follow an exponential survival distribution with 
difference between sarilumab and placebo median times assumed to be 2 days (5  days in placebo 
and 3 days in sarilumab group).  
With a 2:2:1 randomization ratio (sarilumab 400 mg IV:sarilumab 200 mg IV:placebo) and 
assuming that accrual duration is 1 year (~365 days) with each patient followed for a period of at 
least 29 days, the Phase 3 portion of the study would require a total of approximately 300 patients 
in the severe and critical strata with high baseline IL -6. For a pairwise comparison between each 
sarilumab dose (400 mg IV or 200 mg IV) and placebo using a log -rank test, a sample size of 
approximately 123 on sarilumab and 6 1 on placebo (184  total) will provide 90% power at a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05.  
This study plans to enroll approximately 400 patients in Phase 3 Cohort 1  (across all IL -6 levels 
and severity of illness) in order to have 300 patients in the severe and critical strata to test the 
primary hypothesis in high IL -6 patients.  The number of patients enrolled may be revised based 
on the observed distribution of baseline IL -6 levels in Phase 2.   
Due to the novel nature of the COVID -19 pandemic, the ordinal  scale primary efficacy endpoint 
planned in Phase 3 is not well established and will require confirmation based on Phase 2 data. At 
the end of the Phase 2 portion, power calculations will be reassessed, and Phase 3 sample size may 
be re -estimated.

CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 3 Portion of the Study ( Post-Adaptations)  
Sample size calculations for the Phase 3 portion of the study after the adaptations are based on the 
Phase 3 primary endpoint of the percentage of patients who were on mechanical ventilation at 
baseline and h ad at least a 1-point improvement in the ordinal scale (ie, alive and off of ventilation). 
In Cohort 1, t he hypothesis is tested only in patients in the critical stratum , first in the subgroup of 
patients on mechanical ventilation at baseline and then, as an enrichment strategy, in the overall 
critical stratum (ITT) .  In the Phase 2 portion of the study, approximately 17% of patients treated 
with placebo (ie, standard of care) and 57% of patients treated with sarilumab (on top of standard 
of care) achieved at least 1-point improvement by Day  22. 
Cohort 1 : With a 2:1 randomization ratio (sarilumab 400 mg IV: placebo), an effect size the same 
as that observed in Phase 2, and 170 patients in the critical stratum on mechanical ventilation, then 
the pairwise comp arison between sarilumab 400 mg (n ~113 ) and placebo (n ~57) would have 
>99% power. Assuming the response  rate on placebo is 17% and the rate on sarilumab 400 mg is 
37% (ie,  a difference in proportions is one -half that observed in Phase 2), then the sample s ize of 
170 would provide approximately 80% power to detect this reduced difference.  These calculations 
assume alpha=0.045, allowing for an interim analysis at the 0.005 level (see Section  11.5.1 .  
Therefore, t his study plans to enroll approximately 450 critical patients in order to have 
approximately 170 patients within the critical stratum who are on mechanical ventilation  and 
randomized to 400  mg or placebo .  Note that the total number of patients enrolled in Phase 3 
Cohort 1 is larger than that to account for  the patients who had been  randomized to the severe 
stratum, MSOD stratum, or to the 200 -mg dose group  before the I DMC decision to discontinue 
further enrollment into those strata and dose groups . 
Cohort 2 : With a 1:1 randomization ratio (sarilumab 800 mg IV: placebo), an effect size the same 
as that observed in Phase 2 for 400 mg, and 225 patients total, then the pair wise comparison 
between sarilumab 800 mg (n= 113) and placebo (n= 112) would have >99% power to detect the 
difference observed in Phase 2 , and would have 92% power if the effect were half of that observed 
in Phase 2 ( ie, 20% difference) .  These calculations assume alpha=0.045, allowing for an interim 
analysis at the 0.005 level.  A sample size re -estimation may occur after Phase 3 Cohort  1 results 
are determined.   
11.3. Analysis Sets  
11.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
ITT population :  The intention -to-treat (ITT) population i ncludes all randomized patients who 
received at least one dose of the study drug.  Analysis of the ITT population will be done according 
to the initial treatment assigned to the patient (as randomized). ITT population will be used for 
sensitivity analysis of the efficacy endpoints in Phase 2, as well as for analysis of data including 
(but not limited to) demographics and baseline characteristics.  ITT population will be the primary 
analysis population for the Phase 3 Cohort s 1 and 2.  For Cohort 1, the spec ific primary population 
will be the subset  of patients  on mechanical ventilation at baseline.

11.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
The study analysis plan is based on the analysis of 2  populations, an mITT and an ITT population, 
within sp ecific strata or combinations of strata.  Supportive analyses may also be performed using 
the PPS population.  
11.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Phase 2 portion of study (COVID -19 patients in all disease severity strata):  
For the Phase 2 portion of the study, the p rimary efficacy analysis will be a pairwise comparison 
between sarilumab 400 mg IV and placebo with respect to the primary endpoint of percent change 
from baseline in CRP levels (natural logarithm scale) at Day 4.   
Percent change from baseline in CRP leve ls is estimated using the natural log -transformed data.  
Missing values of CRP levels at Day 4 will be imputed by Day 3 or Day 5 levels when available, 
in this order of priority. CRP levels measured by local labs will be used to compute the primary 
endpoin t.  If local lab data is missing, then data from central labs will be used.  Sensitivity analysis 
will be conducted using the CRP data from central labs.  Additional details on missing data 
handling will be specified in the SAP.  
Hypothesis test of superior ity of sarilumab versus placebo will be done using an ANCOVA model 
with change from baseline in CRP at Day 4 as dependent variable; treatment group, severity of 
illness and systemic corticosteroid use as fixed effects, and ln(Baseline CRP) as covariate.  
Estimation of treatment effect will be provided in terms of percent change from baseline in CRP 
levels at Day 4 along with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals.  P -values will be compared to the 
2-sided 5% significance level.  
To determine the success of the Ph ase 2 portion of the trial, first the data in patients with high 
baseline IL -6 will be analyzed (mITT).  If the treatment difference is statistically significant, 
similar analysis will be done between sarilumab 400 mg IV and placebo on the data for the ful l 
Phase 2 ITT population (that is, without regard to baseline IL -6 levels).  In addition, the key 
secondary endpoint, time to improvement (2 points) in clinical status from baseline on the 7 -point 
ordinal scale, will also be analyzed as below using Phase 2  data. These analyses will be used to

CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 3 portion of the study (COVID -19 patients in Cohort 1 critic al disease severity 
stratum ; and COVID -19 patients in Cohort  2): 
Post adaptations to the Phase 3 study design, the primary efficacy analyses will be 2 separate 
pairwise comparisons, namely:  
1. One in Cohort 1 critical patients with mechanical ventilation at baseline comparing 
sarilumab 400 mg IV versus placebo, and  
2. Second in Cohort 2 patients receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline comparing 
sarilumab 800 mg IV versus placebo.  
 
Primary endpoint for each comparison will be proportion of patients with a 1 -point improvement 
in clinical status from baseline to Day 22 using the 7 -point ordinal scale.  Hypothesis tests of 
superiority of sarilumab (400 mg or 800 mg -dose) versus placebo will be done using the stratified  
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  (CMH) test for 2 proportions .  For Cohort 1, the stratification factor 
will be use of corticosteroids (yes/no). For Cohort 2, the stratification factor s will be use of non-
IL-6/6R therapies administered under an EUA at baseline  (yes/no)  and use of corticosteroids  
(yes/no).   
Estimation of the treatment effect will be provided as differences in proportions and confidence 
intervals calculated using the strata -adjusted confidence intervals from CMH method  
(Zhang,  2016 ). Stratification factors are  as mentioned above.  
For each cohort, p -values and confidence intervals will be reported with overall Type 1 error 
controlled at 0.05 (2 -sided).  
11.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Analysis for Phase 2 Key Secondary Endpoints : 
The key secondary endpoint of time-to-improvement (2 points) in clinical status assessment with 
7-point ordinal scale will be analyzed for Phase 2 similarly as described above for the Phase 3 
primary endpoint in COVID -19 patients (all disease severity strata) with high baseline IL -6 
(ie, mITT) as well as in the ITT population of all baseline IL -6 levels.  
Testing of the key secondary endpoint for the Phase 2 portion of the study will be done at the 
significance level of 0.05 (2 -sided).  P -values for other secondary endpoints will also be  reported 
and compared with 0.05 (2 -sided) significance level for descriptive purpose.  
Analysis for Phase 3 Key Secondary Endpoints:  
The following key secondary endpoints in Phase 3 will be tested similarly as the Phase 3 primary 
endpoint described in Sect ion 11.4.3.1 .  See Table  4 for details for second ary endpoints.   
Cohort 1  
1. Proportion of patients with at least 1 -point improvement in clinical status assessment from 
baseline to Day 22 in patients with critical COVID -19

ventilation at baseline  
2. Proportion of patients who die through Day 29 in patients with COVID -19 receiving 
mechanical ventilation at baseline  
Key secondary endpoints for the Phase 3 portion of the study will be test ed sequentially in a 
hierarchical manner, while preserving the overall significance level at 0.05 (2 -sided).  
Analysis for Other Secondary Endpoints (Phase 2 and Phase 3):  
1. Differences in time -to-event endpoints by treatment (eg, time to a one category 
improvement in ordinal scale, and other  time-to-event endpoints) will be summarized with 
Kaplan -Meier estimates and 95% confidence intervals  on medians will be reported . P-
values and confidence intervals for hazard ratios comparing treatment groups will also be 
reported using Cox proportional h azards model with stratification factors mentioned 
earlier.  Cumulative incidence rates will be plotted with comparisons between groups 
descriptively tested using log -rank test . 
2. Change in ordinal scale at specific time points will be summarized by proporti ons 
(eg, proportion who have a 1 -, 2-, 3-, or 4 -point improvement or 1 -, 2-, 3-, 4-point 
worsening).  
3. Duration of event (eg, duration of mechanical ventilation , ventilator -free days, days of 
hospitalization ) will be summarized through descriptive statistics  including mean, standard 
deviation, and median days with quartiles.   P-values using 2-sample t -test and 95% 
confidence intervals using normal approximation will also be reported.  
4. Continuous endpoints and their changes from baseline will be summarized thro ugh 
descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, median and quartiles, and 95% 
confidence intervals of means, as needed.  
5. Categorical data (eg, 28 -day mortality or ordinal scale by day) will be summarized 
according to proportions with confiden ce intervals on the difference or odds ratios for a 
binary or multiple category scale, respectively.  
Missing data procedures will be described in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.4.4.  Control of Multiplicity  
Phase 2 Portion of the Study (Prior to Adaptations ) 
For the Phase 2 portion of the study, hypothesis test will be conducted for the Phase 2 primary 
endpoint of percent change from baseline in CRP levels at Day 4 in patients across all disease 
severity strata in mITT population (ie, high baseline IL -6).  If there is substantial overlap between 
mITT (eg, ≥95%, then ITT will be the primary population ).  Otherwise, ITT population will be 
tested sequentially.   
The key secondary endpoint of time -to-improvement (≥2 points) in clinical status assessment will 
only b e descriptively analyzed in Phase 2.  P -values will be reported for descriptive purpose.   
Overall Type 1 error will be controlled at 0.05 level (2 -sided) in Phase 2.  
Based on Phase 2 results, adaptations may be made to Phase 3, such as to change Phase 3 e ndpoints 
and re -estimate the size of the Phase 3 portion of the study.  The final Phase 3 analyses will be 
independent from Phase 2 and possess an independent 5% significance level.  
Phase 3 Portion of the Study (Post-adaptations):  
Primary analyses in Coho rts 1 and 2 will be conducted separately.  Overall type  1 error will be 
controlled within each cohort  at 0.05 (2 -sided) level.   
Multiplicity adjustment will be made for interim looks and significance level will be adjusted for 
final analysis of the primar y endpoint within each cohort.  Overall type 1 error for testing primary 
and key secondary endpoints within each cohort will be controlled using a hierarchical testing 
order as shown in Table  8.

Definitions  
For safety variables, the following observation period is defined:  
• The on -treatment period is defined as the day from first dose of study drug (Day 1) to 
study Day 29 ( patients who are discharged prior to  Day 29 will receive a follow -up 
phone call to collect data on SAEs (if any), survival and history of hospital re -
admission) . 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those that are not present at baseline 
or represent the exacerbation of a  pre-existing condition during the on -treatment period. In this 
study, only SAEs and AESIs are collected.  As such TEAEs will reflect this data.  
In addition, there will be an end of study (EOS) phone call follow -up to collect data on survival 
and history o f hospital re -admission.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.5.1.  Interim Analysis in Phase 3  
Because  of the unmet medical need for effective medicines in this global COVID -19 pandemic 
situation, interim analyses are planned for efficacy in the Phase 3 port ion of the study.  The timing 
of the first interim analysis will be determined once approximately  110 patients in the Phase 3 
Cohort 1 critical stratum receiving  mechanical ventilation at baseline and randomized to 400 mg 
or placebo are enrolled, with a da ta lock point 22 days later.  Interim analysis for this data lock 
will be conducted in all critical  Phase 3 Cohort 1  patients who were enrolled until the first dose 
date of the last 110th patient in Cohort 1 critical stratum randomized to sarilumab 400  mg or 
placebo who was on a ventilator at baseline.  
To preserve the overall Type  1 error at 0.05 in the Phase 3 Cohort 1, the  primary efficacy endpoint 
will be tested at interim analysis at the 0.005 level (2 -sided), leaving the remaining significance 
level  of 0. 049 (2-sided) for the final analysis should the interim results not be statistically 
significant.  The information fraction at this first interim analysis will be 65% (ie, 110 patients out 
of 170 at final).  Under the Hwang -Shih-DeCani alpha spending  function (Hwang, Shih, DeCani, 
1990, Anderson 2020  [gsDesign R package] ) (assume gamma family with parameter γ = -6.5), if 
the interim analysis is not significant, then the nominal significance level for testing the final 
analysis of primary endpoint will  be 0.049 (2 -sided).  
Should the interim analysis be positive, the alpha from the interim analysis will be recycled  and 
added to the alpha for the planned key secondary endpoints which will allow them to be tested at 
a significance level of 0.05.  Similar i nterim analyses are planned  for the Phase 3 Cohort 2 and 
will be specified in the SAP in more  detail.  
11.6. Statistical Considerations Surrounding the Premature Termination 
of a Study  
If the study is terminated prematurely, only those parameters required for the  development 
program and/or reporting to regulatory authorities will be summarized. Investigator and sponsor 
responsibilities surrounding the premature termination of a study are presented in Section  15.1.

13.1. Good Clinical Practice Statement  
It is the responsibility of both the sponsor and the investigator(s) to ensure that this clinical study 
will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declar ation 
of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
13.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewe d and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB. A copy of the IRB -approved ICF and documentation of 
approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the inv estigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient prior to his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to t he patient in 
language that he/she can understand.  The ICF should be signed and dated by the patient and by 
the investigator or authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the patient.   
• Patients who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to t hem before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read 
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed consent was given.  
The origina l ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, or if there 
are significan t changes to the study procedures, the ICF must be reviewed and updated 
appropriately. All study patients  must be informed of the new information and provide their written 
consent if they wish to continue in the study. The original signed revised ICF must be maintained 
in the patient’s  study record and a copy must be given to the patient . 
13.3. Patients Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient  will be maintained. Patients  should be identified by a patient  identification number only, 
on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor. Documents that will not be submitted to 
the sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.  
The patient’s and investigator’ s personal data, which may be included in the sponsor database, will 
be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  The sponsor shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized third party.

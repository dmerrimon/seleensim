1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Fast Real-time Assessment of Combination Therapies in 
Immuno-ONcology Study in Participants with Advanced Gastric Cancer (FRACTION-Gastric 
Cancer)
Study Phase: Phase 2
Rationale:To determine which combinations show the mo st clinical promise and thus should be prioritized 
for registrational studies; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) has initiated the Fast Real-time 
Assessment of Combination Therapy in Immuno-ONcology (FRACTION) Program (globally 
listed under the descriptor BMS-986217). The FRACTION Program will employ repeat core 
biopsies and serial assessments with different treatment options. Novel study treatment 
combinations and/or additional controls will be appended as FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocols. These FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocols will evaluate the safety profile, 
tolerability, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamics of novel st udy 
treatment combinations in participants with advanced gastric cancer (GC).
Study Population:
Male and female participants, aged 18 years and ol der, with inoperable, advanced, or metastatic 
esophageal cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC) or ga stroesophageal junction (GEJ) carcinoma and 
have histologically confirmed predominant adenocarcinoma and/or squamous carcinoma, may be 
eligible for the study. The documentation of GEJ involvement can include biopsy, e ndoscopy, or 
imaging. 
Track-specific eligibility criteria are as follows:
•Track 1: anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and anti-
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) treatment-naïve participants
−Participants must not have received any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment 
prior to this study. Participants previously treated with agents other than anti-PD-1, anti-
PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 are eligible for Track 1.
−Participants may have been offered platinum-based chemotherapy for progressive or recurrent disease.
♦The platinum-based chemotherapy may have  been in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or 
recurrent setting.
−Participants will be required to submit a fresh tumor biopsy.
•Track 2: anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti -CTLA-4 treatment-experienced participants
−Participants must have had progressive or recurrent disease during or after anti-PD-1, 
anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment. (Par ticipants treated with any study treatment 
targeting PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 will be considered anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment experienced, respectively.)

♦The platinum-based chemotherapy may have  been in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or 
recurrent setting.
−Participants who have had prior treatment with any 1 of the agents (or any other agent 
targeting PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4) in monotherapy or in any combination regimen in a FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol are eligible for treatment on Track 2. 
−Participants who have had prior combination treatment with the same immuno-oncology(IO) combination agents (or IO agents directed against the same targets) as 1 of the combination regimens in a FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol are eligible for study treatment on Track 2 but must be randomized  to another combination regimen.
−Participants will be required to submit a fresh tumor biopsy.
Objectives and Endpoints:
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
•To assess the efficacy (ORR, DOR, and PFSR at 24 
weeks) of each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study treatment combination (relative to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, when applicable) in participants with advanced GC and/or EC•ORR defined as the proportion of all treated participants with a BOR of CR or PR as assessed per RECIST v1.1 by investigator, median DOR, and PFSR at 24 weeks 
Secondary
•To investigate additional saf ety and tolerability of each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study trea tment combination 
in participants with advanced GC and/or EC•Incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, deaths, and clinical laboratory test abnormalities 
Tertiary/Exploratory
•To assess the pharmacodynamic effects as a function of exposure, by evaluation of select biomarkers  
•To explore potential associations between anti-tumor activity or safety  and select biomarker measures  
 
•To evaluate the PK of each IP component
•To evaluate the immunogenicity of each IP, when applicable
•To assess the OS in treated participants 
•To evaluate disease-related symptom improvement, as measured by the GaCS of the FACT-Ga and the ECS of the FACT-E in treated participants
•To evaluate general health, functional status, and utility for health using the EQ-5D-3L in treated participants •Summary measures of change (or % change) 
from baseline or baseline level biomarker measurements  
 
•Correlation (or similar appropriate measure of 
association) of biomarker measure  
 with 
parameters of interest
•Summary measures of PK paramete rs from 
serum concentration
•Incidence of ADAs
•OS rate at certain time points
•Summary measures of EQ-5D-3L index and VAS scores, GaCS scores, and/or ECS scores,
and corresponding change form baselines for 
each score

Overall Design:
This is a rolling, Phase 2, adaptive study that will evaluate the preliminary eff icacy, safety, 
tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of novel FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study tr eatment 
combinations in participants with advanced GC and/or EC. The details pertaining to the specific 
study treatment regimens are provided in each FRACTI ON-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. 
Participants will be enrolled in 1 of the 2 tracks. Participants who are anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and
anti-CTLA-4 treatment naïve w ill be enrolled for Track 1. Participants who have had prior 
anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment will be assigned to Track 2.
Participants on Tracks 1 and 2 will begin on the Treatment Phase (with a total duration of 
approximately 2 years). Tumor assessments will be  conducted according to the timing described 
in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. 
Participants in Tracks 1 and 2 will be treated until completion of the Treatment Phase, progression, 
toxicity, or protocol-sp ecified discontinuation. 
Number of Participants: For Sub-Protocols utilizing a Simon-2 stage (optimal) design, up to 54 anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-
CTLA-4 treatment-naive participan ts will be treated per study tr eatment combination in Track 1. 
In Track 2, up to 41 participants will be treated per study treatment combination.
For Sub-Protocols not utilizing a Simon-2 stage (optimal) design, a different  sample size may be 
used depending on the statistical considerations for those treatment combinations. In those cases, 
sample size will be discussed within the individual Sub-Protocols.
Treatment Arms and Duration and Study Treatments:
Specific dosing and tr eatment reg imens for each FRACTION-Gas tric Cancer study treatment 
combination are outlined in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol.

Eligibility Assessments
Informed Consent X A participant is considered enrolled only when a protocol-specific informed consent is signed. 
Obtain patient identification number via IRT after signing of the written informed consent .
Utilize IRT X Obtain patient identification number .After completing all screening procedures, utilize IRT to 
either screen fail or obtain randomization information, as applicable. Randomization can occur 
up to 7 days prior to first dose. In limited circumstan ces, if patients cannot be treated within 7
days of randomization due to a study -related test, the duration can be extended after discussion 
with the medical monitor.

3 INTRODUCTION
Traditional or conventional tr eatment options for patients with advanced cancer include surgery, 
radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal thera py. Despite advances in these therapies, the majority 
of patients with metastatic disease die from progressive disease (PD). Immunotherapeutic 
approaches have demonstrated clinical eff icacy and have been approved in multiple countries 
worldwide and in several solid tumor malignancies, including melanoma, renal cell, lung, and 
hormone-refractory prostate cancers.1,2Tumors may modulate and evade the host immune 
response through a number of mechanisms, including downregulation of tumor-specific antigen 
expression and presentation, secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines, and upregulation of 
inhibitory ligands. -T-cell chec kpoint regulators such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-antigen 4 
(CTLA-4; see  Appendix 1 ) and programmed death-1 (PD-1, clus ter of differentiation [CD] 279) 
are cell surface molecules that, when engaged by their cognate ligands, induce signaling cascades 
that downregulate T- cell activation and pro liferation. One proposed model by which therapeutic 
T-cell checkpoint inhibitors derive anti-tumor activity is through breaking of immune tolerance to
tumor cell antigens by T-cell activation and proliferation.
Following on the success of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 pathway-targeted agents in several 
cancers, the field of tumor immunotherapy is rapidly expanding. In addition to blocking these and 
other co-inhibitory pathways such as lym phocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), activating 
co-stimulatory pathways to potentiate anti-tum or immune responses is being evaluated as a 
promising approach.3Members of the tumor necrosis f actor receptor supe r family (TNFRsf) 
include several co-stimulatory proteins with key roles in B- and T-cell development, survival, 
immune activation, and anti-tumor immune responses.4Preclinical data have provided the basis 
for clinical studies of agonist antibodies to su ch TNFRsf co-stimulatory receptors such as 
4-1BB,5,6OX40,7,8glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related (GITR)
gene,9,10and CD27,11,12along with a growing list of immuno-oncology (IO) targets that modulate
other immunomodulatory mechanisms as potential therapies for patients with cancer. Overall,enhancement of the magnitude and potency of tumor antigen-specific adaptive cellular responses
by CD8 and CD4 T cells is now consider ed a major goal in cancer immunotherapy.
With emerging clinical data showing significant activity of single a gent immunotherapies, it is 
possible, and indeed likely, that- combination therapies could potentially lead to a greater depth of 
response and an increase in overall survival (OS), as has been noted with the combination of 
anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 in participants with advanced melanoma and renal c ell 
carcinoma.
13,14,15,16This raises the possibility that combining agents with a broader range of 
relevant targets (eg, checkpoint blocking antibodies with  agonist anti bodies to T-cell 
co-stimulatory molecules and immunomodulatory agents) is likely to lead to durable, long -term 
responses and possibly even cures in this high unmet med ical need population of patients with 
metastatic or refractory tumors. Preclinical data from evaluation of combinations in mouse tumor 
models indicate that treatment with the combination of IO agents may lead to enhanced anti-tumor 
activity a bove that from each agent alone.17Thus, the combination of IO agents has the potential 
to provide clinical benefit to such patients with high unmet medical needs.

3.1 Study Rationale
3.1.1 FRACTION Program3.1.1.1 Rationale for the FRACTION Program
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) has an extensive portfolio of novel agents that span a 
variety of targets. Within the immune system, these include T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, 
co-stimulatory molecules acting on T cells, regulatory T cell -and natural killer (NK) cell
targeted- agents 孯季treatments that alter the tumor microenvironment to favor a tumor inhibitory 
milieu, and treatments that target myeloid-derived suppressor cells or tumor-
associated- macrophages. In addition to agents that target the immune system, BMS has a portfolio 
of agents that directly target tumor cells. These include antibody drug conjugates and both biologic 
and small molecule inhibitors of key signaling path ways. In fact, the number of compounds to be 
evaluated has grown so large that it is no longer possible or efficient to test all possible 
combinations in a standard clinical Phase 1 or Phase 2 setting.
To determine which combinations show the mo st clinical promise and thus should be prioritized 
for registrational studies, BMS has initiated the FRACTION Program 孫globally listed under the 
descriptor, BMS-986217). The FRAC TION Program will employ repeat core biopsies and ser ial 
assessments with different treatment options. These approaches are supported by the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Biomarker 孰integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for L ung Cancer 
Elimination (BATTLE) program,
18the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic 
Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis (I-SPY 1/2 TRIAL),19the Lung-MAP: S1400 
Biomarker-targeted Second-line Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IIIB-IV 
Squamous Cell Lung Cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ,20the NCI Molecular Analyses for Therapy Choice 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s Targeted Agent and Profiling 
Utilization Registry.21These studies use innovative trial designs to quickly assess new agents in 
participants with the goal of reducing the time and number of participants required to bring these 
therapies to those who will benefit from them.
The FRACTION Program w ill consist of several FRAC TION studies, each in a sp ecific tumor 
type and with a well-defined participant population. Each FRACTION study w ill have a Master 
Protocol, which will a pply to all study treatment combinations selected for evaluation under that 
tumor-specific FRACTION study and any control treatments. For the FRACTION P rogram, it is 
intended that combination agents will be IO agents  within the BMS pipeline or IO agents already 
approved; however, they may also include small molecule agents or other mod alities for which 
there is scientific rationale for combining with  an IO agent in a given disease. All novel 
FRACTION combinations will be s elected based on sound scientific r ationale, supported 
whenever possible and appropriate by in vivo mode l systems, to demonstrate anti-cancer activity 
and preliminary assessments of clinical tolerability.
Specific study treatm ent combinations and/or control treatments w ill be introduced in FRACTION 
Sub-Protocols for each FRACTION study; these Sub-Protocols will be appended to the Master

Protocol for that study and will include information a ppropriate to the study treatment 
combinations and/or control treatments bei ng added to the study, including the preclinical 
rationale, preclinical toxicology 孯and clinical safety data, as w ell as PK and phar macodynamic 
information (PD), as available. Th e minimum preclinical safety information provided in each 
Sub-Protocol will include the definitive studies that were used to support the health authorities and
review for each individual agent, along with any additional preclinical safety studies that were conducted subsequent to the original applications. In addition, the toxicology rationale to support 
each combination w ill be discussed. For each agent, the established monotherapy and relevant 
combination clinical safety package from studies done outside of FRACTI ON will be included. 
Participants within the FRACTION Program will not be the first to be exposed to any tr eatment. 
Thus, for the FRACTION Program, study treatment combinations that have high potential to produce transformational anti -tumor activity compared to the control will be s elected based on 
both preclinical and early clinical trials data. Th e first study in th e FRACTION Program, 
Study CA018001, “Phase 2, Fast Real-time Assessment of Combination Therapies in Immuno-
ONcology Study in Subjects with Advanced No n-small Cell Lung Cancer (FRACTION-Lung),”
is ongoing. FRACTION-Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is also ongoing.
3.1.1.2 Specific Attributes of the FRACTION Program Design
The specific attributes of the FRACTION Program include the following 孽
•An innovative study design providing participants wi th advanced cancer the possibility of 
expeditious access to innovative therapies, in cluding combinations with approved treatments 
like nivolumab. In addition, it will provide an ongoing treatment option for participants across 
the spectrum of their disease as they progress through the FRACTION Program, as participants 
can enter into different treatment “Tracks” based upon their treatment exposure and response. 
•A streamlined decision-making process allowing for more rapid and efficient selection of 
promising treatment options in BMS’s evolving portfolio of oncology assets. This extensive pipeline of novel targets and/or agents could re sult in an excess of 100 individual monotherapy 
and doublet combinations in need of study. The challenges to study all possible combinations 
in a traditional clinical program are daunting, especially since animal models and/or biomarker 
data still cannot effectively pred ict par ticipant responses. This means that clinical exploration 
in participants is required if it is to be  truly informative and would ultimately  lead to 
participant’s benefit. Thus, FRACTION is designed as a way to explore and compare multiple 
IO combinations against each other and against a control treatment. 
•A Master Protocol, in conjunction with appended FRACTION Sub-Protocols, allowing for operational efficiencies for the rapid and efficient opening of new study tr eatment combination 
arms and closing of other study tr eatment combination arms that have demonstrated 
unacceptable toxicity or futility 
•A continuous throughput design allowing data to be available sooner to support either closure of study treatment combination arms (init ial signal-seeking arms) or adaptively increasing 
sample size for further investigation with additional eligibility criteria and s tatistical 
considerations in a new sub-protocol if promising efficacy is seen with a treatment 
combination. This will drive and improve s election and acceleration of optimal combinations 
to help patients with cancer in dire need of new effective treatment options.

3.1.1.3 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments
There will be a core group of biomarker asse ssments  
 that will apply to all novel FRACTION Program study combinations so that comparisons 
of such data can be made across different study treatments. The goals of the biomarker assessments
proposed in the FRACTION Program are to 1) identify predictive biomarkers for both safety and 
efficacy of a given combination, 2) define the mechanism of action for a particular combination
(pharmacodynamic assessment), and 3) determine the mechanisms of resistance to a particular combination. In addition, there w ill be biomarke r assessments that are applied specifically for a 
given combination as dictated by the biol ogy of the combination.

responsible for a combined total of 1,407,000 new cases and 1,123,000 deaths every year. These,therefore, represent the most prevalent subtypes of GI malignancies worldwide, with an alarming 
increase in esophageal adeno carcinoma in many Western populations in recent decades.
22,23
Gastric cancer (GC) is the 5th leading cancer and the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. The incidence varies with diffe rent geographic regions, with over 70% of GCs
occurring in developing countries. While esophageal cancer (EC) has a lower incidence (8th most common cancer), overall mor tality of EC is hi gh. Moreover, adenocarcinoma of from gastric 
cardia, GEJ and distal esophagus is increasing in the West.
24GC and EC often present as advanced 
disease upon diagnosis.
Locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophaga gogastric carcinomas are not curable and 
highly lethal. While etiologic, epidemiologic,  and biologic heterogeneity among esophagogastric 
carcinomas are well recognized, similar chemothera py regimens are used in treatment of metastatic 
disease. Platinum compounds (oxaliplatin and cis platin) and fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil, 
capecitabine, and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium) are generally considered as standard-of-
care treatment options in metastatic EC, GC and GEJ cancer across geographic regions.25,26,27
Targeted agents that have shown benefit are trastuzumab (for HER-2 positive tumors) and 
ramucirumab for esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.28,29,30The different biologic characteristics
and treatment approaches among regions result in different survival outcomes, with median OS
durations of 12 to 14 months in Asian countries and 8 to 11 months in the US and Europe.31,32,33
Immunotherapeutic approaches have demonstrated clinical efficacy in several advanced solid 
tumor cancers, including esophagoga stric cance r, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
renal cell carcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, recurrent or metastatic squa mous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient 
metastatic colorectal cancer.34,35,36,37,38Nivolumab (BMS-936558), a PD-1 antibody, and 
ipilimumab (BMS- 734016), a CTLA-4 antibody, are such immunotherapies that have been 
approved in the US, Europe, Japan, and other countries.38,39,40,41
Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor blockade may further improve anti-t umor activity.

production 2- to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. In a murine 
melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA-4 or PD-1 antibodies increased the proportion of CTLA-4- and PD-1-expressing CD4/CD 8 tumor-infiltrating T-effector cells, and 
dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of T-effector cells and decreased intratumoral 
T regulatory cells, as compared to either agent alone.
42
In patients with esophagogastric cancer, tumors with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)expression have been reported to  be associated with depth of muscle invasion, tumor size, and 
lymph node metastasis. The survival of patients with PD-L1- or programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2)-expressing tumors is significantly worse than for those patients without 
PD-L1/PD-L2-expressing tumors. PD-L1 or PD-L2- expressing tumors have been reported in 
approximately 22% to 40% of GC , and PD-L1 has been suggested as a prognostic marker for both 
GC and EC.
43,44Thus, blockage of PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 might improve the survival of GC patients.
To that end, anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and avelumab) have 
been investigated in GC treatment and have demonstrated anti-tumor activity.45,46,47Nivolumab 
showed an improvement in response rate, progression free survival, and OS compared to placebo 
in Japanese patients with GC treated with 2 or more lines of chemotherapy, irrespective of PD-L1 
status.48Anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab was approve d in patients with recurrent locally 
advanced or metastatic, gastric, or GEJ adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1, as 
determined by an FDA-approved test and patients must have had disease progression on or after 2 
or more prior systemic therapies, including fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy and, if appropriate, human epidermal gr owth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-targeted 
therapy.
49,50Pembrolizumab is also approved (acceler ated approval) for the treatment of patients 
with MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high)/dMMR (mismatch repair deficient) cancers with no satisfactory alternative treatment options.
Combining immunotherapeutic agents with differe nt mechanisms of acti on offers the possibility 
of further benefit, as noted with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab now approved in 
the US for the treatment of p atients with metastatic melanoma.
38In Study CA209032 (“A 
Phase 1/2, Open-label Study of Nivolumab Monotherapy or Nivolumab combined with 
Ipilimumab in Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors,” [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), participants 
with GC or GEJ were treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
or nivolumab monotherapy. Participants treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg had an objective response rate (ORR) of 24% and 12-month progression-free 
survival rate (PFSR) of 17%. This was greater th an the ORR and 12-month PFSR in participants 
treated with nivolumab monotherapy, who had an ORR of 12% and a PFSR of 8%.34This study 
treatment combination reg imen has also been chosen for use in a Phase 3 registration study in first-
line GC. Hence, nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg has been chosen as 
the control treatment in FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol A. (Further details are described 
in the FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol A 孬孱These data also suggest the potential for other 
combinations to bring additional benefit to participants with GC and GEJ.

This document will serve as the Master Prot ocol for the FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study 
(FRACTION-Gastric Cancer 孾季CA018003). As described a bove, novel study treatment 
combinations and/or additional controls will be appended as FRACTION-Gastric Cancer 
Sub-Protocols. These FRACTION-Gastric Can cer Sub Protocols- will evaluate the safety profile, 
tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics of novel study treatment 
combinations in participants with advanced GC. The initial control treatment in the 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study will be nivolumab in combination with ip ilimumab followed 
by nivolumab monotherapy 孯similar to what has been administered in Study CA209032 as 
described above.
3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
An overall risk/benefit assessment for each novel FRACTION -Gastric Cancer study tr eatment 
combination will be provided in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol.
Non-live coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination is considered a simple concomitant 
medication within the study. However, the efficacy and safety of non-live vaccines (including non-live COVID-19 vaccines) in participants receiving investigational agents is unknown.
3.3.1 Safety Monitoring on Study Treatment
Frequent safety assessments will be carried out by the S ponsor/BMS Medical Monitor (or 
designee) and investigators throughout the st udy to d etermine whether dose modification, 
additional safety measures, or termination of the study treatment combination arm is required at 
any time. In addition, AEs and seri ous adverse events (SAEs) w ill be reviewed regularly by the 
BMS Medical Monitor (or designee) and the Pharmacovigilance group to look for trends and 
potential safety signals. Treatment of AEs w ill follow institutional guidelines and recommended 
management algorithms, as listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and prescribing information, as applicable, for each combination agent and c ontrol comparator, and provided as appendices to 
this protocol. Specific al gorithms for the management of immune-related AEs are provided in 
Appendix 6 and are applicable to immune-related AEs for all FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study
treatment combinations.

option to enter into Track 2, assuming that he/she c ontinues to fulfill all eligibility criteria at each 
new randomization point, including a life expectancy of ≥3m o n t h s( s e e  Section 5.1.1 ). 
A Simon 2-stage (optimal) design will be used in  both Tracks 1 and 2 to evaluate the possibility 
of terminating an arm early and/or moving promising combinations into the next phase of 
treatment development (see Section 10.1 ). The number of participants planned for enrollment may 
vary by track and is described in Section 10.1 . Enrollment will be continued after reaching the 
indicated number of participants at Stage 1 while the initial eff icacy evaluation is ongoing. This 
will allow additional participants to enroll to account for unexpected trial impact, such as response nonevaluable participants due to  early dropout, design parameter change (eg, historical rate 
update), etc. Participants who continue to fulfill eligibility criteria may move from Track 1 into Track 2 or re-enter Track 2, as described in  Section 5.1.1 .

5.1.2 Safety Monitoring Board and Other External Committees
Two independent committees may be utilized: a Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) and an 
Independent Review Committee (IRC).
The SMB will be established to provide safety monitoring and to provide advice to the Sponsor 
regarding actions the committee deems necessary for the continuing protection of participants 
enrolled in the study. The SMB will meet at least twice per year concurrent with BMS internal 
continuous safety assessments. If needed, additional ad hoc SMB meetings may be c onvened. 
Safety-related data summaries and listings (by study track and study tr eatment arm, as  appropriate) 
will be provided to SMB to facilitate safety monitoring. The SMB will act in an advisory capacity 
to BMS and will monitor par ticipant safety th roughout the study. Additional details are provided 
in the SMB Charter.
The IRC may be established at the discretion of the Sponsor. The IRC may review all av ailable 
tumor assessment scans to determine response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
[RECIST] v1.1 criteria). IRC-determined response may be used in the analyses of ORR, PFSR, 
and duration of response (DOR).
5.1.3 Study Phases
Participants will complete up to 3 phases of the study: Screening, Treatment, and Safety 
Follow-up.
5.1.3.1 Screening
Prior to screening for the protocol, investigative sites are required to determine if a participant has 
previously received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or an ti-CTLA-4 treatment through their institutional 
database, participant medical history, or institutional prescreening process. Once determined, 
treatment experience is considered source data for this FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study. The 
participant must be provided with the FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved wri tten consent. Once the consent is signed, the participant is then 
considered to have entered screening. The treatment status must be entered into the enrollment 
management system, and participants will be require d to submit a fresh tumor biopsy. An adequate 
baseline tumor biopsy (as determined by a central laboratory pathologist) must be obtained prior 
to randomization.
The Screening Phase for each track w ill last for up to 28 days. Participants will be enro lled using 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT).If a participant surpasses the 28-day window during the Screening Phase due to a study-related 
procedure (eg, scheduling of a tumor biopsy or w aiting time for a st udy-related laboratory value), 
the participant must be re-consented but does not need to be assigned a new participant
identification number. To reduce any undue burden of procedure in this participant population in 
this situation, the amount of repeat procedures from the initial screening will be minimized, while 
maintaining safety and eligibility under the discretion of the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee) 
and investigator.
Enrollment in all study treatment arms in each track will be competitive.

5.1.3.2 Treatment
The details of the Treatm ent Phase duration are provided in Section 5.1 . Further details of the study 
treatment administr ation are in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. Study assessments 
are to be collected as outlined in the On-treatment Proce dural Outline(s) in each FRACTION-
Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol.
Assessment of response will be outlined for each combination therapy in the specific FRACTION-
Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. Assessments of PR and CR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later 
following initial assessmen t. Tumor progression or res ponse endpoints w ill be assessed using 
RECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors (see Appendix 5 ). 
Participants will generally be allowed to conti nue study treatment until th e first occurrence of one 
of the following: 1) completion of 2 years of study treatment, 2) PD, 3) clinical d eterioration 
suggesting that no further benef it from study tr eatment is likely, 4) intolerable toxicity, and 
5) meeting of criteria for discontinuation of st udy treatment, as outlined in Section 8.1 . Individual 
participants with confirmed CR will be given the option to discontinue study tr eatment, on a case-
by-case basis, after specific consultation and agreement between the investigator and the BMS 
Medical Monitor (or designee) in s ettings where the benefit/risk ratio justifies discontinuation of 
study treatment. 
All participants will be treated as per Section 5.1 , unless criteria for study treatment
discontinuation are met earlier (see Section 8.1 in this FRACTION-Gastric Master Protocol and 
Section 8.1 in the FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol ).Upon completion of the Treatment 
Phase, all participants will enter the Safety Follow-up Phase (see Section 5.1.3.3 andTable 2-3).
As of Protocol Amendment 06, collection of blo od or other biological samples for reasons other 
than safety monitoring (eg, PK, ADA, biomarkers, etc) should be discontinued. Please refer to 
Table 2-3 and Sections 9.5 , 9.6, and 9.8.
5.1.3.3 Follow-up
As of Protocol Amendment 06, tumor scans, survival s tatus follow-ups, and co llection of 
subsequent treatment information w ill end once the participant has disease p rogression or 
treatment discontinuation for any reason, whichever occurs first. Any assessments for monitoring 
of safety will continue per protocol until the final follow-up visit (FU3). Please refer to Table 2-3 .
Safety Follow-up
Upon completion of the Treatment Phase, all par ticipants will enter the Safety Follow-up Phase 
once the decision is made to discontinue the participant from study treatment (eg, at EOT). 
For participants that complete all scheduled weeks of study tr eatment, EOT visit will be the same 
as the last scheduled and completed on-treatment vi sit and the start of Week 1 safety follow-up 
visit. For participants that do not complete all scheduled weeks of study tr eatment, EOT visit will 
be the most recent on-treatment visit (with all available safety and response data; does not need to 
be repeated) and will be considered the start of Week 1 safety follow-up visit.

After the EOT visit, all participants will be evalu ated for any new AEs until 100 days following
the last dose of study treatment, as specified in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. 
All SAEs must be collected from the date of the pa rticipant’s written consent until 100 days post
discontinuation of dosing or participant’s participation in the study if the last scheduled visit occurs 
at a later time. Follow-up visits should occur at Days 30, 60, and 100 (± 7 days) after the last dose 
of study treatment or coinciding with the date of discontinuation ( ±7 days), if the date of 
discontinuation is greater than 30 days after the last dose, to monitor for AEs. All participants will 
be required to complete the 3 clinical safety follow-up visits, regardless of whether they start a new anti-cancer treatment, except for those participants who withdraw consent for study 
participation or those participants who start retreatment or are re-randomized into Track 2.
5.2 Number of Participants
For Sub-Protocols utilizing a Simon-2 stage (optimal) design, up to 54 anti-PD1/PD-L1 or CTLA-
4 treatment-naïve participants will be treated pe r study treatment combination, in Track 1. In 
Track 2, up to 41 participants will be treated per study treatment combination (see Section 10.1 for 
details).
For Sub-Protocols not utilizing a Simon-2 stage (optimal) design, a different  sample size may be 
used depending on the statistical considerations for those treatment combinations. In those cases, 
sample size will be discussed within the individual Sub-Protocols.
5.3 End of Study Definition
The start of the study is defined as first visit for first participant screened. End of study is defined 
as the last visit or scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities for the last participant. 
Study completion is defined as the final date on which data for the primary endpoint was or is expected to be collected, if this is not the same.
5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
BMS has an extensive portfolio of novel agents that span a variety of targets 孱季To determine which 
combinations show the most clinical promise and 孯thus孯should be prioritized for future
registrational studies, BMS has initiated the FRACTION Program. The FRACTION Program will 
treat participants with different study treatmen t options and employ repeat blood sampling 孯季tumor 
biopsies孯and serial assessments to understand markers of response to treatment. These approaches 
are supported by various precedent studies that use innovative trial designs to quickly assess new 
agents in participants 孯with the goal of reducing the time and number of participants required to 
bring these treatments to those who will benefit from them. For the FRACTION Program, specific 
study treatment combin ations and/or control treatments w ill be introduced in FRACTION Sub-
Protocols for each FRACTION study. Study treatment combinations that have high potential to 
produce transformational activity in the cancer compared to the control, based on both preclinical 
and early clinical trials data, will be selected. See Section 3.1 for details.

5.4.1 Rationale for Duration of Therapy
The optimal duration of immunotherapy is an important question and continues to be investigated. 
In Study CA209153, patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC who completed 1 year of 
nivolumab therapy were randomized to either continue or stop treatment, with the option of retreatment upon progression. Among 163 pa tients still on tr eatment at 1 year and without 
progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab had significant improvement in 
progression-free survival (PFS) compared to thos e who were randomized to  stop treatment, with 
median PFS (post-randomization) not reached vs 10.3 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR) =
0.42 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71). With a median follow-up of 14.9 months post-ra ndomization, there 
also was a trend for patients on continued treatment to live longer (OS HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.33, 1.20]). Of note, the PFS c urves in both groups p lateau approximately 1 year after randomization 
(ie, 2 years after treatment initiation), s uggesting that there may be minimal benefit in extending 
treatment beyond a total of 2 years.
51
Moreover, accumulating data suggest that 2 years of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment may be 
sufficient for long-term benefit. In Study CA209003, a dose- escalation cohort expansion trial 
evaluating the safety and clinical activity of nivo lumab in patients with previously treated 
advanced solid tumors (including 129 participants with NSCLC) specified a maximum treatment 
duration of 2 years. Among 16 participants with NSCLC who discontinued nivolumab after completing 2 years of treatment, 12 par ticipants were alive > 5 year s and remained progression-
free without any subsequent therapy. In th e CA209003 NSCLC cohort, the OS curve begins to 
plateau after 2 years, with an OS rate of 25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years.
52These survival 
outcomes are similar to Phase 3 studies in previously treated NSCLC, in which nivolumab 
treatment was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity (2-year OS rates of 23% and 29%, and 3-year OS rates of 16% to 18% for squamous and non-squamous NSCLC,
respectively).
53
Taken together, the data suggest that a shorter duration of nivolumab treatment of onl y 1 year was 
associated with increased risk of progression in previously treated p atients with NSCLC, 
suggesting that treatment be yond 1 year is likely needed. Also, tr eatment beyond 2 years is unlikely 
to confer additional clinically meaningful benefit, and that the risk of progression after discontinuing treatment at 2 years is low.
Collectively, these data suggest that there is minimal, if any, benefit derived from continuing IO 
treatment beyond 2 years in advanced tumors. However, even though immunotherapy is well 
tolerated, patients will be at risk for addi tional toxicity with longer-term treatment.

7 TREATMENT
Study treatment is defined as any investigat ional treatment(s), mark eted product(s), placebo, or 
medical device intended to be administered to a st udy participant acc ording to the st udy 
randomizatio n or treatment allocation.
Study treatment includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Product (IP/IMP) and Non-IP/Non-IMP 
and is described in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol.
An IP, also known as IMP in some regions, is defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently 
from the authorized form, used for an unauthorized indication, or used to gain further information 
about the authorized form.
Other medications used as support or escape medicati on for preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given dia gnosis, may be considered as non-IPs.
7.1 Treatments Administered
Other treatments administered as part of the study that are cr itical to claims of efficacy 
(eg, background treatment and rescue medications) w ill be considered study tr eatment. A table 
describing the study treatments and dosage i nformation is provided in each FRACTION-Gastric 
Cancer Sub-Protocol.
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
This is an open-label study. All participants will be centrally randomized using an IRT. Before the 
study is initiated, each user will receive log-in  information and directions on how to access the 
IRT.
Specific study treatments are listed in each FR ACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. Study 
treatment will be dispensed at the study visits, as listed in the On-treatment Procedural Outline(s) 
in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. 
All participants must be assigned a patient identification number (PID) upon providing a signed 
IRB/IEC-approved written informed consent. During the screening visit, the investigative site will 
utilize the IRT for enrollment and receive a 5-digit PID designated by BMS that w ill be unique 
across all sites. Enrolled participants, including those not dosed, will be assigned sequential PIDsstarting with . The PID w ill ultimately be composed of 
the site number and participant number. For examp le, the first participant screened (eg, enrolled) 
at Site Number 1 will have a PID of . The following information is required for 
enrollment:
•Date of obtaining informed consent
•Date of birth

•Gender at birth
•Anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment experience (see  Section 5.1.3.1 )
Once enrolled in the IRT, participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be ready to be 
randomized through the IRT. The following information is required for randomization:
•Participant number
•Date of birth
Randomization participant schedules will be generated and maintained by the IRT vendor. At the 
conclusion of the trials, BMS will r eceive copies of all genera ted participant schedules from the 
vendor. Because of the nature of the st udy design, limited early access to the rando mization 
information will be granted to the study team to facilitate early analyses for internal decision 
making (early termination of study treatment arm, etc).
Each participant who is randomized will be assigned a unique randomization number. This is not 
the primary identifier for the participant, but is used for the randomization schedule. The primary 
identifier will be the PID described above, for use on the case report form (CRF) and source 
documents. A participant being re-randomized in Track 2 w ill be assigned a different 
randomization number but will r etain the same PID. Ra ndomization numbers will be assigned 
using a Central Randomization System in the order in which participants qualify for study 
treatment, not in the order of study enrollment. Rando mization ratios within each track w ill be 
specified in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. If, within a given track, studytreatment arms from more than 1 FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol within the 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Master Protocol ar e simultaneously open to enrollment, then a new 
participant could be assigned to any of the open study tr eatment arms. In Track 1, participants will

Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocols) in a ratio specified in each new FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-
Protocol. New randomization schedules for new FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocols will 
be generated. If accrual for current FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocols is still ongoing, 
participants will be allocated to the existing rando mization schedule or new randomization 
schedule based on a pre-specified allocation ratio. Details of allo cation ratio w ill be specified in 
the new FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol . In Track 2, participants will be randomized to 
existing study treatment arm/study treatments and newly added study treatment arm/study treatments with equal probability. 
Pre-specified study treatment arm caps (accordi ng to Simon 2-stage [optimal] design) will be 
utilized to control the accrual for each study tr eatment combination arm under different tracks 
(Tracks 1 and 2). The cap for the nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab control arm under 
Track 1 will be set equal to the largest cap among its c orresponding experimental arms. In the 
event that 1 or more participants go off study without being evaluable for response (ie, with no 
post-baseline tumor measurements and no evidence of clinical progression or death due to disease 
progression), the enrollment cap for that st udy tr eatment arm may be correspondingly raised if

IO agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration from AEs caused by 
other therapeutic classes. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with IO agents 
may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algor ithms have been developed from extensive 
experience with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and their combination to assist investigators in assessing 
and managing the following groups of AEs:
•Pulmonary
•Gastrointestinal
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Renal
•Skin
•Neurological

7.7 Concomitant Therapy
7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
The following prohibitions and restrictions apply to all FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocols 
for the FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study. Additional FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol-
specific prohibitions and/or restrictions are outlined in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer 
Sub-Protocol.
The following medications are prohibited during the Treatment Phase of the study:1) Immunosuppressive agents (except for those stated in  Secti on 7.7.3) are prohibited unless they 
are utilized to treat an AE.
2) Chronic systemic corticosteroids (prednisone > 10 m g daily or equiv alent; except for those 
stated in Section 7.7.3 ) are prohibited unless they are utilized to treat an AE.
3) Vaccines (except for those stated in Section 7.7.3 ) are prohibited.
4) Any medicinal herbal preparations within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment are 
prohibited unless prescribed by a treating physician. Use of marijuana and its derivatives for 
treatment of symptoms related to cancer treatment are permitted if obtained by medical 
prescription or if its use (even without a medical prescription) has been legalized locally, as 
long as no drug-drug interactions are outlined in the specific Sub-Protocol.
5) Any concurrent anti-neoplastic treatment (ie, chemotherapy; immunotherapy; extensive, 
nonpalliative radiation treatment; or standard or investigational agents for treatment of GC/GEJ) is prohibited other than those included in the study tr eatment combinations.
Any concomitant therapies must be recorded on the CRF from screening to follow-up.
7.7.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
7.7.2.1 Imaging Restriction and PrecautionsIt is the local imaging fa cility’s respons ibility to determine, based on par ticipant attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen for each participant. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks s hould be 
considered in this assessment. Participants wi th renal insufficiency should be assessed as to 
whether or not they should receive contrast a nd, if so, what type and dose of contrast are 
appropriate. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast  should not be given to participants with 
severe renal insufficiency (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) because 
of increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibros is in this participant population. In these 
participants, alternative imaging tests or MRI without gadolinium should be considered. In 
addition, participants are excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers,

etc. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the 
site radiologist, the investigator, and the standard set by the local IRB/IEC.
7.7.3 Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topical, oc ular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). A brief course (less than 3 weeks) of 
corticosteroids  prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy ) or for treatment of nonautoimmune 
conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted.
•Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids (with min imal systemic absorption may be continued if 
the participant is on a stable dose) and a drenal replacement steroid doses of prednisone
> 10 mg daily or equivalent are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Non 孰
absorbed intra-articular steroid injections will be permitted.
•Immunosuppressive agents and the use of systemic corticosteroids are permitted in the context 
of treating AEs. Participants receiving corticosteroids must be at prednisone < 10 mg daily or 
equivalent prior to re-initiation of study treatment. Participants may continue to receive 
hormone replacement treatment.
•The inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine can be given to participants while on treatment
without restriction. Vaccines containing live/attenuated virus (e.g., varicella, zoster, y ellow 
fever, rotavirus, oral polio and measles, mu mps, rubella [MMR]) are not permitted while on 
study treatment and until 100 days post the last dose.
•Non-live COVID-19 vaccination is  considered a simple concomitant medication within the 
study. However, the efficacy and safety of non-live vaccines (including non-live COVID-19 
vaccines) in participants receiving investigational agents is unknown.
7.7.4 Palliative Local Therapy
Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms may be offered to all participants on 
the study. Limited radiation tr eatment or s urgery to control isolated lesions is permitted for 
participants who have investigator-assessed clinical benefit following consul tation with the BMS 
Medical Monitor (or designee). 
Participants should not receive study tr eatment during radiation because the potential for 
overlapping toxicities with radiotherapy and FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study treatment 
combinations or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab is not known. If palliative 
radiotherapy in short courses and for isolated fields is required to control symptoms not clearly related to disease progression, then study treatment adminis tration should be withheld, if possible, 
for at least 1 week before radiation and for at least 1 week after its completion. Participants should be closely monitored for any potential toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy. Prior to resuming study treatment, radio-therap y related- AEs should resolve to Grade ≤1 or baseline, and 
participants must meet relevant eligibility criteria  as determined by the BMS Medical Monitor (or 
designee) in discussion with the investigator. The BMS Medical Monitor (or designee) must be consulted prior to re-initiating study tr eatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting 
> 8 weeks from the previous dose.

Details of palliative radiotherapy should be documented in the source records and electronic case 
report form (eCRF). Details in the source records should include dates of treatment, anatomic site, dose administered and fractionation schedule, and AEs. Symptoms requiring palliative 
radiotherapy should be evaluated for objective evidence of disease progression. Participants 
receiving palliative radiation of target lesions will have the evaluation of ORR just prior to radiotherapy, but these participants will no longe r be evaluable for the determination of response 
subsequent to the date palliative radiation occurs.
For participants who need to undergo elective s urgery (not tumor related) during the study, it is 
recommended to hold study treatment(s) for at leas t 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after surgery, or 
until the participant recovers from the procedure, whichever is longer. Prior to resuming st udy 
treatment, surgically related AEs should resolve to ≤Grade 1 or baseline, and participants must 
meet relevant eligibility criteria as determined by the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee) in 
discussion with the investigator. The BMS Medical Monitor (or designee) must be consulted prior 
to re-initiating study treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 8 weeks from the previous dose.
7.7.5 Supportive Care Management
Supportive care management for each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study tr eatment combination 
and, as necessary, is outlined in the FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol describing that 
treatment combination.
7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to provide BMS-s upplied study treatment to 
participants/investigators unless BMS chooses to  extend the study. The investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate standard of care to treat the condition under study.
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Participants must discontinue IP (and non-IP at the discretion of the investigator) for any of the 
following reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study 
treatment will remain in the st udy and must continue to be followed for protocol-specified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 2 . The only exception to this is when a participant 
specifically withdraws consent for any further c ontact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by participant to provide this information
•Any clinical AE, laboratory a bnormality, or in tercurrent illness, that, in the opinion of the 
investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the 
participant
•Termination of the study by BMS
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for the treatment of either a psychiatric or a phys ical (eg, infectious disease) illness. (Note: 
Under specific circumstances and only in count ries where local regulations permit, a

participant who has been imprisoned may be pe rmitted to continue as a participant. Strict 
conditions apply and BMS approval is required.)
•Inability to comply  with the protocol
•Pregnancy
•Documented disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 5 ), unless the 
participant meets criteria for tr eatment beyond progression (see Section 7.4.2 ) or the 
participant continues study treatment by entering another track or r eceiving retreatment 
(seeSection 5.1.3.3 )
•Clinical deterioration while receiving active study treatment that, in the opinion of the 
investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the
participant
•Discretion of the investigator
•Protocol-defined reasons for discontinuation ( Criteria for permanent discontinuation for each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study treatment combination and/or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab are provided in each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol.)
•End of study
Refer to Section 2 and the On-treatment Proce dural Outline(s) specific to each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol for data to be collected at th e time of study  treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that can be completed.
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical Monitor (or 
designee) of this event. In most cases, the study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an 
appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor (or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. If the investigator 
determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study tr eatment, a 
discussion between the investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee) must occur.
All participants who discontinue study treatmen t should comply with protocol-specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in  Section 2 . The only exception to this requirement is when a participant
withdraws consent for all study procedures, including posttreatment study follow-up, or loses the 
ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or  a physical illness).
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study, the reason for the discontinuation must be documented in th e participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
Additional study treatment-sp ecific discontinuation criteria are provided in each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol.

8.1.2 Study Treatment Combination Arm Discontinuation Criteria
In the event that 20% or more of study participants in a novel FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study 
treatment combin ation arm of a given track, at any given t ime, meet any of the toxicity criteria for 
permanent discontinuation (as described in Section 8.1.1), then consideration will be given to 
discontinue that FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study treatment combination arm in that track. This will include early side eff ects seen with combination agents and longer-term effects such as 
endocrinopathies. This action w ill be taken in consul tation with the SMB and will consider other 
pertinent facts in coming to a decision, including the toxicity profile of that combination seen 
outside FRACTION-Gastric Cancer, participant b enefit as measured by anti-tumor response, and 
comparison to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab.
Discontinuation of a study treatment combination arm in a given track for any reason will not lead 
to discontinuation for that combination in all tracks. Safety of all open-label study tr eatment 
combination arms in other tracks that contain the same agent (or agents) will be assessed by SMB 
and the Sponsor. In the event of serious, unexp ected, or life-threatening emergent toxicities, 
relevant study treatment combination arms may then be modified to maintain the safety of participants. Decisions on such steps and the re-initiation of any study tr eatment combination arms 
that had been stopped would be made by SMB in consultation with the Sponsor and relevant authorities (eg, IRB/IEC).
8.1.3 Post Study Treatment Study Follow-up
In this study, PFSR is a key endpoint of the study. Post-st udy follow-up is of critical importance 
and is essential to preserving participant safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who 
discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed (in this study or a rollover study) for
safety ( Section 5 ).
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Participants who request to discontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue 
to be followed up for protocol-specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when 
a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by participant to provide this information. 
•Participants should notify the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible.
•The withdrawal of consent should be explained in  detail in the medical rec ords by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with  study treatment only
or also from study proce dures and/or posttreatment st udy follow- up, and entered onto the 
appropriate CRF page.
•In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information s hould be used to determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.
•If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future i nformation, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.

8.3 Lost to Follow-up
•All reasonable efforts must be made to  locate participants to determine and re port their ongoing 
status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the participant.
•Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the participant after a minimum of 
3documented phone calls, faxe s, or emails, as well as lack of response by par ticipant to 
1 registered mail letter. All attempts shoul d be documented in the participant’s medical 
records.
•If it is determined that the participant has died, the site w ill use permissible local met hods to 
obtain date and cause of death.
•If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study 
has been included in the par ticipant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor-retained third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s contact information or other public vital s tatus data n ecessary to complete the follow-up 
portion of the study. 
•The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public h ealth 
registries and databases, in orde r to obtain updated contact information.
•If, after all attempts, the participant r emains lost to follo w-up, then the last  known alive date 
as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the participant’s medical records.
9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and timing are summarized  in the Schedule of Activities in Section 2 and the 
On-treatment Proce dural Outline(s) specif ic to each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer 
Sub-Protocol.
•Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
•All immediate safety concerns must be  discussed with the Spons or immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study 
treatment.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities in Section 2 and the On-treatmen t Procedural Outline(s) specific to each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol, is  essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria be fore randomization. The investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clin ical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of  informed consent may be u tilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided that the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been 
performed within the timefr ame defined in the Schedule of Activities in Section 2 and the On-

9.1 Efficacy Assessments
Disease assessment with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)/MRI scans acquired on 
dedicated CT/MRI equipment is preferred for this study. CT or MRI of the abdomen, chest, pelvis,
and all known sites of disease should be performed for tumor assessments.
CT scans should be acquired with 5-mm slices with no intervening gap (contiguous ). Should a 
participant have a contraindication for CT intravenous contrast, a contrast-enhanced MRI of the
chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other known sites of disease may be obtained. MRIs should be 
acquired with slice thickness of 5 mm with no ga p (contiguous). Every attempt should be made to 
image each participant using an identical acquisition protocol on the same scanner for all imaging time points.
MRI or CT brain scans during on-study treatment and follow-up periods are required only if there 
is a history of brain metastasis or clinically i ndicated for symptoms that suggest CNS involvement. 
Surveillance MRI should be performed per sta ndard of care (approximately every 12 weeks or 
sooner). Participants with a hi story of bone metastasis s hould have a bone sca n, if clinically 
indicated.
Assessments will be performed at baseline and at the time points described in each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol, up to and including Week 24 during the Treatment 
Phase or until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 criteria (see Appendix 5 ) or confirmed disease 
progression for participants treated bey ond progression (defined as an additional 10% increase in 
tumor burden volume with a minimum 5 mm absolu te increase from time of initial PD assessment 
[an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/or the diameters of new measurable 
lesions compared to the time of initial PD ]), discontinuation of study treatment, or withdrawal 
from the study. Please refer to Section 2 for timing of assessments. Tumor assessments at other 
time points may be performed if the investigator is concerned about tumor progression. Assessment of response will be outlined for each combination therapy in the specific FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol. Assessments of PR and CR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks after
initial res ponse. Assessment of tumor response will be reported by the investigator for appropriate 
populations of participants, as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria (see Appendix 5) for participants 
with solid tumors. Same modality/sca nner should be used for all assessments.
Changes in tumor measurements and tumor responses  will be assessed by th e investigator using 
RECIST v1.1 criteria.
54Investigators will also re port the number and size of new lesions that 
appear while on study. The time point of tumor assessments will be reported on the CRF based on 
the investigator’s assessment using RE CIST v1.1 criteria. (See Appendix 5 and Section 7.4.2 for 
specifics of RECIST v1.1 criteria to be utilized in this study.)
Tumor assessments will be submitted to a third party radiology ve ndor on an ongoi ng basis; 
participant management is not dependent on third-party review of tumor assessments.
As a participant’s response to prior therapy is an important part of medical history, additional 
details regarding the previous therapy, including but not limited to best response to therapy, timing 
of progression on prior therapy, method of how the progression was measured, existence of

confirmation scan to document progression and detailed information such as other clinical 
evidence (eg, increased p ain requiring palliative radiotherapy) to support progression, 
response/progression dates, and reason for discontinuation will be collected in this trial.
9.1.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Central assessments are not planned for this study; however, copies of all scans will be stored for 
possible future central analysis, if determined to be necessary by BMS. At the S ponsor’s discretion, 
scans may be collected centrally to be reviewed by independent radiologists.
9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by the pa rticipant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant’s legally authorized representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, doc umenting, a nd reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, that are considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting are specified in Appendix 3.
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection of nonserious AE information s hould begin at init iation of study tr eatment and
continue until 100 days following the last dose of study treatment and at the time points specified 
in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 2 and the On-treatment Pro cedural Outline(s) specific to 
each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol). Nonserious AE information s hould also be 
collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other observational period intended to 
establish a baseline status for the participants.
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the IBs represent th e Reference Safety Information to determine 
expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Following the participant’s written consent to 
participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to st udy tr eatment, must be 
collected, including those thought to be a ssociated with protocol-specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of 
discontinuation of dosing. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later 
protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up sk in biopsy). Participants who are randomized and 
never treated with study treatment must have SAEs collected for 30 days from the d ate of 
randomization.
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure.
•Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF section.
•All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3.

•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of this being 
available.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a d eath, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
Every AE must be assessed by the investigator wi th regard to whether it is considered immune
mediated. For events which are potentially immune mediated, additional information will be collected on the participant’s CRF.
Immune-mediated AEs are AEs consisten t with an immune-mediated mechanism or 
immune-mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. Immune-mediated AEs can include events with an alternate 
etiology that were exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunity. I nformation supporting the 
assessment will be collected on the participant’s CRF.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited duri ng open-ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a participant. (In order to prevent reporting bias, participants should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be followed to resoluti on or stabilization or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatmen t as appropriate.
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorde d and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of s upplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigat or is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and nonserious AEs of special interest (as defined in each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer Sub-Protocol) will be  followed until resolution, until the condition 
stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or un til the participant is lost to follow-up (as 
defined in Section 8.3 ).
Further information on follow-up pro cedures is given in Appendix 3.

9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
•Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical re sponsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
•An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor w ill file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
The Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to  regulatory authorities and ethics commit tees 
according to local applicable laws including E uropean Directive 2001/20/EC and Food and Drug 
Administration Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A Suspected, Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities and inves tigators following local and global guidelines and requirements.
9.2.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5 half-lives- after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor (or designee) of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form to BMS Medical Monitor (or designee) within  24 hours of awareness of the event and in 
accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 3 .
In most cases, the study treatment w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner 
(eg, dose tapering if necessary for participan t safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor (or 
designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.
Follow-up information regarding the course of  the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be re ported to 
the BMS (or designee). In order for the BMS (or designee) to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partne r, the female partner mu st sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this information. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
In cases where a study drug can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to potentially 
cause fetal toxicity, and if any sexual activity (eg, vaginal, anal, oral) has occurred between a male participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the information should be reported to the Sponsor or designee, even if the male participant has undergone a successful vasectomy. In order for 
Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance i nformation from the female pa rtner, 
the female partner(s) must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information. Information on the pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.

9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities  should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate.  Paper forms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study tr eatment
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the pa rticipant to receive specific
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
9.2.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of init ial liv er-related laboratory a bnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential drug-i nduced liver injury (p-DILI) event. All occurrences 
of p-DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 andAppendix 
3 for reporting details).
p-DILI is defined as follows:
•Aminotransferase (AT) (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 ×ULN
AND•Total bilirubin > 2 ×ULN, without init ial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline
phosphatase)
AND•No other immediately a pparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia,
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, preexisting chronic or acute liver disease, or the
administration of other treatment(s) known to be hepatotoxic or cancer metastases.
The key responsibilities for investigators during p-DILI assessment include the following: (i) early 
detection, medical evaluation (including the exclusi on of other potentia l causes), and rapid 
laboratory c onfirmation of liver-related abnor malities and (ii) BMS notification of p-DILI cases 
via SAE forms. Following the gathering and assessment of relevant clinical information, BMS is 
responsible for the following: (iii) timely evaluation and triaging of p-DILI cases, (iv) expedited 
reporting of p-DILI cases, and (v) expanded review of p-DILI cases, including a detailed assessment of all available clinical information, investigations, and biochemical data.
Investigators are expected to monitor ongoing routine and ad hoc hepatic laboratory test results to 
rapidly determine whether a participant meets p-DILI criteria. They are expected to promptly 
notify BMS of all p-DILI cases. p-DILI cases ma y be identified by abnorm al liver biochemistry 
values, whether or not they are accompanied by liver-related signs and/or symptoms. In both cases, expedited confirmation with repeat laboratory testi ng should occur within 3 business days using a

Hepatic Laboratory Panel (ALT, AST, total b ilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase). Any participant
with an abnormal Hepatic Laboratory Panel th at meets p-DILI criteria is a candidate for study 
treatment discontinuation. Any confirmed p-DILI  events must be reported (along with a 
description of the clinical findings) to BMS as an SAE within 24 hours of confirmation. 
An extensive clinical history, examination, and appropriate investigations s hould be ob tained to 
exclude cholestatic and other apparent causes that may explain the observed a bnormalities in liver 
function and/or hepatic signs and symptoms. Other apparent causes include, nonexhaustively and 
by way of example only, infectious diseases (such as active hepatitis A, B, and C), congenital 
diseases (such as Gilbert’s syndrome), neoplas tic diseases (such as hepatocellular carcinoma), 
autoimmune diseases (such as primary biliary cirr hosis), and the use of concomitant hepatotoxic 
medications (such as antibiotics, oral contraceptive pill, and herbal medicines). All investigations to exclude potential causes of liver function a bnormalities or hepatic signs and/or symptoms should 
be guided by relevant factors su ch as the participant’s age, gender, clinical history, and signs and 
symptoms.
9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during inter im or final physical examinations, ECG, X-ray 
filming, and any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should also 
be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.
9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. See  Appendix 3  for reporting overdose.
9.4 Safety
Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities in  Section 2
and the On-treatment Proce dural Outline(s) specific to each FRACTION-Gastric Cancer
Sub-Protocol.
9.4.1 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety re port.
A local laboratory will perform the analyses a nd will provide reference ranges for these tests. The 
clinical laboratory assessments are indicated in Table 9.4.1-1 .
Results of clinical laboratory tests performed on Day -1 must be available prior to dosing.
Results of all laboratory tests required by this prot ocol must be provided to BMS, recorded either 
on the laboratory pages of the CRF or by anot her mechanism, as agreed upon between the 
investigator and BMS (eg, provided electronically). If the units of a test result differ from those 
printed on the CRF, the recorded laboratory values must specify the correct units. Any abnormal laboratory test result considered clinically significan t by the investigator must be recorded on the 
appropriate AE page of the CRF (see Section 9.2.6 ).

9.9.1 Patient-reported Outcomes
The effects of GC and its treatment on health status and quality of life will be assessed using the 
3-level version of EQ-5D self-report ques tionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) and Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-Gastric (FACT-Ga) Gastric Ca ncer Subscale (GaCS), a nd/or Esophagus Cancer 
Subscale (ECS) from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal (FACT-E).58,59,60
Participants will be asked to comp lete the assessments during on-study clinic visits and/or at 
designated visits during the Safety and Surviv al Follow-up Phases. The questionnaires  will be 
provided in the part icipant’s preferred language (if available) or in English and may be 
administered by telephone during the Survival Follow-up Phase. A standardized script in the 
participant’s preferred language (if available) will be used to facilitate telephone administration of the EQ-5D-3L. Section 2 and the On-treatment Procedural Outline(s) in each FRACTION-Gastric
Cancer Sub-Protocol provide i nformation regarding the timing of patient-reported outcomes 
assessments.
Participants’ reports of general health, functional status, and utility for h ealth will be measured 
using the EQ-5D-3L. The EQ-5D-3L is a standa rdized instrument used to measure self-reports of 
health status and functioning. The in strument’s descriptive system c onsists of 5 dimensions, which 
are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each d imension 
has 3 levels, reflecting “no health problems, ” “moderate h ealth problems,” and “extreme h ealth 
problems.” A d imension for which there are no problems is said to be at Level 1, while a dimension 
for which there are extreme problems is said to be at Level 3. Thus, the vectors 11111 and 33333 
represent the best health state and the worst health state, respectively, described by the EQ-5D-3L. Altogether, the instrument describes 3
5or 243 health s tates. Empirically derived weights can be 
applied to an individual’s responses to the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system to generate an index 
measuring the value to society of his or her c urrent health. Such preference-weighting systems 
have been developed for Japan, United Kingdom, US, Spain, Germany, and numerous other 
populations. In addition, the EQ-5D-3L includes a visual analog scale that allows respondents to 
rate their own current  health on a 101-point scale ranging from “best imaginable” to “worst 
imaginable” health. 
In addition to the EQ-5D (which all participants will comp lete), participants w ill also comp lete 
one or more disease-specific symptom subscales based on their cancer type:
•Participants with GC cancer  will complete the F unctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-
Gastric (FACT-Ga) Gastric Cancer Subscale (GaCS) 
•Participants with EC will complete the Esophagus Cancer Subscale (ECS) from the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal (FACT-E).
•Participants with GEJ will complete items from both the GaCS and ECS subscales.

The FACT-Ga is a validated, cancer-targeted measure of disease-related symptoms, functioning, 
and well-being. Nineteen of the FACT-Ga questi onnaire’s items comprise the disease-specific 
GaCS, which assesses GC symptoms and impacts relating to pain, reflux, dysphagia, eating 
difficulties, tiredness, weakness, interference, and difficulty planning. Each GaCS item is rated on 
a 5-point scale ranging fro m 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A su mmary score is derived by 
aggregating responses for the 19 items, with higher scores indicating less symptom burden.
The FACT-E is a validated, cancer-targeted measure of disease-related symptoms, functioning, 
and well-being. Seventeen of the FACT-E questionnaire’s items comprise the disease-specific 
ECS, which assesses esophageal cancer symptoms and impacts relating to swallowing, eating, dry mouth, trouble breathing, co mmunicating with others, appetite, coughing, pain and weight loss. 
Each ECS item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A summary 
score is derived by aggregating responses for the 17 items, with higher scores indicating less 
symptom burden.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination
Sample sizes are guided by Simon 2-stage (optimal) designs. Because of the different participant 
populations (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 treatment-naïve versus anti-PD-1, 
anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment e xperienced) and exis ting options under each track, 
different criteria are applied to determine the number of participants for each stage and the strength 
of the efficacy signal that would recommend proceeding to the next stage. Details are described in 
subsequent sections and in Table 10.1-1 . Any additional statist ical considerations unique to the 
new treatment combinations will be described in the new sub-protocols.
For sample size calculation and fo r simplicity of description, recommendations for stopping or 
progressing to the next stage are based on the number of objective responses observed. However, 
since best overall response (BOR) does not necessa rily capture the full extent of clinical benefit 
and since response can be delayed or of short duration, BMS w ill also review other aspects of 
clinical benefit that may better predict OS benefit, such as DOR and PFSR, as well as the relative performance of different study treatment combin ation arms, before making a final determination.
Enrollment will be continued after reaching the indicated number of participants at Stage 1 while 
the initial eff icacy evaluation is ongoing. This will allow additional par ticipants to enroll to account 
for unexpected trial impact, such as response nonevaluable participants due to early dropout, 
design parameter change (eg., historical rate update), etc.
Although the sample size calculations are based on e fficacy considerations, safety will also be 
continuously assessed and will be taken into account in the decision to continue or terminate a 
study treatment arm. In Track 2, 41 par ticipants per study treatment arm in Stages 1 and 2 
combined will result in 88% probability of detecting an AE that has a true rate of 5%. More participants per study tr eatment arm in Stages 1 and 2 combined will result in a higher probability 
of detecting an AE that has a true rate of 5%.

Note: Numbers of responses serve as a guideline; however, the totality of efficacy data will be considered when making decision s to terminate or continue an arm.
The Track 1 Simon 2-stage (optimal) design assumes a historical response rate of 20% and a target response rate of 40%, based o n the 
observed response rate of approximately 24% for the nivolumab in  combination with ipilimumab and approximately 12% for nivoluma b 
monotherapy participants in Study CA209032. A false positive rate of 5% and power of 90% are used.
Because there is very little data available on participants with prior anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti CTLA-4 tr eatment, the Track 2 design 
is not based on an observed historical response rate. Rather, the a ssumption is made that a response rate below 5% would not be w orth 
further study and that a target response rate of 20% would be worth pursuing in this population. A false positive rate of 5% and  power 
of 90% are used.With regard to sample size, participants who are re-randomized to a different study treatment in Tr ack 2 will be counted once f or each 
randomization; participants who are retreated within the s ame study treatment arm will only be counted once.

10.1.1 Track 1 - Anti-PD-1, Anti-PD-L1, and Anti-CTLA-4 Treatment-naïve 
Participants
As shown in Table 10.1-1 , a minimum of 19 participants in each study treatment combination arm 
will be tr eated in Stage 1 for an init ial evaluation of e fficacy. If the total number of res ponses 
observed in Stage 1 is ≤4/19, the study treatment combination arm would likely not be considered 
efficacious; otherwise, enrollment to Stage 2 will continue, and an additional 35 participants will 
be treated. If the total number of responses at the end of Stage 2 is ≤ 15/54, the study treatment 
combination arm will be terminated for fut ility; if there are more than 15 res ponses observed at 
the end of Stage 2, the study treatment combination arm may be carried on for further treatment 
development. The totality of efficacy data and response profile for each combination arm will be considered when making decisions to terminate or continue an arm.
The operating characteristics of this Simon 2-stage (optimal) design are provided in Figure 10.1.1-
1. With the stopping boundaries as shown in Table 10.1-1 , if the study treatment combination arm 
has an ORR no better than the historical control at 20%, then there is a 95% overall chance of 
stopping for fut ility, with a 67% chance of stopping at Stage 1; there is a 5% false positive rate. If 
the study treatment combination arm has an ORR equal to the target of 40%, then there is a 90% 
chance of declaring efficacy after Stage 2, wh ereas if the true ORR is 25%, 30%, or 35%, the 
power would be 21%, 49%, or 75%, respectively.

If 16 responses are observed at the end of Stage 2 (Declare Efficacy), then the 90% confidence 
interval (CI) for ORR will be (19%, 42%). The CI is calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.
As stated in Section 10.1 , the number of responses given here is used for sample size calculation 
and for simplicity of description. Before making a decision to terminate or continue an arm, BMS will also review the totality of all available data, which includes other aspects of efficacy that may help predict OS benefit, such as DOR and PFSR; clinical safety information; and biomarker data,
as well as the relative performance of other treatment arms.
10.1.2 Track 2 - Anti-PD-1, Anti-PD-L1, or Anti-CTLA-4 Treatment-experienced 
Participants
For each study tr eatment combin ation arm under Track 2, the Simon 2-stage (optimal) design will 
be used. Initially, 21 participants per st udy tr eatment combination arm will be treated in Stage 1
and preliminary efficacy will be assessed when those participants are evaluable. If 1 or fewer 
responses are observed in Stage 1, the study tr eatment combination arm would likely not be 
considered efficacious; otherwise, Stage 2 will be initiated and enroll an additional 20 participants, 
for a total of 41 participants per study tr eatment combination ar m. The totality of efficacy data and 
response profile for each combination will be considered when making decisions to termin ate or 
continue an arm.
The operating characteristics of this Simon 2-stage (optimal) design are provided in Figure 10.1.2-

has an ORR no better than 5%, then there is a 95% overall chance of stopping for fu tility, with a 
72% chance of stopping at Stage 1; there is a 5% false positive rate.  If the study treatment 
combination arm has an ORR equal to the target of 20%, then it has a 90% chance of declaring
efficacy after Stage 2.

If 5 responses are observed at the end of Stage 2 (Declare Efficacy), then the 90% CI for ORR will 
be (5%, 24%). The CI is calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.
As stated in Section 10.1 , the number of responses given here is used for sample size calculation 
and for simplicity of description. Before making a decision to terminate or continue an arm, BMS 
will also review the totality of all available data, which includes other aspects of efficacy that may help predict OS benefit, such as DOR and PFSR; clinical safety information;  and biomarker data,
as well as the relative performance of other treatment arms.
Both participants previously treated in any track (re -randomized participants) and new participants 
who meet eligibility criteria are permitted to enter Track 2. Some slots in Track 2 w ill be reserved 
for re-randomized participants to ensure that both types of participants are enrolled in Track 2. At 
the initiation of the study, recruitment of re-randomized pa rticipants will be limited to 
11 participants per Track 2 study tr eatment combination arm in Stage 1. In Stage 2, recruitment of 
additional re-rando mized pa rticipants w ill be limited to 12 participants out of the 27 additional 
participants. The limited number of re-randomized participants may be re-adjusted depending on the enrollment rates, the rate of progression in Tracks 1 and 2, and the number of currently open 
study treatment arms in Track 2.

Population Description
Response-evaluable All treated participants with measurable disease and 1 of the following: 1) at 
least 1 postbaseline tumor measurement, 2) clinical progression, or 3) death
10.3 Statistical Analyses
The statist ical analy sis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock. Below is a 
summary of planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.
10.3.1 Efficacy Analyses
The primary efficacy analyses w ill be pe rformed on treated  population for the final analysis. 
Efficacy analyses based on the response-evalu able population may be pe rformed for interim 
analyses, when the minimum follow-up period is less than sufficient to warrant adequate 
interpretation of the result.  Details on censoring scheme on time-to-event endpoints such as DOR, 
PFS, and OS will be described in the SAP.
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
ORR
BOR for a participant will be assessed per 
RECIST v1.1 by investigator.Estimate of ORR and corresponding 2-sided exact 95% CI 
will be derived using the Clopper-Pearson method by study 
treatment under each track.
Median DOR
DOR for a participant with a BOR of CR or PR 
is defined as the time between the date of first response and the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression per RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first.Median DOR using the Kaplan-Meier method and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI will be derived using Brookmeyer and Crowley methodology (using log-log transformation) by study treatment under each track.
PFSR at 24 weeks
PFS for a participant is defined as the time from 
the first dosing date to the date of first objectively documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.Estimate by the Kaplan-Meier method and corresponding 95% CI will be derived based on Greenwood formula by study treatment unde r each track.
OS rate at certain time points
OS for a participant is defined as the time from 
the first dosing date to the date of death due to any cause.Estimate by the Kaplan-Meier method and corresponding 
95% CI will be derived based on Greenwood formula by 
study treatment unde r each track.
Treatments under each track for different populations will be analyzed independently. There is no 
intention to combine the same study treatment across tracks for efficacy analyses.
Efficacy from retreatment will be assessed and analyzed separately from the initial treatment.
Participants re-randomized into Track 2 will be co mbined with participants originally randomized 
into Track 2 for efficacy analysis.Specific analyses to be performed for each track are shown in Table 10.3.1-1 .

Track 1 - Anti-PD-1, Anti-PD-L1, and Anti-CTLA-4 Treatment-naïve Participants
The following additional analyses will be performed for Track 1 anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and 
anti-CTLA-4 treatment-naïve participants combined at  end of Stage 2. These efficacy analyses 
will be performed when the study tr eatment arms have been fully enrolled and followed up for at 
least 6 months. A descriptive odds ratio and estimate of the difference in ORRs, along with corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs, w ill be provi ded to evaluate differences between the 
2 randomized study treatment arms (FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study treatment combination arm and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab control arm). Additionally, for each studytreatment arm, the ORR and corresponding 95% CIs will be calculated using Clopper-Pearson method. A descriptive hazard ratio and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI of PFS and OS w ill be 
estimated in a Cox proportional hazards mo del using study treatment as a single covariate to 
evaluate difference between the 2 study treatment arms (experimental and control arms). The PFS 
and OS curves for each study tr eatment arm will be estimated. Two-sided 95% CIs for median 
PFS and OS will be computed. PFSR at 24 weeks and s urvival rates at certain time points
(eg, 2 years) will be estimated. Associated 2-sided 95% CIs will be calculated.
10.3.2 Safety Analyses
All safety analyses will be performed on the treated population.
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs 
leading to discontinuation and deaths
AEs will be graded according to 
CTCAE Version 4.03.Frequency distribution of treated participants with AE using the worst 
CTC grade on treatment. Participants will be counted once at the PT 
level, once at the SOC level, and once in the “Total subject” row at their worst CTC grade, regardless of SOC or PT.
Laboratory abnormalities
Laboratory values will be graded 
according to CTCAE Version 4.03.Laboratory shift table using worst CTC grade on treatment per 
participant.
Abbreviations: CTC = Common Terminology Criteria; PT = preferred term; SOC = system organ class.
Same treatments under different tracks with different  populations may be combined for safety 
analyses.

10.3.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The concentration-time data ob tained in this study may be combined with data from other studies 
in the clinical development program to develop a population PK model. This model may be used 
to evaluate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic covariates on the PK of each component of each 
FRACTION-Gastric Cancer study treatment combination and/or nivolumab in combin ation with 
ipilimumab and to determine measures of individua l exposure (such as steady-state peak, trough, 
and time-averaged concentration). Model-determined exposures may be used for exposure-response-analyses of s elected eff icacy and safety endpoints. Results of p opulation PK and 
exposure-response analyses will be reported separately.
10.3.3.2 Immunogenicity Analyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Incidence of ADA to individual component of study treatment 
combination arm
Baseline ADA-positive participant is defined as a participant
who has an ADA 孰detected sample at baseline.aAn 
ADA-positive participant is a participant with at least 
1 ADA-positive sample relative to baseline after initiation of 
the study treatment 孱Frequency distribution of baseline 
ADA-positive participants and ADA-positive 
participants after initiation of the st udy 
treatment
aBaseline sample is the last sample before initiation of the st udy tr eatment.
10.3.3.3 Exploratory Biomarker Analyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Summary measures of change (or % change) from baseline in 
various biomarkers Summary statistics by planned study day and treatment under each track; plots of the time 
course of biomarkers
If there is indication of meaningful pattern over time, further analysis (eg, by linear mixed model) 
may be performed to characterize the relationshi p. Methods such as, but not limited to, logistic 
regression will be used to explore possible associations between biomarker measures  
 and clinical outco mes. Additional details will be provided in the 
statist ical analysis plan. Exploratory biomarker/phar macodynamic analysis may be presented 
separately from the main clinical study report.

10.3.4 Interim Analyses
Data from individual study treatment arms under each track of this study may emerge at different 
times; timely decisions (including early termination) for each individual study tr eatment under 
different tracks are needed. Database lock an d analysis for certain FRACTION-Gastric Cancer
study treatment combination arms w ill be performed when all participants in these study tr eatment 
combination arms (under each track) have co mpleted treatment and wi th sufficient follow- up. 
Potential interim analyses for each study tr eatment combination arm under each track at the end 
of Stage 1 (6 months after the first treatment date of the last participant within that arm) w ill be 
performed. These interim analyses will be performed independent of each other.
The SMB will have access to interim reports of safety and will provide advice to the Sponsor 
regarding study treatment arm termination due to safety concerns.
The statist ical analysis plan w ill further describe the planned interim analyses.
Additional interim analyses may also be performed for administrative purposes or publications. 
No formal inferences requiring any adjustment to statistical significance level will be performed.

APPENDIX 2 STUDY GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
The term ‘Participant’ is used in the protocol to refer to a person who has consented to participate 
in the clinical research study. The term ‘Subject’ used in the electronic case report form (eCRF) is 
intended to refer to a person (Participant) who has consented to participate in the clinical research study.
REGULATORY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE
This study will be conducted in accordance with:
•Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration 
of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) 
International Ethical Guidelines, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
•as defined by the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH)
•in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC
•United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50) 
•applicable local requirements.
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments 
and the participant i nformed consent will r eceive approval/favorable opinion by Institutional 
Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IE C), and regulatory authorities according to 
applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study.
All potential serious breaches must be re ported to the Sponsor or designee immediately. A 
potential serious breach is defined as a Quality I ssue (eg, protocol, deviation, etc) that is likely to 
affect, to a significant degree, one or more of the following: (1) the physical, safety or mental 
integrity of one or more subjects/participants; (2) the scientific value of the trial (eg, reliability and 
robustness of generated data). Items (1) or (2) can be associated with either GCP Regulation(s) or Trial protocol(s).)
Personnel involved in conducting this st udy will be qu alified by education, traini ng, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.This study will not use the services of study pe rsonnel where sanctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE
Before study initiation, the investigator must ha ve written and dated approval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, participant recruitment materials 
(eg, advertisements), and any other written infor mation to be provided to subjects/participants. The 
investigator or Bristol-Meyers Squibb (BMS) should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator Broc hure or product labeling information to be provided to subjects/participants and 
any updates.

The investigator, Sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other 
information (eg, expedited safety reports, am endments, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROTOCOL AND PROTOCOL REVISIONS
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study subjects/participants.
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining relevant approval/favorable opinion(s) the de viation or change will  be submitte d, as soon 
as possible to:
•IRB/IEC 
•Regulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by lo cal regulations (per national requirements)
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority must be sent to BMS.
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revise d and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from 
subjects/participants currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) 
the new form must be used to obtain consent from new subjects/participants prior to enrollment.
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Investigators and su b-Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit comp lete and 
accurate financial certification or disclos ure statements to the appropriate h ealth aut horities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of 
the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.
INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS
Investigators must ensure that subjects/participants are clearly and fully informed a bout the 
purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer 
to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given by subjects/participants, their legally acceptable 
representatives (as per country guidelines) ar e clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant 
volunteers to participate.

Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample 
informed consent form which will include all  elements required by ICH, GCP, and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sample informed cons ent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
•Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the participant is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be non-technical and easily understood. 
•Allow time necessary for participant or par ticipant's legally acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.
•Obtain an informed consent signed and personally d ated by the participant or the participant's 
legally acceptable representative and by the pe rson who conducted the informed consent 
discussion. 
•Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects/participants, prior to the beginning of 
the study, and after any revisions are completed for new information.
If informed consent is initially given by a par ticipant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the participant subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the participant.
Revise the informed consent whenever impor tant new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the participant’s consent. The i nvestigator, or a person desi gnated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the participant or the participant’s leg ally accep table representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the st udy and of any new information relevant to the 
participant’s willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication s hould be 
documented. The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects/participants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the 
subjects’/participants’ signed informed consent form and, in the United States, the subjects’/participants’ signed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records. 
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects/participants are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.
For the Fast Real-time Assessment of Combination Therapies in Immuno-ONcology 
(FRACTION) Program, participants should r eceive consent forms th at include relevant 
information for all tr eatments to which they are eligible for enrollment; participants will not 
receive consent forms that include data relevant to agents within the FRACTION Program that are 
not within the Sub-Protocol for which they are screened. Informed consents to Sub-Protocols that

Sub-Protocol that is closed or terminated will receive pertinent updated safety and risk information 
if it becomes known. Participants in any foll ow-up phase may receive revised informed consent 
via mail and follow-up phone call by the investigator site.
SOURCE DOCUMENTS
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attributable, whether  the data are hand-written on paper or entered 
electronically. If source data  are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computerized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such systems must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/ or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs),
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol re quired assessments, and/or drug accountability 
records).
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated 
activities, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy consists of a copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all of the same attributes and information as the original. 
STUDY TREATMENT RECORDS
Records for study treatments (whether supplied by BMS, its vendors, or the site) must substantiate 
study treatment integrity and traceability from receipt, preparation, administration, and through 
destruction or return. Records must be made available for review at the request of BMS/designee 
or a Health Authority.

commercial supply, or a sp ecialty 
pharmacy)The investigator or desi gnee accepts re sponsibility 
for documenting traceability and study treatment 
integrity in accordance with requirements applicable 
under law and the standard operating procedures (SOPs)/standards of the sourcing pharmacy.
BMS or designee will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the i nvestigational site does not have an 
established system that meets these requirements.
CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each i ndividual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be coll ected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be re quested for adverse events (AEs) and/or 
laboratory abnormalities that are re ported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the Sponsor or designee elect ronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs w ill be 
prepared for all da ta collection fields except for f ields specific to serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and pregnancy, which will be reported on th e electronic SAE form a nd Pregnancy Surveillance

may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study-specific CRF completion guidelines provided by Sponsor or designee. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects/participants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entrie s and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinve stigator and who is delegated this task on the 
Delegation of Authority Form. Subinvestigators in Japan may not be delegated the CRF approval 
task. For electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically through the 
BMS electronic data capture tool. The investigat or must retain a copy of the CRFs including 
records of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet S ponsor or designee training 
requirements and must only access the BMS elect ronic data capture tool using the unique user 
account provided by Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other 
individuals.
MONITORING
Monitoring d etails describing strategy, including defini tion of study critical data items and 
processes (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk management and 
mitigation strategies and analytical risk-b ased monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and 
requirements, including handling of noncomplian ce issues and monitoring techniques (central, 
remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity. On site they w ill review study records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source 
documents.
In addition, the study may be evaluated by Sponsor  or designee internal auditors and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study 
facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections scheduled by regu latory aut horities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to Sponsor or designee. 
RECORDS RETENTION
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must retain all st udy records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified  by BMS or designee, whichever is longer. The

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTINGADVERSE 
EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation par ticipant administered study treatment 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hemato logy, clinical ch emistry, or uri nalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant 
in the medical a nd scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-exis ting condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the investigator), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical procedure  (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, th en it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which  the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE below)
NOTE: 
The following hospitalizations are not cons idered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
•routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of  health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other than to remed y ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
•admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a med ical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the partici pant or may require intervention [e.g., medical,

EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration 
will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Investigat or’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is one of the criter ia used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up re ports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study tr eatment or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have serum fol licle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: F emales tr eated with hormone replacement therapy, (H RT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durations of 
the washout periods below are suggested guidelines and the i nvestigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels.
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.

APPENDIX 5 RECIST v1.1
1 ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL TUMOR BURDEN AND MEASURABLE 
DISEASE
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease 
is defined by the presence of at least one measurable tumor lesion. When CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes w ill be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:1.1 Measurable lesions
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimensi on (longest diameter in the 
plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
•10 mm by CT/MRI scan - (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
•10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesio ns which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
•20 mm by chest x-ray
•Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged andmeasurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.
1.2 Non-measurable lesions
•All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  
•Lesions considered truly non-measurable includ e:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that in not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to measure 
bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance 
of bone lesions. 
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techni ques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.

1.3.2 Cystic lesions
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts s hould not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts. 
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cy stic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions 
are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional 
therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
1.4 Specifications by methods of measurements
1.4.1 Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). All baseline evaluations should be 
performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 28 days before the 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
1.4.2.1 CT/MRI scan
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to meas ure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumption that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
1.4.2.2 Chest X-ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if  they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated
lung.
1.4.2.3 Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As previously noted, 
when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.

1.4.2.4 Ultrasound

measurement. If new lesions are identified by ul trasound in the course of the study, confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised. 
1.4.2.5 Endoscopy, laparoscopy
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.
1.4.2.6 Tumor markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesion sand will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be s elected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted below, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
2.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥≥15 mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. Nodes 
that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-patholog ical and s hould not be recorded or 
followed.
2.2 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).

3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (P R):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of di ameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study). In addition to the relative in crease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm . (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shri nkage to qualify for PR nor suff icient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
3.1.1 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
3.1.1.1 Lymph nodesLymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded and should be measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination, even 
if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, 
since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.
3.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
However, when such a lesion becomes diff icult to assign an exact measure to then:
•if it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
•if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but 
should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).   
3.1.1.3 Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
•When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
•As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced

BMS-986217 FRACTION-Gastric Cancer
such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should 
be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead 
should be assessed only qualitatively at th e time points specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-ta rget lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-
pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. ( Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special notes on assessment of non-target lesions
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows:
3.2.1.1 When the subject also has measurable disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more  non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status. 
3.2.1.2 When the subject has only non-measurable disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more  non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
qualify for unequivocal progression status. 
•Because worsening in non-target disease ca nnot be easily quantified (by definition: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if  the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden representing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which  is equivalent to a 20% increase di ameter in a 
measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, 
an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. 
•If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject should be consid ered to have had overall PD 
at that point.

3.2.1.3 Tumor markers
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor responses. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize in order for a subject to be considered 
as having attained a complete response. 
3.3 New lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions deno tes disease progression. The finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal: i.e. not attr ibutable to differences in s canning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly important 
when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a 
liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report  as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was notscanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the subject
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan ordered which 
reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely 
a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
3.3.1 FDG-PET evaluation
While FDG-PET response assessments need additi onal study, it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of the qualitative assessm ent of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the 
basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following al gorithm: 
•Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion. 
•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: 
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
CT, this is PD. 
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if ther e is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the init ial positive FDG-PET 
scan).
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.

ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. To be assigned a status of
CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by consecutive repeat 
assessments that should be pe rformed no less than 28 days after  the criteria for response are 
first met. For this study, the next schedu led tumor assessment can meet this requirement.
•
4.2 Best overall response: All timepoints
The best overall response is determined once all the data for th e subject is known. It is the best 
response recorded from the start of the study tr eatment un til the objectively documented 
progression per RECIST v 1.1 or subs equent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first (taking into

account any requirement for confirmation). The s ubject’s best overall response assignment will 
depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration 
the appearance of new lesions. 
Best response is defined as the best response across all time points with subsequent confirmation. 
Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if  the criteria for each are met at a subsequent 
time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later). 
In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as specified in Table 2. When SD 
is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified minimum t ime from baseline.
Measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval 
(in general not less than 6 weeks).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed

when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the subject had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
4.3 Duration of response
4.3.1 Duration of overall response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) un til the firs t date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded on study).
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
4.3.2 Duration of stable disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in rando mized tr ials, from date of 
randomization) until the criter ia for progression are met, taking as reference the sm allest sum on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).

APPENDIX 6 NIVOLUMAB MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor represe nting the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. No n-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary th erapy for immuno-oncology drug-related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low-
grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultation with a medical or s urgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used. The frequency and severity of the related 
adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen 
being used.

was updated from “prior to first dose of study treatment” to “prior to randomization.” It was clarified that the adequacy of the tumor tissue must be confirmed by the central laboratory prior to randomization.Collection timing and assessment of pretreatment tumor biopsies was updated to clarify the information for study sites.
Section 3.2.1 
FRACTION-Gastric 
CancerAn update was made to indicate that pembrolizumab is an Anti-PD-1 antibody. The following information was also added: “pembrolizumab is also approved (accelerated approval) for the treatment of patients with MSI-H/dMMR cancers with no satisfactory alternative treatment options.”This update was made to explicitly describe anti-PD-1 as an SOC option for MSI-H cancers in lack of satisfactory treatment alternatives.

performance of correlative studies. Subjects who 
either do not consent to a pre-treatment tumor biopsy or do not have accessible lesions are not eligible. Fresh biopsy must be confirmed received by central lab before randomization. The biopsy sample must meet the minimum quality requirements and H&E assessment is to be performed primarily at the central laboratory. If fresh biopsy is not clinically feasible or safe, the option of archival tissue can be discussed with BMS if the biopsy was obtained within 90 days of 
study enrollment and there was no intervening 
systemic anticancer or IO therapy. Biopsy requirements has been updated in order to:

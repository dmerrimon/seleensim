Title of study : Association of select EMR -based covariates with oral anticoagulant 
medication selection
Version and date: Version 1.0 , 02 November 2016
 
 
Rationale and 
background:A study of safety/effectiveness of dabigatran is being conducted in health 
insurer claims databases that may incompletely capture select variables 
representing covariates. This validation study seeks to ascertain a select set 
of covariates in electronic me dical records (EMRs) linked to a subset of 
patients within the insurance claims data in order to assess the potential for 
unmeasured confounding in observational studies based on insurance 
claims databases only .
Research question 
and objectives:The research question is whether select patient characteristics that may be 
incompletely captured by insurance claims data differ between dabigatran 
and warfarin initiators.
Objectives:
1) Descriptive: To identify select clinical covariates from electronic 
medical records that might be associated with initiation of oral 
anticoagulant medications (dabigatran or warfarin) in patients with NVAF 
at risk for stroke and are not usually well captured in the associated claims 
database.
2) Prediction Rule: To quantify t he association between EMR -based 
clinical characteristics and patterns of insurance claims

Variables: Patient characteristics derived from insurance claims (claims- based 
covariates)
This study will characterize patients initiating oral anticoagulant 
medications with respect to select characteristics, some of which might be 
reflected differently in claims data compared to electronic medical records 
prior to and including the date of initiation. These characteristics from 
EMR data are usually treated as covariates but will be considered 
outcomes in this validation study.
These characteristics include:
Primary Outcomes
• Obesity 
• Smoking 
• Alcohol consumption
• Abnormal renal function 
• Bleeding history or predisposition
• Renal function (estimated GFR)
• Serum Creatinine
• Abnormal liver function
Secondary Outcomes
• Duration of atrial fibrillation 
• History of adherence
• History/duration of hypertension
• Uncontrolled Hypertension (for HAS -BLED)
• History/duration of CHF 
• Prior TIA

EMR- linked subset: approx. 5.5% of the study cohort.
Data analysis: •Analyses will describe the presence in the claims data of each 
EMR- based clinical characteristic among initiators of dabigatran 
and initiators of warfarin.  
•A prediction algorithm to identify in the claims data each of the 
EMR- based clinical characteristic will be developed. The 
prediction algorithm will be estimated using a regression model 
that uses each of the EMR characteristic as the model outcome and 
all available claims- based covariates as predictors.  
•Strength of association between each EMR -based cov ariate and 
medication choice will guide quantitative assessments of potential 
confounding of the association betw een anticoagulant and clinical 
outcomes.

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)7. RATIONALE AND BACKGR OUND
A number of new oral anticoagulants are being developed and marketed to replace vitamin K 
antagonists, one of the most important drugs in modern medicine. [P11-11875] Unlike 
vitamin K a ntagonists, these new drugs do not require dose titration involving intensive 
therapeutic monitoring of prothrombin time to achieve target anticoagulation within a narrow 
therapeutic range. In Phase III studies, these drugs were found to be therapeutically
advantageous or non -inferior over warfarin. In the coming years, as man y as six new 
anticoagulants could be on the market and a lack of valid comparative evidence will hinder 
prescriber and pay or decision -making.
Pharmacoepidemiologic studies based on large administrative claims databases are 
increasingl y utilized for that purpose; however, these data are collected for reasons unrelated 
to research, and as a result, might not contain sufficient information on important 
confounders, such as body  mass index , smoking, family  history , or alcohol consumption, 
leading to residual confounding. Several approaches have been proposed to address the issue 
of unmeasured confounding, and internal validation studies, based on additional data 
obtained for a subset of par ticipants in the main study  population is one of them. Such studies 
offer specific advantages since they  are more representative of the main study  population and 
allow application of methods that do not require assumptions about the direction of 
confoundin g. [R13-2768]
This protocol is for a validation study  conducted within a cohort of patients initiating 
dabigatran or warfarin during October 2010 –December 2014 time period and matched on 
propensity  score (PS). 
Thestudy  will involve targeted data ascertainment from linked
patients for enhanced covariate assessment via extraction from electronic medical records
using existing electronic data including pre-defined variables, with the goal of describing the 
presence of covariates not ty picall y present or insufficientl y measured in claims data in 
dabigatran users as compared to users of warfarin and assessing the potential for confounding 
in the comparative safet y research that will be undertaken in other phases of the study  
program.

This study  represents a form of internal validation stud y that will involve selection of a 
patient sample, extraction of medical record data, and anal yses that will have implications for 
potential confounding in comparative studies of dabigatran effect.
This study  will be conducted within a cohort of NVAF patients at risk for stroke initiating
dabigatran or warfarin during October 2010 – December 2014 time period identified in 
MarketScan research claims database based on Protocol 1160.207 (Sequential Expansion of 
Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants) . 
9.2 SETTING
The data source for this project will be MarketScan, a research claims database from 
commercial emplo yer-sponsored hea lth plans.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.3 VARIABLES
9.3.1 Exposures
The primary  exposure is new initiation of warfarin or dabigatran.  Initiators are defined as no 
anticoagulation with any oral ant icoagulant in the 12 months before the index prescription. 
Comparison between these two groups of initiators will be made with respect to variables 
obtained from the EMR among patients who have been matched on the propensity  score 
derived from insurance cl aims data.
9.3.2 Outcomes
EMR- based clinical characteristics that are t ypically used as covariates will be treated as 
outcomes in this validation study . Unless otherwise noted, all of these outcomes will have an 
indicator for being recorded in EMR (Present, Y/N) . Index date is the date of dabigatran or

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)9.5 STUDY SIZE
This study  will identify  covariates that represent potential confounding variables among 
dabigatran and warfarin users within a sampled population. The ability  to identi fy a covariate 
and the precision for estimating potential confounding from the covariate will depend on the 
numbers of patients from whom electronic medical record data is extracted , and features of 
the covariate itself , such as how certain it is to be rec orded in the medical record and whether 
binary  (yes/no) or other . 
The PS -matched dabi gatran and warfarin initiators during Oct 2010– December 2013 period 
are approximately  20,000 each. Assuming that 5.5% of this study  group will be linked to 
EMR, the EMR -
linked subset up to Dec 2013 will consist of approximately  1100 patients in 
each exposure group. 
The precision of estimated prevalence for a covariate obtained from the EMR depends on the 
prevalence of the c ovariate, and the sample size. With 10,000 dabigatran initiators, this study  
will estimate a patient characteristic that has a 10% prevalence with considerable precision 
(the 95% confidence interval will be 9.4% to 10.6%) (Table 7). A characteristic not captured 
in claims, but present in the medical record with a prevalence of 10% to 20% is plausibly  a 
confounding variable and so this table enumerates character istics with these prevalences. The 
table has not been extended below 10% since such lower prevalence characteristics have 
progressivel y less ability to produce meaningful confounding, so that while the study will 
have less precision to estimate such a characteristic, validation of the presenc e for such a low 
prevalence chara cteristic becomes unnecessary . At the other end of the range presented in the 
table, a characteristic with a prevalence above 20% will be identified with even greater 
precision, so that it also does not nee d to be depicted in the table.

9.7 D ATA ANALYSIS
9.7.1 Main analysis
Representativeness of EMR
We will assess whether the subpopulation with linked EMR data is a representative sample of 
the full MarketScan cohort of oral antico agulant medication initiators. In the full MarketScan
cohort, the proportion of each exposure group with linked EMR data available will be 
determined. We will evaluate the claims -based covariates in the linked and non -linked 
subpopulations, separately  by exposure group as well as overall, by  examining preval ences

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)for categorical covariates and means and standard deviations for continuous covariates. These 
data will be summarized as in the example Table 8 and will allow us to determine if there are 
any patient characteristics that ar e over -represented or under -represented in the EMR 
subpopulation. I f EMR linkage is only  available for a subset with considerably  different 
characteristics than the full cohort or among a subset where the propensity  score balance is 
not retained, then furt her remedies might be applied such as stratification or weighting.

Objective 1: Descriptive
The anal yses for this objective will occur within the subpopulation of individuals with linked 
EMR data and will focus on describing the EMR- based clinical characteristics for the 
dabigatran and warf arin initiators. This table will provide an evaluation of the association 
between the EMR clinical characteristics and initiat ion of dabigatran or warfarin.
 
The prevalence of each category  for categorical characteristics and the mean and standard 
deviation for continuous characte ristics will be calculated (as shown in the example Table 9).  
This analysis will aid in identify ing EMR characteristics that are unbalanced across exposure 
groups and are therefore potential unmeasured confounders after PS match ing.

We will seek to define variables derived from the EMR in a manner that reduces missingness. 
Accordingl y, most variables will be defined as presence or non -presence in the EMR, which 
we will take as a proxy  of being medically- recognized. For example, if smoking is noted in 
the medical record, it will be recorded as present, if it is not present, it will be assumed that 
the patient does not smoke. We will also evaluate the patterns of missing data in t heEMR 
clinical characteristics.
Objective 2: Prediction Rule
Within the EMR linked subpopulation, a prediction model will be developed 
with particular focus on covariates that are found to represent potentially  
important unmea sured confounding in the primary anal ysis.  Specificall y, a logistic 
regression model (potentially  a multinomial logistic regression, depending on the number of 
categories for the EMR characteristic) will be estimated  that 
uses the EMR covariate as the model outcome and all available claims- based covariates as 
predictors.  
 
For continuous EMR
-based characteristic, a 
linear regression model will be estimated.  Coefficients from these models will be reported as 
well as prediction accuracy , defined by  the R2 statistic.

None defined.
9.8 QUALITY CONTROL
All aspects of data anal ysis will be conducted according to standard procedures of the 
Division of Pharmacoepidemiology
. Programming for this project will be conducted by  a 
primary  anal yst and validated by  a separate anal yst (validation anal yst). For all d ata 
processing and anal ysis steps, the validation analyst will review the program along with input 
and output data sets, and for select steps of the project will employ  double programming 
techniques to reduce the potential for programming errors.
9.9 LIMITATIO NSOF THE RESEARCH METH ODS
This is a validation study and we are not assessing the association between EMR -based 
patient characteristics and clinical outcomes.
The source claims data include limitations with respect to certainty  of the capture of 
exposure, covariates, and outcomes. As a comprehensive insurance database, essentiall y all 
billable medical services will result in claims for reimbursement, so that the certainty  of 
capture is tied to likelihood of a claim being submitted to the insurer.
Although more information on covariates is captured in EMR, some data will be missing in 
EMR as well. In addition, information is assessed during routine medical care (not in a 
standardized way ) and some variation in assessment persists but cannot be stud
ied within the 
scope of the stud y.
As in any  EMR source, there could be potentially  small number of dabigatran initiators and 
they might not represent dabigatran initiators in the general population. In addition, the data 
sources for this study are commer cial US data sources (based on emplo yed people and their 
dependents), so they  tend to over -represent working -age people. The data are supplemented 
with elderly  through patients with certain t ypes of Medicare coverage (Medicare Advantage); 
however, elderl y with Medicare Advantage tend to be healthier and more likely  to still be 
employ ed as compared to elderl y with other t ypes of Medicare. These features of data may  
further limit the generalizability  in that the results will be most generalizable to US people
who are employ ed.[P13-03077, P13-03078]

Cohort formation
Initiators of dabigatran and warfarin will be matched on their PS to initiate the treatment of 
interest (dabigatran) and the calendar quarter of initiation. PS will be derived from predicted 
probabilities of treatment initiation with dabigatran as compared to warfarin estimated in a 
logistic regression model that includes all claims -based covariates identified in this protocol 
 The PS will be 
used to match dabigatran initiators to warfarin initiators on a 1:1 fixed ratio basis using a 
nearest -neighbor algorithm. 
9.11.2 EMR -linked subset
From the PS -matched cohorts we will identify  patients who have EMR data available. Most 
analyses wil l be performed in this group. We expect that the EMR- linked subset is a random 
subset so that the covariate balance achieved b y propensity score matching in the overall 
cohorts will be retained in the EMR subsets. However, due to chance, some imbalances in
baseline characteristics may  occur. We will check the average PS among the linked subset 
and inspect covariates among them prior to proceeding with the anal ysis.  In the event of 
imbalances, we will proceed with anal yses outlined after stratify ing by  the propensity  score.

Various design and analysis methods will be implemented to reduce the po tential for bias in 
the study . We will employ  new -user cohorts of dabigatran and warfarin in order to address 
differences that might arise in the comparison of newer and older treatments, such as survivor 
bias 
and attrition of susceptibles. The comparator cohort will be formed warfarin initiators 
with similar clinical profiles to dabigatran initiators t o reduce confounding by  indication.  We 
will employ  propensit y score matching of dabigatran and warfarin cohorts in order to 
improve the balance of the cohorts with respect to numerous variables.  
As a validation study , the aim of this study  is to assess the magnitude of potential 
confounding that might be present in the main cohort study  as a result of non-claims 
characteristics that are both associated with choice of anticoagulant and predictive of study  
outcomes.

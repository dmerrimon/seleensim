TITLE  Intraoperative, Percutaneous Localization of Peripheral 
Pulmonary Nodules for Resection:  a Prospective,  Open- Label, 
Multi -Center Registry  Study of T horacic S urgery Outcomes.  
STUDY NUMBER VMT -01-003 
STUDY PHASE  Post-marketing  Registry/IV  
LOCATION  This trial will be conducted at approximately  5 sites  across  the 
US. 
NUMBER OF 
SUBJECTS  The study aims  to report 70-100 subjects. Each site is expected  to 
enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OBJECTIVES  The registry  is aimed developing a high-quality set of data 
regarding intraoperative percutaneous localization of peripheral 
pulmonary nodules (PPNs), and then identifying and promulgating efficient, evidence -based best practices for this 
technique. The resection  procedure itself is standard  of care and 
follows the investigator’s standard protocol. 
Successful localization  of PPNs  is a challenge involving multiple 
factors,  beginning with the subjects’ health, lung function and 
also factors specific to the nodule including location  within the 
lung, size, distance from the lung surface, whether solid or 
ground glass and proximity to a fissure.  Hard to see or palpate 
nodules are currently  localized with dye and/or hook wires or 
fiducials, either endoscopically or percutaneously. Successful, 
large, prospective studies have not been reported using modern electro -magnetic navigation (EMN) -guided percutaneous 
intraoperative localiza tion, and different techniques (dye vs. 
fiducial vs. hook wire etc.) have not been evaluated. It is for 
these reasons that the different localization  techniques used with 
EMN -guided percutaneous localization will be collected for 
patients  having a suspicious nodule and who undergo 
percutaneous intra- operative localization and immediate 
resection.  
This registry  aims to record the localization  techniques used by 
thoracic  surgeons and IP/surgical teams to identify PPNs  using 
the SPiN Thoracic Navigation System™ in the hands of trained 
physicians.  The objectives  of this study  will be to accomplish  the

 primary  and secondary  objectives  listed  below,  and to observe 
localization in a real- world context of pulmonary resection.  
 
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE Successful  percutaneous  localization  of PPN.  
This is defined  as the percentage  of subjects  in whom the  nodule 
is successfully  localized  and removed in the first resected 
specimen.  A pathological  specimen  with clear margins  will count 
as a successful localization.  
SAFETY 
OBJECTIVES  1. Report  the incidence  of device -related  adverse events that 
occur during the localization procedure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES   
1. Report localization  methods and techniques – dye and 
materials  used, volume  of dye  (methylene  blue, ICG etc.), 
other materials such as microcoils, hook wires  etc. 
Details regarding these techniques will be collected.  
2. Collect data  on intraoperative  percutaneous  localization 
time and duration of total surgical procedure.  
3. Record nodule characteristics, including location in the 
lobe, distance from pleura, distance  from surface of skin 
to target,  morphological  appearance,  solid  vs ground glass 
etc. 
4. Record  weight  of excised  tissue and margin.  
5. Report type of surgical resection performed (segmentectomy  or wedge) and resection  technique 
(VATS, RATS, thoracotomy).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STUDY DESIGN The registry  is designed to collect  data about subjects  who fall 
within the current practice,  and to better understand effective 
intraoperative localization techniques used by thoracic surgeons  
to localize small,  suspicious lesions just prior to surgery. The 
SPiN  System  and tools  are a medical  device that  is 510(k)  exempt 
under 21 CFR  812.2(c)(2), which applies  to the  investigation.  The 
510(k) product is being used in accordance with the product labeling (Appendix A).  
This is a prospective,  multicenter,  open -label,  single  arm registry 
to record the safety, efficacy,  and methodology of percutaneous, 
intraoperative localization of PPNs immediately prior to lung resection.  As such, it  is a technical  procedure  registry  designed to 
better understand the various factors which affect percutaneous 
localization.  
Thoracic surgeons of varying levels  of experience in EMN - 
guided percutaneous localization will be trained on localization tools  and techniques  using the  SPiN  System – with didactic  peer- 
to-peer presentations, followed  by device training and hands -on 
experience with phantoms and/or cadavers.

 The study  will enroll  between 70 and 100 subjects  who fall  within 
current clinical practices  to have their  PPNs  removed at 
approximately 5 geographically diverse sites across the  US. 
These subjects will undergo intraoperative, EMN -aided 
percutaneous  nodule localization  and subsequent resection as part 
of their normal care. Safety data (adverse and severe adverse 
events) regarding these subjects will be collected for the 
localization  procedure.  
All surgical and post -surgical treatment  decisions and clinical 
assessments will be at the discretion  of the subject’s thoracic 
surgeon. Eligible  subjects from participating  sites will be  enrolled 
following identification of a qualifying nodule, and meeting 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and completing informed consent. 
Data  Collection  
Registry data will be collected before, during, and after the 
procedure from the subject’s medical records by site personnel. Based on current clinical practice, it is anticipated  that subjects 
will be seen following nodule identification  and workup to 
determine the treatment plan and preparation for surgery (baseline visit).  The size and location  of the nodule, demographic 
data and data about smoking history will be collected.  
Comorbidities  will be collected  from medical history, and the 
subject’s lung function test results collected.  
The subject will return to the site  for surgery. A non- contrast 
chest CT scan is recommended within 24 hours/same  day as 
surgery, as a clinically indicated procedural planning tool (Appendix D – Veran CT scan).  Otherwise, a non -contrast  chest 
CT scan within the past 15 days is adequate. Subjects are typically given general anesthesia for surgery. The localization technique and material used will be recorded, including  volume 
and type of dye, which needle used, and any other fiducial markers (e.g. microcoil). Localization procedure -related adverse 
events and device -related  adverse events will be recorded. The 
type and t echnique of resection performed  will be collected 
(VATS, RATS, thoracotomy, etc.).  Subjects recover in hospital 
and are discharged per standard of care. Any localization -related 
adverse events  will be reported, however the  overall  lung surgery 
procedure itself is not being studied (approved indication).  
Subjects  will typically  return  to the clinic  a few times to be  seen 
for scheduled post -operative visits to monitor recovery.  
A secure,  site portal  that is 21 CFR part 11 compliant  is used for 
the electronic  data entry  and reporting  at each site,  which  includes 
appropriate firewalls between sites and users to protect subject

STUDY PROCEDURES  Subjects  are treated for lung resection according  to the  treatment 
devised by their clinician. 
Part of the technical  procedure  registry  trains  thoracic surgeons 
on the various available  tools and techniques in intraoperative 
localization, using both didactic review, best practices, case 
review, and a cadaver lab. 
The following represents  the typical standard  of care for this 
procedure. The registry  study is nested  within  the standard lung 
resection  operation, and study procedures  on data  collection  are 
described within the context of these procedures  for clarity of 
identification: 
Following nodule identification and referral, subjects are 
typically evaluated per the subject inclusion/exclusion criteria. Review of the subject’s  CT/PET scan  demonstrate  a PPN that is 
between 0.4 cm  and 3.2 cm  in its  longest  dimension. All subjects 
will sign and date an Informed Consent Form (ICF) before 
enrollment (Baseline  Visit).  
Subjects will undergo a chest CT scan on the day of surgery, 
verifying  the longest dimension of the nodule (data collected). 
The subject is put under general anesthesia. The SPiN 
Percutaneous nodule localization procedure is performed 
intraoperatively,  using  dye and/or other localization techniques. A 
surgical resection (wedge, segmentectomy etc.) will follow, according to PI’s  judgment. Subjects are generally hospitalized 
between 2 -5 days following this procedure  and discharged.  
Following discharge, subjects  typically  follow a schedule of 
multiple  clinic  visits,  as determined  by their  healthcare team. 
Subject participation in the localization registry will end following hospital discharge.  
ESTIMATED 
DURATION OF 
STUDY  The Registry  is anticipated  to take 24 months  to complete.

STUDY POPULATION The target subject  population includes  adult subjects  (18 years -85 
years), with PPNs.  In the judgment  of the thoracic surgeon, 
localization for resection is warranted via a percutaneous 
localization approach. The establishment of malignancy is not 
necessary for PPN removal.  
Data  will be collected  from  study subjects having a PPN between  
0.4 cm  and 3.2 cm in greatest  dimension, that are  accessible to 
percutaneous localization, who consent to and undergo  
intraoperative  dye/wire  localization  procedure  followed by 
surgical lung resection.

STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  Statistical  Considerations  
This is a registry  study where no formal  hypothesis is being 
tested. Data collected during the study will be summarized  using 
descriptive statistics and graphical displays. Generally, 
demographic and other descriptive characteristics will be 
described as counts and percentages for categorical  variables  and 
as measures of central tendency (mean, median, standard deviation [SD], and range) for continuous variables. Ninety five 
percent (95%) confidence intervals will be presented for key 
variables and measures of effect. In some cases, data may be 
summarized by demographic, response, or treatment subgroups (for example by age, sex, nodule size, smoking history and post - 
surgical smoking pack years, pulmonary function tests, etc.). No 
adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons. All localization -related  adverse events will be  listed  and summarized. 
 
Interim  and Final Analyses  
Data collected  during the study, which is open- label and non-  
randomized, will be analyzed and reported periodically by an 
executive steering committee comprised of thoracic surgeons. When the  study is completed,  a final  analysis will be performed 
and reported.

1. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE  
 
This human subject study will comply with all  applicable federal,  state, and local  laws and 
regulations,  including generally accepted standards  of good clinical practice  as adopted by 
current Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)  regulations  and statutes.  Participating  study 
sites shall  only allow  individuals  who are appropriately  trained  and qualified to assist in the 
conduct of the Study. 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
Within the past several years, small  and suspicious  pulmonary nodules have raised a difficult 
issue for internal medicine physicians, pulmonologists, interventional  radiologists, and 
cardiothoracic  surgeons. Depending upon the size, location, and type of nodule, they can be 
challenging to precisely  locate and remove. The nodules, including those  studied here between  
0.4 cm  and 3.2 cm along their longest  axis, are often  found incidentally usually on Computed 
Tomography (CT) scans and sometimes  on chest X -rays. In studies  of incidentally  detected 
nodules, the prevalence  of malignancy  ranges from 2 -82% (Wahidi et al , 2007). 
 
There is an opportunity to develop efficient tools  and procedures  to more  precisely  target  these 
PPNs. Depending on the patient, this targeted  approach may also offer the best opportunity to 
preserve as much remaining lung function  as possible in cases where subjects have respiratory 
comorbidities. Thus, developing and describing a streamlined, reproducible and accurate 
approach to nodule localization is a method that holds promise  for thoracic  surgeons. 
 
Current recommendations  from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)  evidence - 
based guidelines  for the management of pulmonary nodules begin with examination  of the 
nodule, and an estimation of the clinical probability that the nodule is malignant and evaluation 
of surgical  risk. For subjects  with a high probability of cancer (>60%), diagnosis  by biopsy and 
resection  are recommended.  More than 40% of lung targets are not accessible  by conventional 
bronchoscopy due to their  location, with contributing factors  including the small  diameter  of the 
airways, lack of an airway leading to a nodule and maneuverability  difficulties  (Rivera  et al, 
2003; Alberts and Colice, 2003). 
The ability  to identify and to obtain diagnostic  tissue from PPNs has been evaluated  in clinical 
trials  using techniques such as diagnostic  bronchoscopy alone, and then in comparison, with 
EMN -guided bronchoscopy and r -EBUS (Ost et al., 2016). A large, multicenter  registry -based 
clinical  effectiveness study  (AQuIRE  Registry) (ibid..). The AQuIRE  registry  had a primary 
objective  to measure and identify the determinants of diagnostic  yield for bronchoscopy in 
patients  with peripheral  lung lesions. Secondary outcomes included diagnostic  yield of different 
sampling techniques, complications, and practice  pattern variations.  Subjects  were enrolled  at 15 
centers having 22 study physicians between 2009 -2014, and the registry was funded by the 
CHEST organization.

 Ost et al. reported  unexpectedly  low diagnostic  yields for electromagnetic  navigation.  Regarding 
the low EMN rate, one AQuIRE  principal  investigator  (PI) noted “more than 98% of the EMN 
cases were performed  with a single  system (Medtronic,  Minneapolis,  MN) that lacks additional 
capabilities,  including TTNA under EMN guidance. Since the completion of enrollment  in the 
AQuIRE  study, newer EMN technologies  have  been developed  and now allow  for a navigational 
transthoracic  approach.”  
• The AQuIRE  registry  had a primary objective to measure and identify the determinants 
of diagnostic  yield  for bronchoscopy  in patients  with peripheral lung lesions. Secondary 
outcomes included diagnostic yield of different sampling techniques, complications,  and 
practice  pattern variations.  
• The AQuIRE  registry  reported poor diagnostic  yields  for multiple  modalities  
o Bronchoscopic  alone:  53.7%  
o r-EBUS  when  used alone:  57% 
o EMN  Yield when used alone  was 38.5% (98%  of cases  were SuperDimension 
technology)  
Of these,  312 subjects  in the trial underwent transbronchial  biopsy. Using bronchoscopy alone, 
the diagnostic yield was reported as 63.7%. In earlier work, the average diagnostic  yield for 
peripheral  lung lesion biopsy performed with conventional flexible  bronchoscopy was reported 
to be  69% for  peripheral  lesions  greater  than 20 mm and 33%  for peripheral lesions  less than 20 
mm, (Mazzone et al, 2002;  Rivera et al, 2003; Schriebner and McCrory, 2003). 
 
Results from studies involving procedural guidance technologies such as electromagnetic 
navigation (EMN) and radial  endobronchial ultrasound (radial EBUS) have also been reported 
(Ost et al ., 2016). Diagnostic yield  was reported  at 57% with r -EBUS alone, 47.1% with EMN 
combined with r -EBUS.  In another recent study published in the New England Journal  of 
Medicine,  a total of 639 subjects  underwent  bronchoscopy for suspected  lung cancer  and of those 
bronchoscopic  examinations, 43% were nondiagnostic, including in 25% (120 of 487 subjects)  in 
whom lung cancer was ultimately  diagnosed.9 As a result  of published yields showing an 
unacceptable yield for peripheral bronchoscopy, ACCP  guidelines  recommends  that nodules 
without a CT -bronchus sign should be pursued with EMB -TTNA (Rivera et al, 2013).  
 
Veran’s novel electromagnetic system  (EMN) bronchoscope and toolkit use the EMN field with 
several “Tip Tracked” nodule localization  instruments,  and a bronchoscope to generate three 
dimensional  maps of lung tissue and airways. The “Tip Tracked” instruments display  their 
location during the procedures. The generated maps provide continuous, “real -time”  navigational 
tracking,  identifying  an efficient path to localizing  nodules only a few millimeters  along their 
longest axis. Providing the operator with assisted lung nodule localization and navigation have 
improved diagnostic  yields. The  system  uses the recent chest CT scan  image and  combines  it 
with the bronchoscope to align the subject’s  body with the CT images. This allows for the 
construction  of 3- D virtual bronchoscopy images and the ability to navigate throughout the lung 
with a CT -correlated roadmap. As the operator steers  the bronchoscope, a real time  distance to 
target is generated, that can be used for the precise localization  of small lesions.

Localization  of the peripheral nodules in the outer lung regions can be accomplished 
intraoperatively,  just prior  to surgical resection,  with the same surgical staff who are performing 
the operation. This eliminates an additional step for the  thoracic  surgeon (or other oncology team 
member) and also for the subject, namely  identifying and coordinating with persons from other 
departments  who may typically place fiducial,  hookwire, and microcoils  as separate procedures, 
involving  additional resources.  In addition, the migration  of these markers,  and the need to verify 
their placement  with an additional  CT or other scan prior to surgery, are  potentially  steps  that 
may be  able to be  streamlined.  The overarching objective  is to keep  this localization  and 
resection  procedure within the hands of the principal  investigator, and to quantify the percentage 
of subjects  in whom the nodule is removed in the first  resected  specimen, procedure time, and 
nodule characteristics and procedure details and techniques.  
3. RATIONALE  
 
Veran Medical  Technologies, Inc. is seeking to characterize the efficient localization  and 
successful  removal  of PPNs  aided  by the  technique  of percutaneous  localization  within  the 
operating room.  This falls within the current practice  for these subjects.  However,  the 
characterization  and comparison of various localization  techniques  has not been reported 
prospectively in a large, multicenter approach.  
 
To realize this opportunity, further  localization  methodologies  must  be developed. Percutaneous 
nodule  localization  involves  various  factors.  Nodular  size and location (near the  pleura) can  both 
introduce  challenges for unequivocal localization and complete  removal. PPNs can be difficult  to 
locate and  access in order to  mark them.  It can be difficult to find the marked nodules, 
depending upon the location and how  well the  localization  technique  worked during the resection 
surgery. This registry will collect data regarding different techniques  used by thoracic  surgeons 
using a choice of localization  materials  (dye, hookwire etc.) and with electromagnetic  navigation 
guidance using a transthoracic  approach. Evidence from a multicenter,  prospective  registry  trial 
on localization procedures  will allow us to understand  the best practices in the localization  of 
PPNs that also minimizes risks in subjects who are typically  are older, have comorbid  lung 
disease, poor pre -surgical  lung function and may have early stage lung cancer.  
 
Further, the study will allow  us to describe the use of VERAN  SPiN Thoracic Navigation 
System ™ and percutaneous lung localization tools in a real- world  thoracic surgery  practice, 
including duration of localization  procedure, duration  of the resection  procedure, and other data 
elements.

4. OBJECTIVES  
The registry  is aimed  at developing a high- quality  set of data  regarding the  percutaneous 
localization  of PPNs. The localization  registry  itself is nested within the subjects’  lung 
resection  operation. Analyzing and promulgating  evidence -based  best practices for lung 
nodule localization will allow surgeons to identify technical solutions  and reproducible 
methods.  
This registry  will record  procedural  data for  trained  thoracic  surgeons using  the SPiN Thoracic 
Navigation System ™ and tools. Diagnostic yield will measure  successful localization  of the 
lesion in the resected specimen. Localization -related  safety  events will be collected.  
4.1 Primary  Objective:  
Successful percutaneous localization  of PPN.  
To evaluate the accuracy of percutaneous nodule localization  using the SPiN Thoracic 
Navigation System ™ and its accessories, Veran will  record the percentage of successful 
resections that result  in the complete removal  of the patient’s  nodule, with  a negative margin. 
The diagnostic  yield is calculated  as the percentage of patients  who have intra -operative 
localizations  resulting  in complete  removal  of nodule, divided by the total  number of evaluable 
subjects. Evaluable subjects are those who  complete  the localization  procedure.  
Primary  Objective : Successful  percutaneous  localization  of PPN.  
This is defined  as the percentage of subjects in whom the  nodule is successfully  localized  and 
removed in the first  resected  specimen.  A pathological  specimen  with clear  margins  will count 
as a successful localization.  
4.2 Safety  Objective: 
Collect  safety  data for localization  procedure.  
4.3 Secondary  Objectives:  
Secondary  Objectives : Use as per synopsis – including margin.  
4.3.1 Report localization  methods  and techniques – dye and materials  used, volume of dye 
(methylene  blue, ICG etc.),  other  materials  such as microcoils,  hook wires  etc. Details 
regarding these techniques will be collected.  
4.3.2 Collect data on intraoperative  percutaneous  localization  time and duration of total 
surgical  procedure.  
4.3.3 Record nodule characteristics,  including location  in the lobe, distance  from pleura, 
distance from surface of skin  to target,  morphological  appearance,  solid  vs. ground 
glass etc. 
4.3.4 Record  weight  of excised  tissue and margin.  
4.3.5 Report  type of  surgical resection  performed  (segmentectomy  or wedge) and resection 
technique (VATS, RATS, thoracotomy).

 5. SUMMARY OF REGISTRY DESIGN  
 
PLOTS  is a multicenter,  post- approval  study of the SPiN System™ in percutaneous 
localization.  It’s an  open- label registry  study practically  focused  on the expedient 
intraoperative  localization  and removal of small pulmonary  nodules in subjects undergoing 
lung nodule resection.  The study will aim to collect  data from 70 -100 patients  at approximately  
5 thoracic  surgery  sites distributed  across the U.S. Each  site is expected  to enroll a minimum  of 
6 subjects.  Enrollment will be monitored  and will stop once sufficient  data has been  collected.  
All post- surgical treatment  decisions and clinical assessments will be at the discretion  of the 
patient’s  cardiothoracic surgeon or clinician  per usual care,  not be mandated by registry design.

7. PRIOR  CLINICAL  DATA 
 
Current recommendations  from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)  evidence - 
based guidelines  for the management of pulmonary nodules begin with examination of the 
nodule, and an estimation  of the  clinical  probability that the  nodule is  malignant  and evaluation 
of surgical  risk. For subjects  with a high probability of cancer (>60%),  diagnosis  by biopsy and 
resection  are recommended.  More than 40% of lung targets are not accessible  by conventional 
bronchoscopy due to their  location, with contributing factors  including the  small diameter of 
the airways,  lack of  an airway  leading to a  nodule and maneuverability  difficulties  (Rivera  et 
al, 2003; Alberts and Colice, 2003).  
The ability  to identify and to obtain diagnostic  tissue from PPNs has been evaluated  in various 
clinical  trials  using a variety of techniques. The results  over time are variable and do warrant 
further investigation. Techniques such as diagnostic  bronchoscopy alone, and then in 
comparison with EMN -guided bronchoscopy, EMN -TTNA,  and r -EBUS were studied in the 
large, multicenter registry -based  clinical effectiveness study (AQuIRE Registry) ( ibid..). The 
AQuIRE  registry  had a primary objective  to measure and identify the determinants  of 
diagnostic  yield  for bronchoscopy in patients  with peripheral lung lesions. Secondary outcomes 
included diagnostic  yield of different sampling  techniques, complications,  and practice pattern 
variations.  Subjects were enrolled at 15 centers having 22 study physicians  between 2009-  
2014, and the registry was funded by the CHEST  organization. 
Ost et al. reported  unexpectedly  low diagnostic  yields  for electromagnetic  navigation. 
Regarding the low EMN rate, one AQuIRE  PI noted (Semaan R.W., 2016):  
“…more  than 98% of the  EMN  cases were performed  with a single  system  (Medtronic, 
Minneapolis, MN) that lacks additional capabilities,  including  TTNA under EMN 
guidance. Since the completion of enrollment  in the AQuIRE  study, newer EMN 
technologies  have been developed and now allow for a navigational transthoracic 
approach.”

 Ost replied  in response that:  “In such a scenario, the real question is not  whether sensitivity 
will improve  but, rather,  by how much sensitivity will improve,  and whether that improvement 
is worth the attendant increase in risk.”  
Acknowledging the  Hopkins observation that that SD was used  in almost  all EMN cases,  Ost 
writes:  
“They point  out correctly  that 98% of the  cases in the AQuIRE  registry  were  performed 
with SuperDimension  (Medtronic,  Minneapolis, MN).  I concur that not all EMN 
systems are the same. There are substantive differences in the imaging  and algorithms 
used between these two systems. Veran uses both inspiratory  and expiratory films, 
whereas SuperDimension does not. Respiratory motion can affect nodule location 
significantly  (2). The data in the  AQuIRE  registry  do not provide insight into how 
Veran might  perform in terms of bronchoscopic yield. On the basis of the difference 
between  EMN systems,  I agree that separate studies for the Veran  system  are 
warranted.  “ 
As these (AQuIRE)  were percutaneous cases using  early  EMN -guidance, the results of this 
registry  may likewise provide  insight into  impacts  of technological  advances.  The AQuIRE 
registry  had a primary objective  to measure  and identify  the determinants  of diagnostic  yield 
for bronchoscopy in patients  with peripheral lung lesions. Secondary outcomes included 
diagnostic yield of different sampling techniques, complications, and practice pattern 
variations.  
• The AQuIRE  registry  reported poor diagnostic  yields  for multiple  modalities  
o Bronchoscopic  alone:  53.7%  
o r-EBUS  when  used alone:  57% 
o EMN  Yield when used alone  was 38.5% (98%  of cases were SuperDimension 
technology)  
Of these,  312 subjects  in the trial underwent transbronchial  biopsy. Using bronchoscopy alone, 
the diagnostic yield was reported as 63.7%. In earlier work, the average diagnostic  yield for 
peripheral  lung lesion biopsy performed  with conventional flexible  bronchoscopy was reported 
to be 69%  for peripheral lesions greater  than 20 mm and  33% for  peripheral lesions  less than 
20 mm, (Mazzone et al , 2002;  Riveria  et al, 2003; Schriebner  and McCrory, 2003).  
Results from studies involving procedural guidance technologies such as electromagnetic 
navigation (EMN) and radial  endobronchial ultrasound (radial EBUS)  have also been reported 
(Ost et al., 2016). Diagnostic  yield  was reported  at 57%  with r -EBUS alone, 47.1%  with EMN 
combined with r -EBUS.  In another recent study published in the New England Journal  of 
Medicine,  a total of 639 subjects  underwent bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer and of 
those bronchoscopic examinations, 43% were nondiagnostic, including in 25% (120 of 487 
subjects)  in whom lung cancer was ultimately diagnosed (Silvestri  et al, 2014). As  a result of 
published yields  showing an unacceptable  yield  for peripheral  bronchoscopy, ACCP guidelines 
recommends  that nodules without a CT -bronchus sign should be pursued with EMB -TTNA 
(Rivera et al, 2013).

 A prospective, single  center pilot study  evaluated  the safety,  feasibility,  and diagnostic  yield  of 
staged approached for taking biopsy samples  in a single  procedure setting (Yarmus LB et al., 
2016). In this study, enrolled subjects (n=24) underwent EBUS for lymph node staging, 
followed  by EMN -bronchoscopy, and EMN -TTNA.  The researchers report  a diagnostic yield 
of 83% for EMN -TTNA alone, and 87% when combined with EMN -bronchoscopy. The 
diagnostic  yield increased to 92% when combined with EBUS. There were five (21%) 
pneumothoraces  of which two (8%)  required chest tube placement.  No bleeding events were 
observed. The researchers conclude that the results demonstrate  an acceptable safety and 
feasibility  profile.  
8. RISKS AND  BENEFITS  
PLOTS is a registry  documenting small  lung nodule localization techniques used by thoracic 
surgeons for patients just  prior to lung resection. The localization  PPNs with dye injection 
and/or microcoils  is a standard  medical procedure physicians  complete  prior to the resection 
procedure. All procedures  represent  the clinical  standard of care  provided  by thoracic  surgeons 
to their patients.  The following section documents  the risks and benefits of Registry 
participation,  as well as the published clinical  rates  of complications  as they are known. 
 
The risks  associated  with the localization  procedure  are noted, as well as the  use of  the device. 
If approved devices  will be used  as part  of the  research,  each site may be asked to confirm  that 
the device(s) they are using are being used within their approved labeling  
 
The SPiN  Thoracic  Navigation System ™ and its accessories are marketed  for use as tools in 
the diagnosis  and treatment  of lung cancer.  All devices used in this study are  commercially 
available  and there are no anticipated  risks beyond those already associated  with early lung 
cancer diagnosis and surgical treatment procedures in clinical practice . 
 
Data, including safety data, will be collected  from each subject’s nodule localization 
procedure. The surgical  procedure is not experimental in this 510(k) -marketed  device  that is 
being used within its approved labeling. Safety  data will be summarized  and reported  from the 
localization  procedure.  
8.1 Registry  Data  Collection  – Risks  and Benefits  
Registry Risks: Every effort will be made to protect the privacy of research subjects.  Subject 
names and protected  health information  (PHI) will be kept confidential to the extent possible 
and as required  by HIPAA.  All records and  data related  to the study will be maintained  in a 
secure protected  space, with access restricted  to study personnel or individuals  designated  by 
study personnel who (i) need  access to  the information  to fulfill the terms  and obligations  of 
the Coordinating Site or the  Sponsor under  the Protocol  and (ii)  are under the  same obligations 
as study personnel to keep the information confidential. It is an open- label  study, and each 
study site will use its own portal only. There are software firewalls  in place to prevent site 
personnel from seeing data from other investigative sites.

 Registry Benefits: Subjects  will not receive any direct benefit as a result of their participation 
in the registry.  However, information  contained within the registry  will be used for research 
studies  directed  at improving our knowledge and treatment of  very early  lung cancer  diagnosis, 
screening, and treatment. Identifying best practices  for use in small nodule localization may 
benefit patients with early lung cancer in the future.  
8.2 Procedural  Data  Collection  – Risks  and  Benefits  
Procedure- Related  Benefits  
The Veran ENB SPiN  Thoracic Navigation  System ™ for lung  cancer and the SPiN  Perc™ Kit 
(Veran  System) were cleared  to market by the U.S. Food and Drug Agency (FDA) under 
510(k) (K170023). The Veran System is designed to help guide the surgeon with 
electromagnetic  navigation while  manipulating  small  pulmonary nodules. Early detection (and 
removal) of lung cancer relies upon the precise identification  and prompt removal  of 
pulmonary nodules. Deep pulmonary nodules represent a particular  technical challenge for 
surgeons, due to their accessibility. SPiN System biopsy tools are capable of integrating 
information from imaging devices into real -time visualization, allowing for targeted 
percutaneous localization  of small PPN’s.  Optimization  of this technical localization 
procedure may result in  more  accurate identification  of small tumors  in lung tissue, when used 
by a skilled, trained surgeon or physician.  
Procedure- Related  Risks 
Reported radiation  exposures  to the  patient from the  low dose helical  CT procedure  are comparable 
to current  practice.  No additional  procedural  risks are anticipated  to be introduced.  
8.2.1 Anesthesia  – Lung  Resection  Procedure  
Sedation and the  act of  passing  a bronchoscope  into the airway  introduce  medical risks.  Older 
adults, or those with serious medical problems,  particularly  those undergoing more extensive 
procedures, may be at increased risk of  postoperative  confusion, pneumonia, or  even stroke 
and heart attack. To mitigate  the risks  of anesthesia,  anesthesiologists  or anesthesiology nurses 
and/or a respiratory  therapist typically  monitor all patients  during the procedure per their 
institutional protocols and training.  In addition, oxygen saturation (using pulse oximetry), 
respiratory  rate, blood pressure, ECG, and heart rate are typically continuously  monitored.  
Patients  are not released  until they are fully  awake and medically  stable.  
The benefits  of anesthesia are that  subjects will not feel or remember the pain of the  surgical 
procedure.  
8.2.2 Bronchoscopy  – Lung  Resection  Procedure  
 
The greatest  risks  from bronchoscopy, used as a step  to align (“register”) the subject’s  day of 
surgery  CT with the  subject’s current  position on the  surgical  table,  are related  to sedation  and 
to the act of passing a bronchoscope into the airway. To mitigate  the risks of bronchoscopy, 
subjects will be under general anesthesia.  Subjects are typically  monitored during this

 procedure. In addition, oxygen saturation (using pulse oximetry), respiratory  rate, blood 
pressure, ECG,  and heart rate are continuously  monitored. Patients are typically  hospitalized 
following  lung surgery for approximately days in the US and released  when medically  stable.  
8.2.3 Trans -thoracic  Nodule  Localization  – Registry  Procedure  
The risks  associated  with trans -thoracic  nodule  localization  are bleeding  and pneumothorax,  
The measures to mitigate  the risks are the same for all surgical  procedures. Patients are given 
supplemental oxygen and their oxygen level is continuously monitored  using  pulse oximetry. 
A nurse or  physician continuously monitor  patients’  ECG, heart  rate, blood pressure, and blood 
oxygen during the procedure.  
9. RESEARCH  METHODS  AND DATA COLLECTION  
 
In this study, the “lung resection and after  care protocol”  is determined  by each investigator’s 
current practice,  with an outline provided in the registry to explain the  context for the type of 
data collection  performed  in this  patient  population. The medical  device  is being marketed  for 
and used within its intended use.  
 
Localization  methods  and outcomes, and data  related  to the nodules, diagnosis, and the setting 
of the  planned clinical intervention  of nodule removal  will be recorded.  Data will be collected 
according to descriptions  below, Table 1 and Figure 1.  
 
Collected data include brief  medical history,  smoking history, demographic  characteristics, 
radiographic characteristics,  procedural characteristics,  crossover to other procedures, and 
adverse events, as follows:  
 
• Radiographic  Characteristics:  
The location  of the target  nodule (side, lobe and segment, i.e. right  upper lobe anterior 
segment, etc.) will be determined  and recorded. The radiographic  information  collected 
from CT will include  size of the  nodule (longest  axis),  distance from a  visible  bronchus, 
and distance  from the pleural surface perpendicular to the nodule.  
 
 
• Procedural  Characteristics:  
Collected  procedural  information  will include  the distance of target from pleura  nodule 
statistics (volume, RESIST  diameter, maximum, minimum, and effective diameter), 
and target  motion. The duration of the localization  procedure  will also be recorded.  
 
• Crossover to Other  Procedures:

Percutaneous  Registry:  the PLOTS  Study 
Protocol/Study No.: VMT -01-003 November  2, 2020  
Proprietary  and Confidential.  Page  28 of 46  
 All procedures  performed  to aid  in the  surgical  management  of patients – will be noted. 
Wedge resection,  segmentectomy,  and lobectomy. The  type of initial surgery planned, 
and the eventual surgery done, will both be collected.  
• Adverse Events:  
All device and/or procedure related  adverse events will be recorded for the study 
localization  procedure. Events will be collected  from the  initiation  of the localization 
procedure to the start  of the wedge resection  procedure. Study sites will report 
localization -related  adverse  events and complications to their IRBs  according to 
institutional requirements.  These will be recorded. 
9.2 Primary Efficacy  Objective:  Successful  Percutaneous  Localization  of PPN  
This is defined  as the percentage of subjects in whom the  nodule is successfully  localized  and 
removed in the first  resected  specimen.  A pathological  specimen  with clear  margins  will count 
as a successful localization.  
To evaluate the accuracy of percutaneous nodule localization using the SPiN Thoracic 
Navigation System ™ and its accessories,  by recording the percentage of successful nodule 
resections that result  in the complete removal  of the patient’s  nodule, with at least a one cell 
perimeter and negative  margins.  The diagnostic  yield  is calculated  as the  percentage of patients 
who have intra -operative  localizations  resulting  in complete removal of nodule, divided by the 
total number of evaluable subjects.  
 
Confirmation  of Diagnosis  
Surgical pathology results  will determine  the outcome of the primary  endpoint. If  the patient 
has follow -up imaging  that shows a decrease in size or resolution of the  nodule, the nodule  will 
be determined  to be of benign etiology if the study pathology yields  a benign diagnosis 
(granuloma,  inflammation,  fibrosis,  infection). To verify  final diagnosis, a copy of the final 
pathology report will be de -identified  and provided by the site.  The pathology findings  will 
then identify the case as either benign or  malignant.  Whether  a benign or malignant diagnosis 
is made, the primary endpoint is met.  
 
If Margins  are Intact  
If the nodule  has intact  margins  as described  by the  pathology report.  Explicitly, a perimeter of 
at least one  cell around the  nodule contain cells that are all non- malignant.  This plus the 
nodule sample verifies  that the entire nodule was removed. The pathology findings will then 
identify  the case as either benign or malignant.  
 
Crossover Cases 
It is anticipated  that there will be cases where the wedge is positive for malignancy  and the 
deep margin  also will be positive. In these cases,  the surgical  plan may  change from  a planned 
wedgectomy into a completion  lobectomy or segmentectomy.  If the nodule is fully removed

Proprietary  and Confidential.  Page  29 of 46  
 (having at least a cell’s margin  of non- malignant cells in these  cases, then  the primary  endpoint 
is met. The pathology findings will then identify the entire case as either  benign or malignant, 
and the primary endpoint is met.  
 
Margins  for Crossover Cases 
If the nodule  is fully  removed in crossover  cases, then  the primary  endpoint  is met. The nodule 
may be removed per the surgeon’s judgement. The pathology findings will then identify the 
entire case as either  benign or malignant, and the primary endpoint is met.  
 
If Diagnosis  is Non-malignant  
If the nodule  is deemed non- malignant,  cells are identifiable,  then the positive  box for 
diagnosis is checked, and:  
• The nodule  must  have  an intact margin  of a cell as a perimeter  to be diagnostic.  
• The type  of nodule (ground glass opacity, etc.) is collected  from  the pathology report. 
The pathology findings will then identify the case as either  benign or malignant.  
 
9.3 Safety Objective:  
Record  Safety  Events  During  Intraoperative  Percutaneous  Localization  Only  
To collect  and evaluate the  safety  of nodule  localization,  including incidence  and severity  of 
localization -procedure  related  adverse  events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  that 
occur during the localization procedure. 
 
Baseline/Enrollment  
All patients will be provided with information  about the registry and will sign the informed 
consent form before any registry -related assessments are made.  The following data will be 
collected at baseline for all enrolled patients:  
 
• To be collected  at baseline  visit: Review  of inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
Localization  Period  
• The localization  period begins  when  the needle touches  the subject’s  skin. 
• Localization  ends when the  localization  needle  is withdrawn from  the subject  for the 
final time.  
• Any adverse  events  that develop during the localization  procedure  will be  reported.  
• Bronchoscopy- related  events  that occur  during the alignment  of the CT with the  patient 
(“registration”) will be recorded.  
• Percutaneous localization  step, injection  of dye, injection  of any microcoils,  etc. 
 
The process used for AE reporting conforms  to Veran Medical  Technologies, Inc., standard 
operating procedures  (SOPs) for Medical  Device Reporting (MDR)(Appendix C). Training  on 
AE/SAE/MDR reporting  practices will be provided to each participating  site.

 9.3 Subject  Enrolment  and Informed Consent  
Patients  presenting to their physician in need  of assessment  or removal  of peripheral 
pulmonary nodule(s), and who meet study inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  will be invited  to 
participate.  Patient enrolment will follow each participating  institution’s  standard of care. 
Subjects will be approached to obtain informed consent prior to any study -specific procedure. 
Informed consent will take place in a private environment  (e.g. patient  exam room), free from 
distractions.  The PI or study team member  will approach the  subject at their clinic  appointment 
and will explain the study to qualified subjects prior  to obtaining consent. All individuals  who 
obtain consent (PI, Sub- investigators,  and study coordinators)  must have  received  GCP 
informed  consent training  within  the past 2 years.  Interviews to  obtain consent will not follow 
any stressful  situation  (e.g. patient  being informed  he/she may have cancer) and will not be 
conducted if the patient has received  any mind- altering  medications  or anesthesia.  Patients will 
be assessed for their capacity  to consent by the ability  to show comprehension of the 
procedure, ask appropriate questions, and appear properly oriented.  
 
The PI will confirm subject eligibility.  Patients  who sign the informed consent form will be 
considered  enrolled. A signed copy of  all consents and the  HIPAA authorization document  will 
also be given to consenting subjects.  
 
Patients  who complete  the localization  procedure will be included within the analysis 
population. Reasons for study withdrawal  will be recorded. Each patient’s  participation  in this 
study is approximately 6 weeks baseline through subject’s discharge  from hospital following 
lung surgery. 
9.4 Withdrawal  of Subjects  
Following informed consent, subjects withdrawn from the study prior to the  localization 
procedure due to patient withdrawal of consent or at the discretion of the investigator will be 
considered  withdrawn. In the  case of  investigator withdrawal,  the reason  for early  withdrawal 
will be documented. Data collected from  all treated patients undergoing localization  will be 
included within the analysis population. 
9.5 Screen Failures  
Subjects who provide informed consent but are determined  to be ineligible  prior  to the index 
procedure  will be considered  screen failures.  The reason  for screen  failure  will be documented. 
The assigned subject ID for the subject will not be re -used.  
9.6 Pre-procedure Chest CT Scan Evaluation  
After informed  consent is  obtained, the patient’s  most  recent  chest  CT scan or  chest x -ray will 
be deidentified  and securely downloaded and saved. If subjects have multiple  pulmonary 
nodules, the site  PI will identify  the target nodule.

 9.7 Non-contrast  Chest  CT 
It is recommended  by the manufacturer  that the subject receives a non-contrast  chest CT  scan 
be performed  on the same day as the procedure  as a clinically  indicated  procedural  planning 
tool (Veran Appendix B – technical  description  of CT parameters).  Otherwise,  a chest  CT scan 
from within the past 15 days may also be used when it is consistent  with these parameters.  
 
9.8 General  Anesthesia  
Patients  will undergo the procedure  under  general anesthesia.  
 
9.9 Nodule  Localization  
The bronchoscope  (Olympus  MP-160 or  BF-190) will  be introduced into the  airway.  A Veran 
tip tracked instrument  will then be introduced  into the working channel of the bronchoscope 
and utilizing  standard  Veran System navigation- matching  protocols, the main and secondary 
carinas are identified  using the tip tracked instrument  to confirm that the Veran System is 
properly matched to the airway defined by accurate  matching of the main and secondary 
carina. This allows the system to align the CT with the patient’s  current  position.  
Following registration,  a sterile  field is created  on the  chest wall as  identified  by the  Spin Perc 
planning software and the  area is prepped and draped. A tip  tracked  needle,  such as one of the 
Veran localization  needles or the Veran tip tracked Spin Perc needle introducer,  is selected.  
The surgeon advances the needle trans thoracically  into the nodule, under Veran EMN 
guidance, to the  nodule. The nodule  is localized  percutaneously  by marking  with dye using an 
assortment  of tools designed for this purpose  (Section  5.1), adding microcoils  or fiducials,  etc. 
 
Data  Collected:  patient  position,  registration,  volume  of dye, type of  dye, use of  microcoils  or 
fiducials.  
 
The surgeon  then continues  to wedge resection, and the registry portion of the  procedure  is 
completed.  
 
 
9.10 Study  Discontinuation  
The following data will be recorded  as available from any enrolled subjects  who withdrew 
consent during the Registry:  
• SAEs/AEs  - Method of treatment,  severity, etc. 
• Concomitant  medications including dosages  
• Reason  for withdrawal

10. COMPLAINT AND SAFETY REPORTING  
Principal Investigators  were taught to use FDA 3500A MedWatch (Appendix C) and were 
taught to fill  those out during the investigator meeting,  for relevant  SAEs and also  for medical 
device complaints.  This registry’s primary  safety objective is to collect localization -related 
safety events in patients undergoing wedgectomy. 
The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation  (21 CFR 803) contains mandatory 
requirements for device user facilities (including  hospitals, surgical facilities  and other) to 
report certain  device- related  serious adverse events and product problems to the FDA.  These 
are described in further detail below.  
• User facilities  must  report a suspected  medical  device -related  death  to both the FDA 
and the manufacturer within 10 days. 
• User facilities  must also report a medical device -related  serious  injury  to the 
manufacturer (Veran Medical Technologies, address below). 
• In addition, each IRB and institution may have its own policies regarding  the content, 
format,  and timing for the reporting  of SAE information.  
Each investigator is responsible  for fulfilling  these  duties. Please report device serious adverse 
events to Veran as noted below on form 3500A (Appendix C):

gn=div5 ) using a 510(k)- cleared  device system.  The exemption in 21 CFR 812.2(c)(2) 
applies to this study, where the device is substantially  equivalent to its predicate,  and 
the device is being used in accordance with its labeling.  
 
Study sites are likewise responsible to report adverse  events and complications to their 
IRBs  according to institutional requirements.  
 
10.3 Adverse Events  – Data  Collection  for Localization  Events  
An adverse event (AE) is  any untoward medical  occurrence,  unintended disease or injury,  or 
untoward clinical signs  (including abnormal laboratory  findings) in subjects, users or other 
persons, whether or not related  to the investigational medical device.  Note: Pre -existing 
conditions are not considered to be adverse events unless there is a change in the nature or 
severity of the condition. 
 
We will collect  data on the localization adverse event through subject discharge from hospital. 
Principal Investigators  were taught to use FDA 3500A MedWatch (Appendix C) and were 
taught to fill  those out during the investigator meeting,  for relevant SAEs and also  for medical 
device complaints. This registry’s primary safety objective is to collect localization -related

10.3.1 Serious  Adverse Event  
A serious  adverse event  (SAE)  is an adverse event  that has: 
1. Led to death, 
2. Led to serious  deterioration  in the health  of the subject, that either resulted  in: 
• a life-threatening  illness  or injury,  or 
• a permanent  impairment of a body structure,  or 
• in-patient or prolonged hospitalization,  or 
• medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury  or permanent  impairment to a body structure  or a body function,  
3. Led to fetal distress,  fetal death  or a congenital  abnormality  or birth  defect.  
 
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing  condition, or a procedure  required  by 
the study, without serious  health deterioration  is not considered a SAE.  
 
10.4 Causality  – Adverse Event  Relationship  
The PI will assess the relationship  of an adverse  event  to the  device and  procedure  as 
follows:  
• Not Related:  No relationship  appears  to exist  between  the AE  and the 
device and/or procedure.  
• Related:  The AE follows  a plausible  temporal sequence  following  
administration  of the study  device  and/or  execution  of the procedure.  
• Undetermined:  It is not  possible  to determine  the relationship  of the AE 
with the study device and/or procedure.  
 
10.5 Adverse Event  Outcome  
The outcome  of AEs will be recorded  as follows:  
 
• Resolved: The  event  is considered fully  resolved.  
• Continuing:  At study exit the event  is considered ongoing.  
 
Note:  Any unresolved  AE ongoing past  study exit will be monitored by the physician 
per institutional standard of care.

 10.6 ADVERSE  EVENT  RECORDING  
AEs will be documented in the applicable  source documentation (i.e. medical record). 
Study data  collection  forms  should capture  the event diagnosis  as opposed to symptoms 
(e.g. Infection vs. fever).  The adverse events of pneumothorax and bronchopulmonary 
hemorrhage (including hemoptysis) will be documented as follows:  
 
• Hemorrhage: Significant  bronchopulmonary hemorrhage  including hemoptysis 
will be defined  as bleeding  noted at  the time  of procedure  that requires  a change 
in the level of care (e.g. outpatient  to inpatient  or inpatient  to ICU)  or a blood 
transfusion  or separate intervention  (i.e. surgery or embolization).  Severity  will 
be classified  according to CTCAE as follows:  
o Grade  1: Mild  symptoms;  intervention  not indicated  
o Grade  2: Moderate symptoms; medical  intervention indicated  
o Grade 3:  Transfusion, radiologic, endoscopic, or operative  intervention 
indicated (e.g. hemostasis of bleeding site)  
o Grade 4:  Life-threatening  respiratory  or hemodynamic  compromise; 
intubation or urgent intervention indicated  
o Grade  5: Death  
11. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
11.1 Sample  Size 
This is an observational  study where  no formal  hypothesis  is being tested, data 
collected  during the study will be summarized  using descriptive  statistics. No formal 
sample size estimations were utilized  to determine  the size of the study population. 
Generally, demographic  and other descriptive  characteristics of the cohorts will be 
described  as counts  and percentages  for categorical  variables and as  measures of central 
tendency (mean, median, standard deviation [SD], and range) for continuous variables. 
Ninety -five percent (95%) confidence  intervals  will be  computed for measures  of effect 
and association.  In some cases, data may be summarized  by demographic. 
The study will have 70- 100 evaluable  patients from approximately  5 sites in the US 
who undergo percutaneous localization followed by surgical resection. Evaluable 
patients  are those who undergo the percutaneous nodule localization procedure  and 
meet the  inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Each  site will be expected  to enroll a minimum of 
6 subjects at their site.  
11.2 Data  Analyses 
11.2.1 General  Considerations  
The analysis  to be performed will be described  in a written  and approved statistical 
analysis  plan (SAP).  No adjustments  will be made for multiple  comparisons. 
Effectiveness  data will be  summarized.  Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  and adverse

Electronic Data  Capture  
All data  will be collected  and entered  into the electronic  data capture  (EDC) system  that 
Veran Medical  Technologies has created  specifically  for this purpose (Medrio®). Sites 
will be responsible  for entering extracted  patient data into a secure internet -based  EDC 
registry  database via the eCRF. Investigators and site  personnel will be able to access 
their secure, encrypted accounts with individual usernames and passwords.  
Participating  sites will have access to their own enrolled subjects’  data only, with 
permissions  assigned  to trained  study staff. All eCRFs should be completed by 
designated, trained  personnel  or the study coordinator, as appropriate.  The eCRF should 
be reviewed, electronically  signed, and dated by the Principal  Investigator.  All changes 
or corrections  to eCRFs will be documented in an audit trail with an adequate 
explanation made to explain the reason for the change, a signature,  and a time/date 
stamp.  
12.2 File Retention  and Archiving  
To enable evaluations  and/or audits from regulatory  authorities  or the Sponsor, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating  patients, 
all original signed ICFs, copies of all case report forms (CRFs), SAE forms, site files, 
investigator information, source documents, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence  (e.g., letters,  meeting  minutes).  The records should be retained with  the 
study binder. 
Each site will receive  a study site  file at study initiation  which  contains all  documents 
necessary  for the conduct of  the registry  and is  updated throughout  the study. This  file 
must be available for review in the event the site is selected for monitoring,  audits, or 
inspections  and must be safely  archived for at least 5 years  after completing 
participation  in the study. Documents to be archived include  site regulatory  files 
including IRB approvals,  the subject enrollment  log and the  signed ICFs. In the  event 
that archiving  of the file  is no longer possible  at the site, the site will be instructed  to 
notify the Sponsor.  
If these files are filed electronically,  they must follow electronic  document archival 
practices,  contain  a backup  file on the same media,  and also the  ability  to read  the files 
for 5 years.  
12.3 Data  Management  
High data quality standards  will be maintained,  and processes and procedures will be 
utilized  to ensure  that the data are as  clean and  accurate  as possible when  presented  for 
Veran Medical Technologies, Inc. 
Percutaneous  Registry:  the PLOTS  Study

 analysis.  Data quality  will be enhanced through a series of programmed  or manual  data 
edit checks that automatically detect out -of-range or anomalous data.  
12.4 Changes to  the Protocol  
Changes to the protocol  will be documented in written  protocol amendments.  Major 
(i.e., substantial, significant) amendments will usually require submission to the 
relevant  IRB for approval  or favorable  opinion. In such cases, the amendment  will be 
implemented only after approval or favorable opinion has been obtained.  
Minor (non -substantial)  protocol amendments, including administrative changes, will  
be filed  at each participating  site and will be submitted  to the  relevant  IRB or regulatory 
authorities  where required by pertinent  regulations.  Any amendment  that could have an 
impact on the patient’s  agreement to participate  in the study requires  the patient’s 
informed  consent prior to continued participation  in the study. 
12.5 Study  Governance  
An executive steering  committee  of 4-6 members  will be established,  drawing from  the 
investigators enrolling  patients into this study. This committee,  with the sponsor, will 
review  the protocol  and oversee the study design. The committee  will also recommend 
meetings  and topics for abstracts  and papers to be submitted for presentation  and 
publication. All investigators  will have access to the data for their individual site; 
however, only the sponsor or its designee  shall have access to the entire,  multicenter 
data set. The ESC may review  the de -identified  data,  for purposes  of oversight  and also 
for publication. Any requests  for publication  of individual  site data will be submitted  to 
the committee for review and consideration; the committee recommendation will be 
submitted to the company for consideration.  
All data  generated  from  this study will  be the  exclusive  property of Veran Medical 
Technologies, Inc. 
12.6 Publication  Policy  
Any publication of the results from  this study must be consistent  with the Sponsor’s 
publication policy and guided by the Uniform  Requirements  for Manuscripts  Submitted 
to Biomedical Journals: Writing  and Editing for Biomedical Publication  of the 
International Committee  of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), updated April 2010 
(ICMJE 2010). The rights of the Investigator  and of the Sponsor  regarding  publication 
of the results  of this study/registry  are described in the Investigator  contract.  
13. PROTOCOL  COMPLIANCE  
No amendments  to the protocol are permitted  without prior written approval from the 
Lead Investigator, Veran and the associated  IRB. Deviations to the protocol  are not 
allowed, except  in the  case of  an emergency, or for the protection  of the life  or physical  
Veran Medical Technologies, Inc.

 well-being of the subject.  Investigators  are responsible for reporting all protocol 
deviations  to Veran in  writing  as soon  as reasonably  practicable and to their  IRB per the 
local reporting policy. Unless otherwise notified  in writing,  investigators  shall  provide a 
written report to Veran’s Director of Clinical Studies describing  all protocol deviations 
in full  and shall cooperate with Veran to provide any additional  information  upon 
request in a reasonable and timely manner . 
 
14. DATA STORAGE  AND MAINTENANCE  
This study will utilize  an electronic  database.  Prior to study initiation,  the PI and staff 
will receive training  to ensure that all personnel  fully understand the protocol, data 
collection,  and any other  study related  issues or documents. Data will be collected  from 
patient’s  charts, EHR, medical  imaging, and the Veran System. The Registry database 
will belong to Veran Medical Technologies.  
 
Electronic  Data will  be entered  and stored in the  secure Medrio®  database  created  for 
this study. Medrio® is a web- based application  designed exclusively  to support data 
capture for research studies.  It provides an interface for data entry, audit trails, 
procedures for importing  data from external sources, data features such as branching 
logic and calculated  fields,  and automated export procedures for data downloads to 
common statistical packages such as SAS.  
 
Each PI will review  the collected  study data, which will become part of the subject’s 
medical  record  and research  record. Any clinical  follow -up or repeat  procedures  will be 
dictated  by the patient’s  physician based on clinically relevant  data and will not be 
influenced by enrollment into this study.  
 
To protect subject  confidentiality, the data entry/portal  tool will receive all patient  data 
as de- identified  through use of  the study data  codes. All information  and data  related  to 
this study will be stored in a secured, locked cabinet at Veran Medical  Technologies, 
and also at each investigator’s site.  
 
Access to  this study data is  restricted  to the Sponsor and to study personnel  alone, and 
controls include encryption and user -id and password- protected databases.  
 
Registry  documentation and paperwork will be stored  at each Principal  Investigator’s 
site in a locked file cabinet. Registry records  will be retained for 5 years after the 
completion  of the  registry.  After that period  of time,  all individual patient  information 
will be managed according to the policies  of the PI’s institution.

In addition to the  standard site qualification  documents, prior to the  enrollment of any 
patients  in the study, the following documents  must be provided by the site to the 
Sponsor (or their designee):  
• Copy of the  IRB approval  letter  for the protocol  and informed consent  (all 
written  information  provided to the  patient must be approved by the  IRB)  
• Copy of the IRB- approved informed  consent  document  to be used 
• Copy of the protocol  sign-off page  signed by the investigator  
• Fully  executed  site agreement  (clinical trial agreement)  
 
This is a post -marketing  study conducted within approved labeling for a marketed 
510K device (and not an experimental  device). An investigator’s  meeting  and training 
sessions about localization  techniques. A cadaver session was also held to practice 
localization techniques as part of the investigator’s  meeting.  
15.3 Patient  Information  and Informed  Consent  
An ICF  must  be signed  by the patient  before  his or  her participation  in the study. The 
medical  file for each patient  should document  the informed  consent process and that 
written informed  consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. A copy of 
each signed ICF must be provided to the patient. All signed and dated ICFs must 
remain in each patient’s  study file  and must be available for verification by study 
monitors at any time.  
The ICF should be  revised  whenever there  are changes to procedures  outlined in the 
informed  consent or when new information becomes available  that may affect the

 willingness  of the patient to participate.  For any updated or  revised ICFs, the medical 
file for each patient  should document the informed consent process and that written 
informed  consent was obtained  for the  updated/revised  ICF for  continued  participation 
in the study.  
15.4 Patient  Confidentiality  
In order to maintain  patient confidentiality,  each patient  will be assigned a unique 
patient  identifier upon study enrollment. This patient identifier will be used in place of 
patient  name and or initials  for the purpose of data analysis  and reporting. Medical 
record number or other local reference  identifiers  are not collected  as part of the 
database.  All parties will ensure  protection  of patient  personal  data and will  not include 
patient  names on any study forms, reports, publications, or in any other disclosures, 
except  where required  by law. In accordance  with local  US regulations, patients  will be 
informed  about data handling procedures and asked for their consent. Data protection 
and privacy regulations  will be observed in capturing, forwarding, processing, 
reporting, and storing patient  data. Every effort  will be made to protect participant 
confidentiality.  
The database will be housed at Medrio in a physically  and 21 CFR part 11 logically 
secure computer system maintained  Medrio  with a written  security  policy. The system 
meets approved established  standards  for the security  of health information  and is 
validated. The system also meets the standards of the International  Conference on 
Harmonisation  (ICH)  guideline  E6R2 regarding electronic  study data handling and is 
available for audit upon request. Patient confidentiality will be strictly  maintained.  
15.5 Independent  Ethics  Committee/Institutional Review  Board  
Consistent  with local regulations  and prior  to enrollment of patients  at a given site, the 
study protocol will be submitted  together  with its associated  documents  (e.g., ICF)  to 
the responsible  IRB for its review. Patient enrollment will not start at any  site before 
the Sponsor has obtained  written  confirmation  of a favorable  opinion/approval  from the 
relevant  central or local IRB.  The IRB will be asked to provide documentation of the 
date of the meeting at which the favorable opinion/approval  was given that clearly 
identifies  the study, the protocol  version, and the ICF  version reviewed.  
Before  implementation  of any substantial  changes to the  protocol, protocol  amendments 
will also  be submitted to the  relevant  IRB in a manner  consistent  with local regulations. 
Pertinent safety  information  will be submitted to the  relevant IRBs during the course  of 
the study in accordance with local regulations  and requirements. It is the responsibility 
of the investigator  to have prospective  approval of the study protocol, protocol 
amendments , and ICFs, and other relevant  documents, if applicable,  from their local

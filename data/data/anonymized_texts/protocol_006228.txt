FDA Statement  
The leva  Incontinence Syste m is an investigationa l medical device under development. It has 
been designed to meet the requirements of IEC 60601- 1:2005 ( 3RD Edition), Medical 
Electrical Equipment- Part 1:   General requirements for basic safety and essential 
performance; IEC 60601-1- 2:2014 ( 4th Edition), Me dical electrical equipment -Part1 -
2:General requirements for basic safety and essential performance -Collateral standard: 
Electromagnetic compatibility -Requirements and tests; and IEC 60601-1-1- 11, General 
requirements for basic safety and essential performance -Collateral standard: Requirements 
for medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems used in the home healthcare 
environment. In addition, all materials that will come into contact with the patient have undergone biocompatibility evaluation satisfying ISO 10993- 1 requirements. All patient 
contacting materials have been tested, and passed cytotoxicity, sensitization and irritation or intra-cutaneous standards. Leva  poses little to no risk to the patient if used as instructed . 
 
  
The PFD x dev ice is an investigational medical device currently used to gather data related to 
pelvic floor health. It uses substantially equivalent technology to the  leva  Incontinence 
System, an FDA -approved, Class II medical device. Whereas the leva device uses 6 
accelerometer sensors, the PFD x device uses 12 sensors, allowing for a more complete 
evaluation of a woman’s physiology. The  PFD x device is shaped as a ring that sits in the 
fornix with a thin, flat strip that descends along and out of the vagina. At the end of the device (outside the woman’s body) is a small enclosure that houses a microprocessor and a 
Bluetooth Low Energy radio. The  PFD x communicates wirelessly to the associated 
Chromebook ClinAp p in a similar manner to the  leva device. All sensors related components 
are over -molded with the same biocompatible silicone material used to manufacture

Protocol Version 1. 4 
April 18 , 2018  6 BACKGROUND  
Pelvic floor muscle exercises  (PFME) , also known as Kegel exercises , are the first line 
conservative treatment for pelvic floor disorders , specifically  stress urinary incontinence(SUI)  
within the urogynecology community . Studies have shown that performing PFME and/or 
pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) is the most effective non- invasive treatment for SUI.  
Some women have trouble identifying and contracting the correct muscles when performing 
PFME. The  leva Pelvic Digital Health System TM is an innovative device that allows women 
to have real -time visual verification that PFME is performed correctly and consistently  by 
guiding women through pelvic floor muscle lifting. The leva Pelvic Digital Health System TM 
also measures and records the results of every PFME session performed while using the 
device thus encouraging patient compliance. Data generated during exercise is transmitted 
to a safe, HIPA A compliant database in a cloud, from which an algorithm  used to evaluate 
adherence can  be used to provide automa tic reminders and education via text message to 
encourage participation. In the proposed study we hypothesize that the leva Digital Health 
Platform:  
• improves adherence to a long- term maintenance program of pelvic floor muscle 
exercises.  
• leads to more significant improvements in pelvic floor muscle performance than a 
home PFME program.  
 
There are other alternative biofeedback devices that are home- based and approved by the 
FDA, however these are expensive and may not be covered by insurance.  There is no 
research to demonstrate that these devices are better than a PFME with or without  
supervision of  a pelvic floor Physical Therapist. The leva device has a unique way of 
verifying muscle contraction that is not focused on strength, but rather vertical displacement with muscle contraction.

7.1 Study Objective 
Primary objectives:  
 
• Compar e the efficacy of using a n innovative intravaginal system (leva ® Digital Pelvic  
SystemTM) to perform pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME) compared to a Kegel 
exercise home program in women with stress -predominant urinary incontinence 
(SUI).  
HYPOTHESIS: The leva® Plus Pelvic Digital Health  System i s superior to a home 
PFME program in the treatment of stress -predominant urinary incontinence. 
 
• Compare the effect of the Leva ® Plus Pelvic Digital Health System with home PFME 
program on measures of pelvic floor muscle performance  
HYPOTHESIS: The leva®  Plus Digital Pelvic System leads to more signif icant 
improvements in pelvic floor muscle performance than a home PFME program  
 • Evaluate the contribution of the Digital Health Platform in adherence and treatment of 
SUI for long term maintenance therapy.  
HYPOTHESIS:  The Digital Health Platform improves adherence to a long- term 
maintenance program of pelvic floor muscle exercises.  
. 
  
7.2 Study Endpoint(s)  
Efficacy:  
Efficacy, the primary outcome will be evaluated following 8- weeks of treatment at an in -
person interview by study personnel blinded to randomization, and then again by phone and 
email or mail at 6- and 12 - months.  Two validated measures will be used to evaluate 
primary outcomes.  First, the patient global impression of improvement (PGI -I), with success 
was defined as a response of “much better” or “very much better”.  Second, the Pelvic Floor 
Distress Inventory (PFDI -20) urinary distress inventory (UDI -6), with success defined as the 
absence of bothersome stress incontinence symptoms as indicated by an answer of “no” to the stress incontinence subscale items OR a response of “yes” but with a bother of “not at 
all” or “somewhat.  Other responses will not be considered successes.

• Up to 75  participants per site will be enrolled for a total of 225 subjects in the trial .  
 
 
STUDY ENROLLMENT  
The women interested in the study will be screened for participation based on 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and the MESA questionnaire identifying stress or stress -dominant 
mixed incontinence, and the UDI -6 (score > 25) .  
 
Screening visit: The study will be explained by the study staff and the consent will be 
reviewed with prospective participants.   
 
1) The following questionnaires will be administered: 
a. MESA  
b. UDI-6 
2) Pelvic exam will be performed including:  
a. POP-Q (acceptable to report from an exam within 3 months of baseline)  
b. Pelvic floor muscle assessment (Brink Scale)  (may be performed at baseline 
or screening visit (if screening < 3 months prior to baseline)  
3) If the eligibility requ irements are met, patients should be given a 3- day voiding diary  
(acceptable if reported within 3 months of baseline visit)  
 
The consent will be obtained by the licensed physician investigators or study assistants. 
Study participation will be entirely voluntary.  
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
Once patients have undergone the appropriate screening evaluation, met criteria for study 
participation, and provided informed consent, subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms.  The “Kegel” arm will involve patient education and performance of Kegel  
exercises, the current standard of care.  The “Leva” arm of the study will undergo patient education and performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises using the Leva system.  
Subjects in the “Leva” arm will be sub- randomized to one of two long term follow up plans, 
follow up without reminders or follow up using automated reminders by text message .

Protocol Version 1. 4 
April 18 , 2018  Subjects will complete validated standardized quality of life questionnaires and pelvic floor 
muscle testing using the PFDx device at in- office visits at baseline, 4 weeks and 8- weeks. 
They will record 3- day voiding diaries at baseline and at 8- weeks.  Beyond 8- weeks 
subjects will be asked to participate  in follow -up calls at 6 and 12 months and complete 
validated standardized quality of life questionnaires  by mail or email.  Patients who were 
randomized to the Leva arm of the study and were sub- randomized to the “follow up 
reminder” will receive weekly reminders to perform their pelvic floor exercises using the Leva 
device  
 The study will be funded by Renovia, who will provide leva Plus and PFDX  devices for the 
study and subject re- numeration.

3) Voiding diary – collection of a 3 -day intake and output and symptoms diary 
completed before baseline visit  
 
4) Health Care Provider will perform a Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitative (POP -Q) 
assessment (If not completed at screening)  
 
5) The PFDx  device will be t hen used to measure the pelvic floor angles and strength. 
This will be supervised by clinical research personnel  blinded to randomization.  
 
6) To optimize blinding to arm, the randomization will occur following the above surveys 
and evaluations.  
 
Following randomization, the subject will participate in one of two main study arms:  
 
.   
 KEGEL STUDY ARM  
• Subjects randomized to the Kegel Arm will receive standardized written and verbal 
instructions on how to perform three times  daily/7 days per week pelvic floor muscle 
exercises and their ability to perform the correct muscle action will be confirmed by physical exam (written instructions per the handout, adapted from Voices for PFD).  They 
will be instructed to perform these exercises three times dai ly throughout the 8 -week 
study period, based on a commonly used kegel regimen. These instructions will occur 
during the baseline visit.  Also at the baseline visit, subjects will be informed they will be 
asked to attest to the fact that they performed these exercises twice daily at least 80% of 
the time (approximately 17 times per week).  This attestation will ask the subject to recall 
their adherence; no diary or other record will be required.   
• Subjects will return to the office on week 4 to participate  in validated questionnaires and 
undergo a progress evaluation using the PFDx . For clinical questions they will be directed 
to follow up with their physician. Their evaluator will be blinded to their randomization.  
• Subjects will return to the office on week 8- to participate in validated questionnaires, 
undergo progress evaluation using the PFDx, and physical examination including a 
POP- Q and Brinks score, and attest to their adherence. Their evaluator will be blinded to 
their randomization 
• Following week 8, patients will be recommended to continue weekly Kegel exercises, but 
will be free to pursue alternative treatments if desired.  They will participate over the 
phone and via email or mail in validated questionnaires, in addition to reporting what (if 
any) additional therapies they have undergone for treatment of stress urinary incontinence at 6 months and 12 months after baseline.  
 LEVA STUDY ARM  
• Subjects randomized to the leva® Plus Pelvic Digital Health Syste m will receive training 
on the use of the Leva® Plus Digital Health System including installation of the Digital 
Health System app, the completion of a training module, a timed lift test and one full leva 
exercise session of five timed lifts. Training will  occur at the baseline visit.  Subjects will 
be instructed to perform the lifts twice a day, for 2 ½ minutes each session, 7 days a 
week for a total of 8 - weeks.  Subjects will be informed they will be asked to attest to the 
fact that they performed these exercises twice daily at least 80% of the time 
(approximately 11 times per week).  This attestation will ask the subject to recall their 
leva device  Page 18

April 18 , 2018  adherence; no diary or other record will be required, although they will also be informed 
that the leva digital system tracks adherence.  During the study period (8 -weeks) 
subjects with the leva will contact the Renovia Patient Care Engagement team with any 
technical questions or issues regarding leva use. They will receive regular (6 days/week) 
text messages based on their performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises using the 
Leva device using predetermined algorithm for content.  For any clinical questions they 
will be directed to their physician’s office to speak with a healthcare provider.   
• Subjects will return to the office on week 4 to participate in validated questionnaires (see 
chart) and undergo progress evaluation using the PFDx device. For clinical questions they will be directed to follow up with their physician. Their evaluator will be blinded to 
their randomization.     
• Subjects will return to the office on week 8 to participate in validated questionnaires  (see 
chart) and undergo progress evaluation using the PFDX device and physical 
examination including a POP -Q and Brinks score, and attest to their adherence.  Their 
evaluator will be blinded to their randomization.  
•  Following week 8, patients will be recommended to continue weekly pelvic floor muscle 
exercises using the leva device but will be free to pursue alternative treatments if 
desired.  Based on initial sub- randomization, subjects will receive periodic standardized 
text messages reminding them to use the leva over the next 10 months  or receive no 
additional contact via the leva device.  
• At 6- and 12- months they will participate in validated questionnaires (see chart) by 
phone and email or mail, in addition to reporting what (if any) additional therapies they 
have undergone for treatment of stress urinary incontinence at 6 mon ths and 12 months 
after baseline.  
• The third party research center will provide a single phone call to the subjects receiving the leva plus to ensure the device is functioning properly.  If there are questions 
regarding the device function, a conference call will be undertaken to allow the subject to 
trouble- shoot device function with the sponsor technical specialist.   The sponsor will at 
no time posess protected health information (PHI)

8.2 Risks and/or Benefits to Subjects 
 
leva Incontinence System  
The leva Incontinence System TM (leva) is an FDA -
approved, Class II medical device used to help women 
overcome urinary incontinence. It will NOT be used in 
this study, but is the predicate device upon which the 
study devices are based. The device has two main 
components: (1) a tampon- shaped silicone form that is 
inserted into the vagina (the vaginal insert ) and has a 
cable with a connector at the end; and (2) a control box that connects to the vaginal insert and contains a 
microprocessor and Bluetooth radio (the control box ). 
The intravaginal device contains six accelerometer sensors placed on a flexible circuit board that is 
encased in a silicone form. The control box reads

Protocol Version 1. 4 
April 18 , 2018  positional information from the six sensors in the vaginal insert and communicates that data 
to a mobile phone application (the App ).  
 
The leva Incontinence System TM has been tested and found to conform with the 
requirements of IEC 60601- 1:2005 (3RD Edition), Medical Electrical Equipment -Part 1:  
General requirements for basic safety and essential performance; IEC 60601-1- 2:2007, 
Medical electrical equipment -Part1 -2:General requirements for basic safety and essential 
performance -Collateral standard: Electromagnetic compatibility -Requirements and tests; 
and IEC 60601-1-1- 11, General requirements for basic safety and essential performance-
Collateral standard: Requirements for medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems used in the home healthcare environment. The results of these tests indicate that 
the device is safe for its intended use. In addition, a biocompatibility evaluation was 
performed to satisfy  ISO 10993- 1 and FDA requirements. All patient contacting materials 
have been tested, and passed cytotoxicity, sensitization and irritation or intra- cutaneous 
standards.  
. 
 
leva Plus Incontinence System  
The leva Plus Incontinence System TM is a next -
generation device currently under development. 
It has the same Indications for Use and Intended 
Use as the leva Incontinence System TM. The 
prima ry differences between leva and leva Plus  
are as follows: (1) the leva Plus  device combines 
the vaginal insert and control box into a single, 
smaller form that eliminates the need for a cable; 
(2) the leva Plus  device has a small, detachable 
battery pack at the base; (3) the leva Plus  device 
is made of a biocompatible thermoplastic 
elastomer, whereas leva  is made of 
biocompatible silicone; and (4) the leva Plus  
device uses a Bluetooth Low Energy radio whereas the leva devices uses a classic 
Bluetooth radio. The leva Plus  device 
communicates with an iPhone or Android mobile phone and provides biofeedback to the patient in 
the same way that leva  does.  
 The leva Plus  device has not been submitted to 
FDA for approval yet. However, it is being 
developed under appropriate Design Controls and Risk 
Analysis, as defined by FDA’s 21 CFR 820 and ISO 13485. 
Renovia plans to submit a 510k application to FDA by late 
summer 2017. Given the similarity of leva Plus  and leva, alon g 
with independent risk analysis, leva Plus  is considered a “non -
significant risk device” as defined by 21 CFR 812.3(m).  
 
PFDx   
The PFDx  device is an investigational medical device currently 
used to gather data related to pelvic floor health. It uses leva Plus Incontinence System.  
 Image shows the vaginal insert detached 
from the battery pack.

Protocol Version 1. 4 
April 18 , 2018  substantially equivalent technology to the leva Incontinence System, an FDA -approved, 
Class II medical device. Whereas the leva  device uses 6 accelerometer sensors, the PFDx  
device uses 12 sensors, allowing for a more complete evaluation of  a woman’s physiology. 
The PFDx  device is shaped as a ring that sits in the fornix with a thin, flat strip that descends 
along and out of the vagina. At the end of the device (outside the woman’s body) is a small 
enclosure that houses a microprocessor and a Bluetooth Low Energy radio. The PFDx  
communicates wirelessly to a laptop or mobile phone, in a similar manner to the leva device. 
All sensors related components are over -molded with the same biocompatible silicone 
material used to manufacture the leva device. Given the similarity of leva Plus  and leva, 
along with independent risk analysis, leva Plus  is considered a “non -significant risk device” 
as defined by 21 CFR 812.3(m).

April 18 , 2018  9 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The Study Events Flow Chart ( Section 4) summarizes the procedures to be performed at 
each visit. Individual procedures are described in detail below. Additional evaluations/testing 
may be deemed necessary by the PI and/or the Sponsor for reasons related to subject 
safety.  
Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take precedence over all routine scheduled procedures.  
9.1.1  Adverse Events  
9.1.1.1  Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored at each study visit  for adverse events . A specific enquiry will be 
made at the time of each check -in. The subjects will be queried with an open- ended 
question such as “How are you feeling?” or “How have you been feeling since your last 
visit?”  
9.1.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Any SAE will be reported to the Sponsor and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) , as 
required. All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor via fax or e -mail within one working day of 
becoming aware of the event, whether or not the serious events are deemed study treatment -related and within 5 working days to the IRB (24 hours of discovery if the event 
involves a death), as required. 
An SAE is any AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the PI or Sponsor, 
results in any of the following outcomes:   Death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition.  
Life-threatening is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of the PI 
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Treatment of SAEs will be performed by a physician, either at the site or at a nearby hospital 
emergency room. Where appropriate, medical test(s) and/or examination(s) will be 
performed to document resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, 
improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown (lost to follow -up). 
If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact the Sponsor’s Representative listed in 
Section 2 .

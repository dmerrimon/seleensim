Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 10   3 BACKGROUND 3.1 Background & Preliminary Work Metastatic prostate cancer rates have dropped significantly over the past 30-years, due to early aggressive prostatectomy and radiation therapy. However, hundreds of thousands of survivors have significant treatment-related side-effects, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.  Treatment related side-effects result from collateral damage to structures alongside the prostate, such as nerves (erections) and sphincter muscle (incontinence).  Injury or wide resection of sphincter and nerves is frequently intentional, or planned, to ensure all cancer is removed; yet, in hindsight it often appears this wide resection was not required.  That is, a high percentage of the time the cancer is not extending outside the prostate as suspected or feared from biopsy and imaging-based staging.  Prostate cancer is unique — most cases of extra-prostatic extension (extension into muscle and nerves) is not visible either on standard preoperative imaging, or to the operating surgeon during resection.  Extra-prostatic extension is instead discovered on pathologic analysis after the patient has left the operating room.  Prostate cancer has other unique features that make operative planning difficult: (1) it is multi-focal in up to 80% of subjects (Fig. 1); (2) it often presents with mixed grade lesions (Fig. 1); and (3) conventional imaging modalities (ultrasound, MRI) can miss significant cancers entirely.  Hundreds of thousands of men could have peace of mind and improved outcomes, if new imaging could accurately detect extra-prostatic extension of prostate cancer to better guide treatment.  Recent studies on treatment-related regret in prostate cancer show key drivers of regret are: nerve related injury (erectile dysfunction), loss of masculinity, and positive surgical margins (van Stan, et al. 2020, Baunake, et al. 2020). Cellularly targeted molecular imaging (PSMA-PET) appears to have the needed ability to detect aggressive prostate cancer, but requires further testing to validate its usefulness in surgical guidance.

IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 11   INNOVATION  We currently use multiparametric 3-T MRI (mpMRI), in addition to ultrasound biopsies, to guide surgical therapy, but significant uncertainty remains due to limited sensitivity.  Incorporating MRI-guidance does increase the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer compared to systematic biopsy alone (Hu, et al. 2014, Pokorny, et al. 2017, Wysock, et al. 2014).  However, recent studies mapping MRI lesions to final whole-mount pathology show significant limitations remain with this imaging approach.  For example, a recent study showed only 80% of index (largest) tumors were seen by MRI, and even fewer secondary lesions (Le, et al. 2014).  Another recent study showed MRI missed a clinically significant lesion in 26% of patients using whole-mount analysis (Borofsky, et al. 2017).  Fittingly, Borofsky titled their paper, “What are we missing? False negative cancers at Multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate.”  MRI interpretation has also been shown to vary substantially between radiologists, which persisted after correcting for radiologist practice volume (Sonn, et al. 2017, Sonn, et al. 2020).  We have performed thousands of prostatectomies at Indiana University and note that many patients have “prostate confined” cancer that could have been cured with nerve sparing treatment.  The converse is also concerningly true: many patients have positive surgical margins where nerve sparing surgery was performed at sites of extra-prostate extension leaving cancer behind.  We were early investigators of PSMA-PET imaging, and since 2017 have been observing whether PSMA-PET could aid in surgical resection.  Using a molecular targeted agent such as 68Ga-PSMA-11 to guide resection represents a significant innovation in surgical planning, appearing to offer better individualization of the treatment plan with reduced surgical margins, when appropriate, and consequently improving quality of life.  Preliminary Studies PSMA PET imaging in primary prostate cancer has been reported primarily out of Germany and Australia with few prospective studies in the United States.  Few studies utilize the labor-intensive whole-mount pathology as the “gold standard” for rigorous disease characterization, and few studies have comprehensively looked specifically at extra-prostatic extension and surgical resection guidance.  Furthermore, the published studies have focused on a small percentage of aggressive prostate cancer (high-risk disease) rather than the majority of pre-metastatic cancers (intermediate risk disease).  For example, the only study reported out of the United States was a retrospective 
IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 12   review of 32 higher risk aggressive cancers (≥4+3) removed by prostatectomy, which found PSMA PET-MRI to be superior to mpMRI (Sensitivity 74% vs 50%, p<0.001, Hicks, et al. 2018).  A retrospective trial out of Australia compared 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT and mpMRI using a per lesion approach (Berger, et al. 2018).  They found index lesion localization was better for PSMA-PET than MRI (100% vs 94%).  Secondary lesion sensitivity was much higher for PSMA-PET than for MRI (94% vs 52%).  We need larger prospective studies focused on improved surgical guidance in the patient population posing the greatest challenge in urologic decision-making, patients with intermediate risk disease. Preliminary Studies/Data 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for Early Metastatic Disease.  The project investigators have significant experience in PET imaging with 68Ga-PSMA-11. Our initial human experience with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was for dosimetry assessment, studying ten prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence who had been previously clinically imaged with 11C-acetate under an Expanded Access IND (Green, et al. 2017). The expected utility of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was apparent even in that limited series, with 68Ga detecting sites of metastasis not seen in 11C-acetate imaging.  We have subsequently dropped 11C-acetate imaging in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence in favor of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, and have performed clinical imaging on over 400 patients under Expanded Access IND 131,806.  68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for Diagnosis and Surgical Planning. We recently published an observational trial evaluating 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT or PET-MRI preoperatively in 15 patients with biopsy-proven high or intermediate-risk prostate cancer (Bahler, et al. 2019).  The PSMA-PET exam was obtained prior to scheduled surgical resection for correlation of imaging findings with whole-mount pathology.  All staging 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans (15/15) showed suspicious prostate lesions (index lesion) with median (IQR) SUV of 10.0 (6-13); benign prostate had a median (IQR) SUVmax of 2.2 (2-3).  Good registration was seen between PSMA-PET and whole mount imaging for lethal cancer.  For secondary lesions, 8/11 (82%) were detected with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET; the three missed lesions were of ≤10% Pattern 4 (>90% pattern 3).  Our study was published with the following Editorial Comment: “This study is…one of the few that has done so for intermediate risk disease and it delineates the accuracy of PSMA imaging to differentiate histological grade groups 1- 3.  Prospective well-designed trials validating PSMA imaging in these low prevalence populations are critical and a logical next step based on these study results” (Emmett and Hofman, 2020).

A lesion at the base of the prostate is seen (30% pattern 4) with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT scanner.  68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for predicting extra-prostatic extension. Currently, we have 33 prostatectomy cases (each case has right and left nerve bundle) available with preoperative PSMA-PET imaging.   Extra-prostatic extension was noted in 26/66 (39%) nerve bundles, and this was predicted in 24/26 (92%) of the cases on PSMA-PET.  The PSMA-PET would have changed the treatment plan in 18/33 (55%) of cases, including choosing to spare 12 nerve bundles, while also avoiding nerve sparing in 4 cases of extra-prostatic extension.  See Appendix A for example PSMA-PET surgeon’s report to guide resection. Figure 3. A lesion is noted along the left posterior near the nerve bundle but not the right.  Final pathology was consistent with the PSMA-PET showing extra-prostatic extension only on the left. This patient safely had right-sided nerve-sparing without positive margin due to the PET.    Prostatectomy carries significant risk for post-treatment urinary and erectile dysfunction.  PSMA-PET imaging offers the potential of both cancer control and excellent quality of life for patients whose disease is localized to the prostate. There is an immediate clinical need for validation of advanced imaging (PSMA-PET) in the context of enabling more precise surgical guidance.

Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 14   3.2 Rationale Our long-term goal is to improve cancer outcomes and quality of life for prostate cancer patients by bringing novel imaging agents and systems to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Prostatectomy carries significant risk for post-treatment urinary and erectile dysfunction.  PSMA-PET imaging offers the potential of both cancer control and excellent quality of life for patients whose disease is localized to the prostate (see figure below). There is an immediate clinical need for validation of advanced imaging (PSMA-PET) in the context of enabling more precise surgical guidance.            Figure 4.  The prostate is located near several anatomic structures important for genito-urinary function.  Advanced imaging is important to avoid unnecessary treatment of surrounding structures, while ensuring all malignant lesions are treated.  We aim to improve quality of life by appropriately avoiding injury to structures 1-4 shown at left.  EPE = extra-prostatic extension.

Potential patients will be identified in the Urology clinic, or by physician referrals, mostly likely but not exclusively during pre-operative consultations for surgical removal of prostate cancer. All study procedures will take place at IUSCC/IUH/IU-Health Methodist Hospital, with the research imaging performed at the IU Health Goodman Hall outpatient facility or R2 research facility within the Indiana University Department of Radiology and Imagining Sciences.  All patients will be registered with the Indiana University (IU) Department of Urology. Regulatory files will be maintained by the Department of Urology. Applicable regulatory documents must be completed and on file prior to registration of any patients. Patients who appear to be eligible for this trial will undergo the Informed Consent Process and be screened for eligibility utilizing the Eligibility Criteria. Individual patient registration will be done in the REDCap database. The original signed Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Document and completed eligibility checklist will be stored in the following location: Indiana University Department of Urology, 535 N. Barnhill Dr., Ste 150, Indianapolis, IN, 46202. 8 STUDY PROCEDURES 8.1 Summary This patient population will have clinically significant prostate cancer and either already be scheduled for, or in the process of scheduling a prostatectomy.  Patients will either have recently had (within 6-months) a standard of care prostate MRI as part of routine care for their prostate cancer. Following the informed consent process, patients who enroll in the study will receive a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT.  The sensitivity and specificity for lesion characterization will be evaluated, along with the ability of the tracer to inform the treatment planning.  After patients undergo surgical removal of the prostate it will have a slice-by-slice whole mount analysis to assess the sensitivity and specificity the PSMA PET.

Suspicious lesions will be marked in a blinded fashion. o AE assessment: AEs will be assessed at the time of 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration any event not expected is collected including but not limited to: rash and shortness of breath. o Safety monitoring following radiopharmaceutical administration will consist of visual and verbal monitoring of the patent after injection, and during and at the conclusion of the PET/CT procedure, with any apparent patient abnormalities, reactions or reported effects noted in the study records. o The nuclear medicine technologists administering the radiopharmaceutical are responsible for immediately reporting any adverse or unexpected events to the principal investigator or clinical designee, who will report the occurrence of any adverse events to the IRB. o As in most clinical nuclear medicine procedures, these radiopharmaceuticals are administered at a sub-pharmacologic doses.  Adverse events are exceedingly unlikely, as 68Ga-HBED-CC has been clinically employed, extensively and without reported incident, in  clinical patient diagnostic imaging studies in prostate cancer patients in Germany and other European countries, as well as in over 400 patients locally.

Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 22   o If there is a discrepancy between the PSMA and conventional MRI scan, the investigators will discuss the treatment plan with the patient at the investigator’s discretion. This will be completed through a pre-surgery clinic or virtual visit within 9days of the PET/CT scan. 8.3.3 Surgery and Pathology • The standard of care surgical procedure is performed as indicated by the cancer. • Pathologic assessment: whole mount sections of prostate tissue and routine sections of lymph nodes if applicable will be fixed and analyzed by licensed pathologist per routine care.  This typically happens within 2 weeks of prostatectomy. • Additional study-related pathologic assessment: intraprostatic lesion-based assessment will be done to document the % Gleason pattern 3, 4, and 5 within each lesion.  The Extra-prostatic extension and positive margins will be documented.  This may be “batched” at the discretion of the pathology department. • How the knowledge of the PSMA-PET informs treatment will be tracked. Examples of informing the decision include the number and location of 68Ga-PSMA-PET detected: additional intraprostatic cancer lesions diagnosed, extra-prostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node invasion. 9 STUDY WITHDRAWAL/DISCONTINUATION Subjects must be discontinued from the study for the following reasons: • Withdrawal of consent • Investigator deems withdrawal necessary at any time if it is determined that it is not in the subjects best interest to continue, or if the subject is found to be noncompliant with study procedures. If subject discontinues after administration of study drug, he or she will be encouraged to continue on study for safety procedures per protocol. Reason(s) for discontinuing must be clearly documented in the appropriate source documents. 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Study Design A prospective, single arm, pilot study for evaluating the performance of PSMA-PET 
IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 23   10.2 Study Population The enrolled population comprises all patients who meet the eligibility criteria and are registered onto the study. 10.3 Sample Size The sample size justification of the pilot study is based on the primary objective of estimating the sensitivity and specificity for PSMA-PET for detecting extra-prostatic extension of cancer at the nerve bundles. The sensitivity and specificity will be calculated using both the left and right nerve bundles, based on the gold standard of whole-mount pathology.  A sample size of 50 patients would therefore generate 100 data points. Assuming about 20% of the 100 left and right nerve bundles are not evaluable. Then we could have at least 80 data points.  Based on the preliminary data, the prevalence of extra-prostatic extension is about 35%. The sensitivity of PSMA-PET is anticipated to be 90%. A sample size of 80 would provide a two-sided 95% sensitivity confidence interval with a width of at most 0.23. The specificity of PSMA-PET is anticipated to be 76%. A sample size of 80 would provide a two-sided 95% specificity  confidence interval with a width of at most 0.25. All calculations will be based on the simple asymptotic method with continuity correction. 10.4 Participant Characteristics Demographic characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 10.5 Analysis of Primary Objective The sensitivity and specificity will be summarized along with 95% CI using the simple asymptotic method with continuity correction. PPV and NPV will also be summarized along with 95% CI using the simple asymptotic method with continuity correction. 10.6 Analysis of Secondary Objectives  The frequency of proper treatment changes directed by PSMA-PET compared to MRI will be summarized along 95% CI for all evaluable subjects, and separated for 3 areas important for genito-urinary function including: 1) Bladder neck, 2) Nerve bundles, 3) Urethral Sphincter (Figure 4).  We will use the McNemar test to compare the sensitivity and specificity values between PET and MRI although data from this pilot study is considered hypothesis generating only due to the small sample size.  The quality of life data including IIEF-15 (Erectile function score), EPIC-26 (Pad use), SF-36 (overall mental and physical health domains) are longitudinal data, which will be analyzed separately. The analysis will start with the graphical representation of the data, where 
IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 24   mean and the standard of mean at each time point will be plotted and linked over time. An exploratory statistical modelling approach will be conducted to analyze the change over time. In particular, a mixed effects model will be used to analyze the data.   The parametric kinetic modeling data will be assessed for goodness-of-fit of the measured regional tissue time-activity curves to the applied kinetic model. Additionally, the images derived by voxel-wise kinetic modeling will be visually compared to standard reconstructions of the integrated regional concentration of radioactivity, assessing apparent lesion size, lesion position, and lesion/background contrast.  11 DATA FORMS AND SUBMISSION SCHEDULE This study will utilize the secure, web-based, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system for data input.  REDCap was developed by Vanderbilt University and is provided by Indiana University through their community license.  REDCap is managed by the Indiana University Department of Biostatistics and secured by University Information Technology Services Advanced IT Core.  Access to the password protected database will be limited to the investigators of this study, and any data that is distributed will be either de-identified or authorized by written permission from the subject. All source documents are to remain in the patient’s clinic file.  All documents should be kept according to applicable federal guidelines.  12 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN This study will be conducted in accordance with the IU Simon Cancer Center Institutional DSMP for High Risk Trials.      Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and subject safety. Weekly review meetings for high risk trials are required and will include the principal investigator, clinical research specialist and/or research nurse (other members per principal investigator’s discretion). Weekly meeting summaries should include review of data and subject safety by including for each dose level: the number of subjects, significant toxicities as described in the protocol, dose adjustments and responses observed. Study teams should maintain meeting minutes and attendance for submission to the DSMC upon request.    Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  The IUSCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for oversight of subject safety, regulatory compliance, and data integrity for this trial.  The DSMC will 
IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 25   review this study semi-annually to review overall trial progress, toxicity, compliance, data integrity, and accrual per the Institutional DSMP.      Furthermore, the DSMC conducts an administrative review of serious adverse events (SAEs), deviations, reportable events, and any other outstanding business.  Major issues may require further DSMC review or action.      For any increase in frequency of grade 3 or above adverse events (above the rate reported in the Investigator Brochure or package insert), the principal investigator will notify the DSMC Chair immediately.  The notification will include the incidence of study adverse events, grades, and attributions, as well as investigator statements regarding comparison with risks per the IB/ package insert.       At any time during the conduct of the trial, if it is the opinion of the investigators that the risks (or benefits) to the subject warrant early closure of the study, the DSMC Chair and Compliance Officer must be notified within 1 business day via email, and the IRB must be notified within 5 business days. Alternatively, the DSMC may initiate suspension or early closure of the study based on its review. 12.1 IND Annual Reports For trials with an IND held locally by the IU principal investigator or university, the IND Annual Report will be prepared and submitted to the Compliance Team.  This report will be reviewed by the DSMC at the time of FDA submission.   12.2 Study Auditing and Monitoring  All trials conducted at the IUSCC are subject to auditing/monitoring. Reports will be forwarded to the DSMC for review.  12.3 Data Management/OnCore Reporting Requirements   The DSMC reviews data and study progress directly from Oncore; therefore, timely data entry and status updates are vital.  Study data must be entered within Oncore promptly, no later than one week from study visit occurrence.  Subject status in Oncore will be 
IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 26   updated in real time, as this may affect overall trial enrollment status.  Global SAEs and deviations will be reviewed on a monthly basis by the DSMC Chair directly from Oncore.    12.4 OnCore Safety Reporting  In addition to protocol- and regulatory-required safety reporting, all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be captured in the Oncore system within 1 business day of notification.  Initial SAE reporting will include as much detail as available, with follow-up to provide complete information.   Attributions will be assessed to study drugs, procedures, study disease, and other alternate etiology.      12.5 Study Accrual Oversight  Accrual data will be entered into the IU Simon Cancer Center OnCore system. The Protocol Progress Committee (PPC) reviews study accrual twice per year while the PPC coordinator reviews accrual quarterly. 12.6 Protocol Deviation Reporting  Protocol deviations will be entered into OnCore within 5 days of discovery and reviewed by the DSMC Chair on a monthly basis. Findings will be reported to the full DSMC at the time of study review.  For serious or repetitive protocol deviations, additional action may be required by the DSMC.   13 ADVERSE EVENTS 13.1 Definitions of Adverse Events 13.1.1 Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 4.0 (Appendix A). 
IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 27   13.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more of the following: • Results in death or ANY death occurring within 28 days of last dose of study drug (even if it is not felt to be drug related)  • Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: Hospitalizations that are not considered SAEs are:  o Hospitalization planned prior to first administration of study drug o Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition unrelated to the study medication • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above).  Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 13.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event An adverse event not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure or package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the Investigator's brochure or package insert. 13.1.4 Determining Attribution to the Investigational Agent(s) Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical intervention. CTCAE does not define an AE as necessarily “caused by a therapeutic intervention”. After naming and grading the event, the clinical investigator must assign an attribution to the AE using the following attribution categories: Relationship Attribution Description 
IUSCCC-0760  
Version Date: 03/29/2022    Page: 28   Unrelated to investigational agent/intervention Unrelated The AE is clearly NOT related Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related Related to investigational agent/intervention Possible The AE may be related Probable The AE is likely related Definite The AE is clearly related 13.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements: Adverse events will be recorded for the study drug administration) regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial medications. All AEs considered related to trial medication will be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insignificant, even if this occurs post-trial. 13.2.1 Reporting to the IRB:  Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported promptly to the IRB if they:  • unexpected; • related or possibly related to participation in the research; and • suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.   If the serious adverse event does not meet all three (3) criteria listed above, the event does not have to be promptly reported to the IU IRB.  However, it should be reported at the time of continuing review. Prompt reporting of unanticipated problems to the IRB is defined as within 5 days from becoming aware of the event. 13.2.2 Reporting to the IUSCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee: Regardless of study sponsorship, the study team must enter all initial and follow-up SAE, expedited, and noncompliance reports into OnCore® for review by the DSMC chair and/or coordinator. Expedited reports may include IRB Prompt Report Forms, AdEERS reports, MedWatch, and additional SAE forms as required by the sponsor. When follow-up information is received, a follow-up report should also be created in OnCore®. This DSMC reporting requirement is in addition to any other regulatory bodies to be notified (i.e. IRB, FDA, pharmaceutical company, etc.). The DSMC chair and/or coordinator will review all SAE, expedited, and noncompliance reports monthly.

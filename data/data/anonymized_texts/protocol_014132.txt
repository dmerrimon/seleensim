Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 6 of 94 Exploratory Objectives  
To explore Quality of Life in subjects with 
POAG or OHT when given DE -126 or 
Timolol for 3 months.  Exploratory Endpoints  
 Glaucoma Quality of Life -15 (GQL -15) 
questionnaire at Baseline (Visit 2, Day 1) 
and Month 3  (Visit  5). 
 
Duration of Treatment : 3 months  
Methodology : 
This is a Phase IIb, randomized, double -masked, active -controlled, parallel -group and 
multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of DE -126 ophthalmic solution 0.002% 
compared with Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% in subjects with POAG or OHT.  
Subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT who meet eligibility criteria at Visit 1  (Screening)  
will washout of their current topical IOP-lowering medication(s), if any.   After completing the 
required washout period, subjects will return for Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1).   Subjects who meet 
all eligibility criteria at baseline will be randomized to receive treatment for 3 months.  
Approximate ly 294 adult subjects with POAG or OHT who meet all eligibility criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either:  
 DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution 0.002% QD (20:00)  and Vehicle  QD (08:00),  or 
 Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% BID (20:00 and 08:00) 
 
Study Design : Please s ee Figure  1. 
 
This study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 35 days including a washout period of up 
to 28 days (+ 7 days window) and a 3 -month Double -Masked Treatment Period.  
At the Screening vi sit (Visit 1), subjects will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  Eligible subjects will be instructed to discontinue use of all IOP -lowering 
medications, if any, during a washout period as follows (up to +7 days as a window is 
allowe d): 
 Miotics: 7 days  
 Oral/topical Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs): 7 days  
 Alpha agonists: 14 days  
 Alpha/beta agonists: 14 days  
 Alpha antagonists (α1 blocker): 28 days  
 Beta antagonists (β blocker, including αβ blockers): 28 days  
 Prostaglandin Analogs (PGA): 28 days  
 Rho kinase inhibitor: 28 days  
 Combination drugs: The longest washout period of the individual component will 
be used.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 7 of 94 Please note : Subjects are only allowed to be treated with a maximum of two active ingredients 
for IOP reduction  prior to screening . 
During the required washout period, subjects who discontinue their current treatment may, if 
the Investigator deems it necessary, be treated with a short -acting IOP lowering agent, topical 
CAI, e.g., brinzolamide or dorzolamide eye dro ps, one drop twice daily.  Topical CAI 
treatment must be stopped 1 week before the randomization at Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1).  
An interim safety visit during the washout period (mid -washout visit; Optional Visit 1a) may 
be performed during the washout  period if, in the Investigator’s opinion, a subject’s IOP may 
be of concern during the washout period.   If subjects are treated with a topical CAI during the 
washout period, mid -washout visit ( Optional Visit 1a) is recommended to be performed.  
Final eligibilit y for randomization will be determined at Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1) after all 
necessary washout from prior IOP -lowering medications ha ve been completed.   
At Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , baseline IOP will be measured for both eyes at 08:00 (±60 min), 
10:00 (±60 min) , and 16:00 (±60 min).  The study eye will be the eye that qualifies per 
eligibility criteria at Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) .  If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria, the eye 
with the higher mean diurnal IOP at Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1)  will be designated as the study 
eye.  If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria and have the same mean diurnal IOP, the right 
eye will be designated as the study eye.   Both eyes should be treated with the study medication 
for the duration of the study, even if on ly one eye is eligible per IOP inclusion criteria.  
Please note: Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 (Eligibility/Baseline, D ay 1) may be combined into 
one visit for t reatment -naïve subjects  as long as the additional requirements of Visit 2 
(Eligibility/Baselin e, Day 1) are fulfilled on the day of this combined visit; in particular, full 
diurnal IOP measurements (at 08:00, 1 0:00, 16:00) must be taken.  
Double -Masked Treatment Period (3 months):  
Approximately 294 eligible adult subjects will be randomized to recei ve either DE-126 
ophthalmic solution 0.002%  QD in the evening and vehicle QD in the morning or Timolol 
maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5%  BID in a 1:1 ratio.  Subjects will be treated for 3 months 
with scheduled visits at Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1), 3 (Week 2), 4 (Week 6) , and 5 (Month 3).  
Subjects will be contacted approximately 2 weeks post last study drug administration by a 
phone call to confirm AE.  
In the evening of Visit 2 (Baseline , Day 1 ), subjects will receive their first dose of study 
medication (s tudy eye drops) as per their assigned/randomized study treatment at  
20:00 (±60 min).   The next day, subjects will subsequently dose with their assigned study 
medication at 08:00 (±60 min), and 20:00 (±60 min).  For the DE -126/Vehicle  arm, the  
08:00 (±60 min) instillation will be DE -126 vehicle and the 20:00  (±60 min)  instillation will 
be DE -126 ophthalmic solution 0.002% .  At each scheduled follow -up visit, subjects will 
receive their morning dose of study medication/eye drops following the 08:00 (±60 min ) IOP 
measurement at the investigative site (the doctor’s office).  
IOP will be measured at 08:00 (±60 min), 10:00 (±60 min) , and 16:00 (±60 min) at Visit 3 
(Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 6), and Visit 5 (Month 3) .  At these scheduled visits, BCVA and  
slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be performed just prior to the 08:00 (±60 min) IOP measurement. 
Vital signs (resting blood pressure and pulse rate) will be collected in sitting position anytime 
at Visit 1  (Screening) , and approximately 08:00 for Visit  2 (Base line), and 5 (Month 3) .  After 
the 16:00 (±60 min) IOP measurement at Visit 5  (Month 3) , ophthalmoscopy with the pupil 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 8 of 94 dilated will be performed.   Subjects will be contacted approximately 2 weeks post last study 
drug administration by a phone call to confi rm AE.  
Pharmacogenomics/ Genomics:  
Subjects who consent to the optional pharmacogenomics/genomics (PGx) laboratory study 
will provide a blood sample for future testing.   The earliest this sample is to be collected  at 
Visit 3 (Week 2 ), but it may also be collected  at any later time during  the study  after Visit 2 
(Eligibility/Baseline) or at a separate post -study visit, if necessary .  The purpose of  this 
exploratory research  is to identify possible genetic markers associated  with the study  
medication(s) and/or ocular conditions.  
Masking:  
This is a double -masked study.   The subjects, Investigators, Examiners , and Santen personnel 
involved in the conduct of the study will be masked to the study treatment.  An authorized 
unmasked study staff member at the investigator site who is not the Investigator or Examiner  
will dispense and collect study medication(s) and will query about dosing compliance.  
Subjects will be instructed not to show the eye drop bottles or discuss the eye drop s to either 
the Inves tigator or the Examiner or other study subjects.  The active control treatment (Timolol 
Maleate) bottles will be over -labeled and packaged in the same secondary package  
(e.g., cardboard carton) as the investigational treatment (DE -126). Subjects in DE -126/Vehicle  
arm will receive a kit containing 2 bottles labeled “morning” for the morning dose and  
2 bottles labeled “evening” for the evening dose. Subjects on Timolol arm will receive a kit 
containing 2 bottles labeled morning/evening for the BID dosing.  
Each eligible subject will receive a numbered study medication kit assigned by Central 
randomization via Interactive Response Technology (Medidata Rave  RTSM ) at Visit 2  
(Baseline, Day 1)  and at Visit 4 (Week 6).  
Inclusion Criteria : Please see Section  5.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Exclusion Criteria:  Please see Section  5.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Investigational product, dosage , and mode of administration :  
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the DE -126/Vehicle arm and Timolol 
Maleate arms to receive either DE -126/Vehicle  or Timolol Maleate , as descri bed below:  
Investigational Product : 
DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution contains 0.002% DE -126. Other ingredient s include  
 
 
Vehicle : 
The vehicle is identical to the investigational product but does not contain the active ingredient 
DE-126. 
Active Control : 
Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% contains the active ingredient, Timolol  5 mg/m l, and 
the preservative BAK 0.01%.  Other ingredients include monobasic and dibasic sodium 
phosphate and purified water.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5 to 7.5 with sodium hydroxide.  

Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 9 of 94 Each subject will b e instructed to instill one drop of study medication in each eye at 20:00 and 
at 08:00 starting the evening of Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1) through the morning of Visit  5  
(Month 3).  
Route of Administration of Investigational Product : Topical ocular  
Duration of the Study : The study duration includes up to a 5 - weeks Screening Period, a  
3-month Double -Masked Treatment Period , and up to a 2 - weeks Follow -up Period . 
Statistical Methods : 
The sample size  calculation  is based  on a two-sided  Type  I error  rate of 5% and a  
non-inferiority  margin  of 1.5 mmHg.   Assuming  a between -treatment  difference  of 0 mmHg,   
a standard  deviation  (SD)  of 4.0 mmHg,  and a correlation  coefficient  of 0.6 among  repeated 
measures, approximately 280 adult subjects in total (140 s ubjects per treatment arm) will 
provide 70% power to demonstrate non -inferiority of DE -126 0.002% to Timolol 0.5%.  
Assuming a drop -out rate of 5%, the final needed sample size will be 294 in total,  
i.e. 147 subjects/arm . 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, a  mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) will 
be fitted and 95% confidence interval for least square mean difference in IOP in the study eye 
between the DE -126/Vehicle arm and the Timolol Maleate arm at each scheduled time point of 
each post-baseline visit up to Month 3 will be estimated.   Non-inferiority is achieved if the 
upper limit of the two -sided  
95% confidence interval for the difference in the mean IOP (DE -126 0.002% - Timolol Maleate 
0.5%) is ≤ 1.5 mmHg at all nine time points and ≤ 1.0 mmHg in majority (5 or more) of the  
9 time points.   If non -inferiority is achieved for the primary endpoint, superiority will be tested.  
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, a  MMRM will be fitted on observed cases up to 
Month 3 on the mean d iurnal IOP  in the study eye .  The least square mean diurnal IOP of each 
treatment arm and 95% confidence interval for the difference between DE -126/Vehicle and 
Timolol at Month 3 will be estimated.  If  
non-inferiority in the primary endpoint is achieved, then the key secondary endpoint will be 
tested at the 0.05 significance level (2 -sided).   Non-inferiority is achieved if the upper limit of 
the two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in the mean diurnal IOP (0.002%  
DE-126 - Timolol Maleate) at Month 3 is ≤ 1.5 mmHg.   If non -inferiority is achieved for the 
key secondary endpoint, superiority will be tested.  
All safety outcome measures will be summarized descriptively.  Incidences of AEs will be 
tabulated by the system organ classes and preferr ed terms specified in the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ).  Separate summaries will be provided for ocular and 
non-ocular AEs.

2.1. Study Rationale  
This Phase IIb  study (01260 4IN) will assess the safety and efficacy of DE-126 ophthalmic 
solution 0.002%  QD against Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5%  BID in subjects with 
POAG or OHT after 12 weeks of treatment.  The efficacy and safety profiles for DE -126 have 
been explored in early clinical studies.  Four clinical studies were conducted in the U.S. and 
Japan with DE -126 in healthy adult subjects, or subjects with POAG or OHT to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of DE -126.  As a result, DE -126 ophthalmic solution in concentration of 
0.002% appeared to be tolerated and effective.  This data, along with the novel mechanism of 
action of DE -126, support the  initiation of the clinical study presented in this protocol.  
2.2. Background  
Glaucoma is a group of diseases of the optic nerve, often associated with elevated IOP.  When 
left untreated, glaucoma can lead to retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve damage t hat result 
in progressive and irreversible loss of vision.  Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible 
blindness in the world (King et al., 2013 ).  While people of all ages can be diagnosed with 
glaucoma, it primarily affects adults who are 40 years of age or greater, and the prevalence 
increases substantially with increasing age group.  In  2013, t he global prevalence of glaucoma 
for the population 40 to 80 years of age was 3.54%, or 64.3 million, and the prevalence was 
estimated to increase to 76.0 million by 2020 and 111.8 million by 2040  (Tham et al., 2014 ). 
Although currently there is no cure for open -angle glaucoma, results from multiple studies, 
including the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) (AGIS_Investigators, 2000 ), the 
Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) (Kass et al., 2002 ), and the Early Manifest 
Glaucoma Trial  (EMGT)  (Leske et al., 2003 ), have demonstrated that treating elevated IOP with 
topical ocular hypotensive agents is effective in delaying or preventing disease progression.  The 
lowering of IOP is  currently the only method for reducing the risk of glaucomatous visual field 
loss and remains the primary goal of therapy.  
Topical hypotensive agents are typically the first -line treatment option for patients with OAG or 
OHT; there are several classes and  they are differentiated by their mechanisms of action (MOAs) 
at the cellular/molecular level:  
1. Prostanoid FP receptor agonists (FP agonists) (all FP agonists approved for the reduction 
of elevated IOP in patients with Open -Angle Glaucoma ( OAG ) or OHT are P GAs or 
prostamides)  
2. Beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta blockers)  
3. CAIs  
4. Alpha -adrenergic agonists  
5. Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors  
6. Parasympathomimetics  
Some classes of ocular hypotensive medications lower IOP primarily by reducing aqueous 
humor production (beta b lockers, CAIs, and alpha -adrenergic agonists), and some lower IOP 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 19 of 94 mainly by increasing aqueous humor outflow (FP agonists, ROCK inhibitors, and 
parasympathomimetics).  Of those medications that primarily increase aqueous humor outflow, 
ROCK inhibitors , and parasympathomimetics mainly increase trabecular outflow and FP 
agonists primarily increase uveoscleral outflow.  Additional distinctions exist among the MOAs, 
and thus the pharmacodynamic effects of these medications can differ substantially.  
Of the avai lable topical hypotensive agents, FP agonists are the most frequently prescribed 
first-line topical therapies (Cheema et al., 2016 ; European_Glaucoma_Society, 2017 ), as they 
lower IOP in most patients and have minimal systemic side effects.  
First line treatment with PGAs or β -blockers is very effective  in IOP reduction ; however,  
mono -therapy is often ins ufficient to achieve target IOP.  Therefore, adjunctive therapy or 
combination therapy with a drug of other classes is often chosen as an alternative.  Limited 
treatment options for non - or low -responders are also an issue.  To address these issues, a firs t 
line treatment with more potent IOP reduction than existing PGAs or β -blockers, or an ocular 
hypotensive agent with a novel mechanism of action is still needed.  
To address these needs, Santen is developing an ophthalmic topical formulation of sepetaprost  
(code number: DE -126) for the reduction of elevated IOP in patients with OHT or OAG.  
The ocular hypotensive effects of PGAs have been fully investigated in many animal models.  
Although current PGAs, such as latanoprost, are thought to lower IOP mainly vi a the prostanoid 
FP receptor, a novel mechanism of action via EP3 receptor has been reported recently (Ota et al., 
2006 ).  The prostanoid EP3 and FP receptors have distinct cellular distributions in the tissues 
involved in the uveoscleral and conventional pathways which regulate IOP (Schlotzer -Schrehardt 
et al., 2002 ).  Based on these reports, it was hypothesized that compounds which stimulate b oth 
prostanoid FP and EP3 receptors simultaneously can achieve more profound IOP reduction than 
PGAs  alone , and it was demonstrated compounds targeted both FP/EP3 receptor exhibit more 
potent IOP reduction than latanoprost (Data on file).  Among such dual FP and EP3 receptor 
agonists tested, DE -126 was chosen for its high agonistic activities for both FP and EP3 
receptors.  
DE-126 is unique with a significantly different agonistic profile compared to selective FP 
agonists.  DE -126 is rapidly hydrolyzed by oc ular esterases to the active free acid ONO -AG-367, 
a highly selective and potent agonist for not only the prostanoid FP receptor, but also the 
prostanoid EP3 receptor.  In efficacy studies with monkeys and dogs, DE -126 showed more 
potent and longer -lasting  reduction of IOP than approved PGAs or the fixed combination of PGA 
and β -adrenergic blocker.  In toxicology studies, DE -126 was well tolerated both systemically 
and locally in rodent and non -rodent species for up to 13 weeks.  
Prior to the licensing agree ment with Santen, three clinical studies ( ONO -9054IOU001,  
ONO -9054IOU002, ONO -9054IOU003 ) were conducted by ONO in the U.S. with DE -126 in 
healthy adult subjects, or subjects with POAG or OHT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  
DE-126.  As a result, DE -126 ophthalmic solution in concentrations of up to 0.003% appeared to 
be tolerated and effective.  
After the licensing agreement, a Phase IIb Study 01260 1IN (Refer to 012601IN CSR ), also 
known as a dose -finding study, was conducted in the US and Japan to a ssess the safety and 
efficacy of four concentrations of DE -126 ophthalmic solution (0.0005%, 0.001%, 0.002%, and 
0.003%) when compared to placebo and latanoprost 0.005% in subjects with POAG or OHT.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 20 of 94 Based on the primary and other efficacy endpoints at Mon th 3, DE -126 0.002% was the optimal 
dose from among the four concentrations assessed with respect to IOP lowering, and the 
magnitude of the effect for this concentration was similar to that observed for latanoprost 
0.005%.  All four DE -126 concentrations w ere well -tolerated.  Most AEs were mild in severity.  
The most frequently observed AE was conjunctival hyperemia.  No DE -126 dose -related trend 
was observed with related to conjunctival hyperemia incidence.  AE incidence was lower with 
DE-126 concentration  0.0005%, 0.001% and 0.002% compared with latanoprost 0.005% and 
DE-126 0.003%.  No safety issues were identified by ocular safety assessments.  One serious AE 
(SAE) was reported (left hand weakness ) while the  patient was receiving placebo. Three patients 
experienced AEs that led to discontinuation.  For further information, refer to the current 
investigator’s brochure for DE -126. 
DE-126 with a novel mechanism of action could be a new hypotensive agent for patients with 
OHT or OAG.  
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Topical PGAs, such as latanoprost, are increasingly chosen over topical beta blockers and other 
medications as first -line therapy for patients with POAG or OHT  (AAO -PPP et al., 2015 ).  While 
PGAs typically reduce IOP via the FP receptor, DE -126 (Sepetaprost), a novel prodrug that is 
rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to its active metabolite, targets both the FP and EP3 receptors 
simultaneously; preliminary data suggest that this mech anism can enhance IOP reduction.  In 
Phase I and II studies, DE -126 demonstrated good tolerability and was efficacious in patients 
with POAG and OHT  (Berlin et al., 201 5; Miller Ellis et al., 2017 ; Suto et al., 2015 ).  The effects 
of DE -126 in IOP  lowering appear to persist longer than those of latanoprost (Miller Ellis et al., 
2017 ). 
In 012601IN  study, in both Japan - and US -based patients, DE -126 0.002% was identified as the 
optimal dose among the four concentrations assessed with respect to IOP lowering and safety 
profile.  The magnitude of IOP reduction was similar to that observed for latanoprost 0.005% at 
Month 3 and significantly greater than that of placebo at Week 6. Most AEs were mild in 
severity; AE incidence was lower with DE -126 concentrations 0.0005%, 0.0 01%, and 0.002% 
compared with latanoprost 0.005% or DE -126 0.003%.  
The most common adverse reaction from the previous Phase IIb 012601IN study was 
conjunctival hyperemia.  Since DE -126 is a potent dual agonist for both Prostaglandin F2α 
receptor and EP3 re ceptor, we have observed some similar side effects of Prostaglandin F2α 
analog  (i.e., latanoprost).  It has been reported that latanoprost cause changes to pigmented 
tissues.  The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iri s, 
periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes, and growth of eyelashes.  
DE-126 should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation 
(iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation.  
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with 
latanoprost.  These reports have mainly occurred in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients 
with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with kno wn risk factors for macular edema.  
DE-126 should be used with caution in patients who do not have an intact posterior capsule or 
who have known risk factors for macular edema.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 21 of 94 In summary, DE -126 is anticipated to provide clinically meaningful decrease in I OP in patients 
with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  The adverse reactions observed in patients 
receiving DE -126 were generally well -tolerated.  No serious suspected adverse reaction has been 
reported.  The severity and the frequency of the rep orted ocular AEs were not unexpected for a 
topical ophthalmic medication.  Consequently, benefit -risk balance continued to be favorable 
after taking into consideration the safety data from nonclinical assessment and clinical trials.  
Santen will continue t o actively characterize the benefit: risk profile of DE -126. 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AE of DE -126 may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase II b, randomized, double -masked, active -controlled, parallel -group, and 
multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of DE-126 ophthalmic solution 0.002%  
compared with Timo lol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% in subjects with POAG or OHT.  
Subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT who meet eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will 
washout of their current topical IOP -lowering medication(s) if any.  After completing the 
requi red washout period, subjects will return for Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1).    Subjects who meet 
all eligibility criteria at baseline will be randomized to receive treatment for 3 months.  
Approximately 294 adult subjects with POAG or OHT who meet all eligibility criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either:  
 DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution 0.002%  QD (20:00) and Vehicle QD (08:00), or  
 Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5%  BID (20:00 and 08:00)  
In the Double -Mask ed Treatment Period , Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5%  will be used 
as active control.  
 
Figure  1: Study Design  
   
 
 
See the study design diagram in  Figure  1.  This study will consist of a Screening  Period of up to 
35 days including a washout period of up to 28 days (+ 7 days window)  and a 3-month Double -
Masked Treatment Period . 
At the Screening vi sit (Visit 1), subjects will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  Eligible subjects will be instructed to discontinue use of all IOP -lowering medications , 
if any , during a washout period as follows (up to +7 days as a window is allowed):  

Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 24 of 94  Miotics: 7 days  
 CAIs: 7 days  
 Alpha agonists: 14 days  
 Alpha/beta agonists: 14 days  
 Alpha antagonists ( α1 blocker ): 28 days  
 Beta antagonists (β blocker, including αβ blockers ): 28 da ys 
 PGA: 28 days  
 Rho kinase inhibitor: 28 days  
 Combination drugs: The longest washout period of the individual component will be 
used. 
Please note : Subjects are only allowed to be treated with  a maximum of two active ingredients 
for IOP reduction  prior to s creening . 
During the required washout period, subjects who discontinue their current treatment may, if the 
Investigator deems it necessary, be treated with a short -acting IOP lowering agent, topical CAI, 
e.g., brinzolamide or dorzolamide eye drops, one dro p twice daily.  Topical CAI treatment must 
be stopped 1 week before the randomization at Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1).   An interim safety visit 
during the washout period (mid -washout visit; Optional Visit 1a) may be performed during the 
washout period if, in the Investigator’s opinion, a subject’s IOP may be of concern during the 
washout period.   If subjects are treated with a topical CAI during the washout period, mid -
washout visit ( Optional Visit 1a) is recommended to be performed.  
Final eligibility for rand omization will be determined at Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1) after all 
necessary washout from prior IOP -lowering medications have been completed.   
At Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , baseline IOP will be measured for both eyes at 08:00 (±60 min), 
10:00 (±60 min) , and 16:00 (±60 min).  The study eye will be the eye that qualifies per eligibility 
criteria at Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) .  If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria, the eye with the 
higher mean diurnal IOP at Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1)  will be designated as the study eye.  If both 
eyes meet the eligibility criteria and have the same mean diurnal IOP, the right eye will be 
designated as the study eye.   Both eyes should be treated with the study medication for the 
duration of the study, e ven if only one eye is eligible per IOP inclusion criteria.  
Please note: Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 (Eligibility/Baseline, D ay 1) may be combined into 
one visit for t reatment -naïve subjects  as long as the additional requirements of Visit 2 
(Eligibilit y/Baseline, D ay 1) are fulfilled on the day of this combined visit; in particular, full 
diurnal IOP measurements (at 08:00, 1 0:00, 16:00) must be taken.  
Double -Masked Treatment Period (3 months) : 
Approximately 294 eligible adult subjects will be randomized to receive either DE-126 
ophthalmic solution 0.002%  QD in the evening and vehicle QD in the morning or Timolol 
maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% BID in a 1:1 ratio.   Subjects will be treated for 3  months with 
scheduled visits at Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , 3 (Week 2) , 4 (Week 6), and 5 (Month 3) .  Subjects

In the evening of Visit 2 (Baseline , Day 1 ), subjects will receive their first dose of study 
medication (study eye drops) as per their assigned/randomized study treatment at  
20:00 (±60 min).  The next day, subjects will subsequently dose with their assigned study 
medication at 08:00 (±60 min ), and 20:00 (±60 min).   For the DE -126/Vehicle  arm, the  
08:00  (±60 min)  instillation will be DE -126 vehicle and the 20:00  (±60 min)  instillation will be 
DE-126 ophthalmic solution 0.002% .  At each scheduled follow -up visit, subjects will receive 
their mo rning dose of study medication/eye drops following the 08:00  (±60 min)  IOP 
measurement at the investigative site (the doctor’s office).  
IOP will be measured at 08:00 (±60 min), 10:00 (±60 min) , and 16:00 (±60 min) at Visit 3  
(Week 2) , Visit 4 (Week 6) , and  Visit 5 (Month 3) .  At these scheduled visits, BCVA  and  
slit-lamp biomicroscopy  will be performed  just prior to the  08:00 (±60 min) IOP measurement.  
Vital  signs (resting  blood pressure and  pulse  rate) will  be collected  in sitting position  anytime at  
Visit 1  (Screening) , and approximately  08:00 for Visit  2 (Baseline) , and 5 (Month 3) .  After the 
16:00  (±60 min) IOP measurement  at Visit  5 (Month 3) , ophthalmoscopy  with the pupil dilated  
will be performed.  Subjects will be contacted approximately 2 week s post last study drug 
administration by a phone call to confirm AE.  
Pharmacogenomics/genomics : 
Subjects who consent to the optional PGx laboratory study will provide a blood sample for future 
testing. The earliest this sample is to be collected at Visit 3  (Week 2)  but it may also be collected 
at any later time during the study  after Visit 2 (Eligibility/Baseline) or at a separate post -study

 Subjects will receive verbal and written instructions for proper instillation of the 
study medication, the dosing regimen, and the conditions of the study medication 
storage.  
 Subject will record d aily medication instillation into paper subject diary.  
 Subjects will be reminded at study visits  to consistently dose  at the same time of the 
day 
 Twice daily at 08:00 and 20:00 [±60min]  through Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1) to 
Visit 5 (Month 3).  
 Subjects will be reminded of the evening instillation  of the study drug on the day  
before Visit 3  (Week 2) through Visit 5 (Month 3) /Early Termination  respect ively. 
 Subjects will be reminded that  the morning instillation  of the study drug at each  visit 
through Visit 3  (Week 2)  to 5 (Month 3) will be done at the site. 
 Subjects will be queried regarding compliance with the prot ocol’s dosing regimen at 
Visit 3  (Week 2) through  Visit 5 (Month 3) /Early Termination.  
 Subjects will be counseled on proper dosing procedures and dosing schedule if the 
subject’s compliance is not 100%.  
 A subject’s dosing compliance for a specific period is determined by the total number 
of days that subject followed the proper dosing procedures and dosing schedule.  
Stoppage of study medication use, overdosing of study medication, incorrect time of 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 37 of 94 study  medication administration, will be noted as non -compliance.   The subject’s 
dosing compliance will be recorded in the subject’s source documents at Visit 3  
(Week 2) through Visit 5 (Month 3) /Early Termination.  
 Subjects may be discontinued from the study a t the discretion of the Investigator if 
the subject cannot be brought into compliance.  
6.5. Randomization and Masking  
A stratified permuted -block randomization will be employed to randomize eligible subjects in a 
1:1 ratio to either DE -126/Vehicle arm or Timolo l Maleate arm.  The randomization will be 
stratified by mean diurnal IOP in the study eye at baseline visit (Visit 2 ): <25 mmHg vs.  
≥25 mmHg.  
The randomization schedule will be generated and implemented using  central randomization via 
Interactive Response  Technology (Medidata Rave  RTSM ).  Each randomized subject will 
receive numbered study medication kit s as assigned by Medidata Rave RTSM . 
This is a double -masked study.  The subjects, Investigators, Examiners , and Santen personnel 
involved in the conduct of the study will be masked to the study treatment.  An authorized 
unmasked study staff member at the investigative site who is not the Investigator or Examiner 
will dispense and collect study medication(s)  and will query about dosing compliance.  
Subjects will be instructed not to show the eye drop bottles or discuss the eye drop  to either the 
Investigator or the Examiner or other study subjects.  The active control treatment (Timolol  
Maleate ) containers will be  over-labeled and packaged in the same secondary package  
(e.g., cardboard kit carton) as the investigational  treatment (DE -126).  Subjects on  
DE-126/Vehicle  arm will receive a kit containing  2 bottle s labeled “morning” for the morning 
dose and 2 bottle s labeled “evening” for the evening dose .  Subjects on Timolol arm will receive 
a kit containing 2 bottles labeled m orning/evening for the BID dosing.  
Each eligible subject will receive a numbered study medication kit assigned by Central 
randomization via Interactive Response Technology (Medidata Rave RTSM) at Visit 2  
(Baseline, Day 1)  and at Visit 4 (Week 6).  
In case of a medical emergency, the Principal Investigator  may reveal the treatment information 
by unmasking through Medidata Rave RTSM  to know which  treatment the subject has received.  
The Principal Investigator  (or his/her designee) should contact Santen, or Santen’s designee, 
before taking this measure, if there is sufficient time. Santen, or Santen’s designee, must be 
informed of all instances whe re the code is broken and of the reasons for such instances.  
Additionally, the AE or SAE  for which study treatment was unmasked should be reported to 
Santen Pharmacovigilance.

SUBJECT DISCONTINUAT ION/WITHDRAWA L FROM STUDY  
7.1. Subject Early Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study  
An early termination occurs when a subject who provides written informed consent ceases 
participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the study.  
Subjects may be voluntarily discontinued from study medication or withdrawn from the study at 
any time for any reason.  In addition, the Principal Investigator or Medical Monitor or designee 
may discontinue the study drug administration or terminate a subj ect’s study participation due to 
any of the following reasons:  
 AE (e.g., not compatible with study continuation)  
 Non-compliance with study drug  
 Lack of efficacy (e.g., IOP exceeds 34 mmHg in either eye after randomization)  
 Progressive disease  
 Protocol deviation (e.g., not fulfilling eligibility criteria)  
 Pregnancy  
 Voluntary withdrawal by subject at any time for any reason  
 Lost to follow -up (e.g., no contact is possible)  
 Death  
 Other  
If the study drug administration is discontinued prior to Visit 5 , they should be encouraged to 
still participate  in all follow -up study visits until Visit 5 o n an observational basis.  
If the study drug administration is discontinued  prior to Visit 5, then to the extent possible, all 
procedures for Early Termination  will be pe rformed on the day of early drug discontinuation as 
per Table  3.  Subjects who are discontinued from the study early will not be replaced.  
7.2. Lost to Follow -up 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  The following actions must be taken if a 
subject fails to return to the clinic for a required s tudy visit:  
 The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or shou ld continue in 
the study.  
 Before a subject is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last kn own mailing address or local 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 39 of 94 equivalent methods).  These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s 
medical record.  
 Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of s pecific sites or discontinuation of the study is handled as indicated in  
Section  10.8.

individual informed consent.  Informed consent for the optional PGx consent may 
sign at screening yet laboratory research study must be obtained after subject Visit 2 
(Baseline, Day 1) at any visit.   Ensure the subject understands that if he/she  does not 
wish to provide a blood  sample for the P Gx laboratory research study that their 
decision will have no influence on their participation in the main study.  
 Prepare the list of screening/registration of subjects.  
 Obtain demographics.  
 Obtain medications, procedures/therapies , and medical history inc luding all lifetime 
ocular medical history to the extent possible, non-ocular  medical history within  
5 years, diagnosis, ocular surgical history, current ocular , and systemic conditions.  
 Obtain urine and perform a urine pregnancy test, if the subject is a  female of child -
bearing potential.  
 Query the subject regarding AEs  
 As per Schedule of Events and Procedures  (Table  3), perform the following 
procedures o r assessments (all ophthalmic procedures to be performed in both eyes):  
 Vital signs (blood pressure/pulse rate)  
 Refraction

be used . Please note: Subjects are only allowed to be treated with a maximum of 
two active ingredients for IOP reduction  prior to screening.  
 During the required washout period, subjects who discontinue their current treatment 
may, if the Investigator deems it necessary for safety, be treated with a topical CAI, 
e.g., brinzolamide or dorzolamide eye drops, one drop twice daily. Topical CAI 
treatment must stop 7 days before the ran domization at Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1).  
 An interim safety visit, mid -washout visit (Optional Visit 1a), may be performed 
during the washout period if, in the Investigator’s opinion, a subject’s IOP causes any 
safety concern s during the washout period. If subjects are to be treated with topical 
CAI in the week before Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1), mid washout visit (Optional Visit 
1a) is recommended to be performed.  
 The eligibility visit (Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) ) will be scheduled at the end of the 
washout pe riod for those subjects on prior IOP -lowering medications.  
 Subjects who have not used an IOP -lowering medication for the last 28 days, 
including treatment -naïve  subjects, may be combined Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 
(Eligibility/ Baseline, Day 1)  into on e visit . Subjects must fulfill on the day of this 
combined visit; in particular, full diurnal IOP measurements (at 08:00, 10:00, 16:00) 
must be taken . 
 If a subject does not require washout from an IOP -lowering medication, but they 
use contact lenses in eit her eye, they will need a wait period of ≥ 1-2 weeks   
(1 week for soft contact lens wearers, and 2 weeks for rigid contact lens wearers)  
with no contact use  before their Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1) . 
 Schedule the eligible subject to return for Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1) after the required 
wait/washout period.

8.2. Study Termination  
Santen may stop this study at any time by appropriate  notification.  
8.3. Efficacy Parameter  
The IOP (mmHg) measured in the study eye (identified by the IOP values at  baseline visit) is the 
efficacy measure for this study.  The IOP at each scheduled time point (08:00, 10:00 , and 16:00) 
will be evaluated at each po st-baseline visit.  Besides observed IOP measurements, change and 
percent change from baseline in IOP at each scheduled time point as well as the change  and 
percent change  from baseline in mean diurnal IOP will also be derived  and evaluated.  
8.4. Safety Paramet ers 
In addition to observed values, changes from baseline will be evaluated at relevant post baseline 
visits.   For a safety outcome measure, the baseline value will be the last observation of that 
outcome measure prior to the first dose of study medication . 
8.4.1.  Ocular Assessments

consented to participate in the collection.  
8.5.3.  Glaucoma Quality of Life (GQL -15) Questionnaire  
The GQL -15 (Section  12.6, Appendix F)  is a 15 -item questionnaire assessing the quality of life 
in glaucoma patients by measuring the severity of visual disability.  The GQL -15 will be 
completed by the subject at Baselin e (Visit 2, Day 1) and Month 3 (Visit 5).  The GQL -15 
questionnaire will be used as an exploratory outcome in this study.  
8.6. Assessment of Safety  
8.6.1.  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.6.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence i n a patient or clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study 
intervention .  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication .  
For this study, the investigational products are DE -126, DE-126 vehicle , and Timolol.  
Regardless of relationship to the study medication , an AE can be a clinically relevant unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease.  
Any signif icant change in a subject’s condition from the time that written informed consent  is 
obtained , regardless of causality, is to be considered an AE.  A clinically significant worsening in 
severity, intensity, or frequency of a pre -existing condition may indi cate an AE.  
An elective surgical procedure scheduled or planned prior to study entry that does not require 
overnight hospitalization is not considered an AE, and the underlying diagnosis for the procedure 
should be captured in the medical history as a pre -existing condition.   The surgical procedure 
should also include the term “elective” in all reports.   An elective or planned hospitalization must 
be reported as an SAE.  
The lack of efficacy of the study medication  for the condition being investigated is not  
considered an AE unless a clinically significant change is assessed by the Investigator.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 49 of 94 8.6.1.2.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Investigators will seek information on AEs at each subject contact.   Subjects should be asked 
using a general, non -direct question if the re has been any change in their general health.  Direct 
questioning and examination should then be performed as appropriate.  
Severity of the AE should be assessed according to the following criteria:  
Mild:  No interference with the subject’s daily activitie s; no medical intervention/therapy 
required.  
Moderate:  Possible interference with the subject’s daily activities; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required.  
Severe:  Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; medical 
interventi on/therapy required.  
Regardless of severity, some events may also meet regulatory serious criteria.  Refer to 
definitions and reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) in Section  12.4, Appendix D . 
An Investigator who is medically qualified must make the determination of relationship (related 
or not related) to the investigational product for each AE or SAE.  When determining 
relationship to study medication, the Investigator will consider any investigational products that 
a subject could be exposed to in this clinical trial.  The Investigator should decide whether there 
is a reasonable possibility that the stu dy medication caused the event, taking into account the 
following: a) evidence , b) science -based rationale , c) medical and clinical judgment ,  
d) mechanisms of action , e) biologic plausibility , f) confounding risk factors (i.e., medical 
history, concomitan t medications) , g) temporal relationship , h) dechallenge/rechallenge , and  
i) lack of alternative explanation.  
 The event may be recorded as Related to investigational product or  
 Reporting the event as Not Related to study medication be considered  
8.6.1.3.  Reporting Adverse Events  
AEs, whether spontaneously reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will 
be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF.  Each recorded AE 
will be described by its duration (repre sented in dates), affected eye(s) (if applicable), maximum 
severity of the AE, seriousness criteria, suspected relationship to the study medication, actions 
taken with the study medication , and the study participation, outcome of the AE, and any other 
attributable causes of the AE.  
Regardless of relationship to the clinical study, AEs that occur at any time after the subject has 
provided written informed consent until subject withdrawal or the scheduled exit visit , must be 
recorded.  To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, Investigators should 
observe the following guidelines:  
 Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording.  Do not use 
colloquialisms and/or abbreviations.  
 If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or synd rome) rather than component 
signs and symptoms and /or laboratory or test findings (e.g., record congestive heart 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 50 of 94 failure rather than dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis, and enlarged heart on chest x -ray).  
However, other events that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or 
disease should be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and 
severe headache are observed at the same time and are clinically unrelated, each event 
should be recorded as an individual AE).  
 If the diagnosis is not known, then record the leading component sign, symptom , or 
test finding and describe the other clinically related findings in the narrative 
description of the case.  A suspected diagnosis can be used and described as such 
(e.g., record suspected or probable myocardial infarction); this has to be updated in 
the clinical database once the diagnosis is confirmed.  
AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by the 
primary cause.   A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, ge nerally represents the most 
accurate clinical term.  If a primary AE is recorded, events occurring secondary to the 
primary event should be described in the narrative description of the case.  For 
example:  
The subject developed orthostatic hypotension and subsequently fainted and fell to 
the floor wherein she experienced a head trauma and neck pain.  
The primary AE in this example is orthostatic hypotension.  The fall, head trauma , 
and neck pain should be described in the narrative description of the case.  
 For intermittent events (e.g., intermittent headache), the event onset date should be 
recorded as the date the subject first started to experience the event and resolution 
date should reflect when the last occurrence resolved or stopped.  Separate AEs for 
each event should not be recorded.  For example, if a subject experienced headache 
on 14SEP2015 lasting for three hours, then subsequently experienced intermittent 
episodes of headache every day for approximately 3 hours until 21SEP2015, then the 
AE date o f onset is 14SEP2015 and the resolution date is 21SEP2015.  
 For intermittent events, record the maximum severity of the individual events.  For 
example, if a subject complains of intermittent headaches for one week and the 
severity of each headache ranges f rom mild to moderate, then the severity would be 
moderate.  
 For intermittent hospitalizations occurring for a primary AE (e.g., in a subject with 
multiple sclerosis, commonly known for its relapsing and remitting course, in some 
cases leading to multiple ho spital confinements), the subsequent hospitalizations 
should be described in the narrative description of the case.  
 If treatment was initiated, include the treatment and duration of the medication(s) in 
the eCRF.  
8.6.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
8.6.2.1.  Assessment of Seriou s Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if it fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
 Death (i.e., the AE caused or led to death).  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 51 of 94  It was life threatening (i.e., immediately life -threatening).  
 It required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization . 
 It resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE resulted in a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions).  
 It resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study  subject who 
was exposed to study therapy prior to conception or during pregnancy.  
 It is a medically significant event(s), which may include “sight -threatening events” 
that may not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 Sight threatening event: A sight -threatening event is any event that places the 
subject at immediate risk of permanently losing vision in either eye as a direct 
result of  the event.  
8.6.2.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The SAE eCRF must be completed with as much information as is available within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event . 
To improve the quality and precision of acquired SAE data, Investigators should observe the 
following guidelines:  
 Death: Death is an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in the death should 
be recorded and reported as the SAE.  
 Hospitalizations for Surgical or Diagnostic Procedures: The illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic proced ure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself.   The procedure should be captured in the case narrative as part of the action 
taken in response to the illness.  
Depending on the nature and seriousness of the AE, Santen may request additional 
documentation, for example, copies of the ophthalmic and medical records as well as results of 
laboratory tests.  If the subject was hospitalized, a copy of the discharge summary may be 
requested.  
8.6.2.3.  Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Santen (or desi gnee) will provide the Principal Investigator with a reporting cover letter and a 
masked expedited safety report for expedited reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC.  The 
Principal Investigator is responsible for receiving and reviewing expedited safety repo rts, 
submitting expedited safety reports to the IRB or IEC, and maintaining copies of expedited 
safety reports in the study records.  
8.6.3.  Events of Special Interest  
The following are considered Events of Special Interests ( ESIs ) and should be reported on the 
appropriate eCRF with as much information as available within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event:  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 52 of 94  Pregnancy:  
 There are no controlled data with the investigational product in human pregnancy. 
It is required that females of childbearing potential use effectiv e contraception 
during the study  and recommended for 4 weeks  for female subjects  of 
childbearing potential  and 12 weeks for male subjects  capable of fathering 
children  after the completion of the study .  Any pregnancy occurring during study 
treatment shoul d be reported and the subject will be discontinued  from the study.  
The subject should be followed until the end of pregnancy or until the end of t he 
study, whichever is longer.  
 Medication administration errors  
 Study medication  administration errors determ ined to be  significant  by the 
Investigator will be reported and evaluated as ESIs.   Examples of study 
medication  administration errors may include, but are not limited to: incorrect 
dose of study medication  and administration of study medication  from an 
incorrect kit.  An AE does not necessarily need to have occurred to count as a 
study medication administration error.  A medication administration error is an 
unintended failure in the process of treatment with a medicinal product that leads 
to, or has the potential to lead to harm of the subject.  
8.6.4.  Pregnancy Testing, Monitoring, and Reporting  
8.6.4.1.  Pregnancy Testing  
If the subjec t is a female  of childbearing potential, urine  samples will be collected for pregnancy 
tests as specified in Schedule of Events and Procedures ( Table  3).  Urine samples will be 
analyzed at the site with results available prior to administration of Study Medication . 
8.6.4.2.  Pregnancy Monitoring and Reporting Procedures  
A urine pregnancy test will be conducted using a commercially available test kit at Visit 1 
(Scree ning), Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , Visit 4 (Week 6) and Visit 5 Study Exit/Early 
Termination for all females of childbearing potential.  
Although not considered an AE or SAE, pregnancy is an ESI and requires careful monitoring and 
follow up.   If pregnancy is  reported by a study subject (or in the partner of a study subject), the 
investigator must:  
 Inform Santen within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.  
 If the pregnancy has occurred in a study subject, discontinue further study medication  
administration and/or withdraw the subject from the study.  
 Report pregnancy information on the eCRF following instructions.  
 Follow the pregnancy until outcome is known.  Santen will request specific follow -up 
on a case -by-case basis.  
Additional details regarding collecti on, reporting, and follow -up of pregnancy is provided below:  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 53 of 94 Female subjects who become pregnant : The investigator will collect pregnancy information on 
any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in this study.   Information will be 
recorde d on the appropriate form and submitted to Santen within 24 hours of learning of a 
subject's pregnancy.   The subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the subject and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to Santen.   Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer 
than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date.   Any termination of pregnancy will be 
reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or abs ence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure.  While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an ESI.   Abnormal 
pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, 
ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as such.  Any post -study 
pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study medication  by the investigator 
will be reported t o Santen.  While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study subjects, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting.   Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
disco ntinue study medicaiton  and be withdrawn from the study.  
Male subjects with partners who become pregnant : The investigator will attempt to collect 
pregnancy information on any male subject’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the 
male subject is in this study.  After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to Santen within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pr egnancy. 
The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.   
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to Santen.  Generally, the 
follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimat ed delivery date.  Any 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
8.6.5.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
AEs and SAEs will be monitor ed for and collected at the time points specified in  Schedule of 
Events and Procedures  (Table  3), from the signing of the ICF until the subject withdraw al or the 
scheduled exit visit. (Note: Although AEs will be monitored for and collected prior to study 
medication  administration, the statistical data analysis will determine and summarize treatment -
emergent AEs, i.e., those AEs that began or worsened in s everity after the first study medication  
administration.)  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Santen  or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed  24 hours, as indicated in  Section  12.4, Appendix D .  The 
investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Santen within 24  hours of it being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to monitor for new AEs or SAEs after conclusion  of the study 
participation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the study medication  or study partic ipation, the investigator must promptly notify 
Santen . 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 54 of 94 8.6.6.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in  
Section  12.4, Appendix D .  During the double -masked period, regardless of the source of the 
reported occurrence of an AE in a subject, the masked investigator will assess the causality of the 
AE. 
Care will  be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.   Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.6.7.  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All reported AEs (related and unrelated) shou ld be followed until resolution or until the subject’s 
participation in the study ends.  Subjects with the following types of events should be followed 
by the Investigator until the event is determined to be resolved, irreversible, chronic, stable, the 
subject withdraws consent, or no further information can be reasonably obtained.  
Independent of whether a subject has already had their scheduled study exit visit or not, any 
ongoing following types of event should be followed by the investigator until the ev ent is 
determined to be resolved, irreversible, stable, the subject withdraws consent, or no further 
information is available.  
 On-going SAEs  
 On-going ESIs, including pregnancy  and medication errors resulting in AE’s  
 Early termination and withdrawal from th e study due to study medication  related AEs  
 The other types of related AEs should be also followed by the same manner as SAEs 
in principle, and this follow up should be continued, as needed, up until the time 
database lock.  Generally, the status/resolutio n of the AE should be confirmed via an 
on-site visit, frequency as per investigator's judgement.   However, in cases where the 
investigator considers an on -site visit is not necessary, such as with an AE based on 
subjective symptoms, the Investigator may co nfirm the outcome of the AE by 
telephone, email , etc. 
 The other types of unrelated AE should be followed until resolution or the scheduled 
exit visit  
If the information requested by Santen is not part of the eCRF, or when database lock has already 
been com pleted, the site’s response to follow -up requests should be emailed, faxed , or reported 
in writing to Santen Global Pharmacovigilance of Emergency Contact Information.  
In addition, on a case by case basis, Santen (or designee) may request follow up beyond the 
scheduled exit visit.  
The follow -up information on an individual SAE or AE (or ESI) will be entered into the eCRF 
prior to database lock.  If the information requested by Santen is not part of the eCRF, or when 
database lock has already been completed,  the site’s response to follow -up requests should be 
emailed to globalPVAmericas@santen.com or reported in writing and fax to +1 -415-276-5882 
(in the US).  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 55 of 94 8.6.8.  Manual Back -Up Reporting Procedures  
This study is utilizing an EDC system for data entry.  In the event that the EDC system is 
unavailable for electronic reporting, the manual back -up reporting procedures below should be 
followed.  
 Complete an AE Form, SAE Form, Pregnancy Form, Medication Error Form, or ESI 
Form as appropriate . 
 Attach a cover sheet with  your contact information and address to Santen (or its 
designee)  (Table  1). 
 Email (preferred) or Fax the cover sheet and the completed form(s) to Sante n  
(or its designee)  (Table  1) at ‘globalPVAmericas@santen.com ’ or fax number  
+1-415-276-5882 (in the US).  
When the EDC system becomes available, the EDC system should be updated with all 
previously reported information.  
8.6.9.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by the investigator to Santen of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the sa fety of subjects and the safety of a study intervention 
under clinical investigation are met.  
Santen has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clini cal investigation.   Santen will comply 
with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory 
authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators.  
Santen will prepare investigator safety reports for suspected unexpected serious adve rse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and Santen policy and forward 
them to investigators as necessary.  An investigator who receives an investigator safety report 
describing an SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., sum mary or listing of SAEs) from 
Santen will review and then file it along with the Investigational Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 56 of 94 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section outlines topics related to the statistical methods used in the design and analysis of 
the study. A more detailed description of all the analyses and methods is provided in the SAP.  
9.1. Interim Analysis  
There is no planned  interim an alysis for this study.  
9.2. Final Analysis  
An unmasked final  analysis will be performed after all subjects completed  Month 3  or 
discontinued prematurely .  The analysis will evaluate the  efficacy and safety of DE-126 
Ophthalmic Solution  0.002% once daily compared with Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic  
Solution  0.5%  twice  daily.  
9.3. General Considerations  
Descriptive statistics, unless otherwise noted, will include the number of subjects (N), mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and N and percent for categorical 
variables.  
The study eye will be defin ed as the eye that qualifies per inclusion criteria at Visit 2  (Baseline, 
Day 1) .  For example, IOP must be ≥ 22 mmHg at all IOP measurement time -points (08:00, 
10:00, and 1 6:00).  See Section  5.1  and Section  5.2 for all inclusion/exclusion criteria.   If both 
eyes qualify, the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP at Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1)  will be the 
study eye.   If both eyes have the same mean diurnal IOP at baseline, then the right eye will be 
designated as the study eye.  
Additional considerations  will be described in SAP which will be finaliz ed prior to unmasking 
the data.  
9.3.1.  Sample Size  
The sample size calculation was based on a two -sided Type I error rate of 5% and a  
non-inferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg.   Assuming a between -treatment difference of 0 mmHg,  
SD of 4.0 mmHg and a correlation coeffic ient of 0.6 among repeated measures, approximately 
280 adult subjects in total ( 140 subjects per treatment arm) will provide 70% power to 
demonstrate non -inferiority of DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution 0.002% to Timolol  maleate  
ophthalmic solution 0.5%.   Assuming a drop -out rate of 5%, the final needed sample size will be 
294 in total, i.e. 147 subjects/arm.  
9.3.2.  Statistical Hypotheses and Level of Significance  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the IOP in the study eye measured at the specified time points: 
08:00, 10:00 , and 16:00 at Wee k 2, Week 6 , and Month 3 visits.  
For the primary endpoint, a MMRM  will be used to test the following hypotheses:  
H0: µT – µC > Δ versus  HA: µT – µC ≤ Δ  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 57 of 94 Where  µT and µC denote the mean values of the primary endpoint in DE-126/Vehicle arm  and 
Timolol Maleate arm , respectively , and  Δ denotes the non -inferiority  margin of 1.5  mmHg . 
Treatment difference between the DE-126/Vehicle arm  and Timolol  Maleate arm  at each 
specified time point of each post -baseline visit  up to Month 3  will be reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals.  Non-inferiority is established if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval for the difference in the mean IOP ( DE-126/Vehicle - Timolol Maleate) is  
≤ 1.5 mmHg at all nine time points and ≤ 1.0 mmHg in majority ( 5 or more ) of the time points.  
If the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the difference is < 0 at all nine time points, 
superiority of DE-126 ophthalmic solution 0.002% to Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% 
will be claimed  for the primary endpoint.  
If non -inferiority in the primary endpoint is achieved, then the key secondary endpoint will be 
tested:  Mean diurnal IOP in the study eye at Month 3 . 
The corresponding hypothesis is:  
H0S: µTs – µCs  > Δ versus  HAS: µTs– µCs ≤  Δ 
Where  µTs and µCs denote the mean diurnal IOP at Month 3 in DE-126/Vehicle arm  and Timolol 
Maleate arm , respectively ; and Δ denotes the non -inferiority margin of 1.5  mmHg .   
Non-inferiority is established if the upper limit of the two -sided 95 % confidence interval for the 
difference between DE-126/Vehicle arm  and Timolol  Maleate arm  (DE-126/Vehicle – Timolol  
Maleate ) in the mean diurnal IOP at Month 3 is ≤ 1.5 mmHg.   If the upper limit of the  
95% confidence interval for the difference is < 0 mmHg, superiority of DE-126 ophthalmic 
solution 0.002% to Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% for the key secondary endpoint 
will be claimed.  
9.3.3.  Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
Fixed sequence procedure will be applied t o control the overall Type I error rate across the four 
hypothes es in the primary and key secondary endpoints at the 0.05  level .  Fixed sequence 
procedure tests hierarchically ordered hypotheses  at level 0.05 until the first non -rejection.  
The fixed sequence for the four hypotheses in this study is as follow s: 
1. Hypothesis of n on-inferiority of DE-126 ophthalmic solution 0.002% to Timolol maleate 
ophthalmic solution 0.5% for the primary endpoint, IOP at each scheduled timepoint 
(08:00, 10:00,  and 16:00) at Week 2, Week 6 , and Month 3.  
2. Hypothesis of n on-inferiority of DE-126 ophthalmic solution 0.002% to Timolol maleate 
ophthalmic solution 0.5% for the key secondary endpoint, mean diurnal IOP at Month 3.  
3. Hypothesis of s uperiority of DE-126 opht halmic solution 0.002% to Timolol maleate 
ophthalmic solution 0.5% for the key secondary endpoint, mean diurnal IOP at Month 3.  
4. Hypothesis of s uperiority of DE-126 ophthalmic solution 0.002% to Timolol maleate 
ophthalmic solution 0.5% for the primary endpo int, IOP at each scheduled timepoint 
(08:00, 10:00, and 16:00) at Week 2, Week 6 , and Month 3.

Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 58 of 94 9.4. Study Populations  
9.4.1.  Safety Population  
The Safety Population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the 
study medication.  The safet y analysis will be performed on the Safety Population by actual 
treatment received.  
9.4.2.  Full Analysis Set  
The FAS will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication 
and provided at least one post -baseline IOP measurement.  The efficacy analysis will be 
performed on the FAS or a subset of the FAS by planned treatment.  
9.4.3.  Per-Protocol Set  
The PPS is a subset of the FAS, restricted to the subjects who fulfill the protocol in the terms of 
the eligibility, interventions, and outcome  assessment.  It will be the analysis population for 
some sensitivity analyses.   More details will be provided in SAP.  
9.5. Handling of Missing Values  
The primary analysis of continuous IOP endpoints will be performed using the MMRM analysis 
on observed cases.  As sensitivity analyses, a PMM approach may be applied to evaluate the 
impact of missing data on the primary analysis results.  
For medical events including AEs and medical history, completely or partially missing onset and 
resolution dates will be imputed  in a conservative fashion  to be detailed in the SAP .  Similar 
rules will be followed to impute the completely or partially missing start and end dates of  
non-study medications.  
Unless specified otherwise, descriptive summaries will be based on observed c ases.  
More details on handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP.  
9.6. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized with descriptive statistics 
by treatment.  
Concurrent diseases will be  coded using the latest version of MedDRA .  Subjects with any 
concurrent diseases will be tabulated by primary SOC and PT specified in the MedDRA.  
Subjects using any prior medications that has been used for glaucoma  or OHT within 28 days 
before Screening  (Visit 1) will be tabulated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) levels 
and PT specified in the latest version of  World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced 
(World Health Organization Drug Dictionary, 2011 ). 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 59 of 94 9.7. Efficacy Analyses  
Unless specified otherwise, for subjects who discontinue from the study medication per protocol 
before the Study Exit, the IOP data collected after the study medication discontinuation with any 
use of non -study IOP lowering medication or surgery  will be ce nsored from all efficacy analyses.  
9.7.1.  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the IOP in the study eye measured at the specified time points: 
08:00, 10:00 , and 16:00 at Week 2 (Visit 3) , Week 6 (Visit 4) , and Month 3 ( Visit  5). 
A MMRM will be carried out on observed cases up to Month 3.  At each scheduled time point of 
each visit, least square mean IOP of each treatment arm and 95% confidence interval for the 
difference in least square means between DE-126/Vehicle arm and Timolo l Maleate arm will be 
estimated .  Non-inferiority is established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 
difference is ≤ 1.5  mmHg for all nine time points and ≤ 1.0 mmHg  for at least 5 out of the 9 time 
points.  
The primary analysis will be based on the FAS.  The same analysis will be repeated on the PPS 
population as a sensitivity  analysis.  More details on the model specifications will be provided in 
the SAP.  
9.7.2.  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
9.7.2.1.  Key Secondar y Efficacy Endpoint  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint  is mean diurnal IOP in the study eye at Month 3 (Visit 5) . 
A MMRM will be carried out on observed case s up to Month 3.  The least square mean diurnal 
IOP of each treatment arm and 95% confidence inter val for the difference in least square means 
between DE-126/Vehicle arm and Timolol Maleate arm at Month 3 will be estimated .  If  
non-inferiority in the primary endpoint is achieved, then the key secondary endpoint will be 
tested at the 0.05 significance level (2 -sided) . 
The primary analysis will be based on the FAS.  The same analysis will be repeated on the PPS 
population as a sensitivity  analysis.   More details on the model specifications will be provided in 
the SAP.  
9.7.2.2.  Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s 
Other secondary endpoints to be assessed include:  
 Mean diurnal IOP in the study eye at Week 2 (Visit 3) and Week 6  (Visit 4)  
 Change and percent change from Baseline (Visit 2, Day 1) in IOP in the study eye at 
each timepoint  of each post-baseline  visit 
 Change and percent change from Baseline (Visit 2, Day 1) in mean diurnal IOP in the 
study eye at each post -baseline visit 
 Having a mean diurnal IOP reduction ≥ 20%, ≥ 25%, or ≥ 30% from Baseline   
(Visit 2, Day 1) in the study eye at each post -baseline  visit

Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 60 of 94  Having a mean diurnal IOP ≤ 18mmHg in the study eye at each post -baseline  visit 
The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using MMRM on observed cases. More 
details on the model specifications will be provided in the SAP.  
The binary secondary en dpoint s will be analyzed using the Pearson’s chi -square test for a  
2×2 contingency table.  The Fisher’s Exact test may be conducted as a sensitivity analysis.  
Subgroup analyses by the two randomization strata (baseline IOP in the study eye  
<25 mmHg vs. ≥25 mmHg) be performed for secondary endpoints using descriptive statistics.  
9.8. Safety Analyses  
All safety outcome measures will be summarized descriptively for the Safety Population.   The 
safety outcome measures include AEs, BCVA , slit-lamp biomicroscopy, op hthalmoscopy , and 
vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) . 
AEs will be coded using the latest version of  MedDRA .  Subjects with any AEs will be tabulated 
by primary SOC  and PT specified in the MedDRA.  Similarly, subjects with any ocular and non -
ocular  AEs will be tabulated separately.   AEs, ocular , and non -ocular will also be summarized by 
relationship to treatment and maximum severity.   In addition, SAEs and discontinuations due to 
AEs will be summarized.  
Safety parameters listed in  Section  8.4.1  and Section  8.4.2  will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics by actual treatment received.  Changes from baseline in these safety parameters will also 
be summarized by treatment.  
9.9. Exploratory Analyses  
The G QL-15 total score and each domain score will be summarized descriptively by actual 
treatment received .  The 4 domains are central and near vision, outdoor mobility, peripheral 
vision, and dark adaption and glare.

Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 64 of 94 10.7.3.  Source Documents  
The Principal Investigator must maintain de tailed source documents on all study subjects who 
provide informed consent.   Source documents include subject medical records, hospital charts, 
clinic charts, medication dosing diaries, study files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests  
(e.g., visual  field test printouts).  
The following minimum information should be entered into the subject’s medical record:  
 The date the subject entered the study and the subject number  
 The study protocol number and the name of Santen  
 The date that informed consent was  obtained  
 Evidence that the subject meets study eligibility requirements (e.g., medical history, 
study procedures , and/or evaluations)  
 The dates of all study -related subject visits (scheduled and unscheduled)  
 Evidence that required procedures and/or evalua tions were completed  
 Use of any concomitant medications  
 Documentation of study medication accountability  
 Occurrence and status of any AEs  
 The date the subject exited the study and a notation as to whether the subject 
completed or terminated early from the study, including the reason for early 
termination  
 If unmasking at the site occurred, proper documentation and notifications were made  
10.7.4.  Source Data  
Source data is defined as all information in original records and certified copies of original 
records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.   Source data should be accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, attributable, complete and consistent.  Source data is documented in 
source documents which may be both electronic and on paper.  
The Investigator (s) should be aware about the location of the source data and consistent in 
recording them.  The intended location should be clearly defined prior to subject enrol lment.  
One way of achieving this is to generate a source data location list.  The source data location list 
will be prepared by the site and will be signed and dated by the Principal Investigator.  The list 
will be filed in the Investigator ’s trial master  file. 
10.7.5.  Data Collection  
The Principal Investigator  must maintain detailed records on all subjects who provide informed 
consent.  Data for screened and randomized subjects will be entered into eCRFs. eCRFs should 
be completed within 3 business days of each s ubject visit as much as possible.  A review of the 
eCRFs will be completed remotely by Santen (or designee).  At designated intervals, a study 
monitor will perform Source Data Verification on site.  During those visits, Santen (or designee) 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 65 of 94 will monitor th e subject data recorded in the eCRF against source documents at the study site. 
Santen (or designee) will review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard system edits, and may 
use centralized monitoring evaluations, to detect errors in data collection.  At the end of the 
study, a copy of the completed eCRFs will be sent to the site to be maintained as study records.  
10.8. Study and Site Closure  
Santen’s designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for 
any reason at the sol e discretion of Santen. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A 
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by Santen or investigator may include but are not 
limited to:  
 Failure of  the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, Santen's procedures, or GCP guidelines  
 Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator  
 Discontinuation of further development  of the investig ational product

(Screening), Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , Visit 4 (Week 6) and Visit 5 (Month 3) Exit/Early 
Termination for all females of childbearing potential. A female is considered  of childbearing 
potential unless she is post -menopausal (at least 12 months since last menses occurred), is 
without a uterus or without both ovaries, or has had a bilateral tubal ligation.  To perform the 
pregnancy test, follow instructions provided by th e manufacturer of the urine pregnancy test kit.

medication . 
12.3.4.  Vital signs (Blood pressure/ Pulse rate)  
Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and p ulse rate will be measured at Visit 1 
(Screening), Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , and Visit 5 (Month 3) Exit/Early Termination .  Vital signs 
(resting blood pressure and pulse rate) will be collected anytime at Visit 1 (Screening), and 
approximately 08:00 for Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , and Visit 5 (Month 3) Exit/Early Termination  
before the morning dose.  
Vital signs will be collected in a sitting position after keeping quiet for more than 5 minutes.  
12.3.5.  Best-Corrected Visual Acuity  
BCVA will be measured for each eye  prior to the 08:00 IOP measurement at all visits except 
Visit 1  (Screening) /1a (Optional visit ) under normal room illumination using visual acuity chart 
(Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ ETDRS ] chart) and the logMAR scoring and will 
be recorded  in the subject’s source document.   For Visit 1  (Screening) /1a (Optional visit) , the 
corrected visual acuity should be performed prior to IOP measurement. If ETDRS chart is used, 
the following procedure should be followed.  
12.3.5.1.  ETDRS Visual Acuity Scoring  
The E xaminer records each letter identified correctly by circling the corresponding letter on an 
appropriate visual acuity worksheet.  The Examiner records a letter read incorrectly, or a letter 
for which the subject made no guess, by crossing the letter out wi th an “x” or a line.  Each letter 
read incorrectly is scored as one point.  The last line in which a letter is read correctly will be 
taken as the Base logMAR line.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 74 of 94 The total number of letters that have an “x” or a line through them (letters read incorrect ly or not 
at all) down to and including the Base logMAR line and  multiply the total number by 0.02.   Add 
this value to the Base logMAR value to obtain the logMAR score.  
Example:  
Subject correctly reads 4 of 5 letters on the +0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on  the +0.1 line,  
and zero letters on the 0.0 line  
Base logMAR value = +0.1 (last line in which a letter was read correctly)  
Total number of letters missed = 4 (number of letters missed on the +0.2 line plus the number 
missed on the +0.1 line)  
LogMAR score = +0.1 + (4 x 0.02) = 0.18

12.3.7.  Intraocular Pressure  
IOP will be performed at each visit. At visit 1  (Screening) /1a (Optional visit) , IOP can be 
measured at any time.  For Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1)  to Visit 5  (Month 3) Exit/Early Termination, 
IOP measurements will be scheduled for 0 8:00 (±60min ), 10:00 (±60min ), and 1 6:00 (±60min ). 
IOP will be measured using calibrated manual Goldmann applanation contact tonometer with the 
subject in a sitting position.  The same Goldmann contact tonometer employing the investigator’s 
standard technique will be used throughout the study.   Measurement  will be performed 
preferably by the same authorized study staff throughout the study.   Study staff who perform s the 
IOP measurement  must have  at least 2 years of experience in IOP measurement.  
The right eye is always tested first.  At least two, and somet imes three, consecutive 
measurements are made to obtain a determination of IOP.  Each IOP measurement and the clock 
time of IOP measurement will be recorded in the subject’s source document.  
A single measurement is made as follows:  
 The study staff adjusts the force on the tonometer dial to an initial setting 
corresponding to 10 mmHg.  The slit -lamp magnification is set at 10X.  The light 
source is positioned at an angle of approximately 45°, and the aperture is maximally 
opened.  A cobalt blue filter is emp loyed.  
 After instillation of a topical anesthetic, a fluorescein paper strip is placed near the 
lateral canthus in the lower conjunctival sac.  Once the lacrimal fluid is sufficiently 
colored, the paper strip is removed.  Alternatively, one drop of premixe d fluorescein 
and anesthetic (Fluress, Barnes Hind) may be instilled.  The study staff should use the 
same technique each time, be it a paper strip or a pre -mixed eye drop.  
 The subject and slit -lamp are adjusted so that the subject’s head is firmly positio ned 
on the chin rest and against the forehead rest without leaning forward or straining.  
Tight -fitting neckwear is loosened.  The subject is asked to look straight ahead at a 
distant object or fixation target.  If it is necessary to hold the eyelids open,  the study 
staff holds the eyelids against the orbit rim, taking care not to apply any pressure to 
the globe.  The subject is cautioned not to hold his breath.  
 The study staff looks through the slit -lamp and gently brings the tip of the prism into 
contact with the center of the cornea.  The mires are well -focused, centered 
horizontally, and positioned vertically so that they are of equal circumference above 
and below the horizontal dividing line.  If the mires are narrower than approximately 
1/10 their diam eter, additional fluorescein is instilled.  
 The study staff adjusts the measuring drum until the inner borders of the two mires 
just touch each other or, if pulsation is present, until the mires separate a given 
distance during systole and overlap the same distance during diastole.  
 The study staff removes the tip from the cornea, and records the reading on the dial, 
rounded to the next highest integer.  For example, if the measurement indicated is 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 79 of 94 between 16 and 17, then 17 is recorded as the measurement in the subject’s source 
document.  
 If corneal astigmatism is greater than 3.0 D, the prism is rotated so that the red line 
corresponds to the orientation of the longer axis of the elliptical applanated area.  
The above procedure is then repeated for the same ey e, and that second measurement is also 
recorded in the subject’s source document.  
 If the two measurements differ by less than 3 mmHg, then the average of the two 
measurements becomes the recorded IOP. For example, if the two measurements are 
22 and 23, the n 22.5 is the final recorded IOP.  
 However, if the two measurements differ by 3 mmHg or more, then a third 
measurement is made, and the median of the three measurements becomes the 
recorded IOP (the median is the middle measurement after ordering the 
measur ements from low to high).  For example, if the three measurements are  
15, 19, and 16, then 16 is the final recorded IOP.  
The IOP in the left eye is then measured using the same technique.  
12.3.7.1.  Goldmann Applanation Tonometer Calibration  
Every tonometer  being us ed in the study  must be calibrated for accuracy before the first subject 
undergoes screening (mandatory), and then check calibration monthly  until the last subject has 
exited the study.   For checking calibration, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.  If the 
variation is within ±2 mmHg, the tonometer is considered adequately calibrated.  However, if the 
variation exceeds this amount, the tonometer should be sent for repair and a different, adequately 
calibrated instrument should be used for IOP measuremen t.  The date of each calibration, along 
with the name and signature (or initials) of the person who performed the calibration, will be 
documented.  The tonometer calibration record will be retained as a part of the study record.  
12.3.8.  Gonioscopy  
Gonioscopy will be performed to examine the angle of the anterior chamber after IOP 
measurement at Visit 1 (Screening) if it has not been performed within 3 months  (90 days) .   
The Shaffer scale will be used to rate the degree of angle closure.  
(0) = approximately 5 degrees or less, complete or partial closure  
(1) = approximately 10 degrees  
(2) = approximately 20 degrees  
(3) = approximately 30 degrees  
(4) = approximately 40 degrees or more  
12.3.9.  Pachymetry (C entral Corneal Thickness ) 
The central corneal thickness (µm) of ea ch eye using any pachymeter  including optical 
pachymeter, ultrasound pachymeter, OCT  (optical coherence tomography ), etc. will be measured  
and record ed after IOP measurement at Visit 1 (Screening).   Pachymetry will be performed after 
IOP measurement . 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 80 of 94 12.3.10.  Visual Field  
Visual field examinations will be performed using a static or dynamic perimeter (Humphrey or 
Octopus) without pupil dilation  at Visit 1 (Screening), if it has not been performed within  
3 months  (90 days)  or the previous visual field test(s) i ndicates low subject reliability (e.g., due 
to fixation losses, false positive errors, or false negative errors).  Glaucomatous visual field loss 
will be evaluated by the Investigator as presence or absence (mean deviation, pattern SD, 
glaucoma hemifield t est, and type of glaucomatous visual field loss).  
Visual field tests that, in the Investigator's opinion, indicate low subject reliability (e.g., due to 
fixation losses, false positive errors, or false negative errors) can be repeated once more; if still 
low reliability then the subject should be excluded.  A copy of the computer printout from the 
visual field test(s) will be attached to the subject’s source documents.  
12.3.11.  Ophthalmoscopy (Fundus) Examination  
The ophthalmoscopy (fundus) examination with pupil di lation will be performed for each eye at 
Visit 1  (Screening) , Visit 2  (Baseline, Day 1) , and Visit 5 (Month 3) Exit/Early Termination, and 
graded as described below.  The examination will be performed with pupil dilated at Visit 1 
(Screening) and Visit 5  (Month 3)  Exit.  Dilate pupil and ophthalmoscopy examination will be 
performed after all other ocular procedures have been completed.   Cup to disc ratio and 
abnormality in retina, macula, choroid, and vitreous will also be evaluated.  
Glaucomatous Optic Nerv e Findings  
The optic nerve will be evaluated using a 4 -point scale (0 -3 scale).  
None  (0) =  No damage  
Mild  (1) =  Optic nerve damage, secondary to glaucoma including any rim loss 
(sloping or thinning)  
Moderate  (2) =  Optic nerve damage, including cupping to d isc margin at one or more 
points  
Severe  (3) =  Optic nerve damage, nearly total cupping, only nasal rim or less present  
12.3.12.  Blood  Sample for Pharmacogen omics/genomics  Study  
All subjects participating in the study will have the option to participate in blood sampling for 
PGx and this will be consented to collect this optional test.   Subjects who do not wish to 
participate in the PGx sampling may still participate in the study.  For PGx, one whole blood 
sample (approximately 10  mL) will be collected on Visit 3 (Week 2) but may be collected at any 
time during the study, as shown in Schedule of Events and Procedures  (Table  3).  The blood 
samples will be coded to protect the subject’s private information. DNA will be extracted from 
the blood sample and stored in the DNA repository for potential future PGx research.  The 
samples will be coded to protect the participant’s private information.  Sample handling, storag e, 
and shipment will be defined in a separate procedure manual.  
If conducted, PGx research will be performed by appropriate assay platforms such as Polymerase 
Chain Reaction ( PCR ), hybridization, and sequencing.   Individual subjects’ results from the 
resea rch testing of their sample will not be communicated to investigator and participants.

Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
1. Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
 An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related 
to the study intervention.  
 NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis)  
or other  safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator (and not related to progression of underl ying 
disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject's 
condition).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical se quelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.   Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent.  Such overdoses should be rep orted regardless of sequelae.  
 “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE.   Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequel ae resulting from lack of efficacy will 
be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied,  unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 82 of 94 2. Definition of SAE  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurr ence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at 
risk of death at the time of the event.   It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detaine d (usually involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.   Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are A Es.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatm ent of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is 
not considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
 This definiti on is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functio ns but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Other situations:  
 Sight threatening event: A sight -threatening event is any event that places the subject at 
immediate risk of permanently losing vision in either eye  as a direct result of the event.  
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize t he 
participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition.  These events should usually be considered serious.  
 Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive  treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
 
 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 83 of 94 3. Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
 When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
 The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
 It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to Santen in lieu of completion of the Santen/AE/SAE CRF page.  
 There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain case s are requested by 
Santen.  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Santen.  
 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis o f the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Severity  
Severity of the AE should be assessed according to the  following criteria:  
Mild: No interference with the subject’s daily activities; no medical intervention/therapy required.  
Moderate:  Possible interference with the subject’s daily activities; no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe: Cons iderable interference with the subject’s daily activities; medical intervention/therapy 
required.  
 An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Assessment of Causality  Note: During the double -masked period, regardless of the source of the 
reported occurrence of an AE in a subject, the masked investigator will assess the causality of the AE.  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
 A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled o ut. 
 The following criterial can be used to make a causality judgment:  
 Related (possibly or probably)  
 There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and 
investigational product administration/protocol procedure; and/or  
 There is a bio logically plausible mechanism for investigational product causing or 
contributing to the AE; and  
 The AE may or may not be attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
protocol procedures.  
 Not Related  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 84 of 94  A clinically plausible temporal sequence  is inconsistent with the onset of the AE and 
Investigational product administration/protocol procedure; and/or  
 A causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. The investigator will use 
clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alterna tive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
 The investigator will also consult the Inve stigational Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical records that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 Ther e may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Santen.  However, it is very important that 
the investigator always assess causality for every event before the initial trans mission 
of the SAE data to Santen.  
 The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
 The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
Procedures for Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
 The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Santen to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible.  This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
 If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the investigator wi ll provide Santen with a copy of any post --mortem findings 
including histopathology.  
 New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
 The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Santen within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 85 of 94 4. Reporting of SAEs  
SAE Reporting to Santen via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Santen will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
 If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection 
tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.  
 The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
 After the study is completed at a given site, the elec tronic data collection tool will be taken 
off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
 If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the electronic da ta collection tool has been taken  
off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form to Santen Global 
Pharmacovigilance ( Table  1). 
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  Table  1. 
 For SAE supporting information (i.e. X -ray reports, hospital summaries, etc.) that are not 
included in the EDC format, follow a procedure analogous to the manual SAE reporting 
process.  
SAE Reporting to Santen via Paper CRF (If Electronic Data Collection Tool is Unavailable)  
 Complete both the paper AE and SAE Forms (located in your site regulatory binder) . 
 Attach a Fax Cover Sheet with your contact information and fax to Santen Global 
Pharmacovigilance ( Table  1). 
 In the rare circumstance of the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is 
acceptable with a copy of the paper AE and SAE forms sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.  
 Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.  
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  Table  1.

Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 86 of 94 12.5. Appendix E- Adverse Event Case Report Form Items and Terms  
Concise Description of Event:  A concise description of the signs, symptoms, complaints, or 
diagnosis of the subject’s problem (e.g., nasal congestion).  
Complete one AE form for related symptoms that can be grouped as 
one condition (e.g., If a subject complains of sneezing, nasal 
conge stion, watery eyes, the AE is described as cold symptoms).   If 
two independent events occur at the same time, separate AE forms 
must be completed for each event.  
Affected Eye(s):  Indicate if ocular event is OD, OS, or OU. Non -ocular events should 
be recor ded as N/A.  
Adverse Event Serious /Event 
of Special Interest : If AE is serious or an Event of Special Interest, Santen must be 
notified immediately (within 24 hours).   Complete both the AE and 
the SAE eCRFs in the EDC system. In the event the EDC system is  
unavailable, and your site needs to report an SAE, please follow the 
manual process described in the body of the protocol under 
“Reporting of SAEs.”  
Date of Event Onset:  The date the event started.  
Maximum Severity of Event:  Record the severity of the AE according to the following definitions:  
Mild:  Aware or unaware of event, but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual 
activity  
Severe:  Incapacitating; unable to work or perform usual activity  
For intermittent events , record the maximum severity of the 
individual events.  For example, if a subject complains of 
intermittent headaches for one week and the severity of each 
headache ranges from mild to moderate, then the severity would be 
moderate.  Record that the severit y of the headaches ranged from 
mild to moderate in the comment section of the form.  
If an event occurs with each administration  (e.g., eyes burn mild to 
moderate for 5 minutes after every administration ), record the 
maximum severity of the individual incid ent. In the example above, 
the severity is moderate.   Record that the severity of the event 
ranged from mild to moderate in the comment section of the form.   
Action Taken as Related to 
this AE:   Indicate the action taken as a result of the AE.   If the frequency of 
Investigational product administration was changed or discontinued 
temporarily or if surgery was required, provide more detailed 
explanation in the comment section of the form.  If “Other” is 
indicated, specify the action taken.  
Protocol 012604IN  DE-126 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 2.0 18FEB2021  Confidential  Page 87 of 94 Outco me of Event:  Indicate the outcome of the AE and provide resolution date or date 
of death.  
For intermittent events  (e.g., intermittent headache) and events that 
occur with each administration  (e.g., eyes burn for 5 minutes after 
every administration ), the d ate should reflect when the last 
occurrence resolved or stopped.  For example, if a subject has an 
intermittent headache from 12/14/2010 until 12/21/2010 and each 
individual headache lasts 3 hours a day, then the date of resolution is 
12/21/2010 (NOT 12/14 /2010).  
If treatment was initiated, then include the treatment and duration in 
the comments section (e.g., subject took acetaminophen for 
headache on 12/14/2010, 12/17/2010 , and 12/20/2010).  
Relationship to Study 
Drug/Investigational 
Product:  Indicate if there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have 
been caused by the study drug/investigational product with a Yes or 
No response.  A “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/investigatio nal 
product and the AE.  
If response is No, select the possible alternative explanation of the 
event from the list provided.  
For SAE supporting information (i.e., X -ray reports, hospital summaries, etc.) that are not 
included in the EDC format, follow the same reporting process as for manual SAE reporting.

2.0 PROTOCOL 
2.1 Protocol Methodology and Analysis  
Methodology: 
Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are a healthy male or female 18 – 65 years 
of age. Up to 10  subjects will be enrolled at 1 study center. Subjects will attend a 
screening/pretreatment visit which may be performed on the same day as the treatment visit. 
Subjects may receive up to 4 treatments. All subjects will receive a phone call 1 week after each 
treatment. Subjects will return for follow up visits at 30 and 90 days post last treatment for side 
effect and efficacy assessments. An unscheduled visit or phone call may be performed at any time 
during the study at the request of the subject or as deemed necessary by the site Investigator.

Analysis: 
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in non-ablative aesthetic treatments and will 
drive demand for innovated products, procedures, and practice design.1 Due to this shift in patient 
base, practices need to evolve to adapt to the newer generational ideologies. This device will be 
using the PicoSure device with the focus lens array to collect additional data and imaging. 
Although this laser technology is one of the most used, there is a need to expand claims and study 
its current use in the field. 
 
Relevance: 
According to the 2018 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report, the amount of laser treatments for 
minimally invasive aesthetic treatments have drastically increased over the past 8 years.2 There is 
an increasing demand for new methods and novel laser technology for improved treatment 
outcomes. Other devices currently on the market cleared for use include, but are not limited to, the 
Excel, Candela and Elite devices. 
 
Testability: 
The PicoSure device, had been previously cleared for use for wrinkles, acne scars, and benign 
epidermal and dermal pigmented lesions (FDA 510(k) K140719). This study will utilize the 
collection of data and imaging to support additional marketing claims. 
 
Compatibility: 
Although laser technology is a well-known and widely use technique for non-ablative aesthetic 
treatments, there is still a need to expand marketing claims, device use, and imaging techniques.  
 
Predictive power: 
Assuming there is an acceptable side effect profile, it would be appropriate to expect results for 
other products and devices to have similar outcomes. 
 
2.2 Protocol Study Design 
This is a prospective, open label, single-center clinical study to collect additional data and imaging 
for the PicoSure device with the focus lens array. 
 
2.3 Subject Selection Criteria 
 Subjects will meet the criteria described below: 
 
Inclusion Criteria: 
 A healthy male or female 18 – 65 years of age.

o If you are prone to break outs or have sebaceous skin, consider waiting 24 hours before 
applying any topical products. 
 
2.6 Pre-Treatment Procedures 
If the subject is of childbearing potential (i.e. females not post-menopausal or not surgically 
sterile), they will be asked if they are pregnant, the date of their last menstrual cycle, and perform a 
urine pregnancy test. At each subsequent treatment, subjects will be asked the date of their last 
menstrual cycle for pregnancy verification purposes. A urine pregnancy test may also be 
conducted at the Investigator’s discretion at any time during the study. If a urine pregnancy test is 
conducted, then a negative result must be obtained within 24 hours prior to the treatment. 
 
Urine Pregnancy Test Procedure: 
1. A urine sample is tested mid-stream or by cup sample with an indicator stick.  
2. Negative results are indicated on the indicator stick.  
 
 Photographs will be taken prior to the first treatment and may be taken prior to each 
subsequent treatment.  
 
2.7 Treatment Procedures 
 The defined study area will be identified  and will be cleansed thoroughly using a facial 
cleanser or mild soap and water. Then the area will be wiped with 70% isopropyl alcohol and 
may be marked with a white or yellow, washable marker. 
 To avoid eye injury, appropriate eye protection for the wavelength being used must be worn by 
all individuals in the room during treatment. 
 Test spots may be performed prior to each treatment in an area in or close to the treatment area. 
Parameters will be collected of these test spots. 
 Procedures for the PicoSure treatment: 
o The device may be used in accordance with the Operator’s Manual and Clinical 
Reference Guide. 
o The entire defined treatment area will then be treated by delivering adjacent pulses with 
minimal overlap of 10% or less.  
o An air-cooling system may be used during treatment. The air-cooling system allows for 
the continuous flow of cold air on the treatment area to ease the sensation from the laser 
pulse. 
o Parameters may be adjusted throughout the treatment in order to increase subject 
comfort. 
o Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort/pain on a 
scale of 0 (none) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain). 
o Parameters and skin reaction will be continuously monitored and recorded during 
treatment.  
 The additional treatments will follow the same procedure. 
 Subjects may receive up to 4 treatments on the face. Treatments will be performed every 4 
weeks (+/- 2 weeks).  
 
2.8 Post Treatment Procedures 
 Adverse events will be documented after treatment.

 Following treatment, an aloe-based gel, chiller, and/or cold pack may be applied to soothe the 
skin. 
 Photographs may be taken post treatment. 
 Post treatment instructions will be reviewed with the subject.  
 
2.9 Follow Up 
 All subjects will receive a phone call 1 week (1 - 10 days) after each treatment.  
 Subjects will return for follow up visits at 30 and 90 days post last treatment. 
 Photographs will be taken, adverse events will be documented, and subject questionnaires will 
be performed at all follow up visits.  
 Any subject affected by COVID-19 that is not able to attend their follow up visits to complete 
the study will be asked to return to the site for a final follow up visit within 1 year of last 
treatment.  
 Some subjects may have an incomplete response or no response by the end of the study. At the 
end of the study, treatments using an FDA approved/cleared treatment method may be 
discussed with the subject and obtained at the cost of the subject.  
 
2.10 Unscheduled Visits 
An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the subject’s request or as 
deemed necessary by the site Investigator. The date and reason for the unscheduled visit will be 
recorded in the source documentation. 
 
2.11 Replacement of Subjects 
Replacement of subjects who have withdrawn or been withdrawn from the study will be allowed to 
be replaced with prior approval from the sponsor and/or IRB .

2.13 Evaluation Methods 
Blinded Evaluation: 
Three blinded independent reviewers will perform a photographic evaluation in which they will be 
asked to identify pre-treatment images when compared to post treatment images. The reviewers 
will be Board Certified Dermatologist and/or Surgeon and will be chosen based on availability and 
have relevant clinical experience. They will attend a training session prior to grading.   
 
Photographs: 
Photographs may be taken at all visits and will be used to assess efficacy and safety of treatment. 
 
Treatment Discomfort/Pain Evaluation: 
Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort on a scale of 0 (none) to 
10 (maximum intolerable pain) using the universal pain assessment tool (Appendix B) 
 
Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire:  
The subject will be asked their level of satisfaction using a 6-point Likert scale that ranges from 
“extremely satisfied” to “extremely unsatisfied.” 
 
Subject Satisfaction 
Rating Description 
6 Extremely Satisfied  
5 Satisfied 
4 Slightly Satisfied 
3 Slightly Unsatisfied 
2 Dissatisfied 
1 Extremely Unsatisfied 
 
Clinician Questionnaire:  
The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) ranging from “worse” to “very much improved” 
will be used to judge the improvement as seen by the subject and Investigator. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.14 Adverse Event Recording 
All data captured must be supported by the Investigator’s timely assessment and documentation of 
the adverse event in the case report forms or source documents.  All documented adverse events 
will be reviewed by the Sponsor or designee to determine whether the adverse event meets Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale Assessment 
Rating Description  
1 Very Much Improved- Optimal cosmetic result in this subject  
2 Much Improved- Marked improvement in appearance form the initial 
condition, but not completely optimal for this subject.   
3 Improved- Obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition, but a 
re-treatment is indicated.  
4 No Change- The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition.  
5 Worse- The appearance is worse than the original condition.

regulatory reporting requirements and to ensure timely adverse event reporting to meet local and 
global regulatory requirements. All adverse events must be followed until their resolution. 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the PicoSure Device: 
Adverse effects can include discomfort, redness, swelling, pinpoint bleeding, blistering, 
scabbing, crusting and bruising, which are usually transient and resolve without intervention. 
Possible adverse effects include pustules, skin burns, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, 
scarring, infection and allergic reaction. Most of these are transient and resolve over time. 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the Marker: 
Using a marker has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as redness or a rash. 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Cooling: 
Anticipated transient side effects associated with forced air/contact cooling may include tingling, 
itching, decreased sensation, numbness, redness and pain. 
 
Other Cautions: 
Incomplete response or no response may occur since some subjects may not respond to treatment. 
 
2.15 Statistical Analysis  
 
2.15.1 Hypothesis 
 For this study to be considered a success, correct identification of pre-treatment images when 
compared to post treatment (3 month) images will be ≥80%.  
 In cases where the subject’s improvement is being graded on a scale, such as the GAIS scale, 
we will test the statistical significance of our results against a hypothetical population that 
would have no change (average score of 4). 
 The side effect profile (adverse events) and the average pain score is acceptable to the 
Physician as it relates to the type of treatment. 
 
2.15.2 Sample Size Rationale 
Based on the need for data collected from this study, it was determined that a total of 10 subjects 
will be required, including departures. 
  
2.15.3 Patient Populations 
Interim results may be collected and reported.  All data will be analyzed at the end of the study.  
The primary analysis will be performed by the intention-to-treat approach.  Everyone who begins 
the treatment is part of the study whether he or she completes the study or not.  Additional per-
protocol analysis may also be performed on subjects who complete the entire clinical trial 
according to the protocol.  The most appropriate method of handling missing values will be chosen 
based on the individual trial goals, endpoints and context. 
 
The analysis of demographic, medical history, and efficacy variables will be based on all patients 
who are randomized and receive at least one treatment. The analysis of safety data will be based on 
all patients who are randomized, receive at least one treatment, and have at least some safety data.

2.15.4 Analysis of Demographic and Medical History Variables 
Summaries will be prepared for all important demographic and medical history variables. For 
quantitative variables summaries will include the sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum.  For these variables the treatment groups will be compared using either a 
t-test or a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, as appropriate.  For categorical variables the summaries will 
include the sample size and the number and percent of patients for each outcome.  For these 
variables the treatment groups will be compared using Fisher’s Exact test.  Statistical significance 
will be declared if the two-sided p-value is < 0.05.  
  
2.15.6 Analysis of Safety Variables 
Safety will be assessed through the degree of pain/discomfort related to the procedure (universal 
pain scale) and the collection of Adverse Events throughout the course of the study.  For each 
treatment group these variables will be summarized.  The summaries will include the number and 
percent of patients for each outcome.  No statistical comparisons will be performed for any of 
these variables. 
 
3.0  RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT  
3.1 Risk Determination 
This device study used in this study does not meet the FDA definition for a Significant Risk 
Device study per 21 CFR 812.3(m).  Therefore, the sponsor determines that this is a non-
significant risk device study. 
 
Significant risk device means an investigational device that: 
(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject; 
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; 
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or 
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 
 
3.2 Risk Management  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experience with the use of the system and/or similar systems and industry experience.  Experience 
with treatments is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial. 
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods may be used in 
conjunction with subjective evaluation methods when feasible.  The value of the compensation to 
the clinical investigator for conducting the study is not influenced by the study outcome.  If 
photographic results are listed as the primary objective, they are to be evaluated by blinded 
evaluators who did not partake in the study.  If information concerning investigator assessment of 
improvement or investigator satisfaction is collected, then it is not listed as an objective for the study.

Version 2.0: April 20, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 29 
 
All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this 
is an elective procedure and the subjects are volunteers, it can be assumed that their signature on 
the informed consent is indicative of their agreement to accept the risks involved. 
 
The risks to the subjects who participate in this study are the same as those for the subject 
undergoing similar non-ablative radiofrequency treatment. It is possible to have an adverse 
reaction to the PicoSure device. There may be some side effects that we don’t know about yet. 
 
3.3 Risk Analysis 
 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
Over time, skin structure degrades due to a variety of internal and external conditions.  As 
enzymes break down collagen and elastin, skin loses its suppleness and becomes loose.  UV 
exposure, diet, and smoking among other behaviors all contribute to skin degradation.  In certain 
areas, this issue can be concealed, but in areas that are in view (face, neck, décolleté) have all been 
attempted to be treated for this condition.  
 
The picosecond alexandrite laser, with its very short pulse duration, causes both photomechanical 
and photo thermal effects on tissue (as seen with its use in tattoo removal) and produces greater 
tensile strength than when using nanosecond lasers.iii,iv This device, specifically the Focus Lens 
Array, allows for an added degree of safety while still delivering high energy to affect the targeted 
tissue. The Focus Lens Array is a specialized optical hand piece that distributes low energy density 
to the entire spot size, with increased density to approximately 5-10% of surface area in each spot. 
 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
The risk identified with the overall clinical investigation is the integrity of the data collected. There 
are multiple clinical mitigation strategies for the risk identified. Proper training on the protocol will 
be performed. Monitoring of the study will be implemented to minimize subject and data risks.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION:    
The subject may or may not have improvement for the indication treated. 
 
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION:  
Many physicians support the use of laser devices for non-invasive cosmetic treatments due to 
current patient satisfaction of cosmetic results with the currently available devices. However, there 
is still a level of interest in expanding indications and marketing claims for legacy devices. 
 
ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY: 
There is uncertainty of efficacy results for expanding marketing claims while using the PicoSure 
device in this study.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
This study is determined to be a non-significant risk study and  the risks posed to the subjects and 
integrity of data are acceptable.

Version 2.0: April 20, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 of 29 
 
The Investigator and/or designated study staff will review each event and assess its relationship to 
the study device (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the PicoSure treatments:  
 Not related – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product. 
 Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stopping the investigational product, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site. 
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3-point severity. Using the following 
definitions for rating severity will be used: 
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday 
activities. 
 Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities. 
 Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life-threatening adverse device experience, in-patient hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse device experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by the FDA Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported 
within 24 hours of acknowledgment to the Sponsor whether or not the serious events are deemed 
sampling session-related.  All serious event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR part 812 and the IRB 
will be notified accordingly.

The SAE information will be entered into the database and a desk copy of the complete SAE report 
will be submitted to the study file.  
 
Adverse events, whether serious or non-serious, will be followed until the condition is resolved, 
stabilized, otherwise explained or the subject is lost to follow-up.  Adverse events will be captured 
throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, improved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow-up.  Following the resolution of any study-
associated adverse events there will be no further adverse event reports for that subject.

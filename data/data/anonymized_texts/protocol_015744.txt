Abstract  
The opioid epidemic has permeated all strata of society over the last two decades,  especially 
with in the adolescent student athletic environment, a group particularly at risk and presenting 
their own challenges for science and practice.  Effective interventions to are needed for these 
young people to help them avoid prescription opioid misuse .  
 
The Student Athlete Wellness Portal  model s effective opioid misuse resistance strategies  for 
high school athletes .  It was adapted from the evidence -based keepin’ it REAL curriculum that is 
recommended for schools in the Surgeon General’s 2016 report on addiction.  
 
The process of translating research about opioids and youth sports into the web-based 
intervention  began with formative research  among  35 student athletes, ages 1 4 to 21, who had 
all been injured in their school -based sport and who received a pain management plan from 
their doctor . They  participated in in -depth qualitative interviews to explore narratives relating 
to their injuries; their pain management plans; and the ways in which they used, misused, or 
avoided prescription med ication. An inductive analysis of interview transcripts revealed themes 
of the (a) the challenges of being a student athlete ; (b) s ports, drugs, and you ; and (c) w ays to 
stay healthy .  
 
These themes were then translated into prevention messages for the Student Athlete Wellness 
Portal intervention , including a series of video docudramas portraying resistance process . A 
single -group  feasibility test was conducted that provided evidence of its usability, engagement 
and preliminary outcomes.  
 
Introduction  
To date, there are no evidence -based interventions addressing prescription opioid misuse among high 
school athletes. The proposed intervention, adapted from an evidence -based substance use prevention 
intervention, will be the first to effectively address thi s problem among at -risk high school athletes.  
Background and Rationale  
Opioid use and misuse have migrated into the adolescent student athletic environment. This includes 
athletes who misuse their own prescription opioids (i.e., use them recreationally or for other non -
prescribed purposes) as well as those divert prescription  opioids to others for their misuse. It is 
estimated that 2% of youth athletes use heroin, although this, too, varies by sport. Unfortunately, little 
has been done to address the needs of this at -risk population. This paper addresses these issues.  
Accordin g to a recent national study, the incidence of non -medical opioid use is higher among athletes 
than non -athletes.  National statistics document the prevalence of the problem among athletes, with 
some sports (i.e., ice hockey) particularly impacted. Other r esearch shows the incidence of nonmedical 
prescription opioid use increases when youth are injured. The picture, however, is complex: some 
studies suggest that rates for athletes merely mirror those for the general adolescent student 
population, which stil l puts them at risk, some suggest an increased risk for male athletes but not female 
athletes, and others suggest greater likelihood of use among those participating in only some sports. 
Overall, it is estimated that as many as 14% of athletes misuse presc ription opioids and that prescription 
opioid misuse among athletes is associated with somewhat different risk factors from those associated 
with misuse in the general adolescent population, including the heightened perceived need to compete 
and arguably a high pain tolerance.  
Other reports have highlighted the problem of prescription opioid diversion (e.g., sharing or selling their 
opioids to others) among student athletes, and schools across the country have begun partnering with 
law enforcement for Natio nal Prescription Drug Take Back Day  events, to help students understand the 
risks of unused medications and prevent old medications from diversion. These trends have 
underscored the importance of prevention interventions tailored to meet the needs of youn g athletes 
and keep them safe.  
Objective  
The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the Student Athlete Wellness Portal (SAWP). 
SAWP is a digital intervention that targets  
1) prescription opioid misuse among high school athletes  
2) prescript ion opioid diversion among high school athletes.  
Study Design  
 
Five high school were recruited. Student athletes from the five high schools were recruited through the 
athletic departments as well as through online advertisements. Parental consent and youth assent was 
obtained for youth 18 and younger with youth consent for those 19 or older. Consent was obtained 
online.  
After consent was received, participants received a link to the interv ention. They first completed a 
pretest followed by the Student Athlete Wellness Portal program. After completing the program, they 
responded to a posttest. Participants receive incentives of $50.  
Usability and Engagement scores were from the posttest only and compared to neutral using a one -
sample t -test. Efficacy and Willingness posttest scores were compared to pretest schools. Efficacy 
analysis was conducted using a paired t -test while Willingness comparison used a Chi Square test.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
• English-speaking male and female adolescents  
• Ages 13 -19 
• Attending middle or high school

Baseline/Pretest Assessment  
1) demographics  
2) self-efficacy to resist prescription opioid offers  
3) willingness to misuse prescription opioids  
Immediate Posttest  
1) self-efficacy to resist prescr iption opioid offers  
2) willingness to misuse prescription opioids  
3) usability of SAWP  
4) engagement with SAWP  
5) perceptions of opioids  
Intervention Description  
The Student Athlete Wellness Portal prototype consists of 3 video docudrama, scripted from the 
formative interviews and produced by Aaron Matthews of Look Alive Films, an Academy Award winning 
documentarian. Students received an email with a link, complete d an assent, pretest, participated in 
SAWP and then completed an immediate posttest, all in one session.

board was established and supervised procedures. Data were secured  digitally without identifiers by 
REAL Prevention (formative interviews) and St. Andrew Development (surveys). Risks were minimal 
because participants were not asked about prescription opioid misuse or diversion.

Data Analyses  
 
Sample Size Calculation  
We analyzed power to test that our programs would impact targeted outcomes in this project. Since all 
data were collected during a single session, we fixed a somewhat conservative response rate such as 
72%. U   g      ’  f  m     f      m     ff   ,  ur power analysis suggests that the required sample is 
100 participants at posttest to detect program effects. We calculated nominal sample size based on the 
expectation of 72% attrition to require an initial sample of 139 (i.e., 139 athletes x 7 2% respons e rate  = = 
100 athletes at posttes t). Using these estimates, the  proposed study power was good.   
Planned Analyses  
Missing data was not a problem because the program required responses to every item. We planned 
listwise deletion if missing data emerged; no ne did.  
To examine findings for usability , engagement, and perceptions of opioids that were measured on the 
posttest only, we planned on using one sample t -test.  For self -efficacy and willingness to misuse, 
measured on pretest and posttest, we planned on using a  paired t -test.

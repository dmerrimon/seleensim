Study Title  The Randomized A nd Controlled N oninferiority Trial to Evaluate Safety 
and C linical Efficacy of the SurVeil™ Drug-Coated Balloon i N the 
Treatment of Subjects with Stenotic Lesions of the Femoropopliteal Artery 
Compared to the Medtronic IN.PACT® Admiral® Drug-Coated Balloon: 
TRANSCEND Study  
Investigational 
Device  Surmodics SurVeil™ Drug-Coated Balloon (SurVeil DCB)  
Comparator 
Device  Medtronic IN .PACT® Admiral® DCB  
Objectives  To demonstrate the safety and efficacy  of the SurVeil  DCB for treatment of 
subjects with symptomatic  peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to stenosis 
of the femoral and /or popliteal arteries.  
Study Design  Prospective, multi- center, single-blind, randomized, controlled, 
noninferiority clinical trial 
The trial will randomize approximately 446 subjects with symptomatic 
PAD due to  stenoses of the femoral and /or popliteal arteries. Subjects 
meeting eligibility  criteria will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with either 
the SurVeil DCB or the IN.PACT  Admiral DCB , and followed for 60 
months. 
Subject 
Populations Subjects with symptomatic PAD due to a stenotic  lesion of the femoral 
and/or popliteal arteries with  a reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 4 mm to 
7 mm and a total lesion length ≤180 mm. 
Subjects  and 
Sites  Up to 446 subjects will be randomized at approximately 60 sites in the 
United States and approximately  18 sites outside of the United States.  
Primary Safety Endpoint  The primary safety endpoint is a composite of freedom from device- and procedure- related death through 30 days post-index procedure and freedom 
from major target  limb amputation (above the ankle) and clinically -driven 
target vessel revascularization  (TVR) through 12 months post-index 
procedure.

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential Primary Efficacy 
Endpoint  The primary efficacy endpoint is primary patency, defined as  a composite 
of free dom from clinically -driven target lesion revascularization (TLR)  and 
binary restenosis (restenosis defined as  duplex ultrasound [ DUS ] peak 
systolic velocity ratio  [PSVR ] ≥2.4 or ≥50% stenosis as assessed by 
independent angiographic and DUS  core lab s) through 12 months post-
index procedure. In cases when there is a discrepancy between 
angiographic and DUS  assessment of patency, angiographic assessment 
takes precedence. 
Secondary 
Endpoints  Acute:  
•Device Success: defined as successful delivery, balloon inflation,
deflation and retrieval of the intact study device without burst below
rated burst pressure, and achievement of <50% residual stenosis of the
target lesion (by co re lab -assessed quantitative angiography [ QA])
without flow- limiting  arterial dissection using only the study device
•Technical Success: defined as achievement of a final residual
diame ter stenosis of <50%  (by core lab -assessed QA)  without flow-
limiting  arterial dissection at the end of the procedure
•Procedure Success: defined as evidence of both acute technical
success and absence of Peripheral Academic Research Consortium
major adverse events (PARC MAEs; e.g., death, stroke, myocardial
infarct ion, acute onset of limb ischemia, index bypass graft or treated
segment thrombosis, and or need for urgent/ emergent vascular
surgery) within 72 hours of the index procedure
•Freedom from all -cause death,  major  target  limb amputation  and TVR
through 30 days
Through follow-up: 
•Primary patency  through 24 months (only if both the primary safety
and efficacy hypotheses of noninferiority are met)
•Target vessel patency , defined as freedom from clinically -driven TV R
and binary re stenosis (restenosis defined as DUS  PSVR  ≥2.4 or ≥ 50%
stenosis as assessed by independent angiographic and DUS  core labs) ,
within  12 and 24 months ( In cases when there is a discrepancy
between angiographic and DUS  assessment of patency, angiographic
assessment takes precedence.)
•Sustained c linical improvement, defined as freedom from major target
limb amputation, TVR and worsening target limb Rutherford c lass,
within 6, 12, and 24 months

24 months
•Change in target limb P ARC class from baseline to 1, 6, 12, and 24
months
•Decrease in target limb resting ankle brachial index (ABI)  or toe
brachial index (TBI) ≥0.15 from baseline to  6, 12, and  24 months
•Change in Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) score from
baseline to 1, 12, and 24 months
•Change in 6- minute walk test (6-MWT) from baseline to 12 and 24
months
•Change in Peripheral Artery  Questionnaire ( PAQ) score from baseline
to 1, 12, and 24 months
Statistical 
Considerations The proposed investigational device exemption (IDE) study will assess noninferiority of the 12-month primary patency rate in subjects treated with the SurVeil DCB vs. the primary patency rate in subjects treated with the 
IN.PACT Admiral DCB.  
Hypotheses : The efficacy objective will be assessed through testing the 
following hypotheses:  
𝐻𝐻0:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Eff – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Eff≤ −𝛿𝛿Eff 
𝐻𝐻1:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Eff – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Eff>−𝛿𝛿Eff 
where 𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Eff and  𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Eff are the 12 -month primary patency rates in the SurVeil 
group and comparator IN.PACT Admiral group, respectively, and 𝛿𝛿Eff is 
the noninferiority margin . 
Statistical analyse s for the primary endpoint will be conducted using a 
Farrington & Manning test for noninferiority of proportions; the test will be 
a one- sided test at 𝛼𝛼= 0. 025 
Sample Size Assumptions: 
•True 12-month primary patency rate is 82.2% in both treatment groups
TRANSCEND Study  Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3 Page 8 of 95 
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential •1:1 randomization of SurVeil DCB vs IN.PACT Admiral DCB
•15.0% is the absolute noninfer iority margin ( 50% of the difference in
primary patency rate between IN.PACT Admiral DCB and PTA1)
A sample size of 446 (223 randomized to SurVeil DCB group and 223
randomized to IN.PACT Admiral DCB group) randomized  subjects ,
account ing for an assumed 10% lost to follow up, will lead to a power
level  of 97.5%. If the true primary patency rates are 82.2% in the
IN.PACT  Admiral DCB arm , and 80% and 78.3% in the SurVeil DCB
arm, at least 90% and 80% power , respectively, will be preserved at
the planned sample size.

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 4.6 Study Rationale  
The rationale for the current pivotal study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 
SurVeil DCB in subjects with symptomatic PAD due to a stenotic lesion of the femoral and/or 
popliteal arteries with a RVD of 4 mm to 7 mm and a total lesion length ≤180 mm. Specifically, 
the SurVeil DCB is being evaluated in terms of its noninferiority to the Medtronic IN.PACT 
Admiral DCB , which is indicated for use in PTA, after successful pre-dilatation, of de novo or 
restenotic lesions up to 180 mm in length in native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries with 
RVDs of 4 -7 mm.   
5. Device Description /Indications for Use  
The SurVeil  DCB ( Figure 1 ) is indicated  for PTA , after pre-dilatation  of de novo or restenotic 
lesion s (≤180 m m in length) in femoral and popliteal arteries having reference vessel diameters of 
4 mm to 7 mm.  
5.1 PTA Catheter Description  
The SurVeil DCB Catheter (Figure 1) is a standard 0.035” over the wire PTA catheter, 135 0 mm 
working length.  
 
The shaft tubing size is 
5 French and connects the hub to the proximal end of the balloon.   
The shaft o f the catheter is coated with Surmodics PhotoLink
® lubricious  coating. 
The balloon has a cylindrical section, which defines the length of the balloon, with a nominal diameter and a nominal length and a cone section at each end.  
The catheter 
tip, with an atraumatic design, acts as the transition from the catheter to the guidewire.

5.2 Balloon Drug Coating Description 
The balloon is coated with two proprietary coatings. The first layer is a hydrophilic basecoat  
The second layer comprises the drug paclitaxel (See 

TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 30 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 7. Trial Objective and Endpoints   
7.1 Trial Objective  
The objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety and eff icacy  of the SurVeil  DCB for the 
treatment of subjects with symptomatic PAD due to stenosis of the femoral and/or popliteal 
arteries . The study will be deemed a success if at a minimum the hypotheses of inferiority of the 
safety and efficacy of the SurVeil DCB are rejected . 
7.2 Primary Safety Endpoint 
The primary safety endpoint is a comp osite of freedom from device - and procedure -related d eath 
through 30 days post -index procedure and freedom from major target  limb amputation  (above the 
ankle) and clinically -driven target vessel revascularization (TVR) through 12 months post -index 
procedure. 
7.3 Primary Effi cacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is primary patency, defined as  a composite of freedom from 
clinically -driven TLR and binary restenosis (restenosis defined as duplex ultrasound [DUS] peak 
systolic velocity ratio [PSVR] ≥2.4 or ≥50% stenosis as assessed by independent angiographic and 
DUS  core labs) and through 12 months  post- index procedure . In cases when there is a discrepancy 
between angiographic and DUS  assessment of patency, angiographic assessment takes precedence. 
7.4 Secondary Endpoints 
7.4.1 Acute  
The following acute secondary endpoints will be assessed: 
• Device Success: defined as successful delivery, balloon inflation, deflation and retrieval of 
the intact study device without burst below rated burst pressure, and achievement of <50% 
residual stenosis of the target lesion (by core lab- assessed quantitative angiography [ QA]) 
without flow- limiting arterial dissection, using only the study device. 
• Technical Success: defined as achievement of a final residual  diameter stenosis of <50% (by 
core lab -assessed QA)  without flow- limiting arterial dissection at the end of the procedure . 
• Procedure Success: defined as evidence of both acute technical success and absence of Peripheral Academic Research Consortium major adverse events ( PARC MAEs; e.g., 
death, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute onset of limb ischemia, index bypass graft or 
treated segment thrombosis, and or need for urgent/ emergent vascular surgery) within 72 
hours of the index procedure. 
• Freedom from all -cause death,  major  target  limb amputation  and TVR through 30 days. 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 31 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 7.4.2 Through Follow-Up 
The following endpoints will be assessed through the follow-up period: 
• Primary patency  through 24 months (only if both the primary safety and efficacy 
hypotheses of noninferiority are met ). 
• Target vessel patency , defined as  freedom from clinically -driven TVR and freedom from  
binary restenosis ( restenosis defined as DUS  PSVR  ≥2.4 or ≥ 50% stenosis as assessed by 
independent angiographic and DUS  core labs)  within 12 and 24 and months ( In cases when 
there is a discrepancy between angiographic and DUS  assessment of patency, angiographic 
assessment takes precedence.) 
• Sustained clinical improvement, defined as freedom from major target limb amputation, 
TVR and worsening target limb Rutherford class within 6, 12, and 24 months 
• Clinically -driven TLR within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months  
• Historical major adverse events ( Historical MAEs), defined as composite of all -cause death, 
clinically -driven TLR, major target limb amputation, or thrombosis at the target lesion, 
within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months  
• Major target -limb amputation within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months 
• Thrombosis at the target lesion within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months 
• Change in target limb Rutherford class from baseline to 1, 6, 12, and 24 months 
• Change in target limb Peripheral Academic Research Consortium (PARC) class from baseline to 1, 6, 12, and 24 months 
• Decrease in target limb resting ABI or toe brachial index (TBI) ≥0.15 from baseline to  6, 
12, and 24 months 
• Change in Walking Impairment Questionnaire  (WIQ) score from baseline to 1, 12, and 24 
months 
• Change in 6- minute walk test (6-MWT) from baseline to 12 and 24 months 
• Change in Peripheral Artery  Questionnaire ( PAQ) score from baseline to 1, 12, and 24 
months

Version  3.3  Page 37 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 9.2 Informed C onsent  
Subjects are to be consented prior to initiating any study- specific procedures that are not 
considered routine standard of care . The investigator or site personnel, who has been trained 
on the protocol, will approach individual subjects who are potential candidates for 
participation . She or he  will explain the nature and scope of the study, the procedures to be 
performed  as part of the study, the potential risks and benefits of participatio n, and will answer 
questions for the candidate. The study will be explained to the subject in lay terms  and adequate 
time will be allowed for the subject to ask questions. Interested subjects will be invited to 
participate in  the trial and will be asked to  provide written informed consent prior to initiation 
of any trial- related procedure.  Subjects will be assured that they may withdraw from the study 
at any time and for any reason, without repercussion. If the subject agrees to participate, the 
informed consent must be signed and dated by the subject  or their legally authorized 
representative and by the person who obtained the informed consent . If a participant requires 
a translated consent, the Ethics Committee ( EC) or Institutional Revie w Board ( IRB) poli cies 
will apply to the informed consent process. Any additional persons required to sign the 
informed consent by the local EC/IRB will also do so.  
The informed consent form that is used must be approved by the EC/ IRB. A dated and signed 
copy of the inform ed consent form will be given to the subject or their legal ly authorized  
representative and a dated and signed copy will be placed in the research folder.  
Failure to obtain a signed and dated informed consent  form  prior to the procedure constitutes 
a protocol violation, which must be reported in accordance with all applicable regulations. 
9.3 Enrollment  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled  consecutively at each investigative  site in this study. A 
subject is considered to  be enrolled after she or he has signed the informed consent form . 
Enrolled s ubjects who met all the clinical inclusion criteria and none of the clinical exclusion 
criteria will then be evaluated for angiographic eligibility criteria. If an enrolled subjec t fails 
any of the clinical or angiographic eligibility criteria, the investigative site research staff will 
enter information into the electronic data capture (EDC) system to document this ; the subject 
will be considered a screen failure, will not be randomized , will be  exited from the study, and 
will be followed per site standard of care . Subjects who do not fail the angiography eligibility 
criteria  may be randomized:  once angiography is complete and the investigator is satisfied that 
the subject has met all of the trial eligibility criteria, he/she may then  randomize the subject.

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 9.5 Procedure (Day 1)  
9.5.1 Subject Preparation and Baseline Angiography  
The subject must have met all clinical inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, including 
confirmation of all laboratory results , prior to proceeding with the index procedure . Subject 
preparation and percutaneous access should be performed according to the standard hospital 
care unless otherwise specified in this investigational plan. The procedure begins once 
percutaneous access has been established . Standard PTA balloons should be used for pre -
dilatation. Use of  embolic capture angioplasty balloons or cutting/scoring balloons and 
atherectomy devices is not allowed. The appropriate size of the balloon to be used should be 
selected by visual assessment.  
Baseline angiography of the vessel(s) will be performed as per  the angiographic core laboratory 
procedure guidelines to characterize the target lesion and to confirm angiographic eligibility criteria. Because the l esion location must start ≥10 mm below the common femoral bifurcation 
(and terminate  distally at or above the end of the P1 segment of the popliteal artery), the 
common femoral artery cannot be treated.  Assessment of angiographic eligibility criteria is 
based on a visual assessment of the angiogram  and/or QA . All angiograms, either digital 
subtraction angiography or cineangiography, will be submitted to an independent angiographic 
core laboratory for analysis. Angiograms should be captured before and  during the index 
procedure, and at any unscheduled interventions. Care should be taken to utilize the same 
angles and views for all angiographic assessments. All angiograms should be submitted as 
soon as possible to the angiographic core laboratory for analysis  per the core lab oratory 
guidelines. 
9.5.2 Inflow L esion Treatment  
In order to be randomized, the subject must have a patent inflow artery free from significant 
stenosis ( ≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by angiography. Subjects can be randomized after 
successful treatment of inflow stenosis per standard practice; there is no limit to the number of 
inflow lesions tha t can be treated.  Successful treatment is defined as ≤30% residual stenosis 
without death or major vascular complications.  
9.5.3 Target Lesion Pre-Dilatation 
Refer to the SurVeil DCB and IN.PACT Admiral DCB Instructions for Use (IFU) for detailed 
pre-dilatation requirements . Pre-dilata tion of the target lesion  with an uncoated PTA catheter  
is required for both the SurV eil and IN.PACT  Admiral DCB s. The uncoated PTA catheters 
should have a diameter that is 1mm less than RVD. The length of the uncoated PTA catheter 
should approximate the length of the lesion. This is in order to limit vessel injury outside the 
boundaries of the target lesion and prevent “geographic miss” where the pre -dilation balloon 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 41 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential treated area is outside of the DCB treated area.  The DCB must be longer than the uncoated 
PTA catheter that was used . 
Successful pre -dilata tion is defined as having achieved residual stenosis ≤70% and the absence 
of a flow -limiting dissection.  If a subject does not achieve a successful pre -dilatation, the 
subjec t is not eligible to be randomized , is considered a screen failure, and is treated in 
accordance with standard of care. 
9.5.4 Randomization 
Subject s will be  randomized  in a 1:1 fashion via the EDC to either the SurV eil DCB or the 
IN.PACT  Admiral DCB.   
Prior to randomization, the investigative site should verify that the appropriate sizes of both 
the IN.PACT  Admiral and SurVeil products are available for use in the subject. Each subject 
will receive one unique randomization number associated with a randomization assignment 
allocated via EDC . Randomization will be stratified by study center and to prevent bias ; the 
blocks and randomization schedules will be pre -defined prior to the first subject  being enroll ed.   
9.5.5 Subjects Not Randomized 
A subject who was enrolled but not randomized due to not meeting all of the eligibility criteria 
(either clinical or angiographic)  will be treated per the investigative site’s standard of care.  The 
appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF ) should be filled out to indica te that this subject 
has been exited from the study. 
9.5.6 Treatment with the SurVeil DCB or IN.PACT Admiral DCB  
Refer to the appropriate device (Sur Veil DCB  or IN.PACT  Admiral DCB) IFU for detailed 
information on use of the particular device. The investigator should determine the appropriate size DCB based on visual estimate and/or QA  and plan to use a  maximum of 2 SurVeil DCBs.  
DCB sizing must match the RVD and fully cover and extend slightly beyond the lesion length. 
The o perator should not plan to use more than two study devices to treat a single target lesion 
during the procedure. The investigator should determine the appropriate size of the balloon(s)  
to be used as follows: 
• The nominal DCB diameter must match the RVD distal to the target lesion.  
• The nominal DCB length must cover the entire target lesion or area treated by the 
pre-dilatation balloon plus a minimum of 5 mm proximally and 5 mm distally. 
• If multiple DCBs  are required to treat a lesion, the balloons must overlap by at 
least 10 m m. The additional DCB should be angiographically positioned to ensure 
coverage of at least 5 mm proximally and distally beyond the margins of the pre-dilatation  lesion.  
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 42 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential The balloon to artery ratio must be 1.1:1. 
Use a radiopaque ruler to ensure appropriate placement of the DCB catheter.  The device(s) 
should cover the entire lesion. 
Balloon inflation pressure should be at or beyond the nominal pressure. Do not  exceed rated 
burst pressure.  
The DCB (s) (SurVeil or IN.PACT Admiral) should be inflated for a minimum of 120 seconds 
to achieve the desired dilatation.  If additional dilatation is required, a standard PTA catheter 
should be used. If a SurVeil DCB is open ed but not used, or if a device deficiency or malfunction occurs during 
its use, it must be returned to Surmodics or its designee in accordance with the packaging and 
shipping instructions. The Sponsor is responsible for device deficiencies reporting of the 
SurVeil DCB to all concerned National Competent Authorities of the EU according to national regulations and in line with MEDDEV 2.7/3 revision 3, May 2015. 
9.5.7 Bailout Stenting  
Prior to bailout stenting, the investigator should attempt prolonged balloon inflations (>2 
minutes) in order to limit the amount of bailout stenting required in the study.   
Bailout stenting is allowed if: 
• residual stenosis is ≥50% (based on in- lab review of angiograms with/without QA ) 
or  
• major ( ≥Grade D)  flow-limiting dissection confirmed by a peak translesional systolic 
pressure gradient >10 mmHg.   
If bailout stenting is required  per either of the above criteria, the investigator should treat the 
patient per standard of care including use of a superfici al femoral artery ( SFA)-indicated bare 
nitinol stent. The size of the stent should be as short as possible in order to cover the dissection 
or focal area of residual stenosis and not to cover the entire lesion with the bailout stent. During 
angiography, ca re should be taken to utilize the same angles and views that were used during 
the baseline and DCB procedures. 
All subjects who undergo a bailout procedure, including emergency surgery , are required to be 
followed per the protocol follow -up schedule. These  subjects will be included in all study 
analyses.  Any complication leading to a bailout procedure is considered an AE in this study, 
or an SAE based on the seriousness of the event (see Section 12.3.1). 
9.5.8 End of P rocedure  
Angiography of the vessel(s) must be  performed per angiographic core lab guidelines and in 
the same views that were taken at baseline.  FDA -approved/CE -marked  closure devices are 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 43 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential allowed.  The end of the procedure is defined as the time the guide catheter is removed from 
the subject. If the subject is returned to the procedure room and a guiding catheter is reinserted 
and a dilatation is performed, this should be considered a repeat intervention. Please see 
Section 9.8 for Medication Regimen information. 
9.6 Follow- Up Visits  
All follow -up visits in the study will be completed per the schedule of events (See Table 3.) 
including the required exams and assessments at the specified timepoints after the index 
procedure. 
9.6.1 Exceptions for the 12-month and 24- month Follow -up Visits  
If travel restrictions and limitations on personal contact with study subjects are due to the 
Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), exceptions will be made to the protocol. This includes a telephone call to the study subject instead of an in- office visit at the time of the 12 -month 
and/or 24-month follow-up visit.  Mobile duplex ultrasound (DUS) examinations will also be 
available during these visits.  Howev er, efforts should continue to obtain an in- office visit to 
perform all of the protocol-required exams and procedures (See Table 3  Schedule of Events)

9.9 Imaging and Other Clinical Assessments  
9.9.1 Angiogram 
All angiograms will be performed per angiographic core lab guidelines. Care should be taken 
to utilize the same angles and views that were assessed at baseline for all subsequent 
assessments.  
9.9.2 Duplex Ultrasound (DUS)  
All DUS  will be performed by personnel w ho have been trained on the protocol and also on 
the DUS  core lab oratory guidel ines. The quality of the DUS images are critical for assessing 
study endpoints. The DUS core laboratory  will be monitoring images  closely during the 
duration of the study to ens ure DUS images are captured correctly.    
9.9.2.1 Mobile Duplex Ultrasound  
If the investigational site is interested in using mobile duplex ultrasound as an option to obtain 
DUS exams for subjects who are not able to attend an in- office visit, a third party mobile 
diagnostic company has been contracted by the sponsor . (United States sites only) .  Subjects 
will be reconsented per local IRB requirements prior to obtaining the mobile DUS exam . 
Mobile DUS technicians will be qualified and trained on the study to perform the DUS exams 
according to the imaging protocol.  The DUS exam images  and completed worksheets will be 
provided to the specific investigational site and to the DUS Core Lab.  The DUS core lab will 
review  and interpret the DUS images.

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 9.9.3 Target Limb Rutherford and PARC Evaluations 
Target limb Rutherford classification and target limb PARC classification can be determined 
with or without  a treadmill, but at a minimum, each subject should have the evaluations 
performed in the same manner  over the course of the entire study. For example, if a treadmill 
is used for the baseline visit  Rutherford  and PARC  evaluation s for a subject, a treadmill should 
then be used for all  subsequent Rutherford and PARC evaluations for that same subject.  
Exception: When conducting a telephone visit, Target limb Rutherford Classification without 
the use of treadmill may only be performed.  If a treadmill has been previously used in the 
assessment, it must consistently be used throughout the study and therefore would require an office visit.  
9.9.4 Ankle Brachial Index  
A resting ABI should be performed on the target limb per hospital standard practice. If an ABI 
cannot be assessed, a TBI can be used.  If a TBI is used, future visits will need to have a TBI 
recorded as well . 
9.9.5 6-Minute Walk Test , Walking Impairment Questionnaire , and Peripheral 
Artery Questionnaire 
The 6 -MWT , WIQ, and PAQ wil l be performed for each subject . 
10.  Blinding Plan  
In this single-blind study, all randomized subjects will be blinded.  
All core lab oratory  personnel (DUS, angiogram) , all members of the Clinical Events 
Committee  (CEC) , and a study statistician will be blinded  to the subject’s treatment.  
11.   Subject Accountability  and Withdrawal  
11.1 Withdrawal  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care by the study personnel or institution. If a subject decides 
to withdraw, they will be asked to participate in a limited capacity by allowing their medical 
status t o be followed by telephone contact, medical chart review, or by other agreed upon 
method. If a subject decides not to continue participation in a limited capacity, all study tests 
and procedures will be stopped and an inquiry will be made about the cause of withdrawal ; 
however, study data collected prior to their withdrawal may be reviewed and publicly available 
records may be consulted prior to or after withdrawal.  
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 50 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential The investigative site must account for and document all subjects enrolled in the study, 
including those withdrawn from the study or lost to follow -up. All subjects will be encouraged 
to remain in the trial through 60 months. I f a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, 
the reason(s) shall be reported  on the eCRF.  
Reasons fo r withdrawal include, but are not limited to: 
• Subject does not receive a device  
• Physician discretion 
• Subject choice to withdraw consent 
• Loss to follow-up 
• Death  
Randomized  subjects who discontinue participation prematurely will be included in the 
analysis of results (as appropriate) but they will not be replaced in the enrollment of total trial 
subjects.  Additional study data may no longer be collected after the point at which a subject 
has been withdrawn from the study or withdraws his/her consent. Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal will be used  for analysis. If a subject withdraw s due to medical safety 
considerations because of an AE, the AE must be followe d by medical attention to satisfactory 
resolution and all study data related to the subject will be reported.   
11.2 Los s to Follow- Up 
A subject  will not be considered lost to follow- up unless all efforts to obtain compliance are 
unsuccessful. At a minimum, the  effort to obtain follow -up information must include  3 
attempts to make contact with the subject  (or their legally authorized representative)  via 
telephone and if contact via telephone is not successful, a certified letter from the investigator 
must be sen t to the subject’s last known address. Should both telephone and mail  efforts to 
contact the subject  be unsuccessful, the subject’s primary physician should be contacted. All 
contact efforts to obtain follow -up information must be documented in both the subject’s 
medical records and on the eCRFs. Subjects are not eligible to be exited as lost to follow -up 
until after the 12 -month follow -up visit. After the 12- month follow -up visit, if a minimum of 
two consecutive study visits have been missed, after making two attempts by phone and one 
by certified mail at each time point, lost to follow -up may be an acceptable reason for exit.  
12.  Adverse Events  
Starting at the time of informed consent signing and at each subsequent evaluation  (scheduled 
or unscheduled) , the investigator will determine if any AE s have occurred  in any subject. 
Subjects are encouraged to report AEs freely or in response to general, non- directed 
questioning. The subject may volunteer information that appears to be  an AE anytime during 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001

required information and document findings on the eCRF.   
12.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
12.1.1 Adverse Event  (AE)  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device.  
NOTE 1: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device
  or the comparator. 
NOTE 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
NOTE 3: Abnormal laboratory findings will be considered AEs, only if determined 
by the investigator to be clinically significant  
NOTE 4:  For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices.  
Any current condition that is recorded as a pre -existing condition in the physical examination 
section, unless there is a change in nature, severity, or degr ee of incidence, is not an AE.  
All AEs will be followed  until the event becomes stable or  through to resolution, independent 
of duration or follow- up window. 
12.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is an AE that leads to:  
1. Death  
2. A serious deterioration in the hea lth of the subject that either resulted in:  
a. life-threatening illness or injury or 
b. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function or 
c. in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or 
d. medical or surgical intervention to  prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
3. Fetal distress, fetal death, or congenital abnormality or birth defect.   
NOTE: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the 
protocol , without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a n SAE . A planned 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 52 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential hospitalization is one that is scheduled prior to the subject  signing the informed consent for 
the study. 
SAEs  include device deficiencies that might have led to an SAE if  
a. suitable action had not been taken or 
b. intervention had not been made or  
c. circumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting 
system.   
Please note, any investigational device deficiencies must be reported to Baim Institute  for 
Clinical Research . 
  
12.1.3 Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
An adverse device effect ( ADE ) is an AE that is related to the investigational medical device.  
NOTE 1 : Thi s definition includes AE s resulting from insufficie ncies  or inadequa cies 
in the instructions for use, the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. 
NOTE 2 : This definition includes any event that is a result of a use error or from 
intentional abnormal use of the investigational medical device.  
12.1.4 Anticipated Adverse Event  
Any undesirable health related experience occurring to a subject whether or not considere d 
related to the investigational product(s) or drug regimen prescribed as part of the clinical 
protocol, predefined in the clinical protocol and/or IFU that is identified or w orsens during a 
clinical study.  Anticipated AEs are identified  in the IFU and can  be found in Section  14.2. 
12.1.5 Device Deficiency, Device Malfunction  & User Error  
The investigators are instructed to report all device deficiencies, device malfunctions and us er 
errors during the study. The following are the descriptions of each instance: 
Device Failure:  A device failure occurs when the device is used in compliance with the IFU, 
but does not perform as described in the IFU and also negatively impacts treatment of the study subject  
Device Deficiency  (ISO14155:2011):  Inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance . This may include malfunctions, use error, 
or inadequate labeling . 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential Device Malfunction  (ISO 14155:2011) : Failure of an investigational medical device to 
perform in accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance with the IFU or 
clinical study protocol.  
Use Error: Act or omission of an act that results in a different medical device response than 
intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user. 
NOTE 1 : Use error includes slips, lapses, and mistakes.  
NOTE 2 : An unexpected physiological response of the subject does not in itself constitute 
a use error.  
12.1.6 Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
An SADE is an ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of an SAE.   
12.1.7 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE ) and Unanticipated Serious 
Adverse Device Effect (USADE)  
12.1.7.1 UADE per the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  
Pertinent to investigative sites conducting this study within the United States: An unanticipated  
adverse device effect (UADE) is defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s) as “any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”  
12.1.7.2 USADE per the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
Pertinent to investigative sites conducting this study outside the United States:  An 
unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE)  is defined in ISO14155:2011 3.42 as 
“Serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report. 
NOTE Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by its nature, 
incidence, severity,  or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report. 
12.2 Adverse Event Documentation  
All AEs must be documente d on the appropriate eCRF  and will be characterized by the 
following criteria:  
• Seriousness 
• Intensity or Severity  
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 54 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential • Relatedness to device and procedure  
• Outcome 
• Treatment or action taken  
All AEs (serious and non- serious) will be reported for the entire study period to the extent 
required by national and/or local requirements.  For U nited S tates investigative  sites only: After 
the 12- month follow -up visit, continuing AEs will be followed through to resolution or until 
event becomes stable, and only SAEs, including Historical MAEs,  and clinical study 
endpoints, will be recorded.  
12.2.1 Intensity or Severity  
The intensity or severity or each AE, as assessed by the investigator, will be recorded using 
the following definitions: 
Mild  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s 
usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae.  
Moderate  Interferes with a subject’s usual activity, but the subject is still able to 
function  
Severe Events that interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and generally require a systemic drug therapy or other treatment 
12.2.2 Relatedness to Study Device or Procedure  
The investigator will evaluate if the AE or SAE is related to the investigational device or study 
procedure.  The investigator will use the following def initions for this assessment: 
Table 5. Adverse Event Relatedness Categories  
Not Related  Relationship to the device or procedures can be excluded when:  
• the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to, 
or of similar devices and procedures; 
• the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device or the procedures; 
• the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern  is previously known) and is biologically implausible; 
• the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation /exposure), do not impact on the serious event; 
•  the event involves a body site or an organ not expected to be affec ted by the 
device or procedure;  
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 55 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential • the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or 
concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment 
or other risk factors); 
• the event does not depend on a false result given by the investigational device 
used for diagnosis, when applicable;

• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Ongoing 
• Death 
12.3 Adverse Event Reporting 
12.3.1 Serious  Adverse Events  
Reporting of SAEs includes reporting of any SAE, any investigational medical device deficiency that might have led to an SAE and any new finding/update in relation to already reported events.  
It is the responsibility of each investigator to report all SAEs to the sponsor or its designee 
within 24 hours using the  appropriate eCRF, and in accordance with applicable national 
regulations. Report of a subject death must be submitted using the eCRF along with a brief 
statement of the pertinent details, and the death records/certificate or autopsy report, if 
available/performed. Every effort should be made to report the SAEs leading to the subject 
death using the eCRF.  
The Sponsor or its designee will  evaluate the SAE for UADE and perform analysis of the event. 
The Sponsor or its designee will prepare the safety documentation to be submitted to 
investigators, National/local regulatory authorities , and IRB /ECs according to national /local  
regulations and IRB/EC requirements.   
12.3.2 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
If a complication occurs that the site investigator believes may be a potential UADE, the site 
should immediately contact the sponsor or its authorized representative to determine reporting 
requirements. In addition, when there is a reason to believe a device may have malfunctioned, causing potential harm to a subject , the site should immediately notify the sponsor.  
The site investigator shall submit to the sponsor or its authorized representative  a report of any 
UADE occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in no event later than 24 hours 
after the Investigator first learns of the effect. All UADEs must be documented by the site 
investigator including the date of onset, a complete description of the event, causality  
assessment, possible reason(s) for the event, severity, duration, actions taken, and outcome.

14.2  Poten
tial Risks  of SurVeil DCB  
Risks associated with the SurVeil DCB include risks associated with a standard peripheral 
balloon dilatation catheterization procedure. These risks may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Punctur e related:  
• Arterio -venous fistula 
• Bleeding 
• Femoral nerve compression with associated neuropathy • Groin area bruising and discomfort 
• Local hematoma  
• Local hemorrhage 
• Local infections • Local or distal thromboembolic episodes

• Drug reactions • Endocarditis 

TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 62 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential • Kidney failure 
• Low blood pressure • Pain and tenderness 
• Pyrogenic reaction 
• Respiratory failure • Sepsis/infection  
• Short-term hemodynamic deterioration 
• Stroke 
• Systemic embolization  
Potential risks that may be unique to the SurVeil DCB catheter:  
• Allergic/immunologic reaction  
• Alopecia • Anemia • Gastrointestinal symptoms  
• Hematologic dyscrasia (including leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) 
• Hepatic enzyme changes  
• Histologic changes in vessel wall, including inflammation, cellular damage, or necrosis 
• Myalgia/arthralgia  
• Myelosuppression 
• Peripheral neuropathy 
There may be other potential risks that are unforeseen  at this time. The occurrence of the above-
listed risks may lead to the need for a repeat procedure, emergency blood vessel surgery, 
amputation or death.  
For more detailed information on the risks of treatment with the SurVeil DCB, including a 
complete list of warning s, precautions and potential AEs, please refer to the IFU, which is 
provided with the product. 
14.3  Potential Benefits  
There are no guaranteed ben efits from participation in this trial;  however, it is possible that 
treatment with the SurVeil DCB may reduce the potential for restenosis of the treated lesion, 
thereby reducing the need for repeat interventions. 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 63 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential Moreover, in this clinical investigation all subjects will have a more intense medical follow -
up compared to standard practice, which can be beneficial to the long -term clinical outcome 
of study subjects. 
Additionally, information gained from the conduct of this study may be of benefit to others 
with the same medical condition. Efficacy and safety data collected on the SurVeil DCB will contribute to expanding the knowledge of use of DCBs in peripheral interventions. Surmodics 
believes the risk for significant injury or death is low and the potenti al benefits of decreased 
restenosis and need for re -intervention are likely, but these potential risks and benefits have 
yet to be quantified. 
14.4 Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  
The anticipated adverse device effects are listed in Section  14.2. These events are typical for 
other commercially availab le peripheral balloon dilatation devices. 
14.5 Residual Risk  
There were no intolerable risks r emaining in the risk analysis. The remaining risks have been 
mitigated as far as reasonably practicable.  
14.6 Risks Associated w ith Participation in the Clinical Trial  
The risks associated with participation in this study will be similar to those associated with use 
of commercially available peripheral balloon dilatation devices. The risks of participation in 
this study will be min imized by careful subject  and site selection, as well as by implementing 
monitoring procedures to ensure proper conduct and management of the study. 
Meta- analyses of randomized controlled trials of paclitaxel -coated balloons and paclitaxel -
eluting stents u sed to treat peripheral arterial disease in the femoropopliteal arteries have 
identified an increased risk of late mortality at 2 years and beyond. The magnitude and 
mechanism for the increased risk in mortality is currently unclear. The analyses also 
demonstrated reduced revascularization rates with the drug -containing products. The impact 
of future device exposure is unknown as is the impact of other drug-containing devices. 
Physicians should discuss the benefits and risks of all available treatment options with patients.
 
 
14.7 Possible Interactions with Concomitant Treatments  
Concomitant treatment with this device has not been investigated. Therefore the interaction of 
this device with concomitant treatments remains unknown. 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 64 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 14.8  Risk Mitigation  
To minimize the po tential risks associated with study procedures, all efforts will be made to 
select i nvestigators who are experienced and skilled in using peripheral interventional devices. 
Additionally, at study initiation all investigators will be trained on the SurVeil IFU and the 
protocol. All enrolling investigators will be instructed on appropriate subject selection in an 
effort to minimize the risk of recruiting ineligible subjects to the study.  
Subjects will be monitored closely throughout the study duration and wil l be evaluated at pre -
specified time points to assess their clinical status.  
14.9 Risk / Benefit Rationale  
The conclusions from the risk analyses performed on the SurVeil DCB are:  
• The device is appropriate for the intended use. 
• The potential benefits of the device outweigh the risks. 
• All applicable risks have been addressed through appropriate testing and any residual 
risks are acceptable when weighed against  the potential benefits to the subject.  
• The use of the device is designed to protect the health and safety of the subjec t, user, 
and environment.  
15.   Data Collection and Verification  
15.1 Data Collection, Verification and Retention  
All required data for this trial will be collected on standardized eCR Fs. The investigator or 
investigational site will maintain, at the investigative site, in original format, all essential study 
documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in 
compliance with International Conference on Harmoni zation ( ICH)/Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ), ISO14155:2011,  and any local regulatory guidelines. Sites that are able to send 
complete source documents to the Baim Institute will be encouraged to do so: the EDC system 
allows a direct upload of documentation, which mitigates the site burden and reduces delays. This will not replace monitoring visits on site, but can be used to accelerate the review of the 
subjec t data.  
Documents must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a ma rketing 
application or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal completion  of or 
discontinuation of the clinical investigation of the product. These documents will be retained 
for a longer period of time by agreement with Surmodics or in compli ance with other local 
regulations. To avoid error, the investigator should contact Surmodics before the destruction 
of any records and reports pertaining to the trial to ensure they no longer need to be retained. 
In addition, Surmodics should be contacted if the investigator plans to leave the investigational 
site so arrangements can be made for the transfer of records.

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 15.2 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is defined as any instance during the conduct of the study in which the 
investigator or other site personnel changed or failed to adhere to the study design or 
procedures specified by the protocol. Examples of protocol deviations may include:  
a. enrollment of a study subject who does not meet all of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the protocol;  
b. failure to obtain a key safety procedure or lab test; or  
c. enrollment of a patient during a lapse in IRB /EC approval of the study.  
All relevant p rotocol deviations should be submitted by the site on the applicable eCRF, and 
will be reviewed and assessed for their impact on subject safety by Surmodics or its designee.  
Investigative sites are expected to comply with the study protocol except where necessary to 
protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency  (in cases of medical 
emergency, the Baim Institute for Clinical Research  should be notified within 24 hours  of the 
occurrence of the event) . 
All protocol deviations will be tracked and entered into the EDC system. Surmodics or its designee is responsible for assuring t he site i nvestigator is aware of all protocol deviations at 
their site, reporting to regulatory agencies as appropriate, and for determining if the trial needs 
to be terminated at a particular site due to the number or type of protocol deviations. 
Investigative s ites should report deviations to their IRBs/ECs per their procedures. 
Protocol deviations for inability to perform office visits, exams or procedures due to COVID -
19 pandemic  should be completed and a notation of  “COVID -19” in the CRF  for each 
deviation. 
16.  Device Supply and Management  
Tracking of the investigational product used in this study will be consistent with 21 CFR Part 
821 and ISO 14155:2011, and in accordance with locat ion-specific requirements. Devices must 
be stored in a locked location at the investigative  site. 
Surmodics will provide the investigational device ( SurVeil DCB ) to all participating sites . 
Control devices (IN.PACT Admiral DCBs) will not be provided by the study; sites should use their own inventory in this case. 
Device management will  be captured through EDC and on the device accountability log. The 
site will record device usage in the EDC  as soon as possible after opening any DCB (both test 
and control devices) used in this study, including the description and the dimensions of the 
device. If a SurVeil DCB is opened but not used, or if a device deficiency or malfunction 
occurs during its use, it must be returned to Surmodics or its designee  in accordance with the 
packaging and shipping instructions.

17.   Statistical Methods  
The proposed study is a prospective, multi -center, randomized, controlled trial designed to 
assess the no ninferiority of the SurVeil DCB in the treatment of subjects with stenotic lesions 
of the femoropopliteal artery, compared to the IN.PACT Admiral DCB , with respect to the 
primary efficacy endpoint of 12- month primary patency, defined as freedom from clinically -
driven TLR  and binary restenosis (restenosis de fined as DUS  PSVR  ≥2.4 or ≥50% stenosis as 
assessed by independent angiographic and DUS  core labs ), and with respect to the primary 
safety endpoint, defined as  a composite of freedom from device - and procedure -related death 
through 30 days post-index procedure and freedom from major target limb amputation (above 
the ankle) and clinically -driven TVR through 12 months post -index procedure.  The study will 
be deemed a success if at a minimum the hypotheses of inferiority of the safety and efficacy 
of the SurVeil DCB are rejected . The proportions of subjects me eting the primary efficacy and 
safety endpoint s at 12-months post -index procedure  and the confidence interva ls of these rates 
in each group will be reported.  
The main analysis of primary efficacy and safety endpoints will be based on multiple imputation.  Details on the imputation model will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
17.1 Assessment of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is primary patency, defined as a composite of freedom from 
clinically -driven TLR and binary restenosis (restenosis defined as DUS PSVR ≥2.4 or ≥50% 
stenosis as assessed by independent angiographic and DUS  core labs ) and through 12 months 
post- index procedure. In cases when there is a discrepancy between angiographic and DUS  
assessment of patency, angi ographic assessment takes precedence. The primary efficacy 
objective will be assessed through testing the following hypotheses: 
𝑯𝑯
𝟎𝟎: The proportion of subjects who meet the efficacy endpoint in the SurVeil DCB group 
through 12 months pos t-index procedure is clinically inferior to the proportion of subjects who 
meet the efficacy endpoint in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group  
𝐻𝐻0:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Eff – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Eff≤ −𝛿𝛿Eff 
𝑯𝑯𝟏𝟏: The proportion of subjects who meet the efficacy endpoint in the SurVeil DCB group 
through 12 months pos t-index procedure is clinically noninferior to the proportion of subjects 
who meet the efficacy endpoint in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group 
𝐻𝐻1:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Eff – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Eff>−𝛿𝛿Eff 
where 𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Effand 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Effare the 12 -month primary patency rates in the SurVeil  DCB  group and 
comparator IN.PACT Admiral DCB group, respectively, and 𝛿𝛿Eff is the noninferiority margin. 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 67 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential Statistical analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using a Farrington & 
Manning test for noninferiority of proportions. The SurVeil DCB will be declared noninferior to IN.PACT  Admiral DCB with respect to the efficacy endpoint if the null hypothesis of 
inferiority is rejected at a one- sided significance level of 2.5%. Subsequently, if the null 
hypothesis of inferiority is re jected, a statistical test for superiority  
𝐻𝐻
0:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Eff – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Eff≤0 
𝐻𝐻1:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Eff – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Eff> 0 
at the one -sided 2.5% will be conducted. If the superiority hypothesis is also met, the Surveil 
DCB will be declared superior to IN.PACT  Admiral DCB with respect to the efficacy endpoint. 
The main analysis will be carried out using the Intention- To-Treat ( ITT) analysis set. In 
addition to the main ITT analysis, supportive analyses will also be carried out using the As 
Treated ( AT) and Per -Protocol ( PP) anal ysis sets.  
17.1.1 Primary Patency Rates and Noni nferiority Margin   
The FDA -approved/CE marked  Medtronic IN.PACT Admiral DCB will be used as the 
comparator for the SurVeil DCB. In the Medtronic Premarket Approval  (PMA) study, the 12-
month primary patency rates wer e 82.2% and 52.4% in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB and PTA 
groups,40 respectively. The observed difference in the 12-month primary patency rates between 
the IN.PACT Admiral DCB and PTA groups was 29.8% . Based on 50% of the difference in 
primary patency between IN.PACT Admiral DCB  and PTA, a noninferiority margin of 15.0% 
is clinically  justified  as it preserves the 50% of the treatment effect between DCB and PTA .  
17.1.2 Sample Size Calculations  
The assumptions for this analysis are: 
• True 12-month primary patency rate is 82.2% in both treatment groups 
• 1:1 randomization of SurVeil DCB vs. IN.PACT Admiral DCB   
• 15.0% is the absolute noninferiority margin (50% of the difference in primary patency rate between IN.PACT Admiral DC B and PTA)  
• Statistical analysis will be conducted using a Farri ngton & Manning test for 
noninferiority of proportions; the test will be a one- sided test at 𝛼𝛼=0.025  
• Sample Size: N=400 (200 in the SurVeil DCB group and 200 in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group) evaluable subjects or 446 (223 in the SurVeil DCB group and 223 in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group) randomized subjects to account for an assumed 10% loss to follow-up 
Under these assumptions , the power is at least 97.5%. If the true primary patency rates are 
82.2% in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group and 78.3% or higher in the SurVeil DCB group, 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001

17.2 Assessment of the Primary Safety Endpoint 
The primary safety endpoint is a composite of freedom from device - and procedure -related 
death through 30 days post -index procedure and freedom from major target limb amputation 
and clinically -driven TVR through 12 months post-index procedure.  
The primary safety objective will be assessed through testing the following hypotheses: 
𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎: The proportion of subjects who meet the safety endpoint in the SurVeil DCB group 
through 12 months post -index procedure is inferior to the proportion of subjects who meet the 
safety endpoint in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group  
𝐻𝐻0:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Saf – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Saf≤ −𝛿𝛿Saf 
𝑯𝑯𝟏𝟏: The proportion of subjects who meet the safety endpoint in the SurVeil DCB group 
through 12 months post -index procedure is clinically noninferior to the proportion of subjects 
who meet the safety endpoint in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group 
𝐻𝐻1:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Saf – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Saf>−𝛿𝛿Saf 
where 𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Saf and  𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Saf are the 12 -month primary safety rates in the SurVeil DCB group and 
comparator IN.PACT Admiral DCB group, respectively, and 𝛿𝛿Saf is the noninferiority margin . 
Statistical analyses for the primary safety endpoi nt will be conducted using a Farrington & 
Manning test for noninferiority of proportions. The S urVeil DCB will be declared non inferior 
to IN.PACT Admiral DCB with respect to safety endpoint if the null hypothesis of inferiority 
is rejected at a one sided s ignificance level of 2.5%.  
Subsequently, if the null hypothesis of inferiority is rejected, a statistical test for superiority  
𝐻𝐻0:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Saf – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Saf≤0 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 69 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 𝐻𝐻1:𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆Saf – 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀Saf> 0 
at the one -sided 2.5% will be conducted. If the superiority hypothesis is also met, the Surveil 
DCB will be declared superior to IN.PACT Admiral DCB with respect to the safety endpoint. 
The main analysis will be carried out using the ITT analysis set. In addition to the main ITT analysis, supportive analyses will also be carried out using the AT and PP analysis sets . 
17.2.1 Primary  Safety Endpoint Rates and Noni nferiority Margin  
The FDA -approved/CE marked  Medtronic IN.PACT Admiral DCB will be used as the 
comparator for the SurVeil DCB. In the primary publication of the IN.PACT SFA trial, the 
primary safety rates were 95.7% and 76.6% in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB and PTA groups, respectively.
40 The observed difference in primary safety endpoint rates between the IN.PACT 
Admiral DCB and PTA groups was 19.1%. Based on 50% of the difference in primary safety 
endpoint between IN.PACT Admiral DCB  and PTA, a noninferiority margin of 10.0% is 
clinically justified , as it preserves the 50% of the treatment effect between the DCB and PTA. 
This is the same noninferiority margin utilized in  the IN.PAC T SFA study.  
17.2.2 Sample Size Calculations  
The assumptions for this analysis are: 
• True 12-month primary safety endpoint rate is 95.7% in both treatment groups 
• 1:1 randomization of SurVeil DCB vs. IN.PACT Admiral DCB  
• 10.0% is the absolute noninferiority margin  (50% of the difference in primary safety 
endpoint rate between IN.PACT Admiral DCB and PTA)  
• Statistical analysis will be conducted using a Fa rrington & Manning test for 
noninferiority of proportions; the test will be a one- sided test at 𝛼𝛼=0.025  
• Sample Size: N=400 (200 in the SurVeil DCB group and 200 in the IN.PACT 
Admiral DCB group) evaluable subjects or 446 (223 in the SurVeil DCB group and 223 in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group) randomized subjects to account for an 
assumed 10% loss to follow-up 
Under these assumptions, the power is at > 99%. If the true primary safety endpoint rates are 
95.7% in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB group and 92.7% or higher  in the SurVeil DCB group, 
at least 80% power will be preserved at the planned sample size. Power calculations  were 
performed with SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

17.3 Handling of Missing Data in the Analysis of Primary Efficacy and S afety 
Endpoints 
Every effort will be undertaken to limit premature discontinuations and ascertain completeness 
of data collection. The reasons for missing data will be described in detail and evaluated for 
assessment of possible bias. The missing data is expected to be <10% at 12 months.   To assess the effect of missing data on the results of the primary efficacy and safety endpoints, a series of sensitivity analyses will be carried out.   
First, a  tipping point analysis will be carried out. For the primary efficacy endpoint , it is 
assumed that for all IN.PACT Admiral DCB subjects with missing primary patenc y status, the 
loss of primary patency did not occur. For SurVeil DCB subjects  with missing data, it will be 
first assumed that the loss of primary  patency occurred for exactly one such subject ; then the 
primary analyses  will be re -run to assess if noninferiority is met under this assumption. Then 
it will be assumed the primary patency loss occurred for exactly two SurVeil DCB subjects 
with missing data, and the primary noninferiority analysis will be rerun. The process  will 
continue sequentially in this manner until all SurVeil DCB subjects with missing data  are 
considered to have lost primary patency
. Of interest is the  “tipping point”, or i.e., the number 
of imputed SurVeil DCB subjects not meeting primary pa tency where noninferiority is not met 
in this analysis.  A similar analysis will be carried out for the primary safety endpoint.  
Second, a sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy and safety endpoints will be carried out 
using Cox regression. In this analyses, study discontinuation before an event will be treated as 
a censored observation  at the time of dropout. 
17.4 Assessment of Secondary Endpoints 
The main analysis of the secondary endpoints will be carried out using the ITT analysis set. In 
addition to the main ITT analysis, supportive analyses will also be carried out using the AT 
and PP analysis sets.  
Primary patency through 24 months will be compared between treatments  only if both the 
primary safety  and efficacy hypotheses of noninferiority are met. This hierarchical testing 
scheme ensures that the study -wide Type I error rate is 0.025 (one -sided) when the key 
secondary endpoint is tested at one- sided α=0.025.  
The objective is to assess whether the primary patency rate of subjects in the SurVeil DCB 
group is noninferior to that of the IN.PACT DCB group: 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 71 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎: The proportion of subjects with primary patency in the SurVeil DCB group through 24 
months is clinically inferior to that of the IN.PACT DCB group. 
𝑯𝑯𝟏𝟏: The proportion of subjects with primary patency in the SurVeil DCB group through 24 
months is clinically noninferior to that of the IN.PACT DCB group. 
The Farrington and Manning test for noninferiority of proportions at a one -sided significance 
level of α=0.025 will be used to test the hypothesis. The primary patency rate at 24 months, 
along with the 95% confidence intervals of these rates in each group, will be reported. If 
noninferiority is demonstrated for the 24- month patency rates between the SurVeil  DCB  and 
IN.PACT Admiral DCB groups, a test of superiority of the SurVeil DCB compared to the 
IN.PACT Admiral DCB will be conducted. 
In the Medtronic Premarket Approval (PMA) study, the 24- month primary patency rates were 
78.9% and 50.1% in the IN.PACT Admiral DCB and PTA groups,41 respectively, with an 
observed difference of 28.8%. Thus, a noninferiority margin of 15.0% is clinically justified , as 
it preserves ~50% of the treatment effect between DCB and PTA at 2 years.   
Descriptive analysis of the following additional Secondary Endpoint s will be performed, 
comparing the two treatment groups. 
17.4.1 Secondary Endpoints (Acute)  
• Device Success: defined as successful delivery, balloon inflation, deflation and retrieval 
of the intact study device without burst below rated burst pressure, and achievement of 
<50% residual stenosis of the target lesion (by core lab -assessed QA) without flow-
limiting arterial dissection, using only the study device. 
• Technical Success: defined as achievement of a final residual  diameter stenosis of <50% 
without flow- limiting arterial dissection  at the end of the procedure. 
• Procedure Success: defined as evidence of both acute technical success and absence of 
PARC MAEs  (e.g., death, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute onset of limb ischemia, 
index bypass graft or treated segment thrombosis, and or need for urgent/ emergent 
vascular surgery) within 72 hours of the index procedure. 
• Freedom from all -cause death,  major  target  limb amputation  and TVR through 30 days. 
The incidence estimates for each endpoint above wil l be reported along with a 95% c onfidence 
interval for the SurVeil and the IN.PACT Admiral groups. Fisher’s exact test at a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05 will be used to compare the results between the SurVeil and IN.PACT Admiral groups.

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 17.4.2 Secondary Endpo ints (Through 60 Months  Follow- Up) 
In addition to primary patency through 24 months, as listed above, other secondary endpoints 
through follow-up include: 
• Target vessel patency , defined as freedom from clinically -driven TVR and freedom 
from  binary restenosis ( restenosis defined as DUS  PSVR  ≥2.4 or ≥ 50% stenosis as 
assessed by independent angiographic and DUS  core  labs) , within 12 and 24 months ( In 
cases when there is a discrepancy between angiographic and DUS  assessment of 
patency, angiographic asse ssment takes precedence.) 
• Sustained clinical improvement, defined as freedom from major target limb amputation , 
TVR and worsening target limb Rutherford class, within 6, 12, and 24 months 
• Clinically -driven TLR, within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months 
• Histo rical MAEs,  defined as composite of all- cause death, clinically -driven TLR, maj or 
target limb amputation , or thrombosis at the target lesion, within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 
60 months 
• Major target -limb amputation , within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months 
• Thrombosis at the target lesion , within 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months 
The incidence estimates for each endpoint above will be reported along with a 95% 
confidence interval  for the Sur Veil and the IN.PACT Admiral groups at the specified time 
points. Fisher’s exact test at a two -sided significance level of 0.05 will be used to compare 
the incidence of each endpoint between  the SurV eil and IN.PACT Admiral groups at each 
specified time  point. In addition, Kaplan- Meier estimates will be provided at 6 , 12, and 24 
months, unless otherwise indicated: 
• Change in target limb  Rutherford class from baseline to 1, 6, 12, and 24 months 
• Change in target limb PARC class from baseline  to 1, 6, 12, and 24 months 
• Decrease in resting target limb ABI or TBI ≥0.15 from baseline to  6, 12, and 24 months 
• Change in WIQ score from baseline to 1, 12, and 24 months 
• Change in 6- MWT from baseline to 12 and 24 months 
• Change in PA Q from baseline to 1, 12, and 24 months 
Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals) for each of 
the above endpoints will be reported in each treatment group and at the specified time points. 
The differences between the Surveil DCB and the IN.PACT Admiral DCB in the above 
endpoints at the specified time points will be evaluate d using a two-sample t -test or the 
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test  at a two -sided significance level of 0.05.

14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 17.5 Study Populations 
The study will use the following analysis data sets: 
Screen Failure Analysis P opulation 
The Screen Failure analysis set is defined as all subjects  who were enrolled but not randomized.  
Intent ion-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Population 
The ITT analysis set will comprise all subjects who were randomized . Subjects will be 
analyzed according to their randomized group assignment . The ITT analysis set will be used 
for the primary efficacy and safety analyses .  
As Treated (AT) Analysis Populat ion 
The AT analysis set  will include only those subjects treated with either an investigational or 
control device, and the comparison will be based on the actual device used, not the randomized 
assignment. The AT analysis set will be used for sensitivity and supporting analyses for the 
primary safety and efficacy analyses.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP analysis set  is defined as all randomized subjects who were treated with the assigned 
study balloon, who have sufficient follow -up data (at least 335 days of follow -up or 
experienced the primary endpoint) , and who had no major protocol eligibility violations (i.e. 
inclusion/exclusion criteria violations that could impact the primary endpoint). Subjects will 
be compared based on the actual device used. The PP analysis set will be used for sensitivity 
and supporting analyses for the primary safety and efficacy analyses.   
17.6 Subgroup Analysis  
The following s ubgroups will be analyzed, in order to assess for heterogeneity of clinical 
endpoints: 
• Age 
• Smoker s vs. non-smokers 
• Females vs. males  
• Subjects with diabetes  mellitus vs.  subjects without diabetes  mellitus  
• Lesion length ≤90 mm vs. >90 mm in length  
• Calcified  vs. non- calcified lesion s 
• De novo  vs. restenotic lesion s 
• Subjects with bailout stenting vs. subjects without bailout stenting  
The treatment group difference (SurVeil DCB vs . IN.PACT Admiral DCB) in the primary 
endpoint rate and the two- sided 95% confidence interval of the difference will be presented 
within each subgroup. A test of interaction on the primary endpoint will be performed using 
logistic regression models with the effects of subgroup, randomized treatment, and randomized 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 74 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential treatment -by-subgroup interaction to formally assess heterogeneity of treatment effect on the 
primary endpoint across subgroups. An interaction p- value <0.15 will indicate a potential 
differential effect of treatment across the subgroup; the nature of any such effect (e.g., 
quantitative vs. qualitative) will further be investigated by inspecting th e treatment differences 
within the relevant subgroups. The purpose of this analysis is not to formally assess 
noninferiority within each subgroup, but simply to assess consistency of results across the 
various subgroups.  Subjects with an event or with appropriate follow -up will be included in 
this analysis.  
17.7 Poolability of Data Across Sites and Regions (United States vs. Outside the United 
States)   
In evaluating the center treatment effect heterogeneity, centers with 9 or fewer subjects  
randomized  will be combined by geographic region into aggregate sites, not to exceed 20 
subjects per aggregate site. Logistic regression will be employed, with treatment, site, and the interaction of treatment and site as covariates. Statistical significance (0.15 level) of the 
interaction term will indicate that the observed effects are not homogeneous across sites.  
Since the study plans to recruit patients from the U nited S tates as well as from outside the 
United State s, a poolability analysis will be conducted to determine if data from these two 
regions are poolable. For both the primary and safety endpoints, a logistic regression with 
treatment, region ( United States vs. non- United States) and their interaction as covariates will 
be employed. Statistical significance ( 0.15 level) of the interaction term will indicate that the 
observed effects are not homogeneous between the two regions and may potentially negate 
poolability of the two regions for the primary analysis or may require assessment of the endpoint rate adjusting for region variability. In that case, further inspection of the “by-region” primary endpoint rates and possible discussion with the FDA will determine if regions may 
still be pooled for the primary analysis and if adjustment for region variability is required (for 
example, if it is agreed between the s ponsor and the FDA that the statistically significant region 
effect is not clinically meaningful, it is possible that the regions may still be pooled for the primary endpoint analysis, and without adjustment for region variability). 
17.8 Assessment of Adverse Events  
Descriptive statistics will be used to identify the frequencies and 95% confidence intervals of 
AEs in each treatment group. Fisher’s exact tests at a two -sided significance level of 0.05 wil l 
be used to compare the AEs proportions.

deviations on the part of an investigator. 
If suspension or premature termination occurs, the terminating party will justify its decision in 
writing and promptly inform the other parties with whom they are in direct communication.  
If suspension or premature termination occurs: 
• The s ponsor will remain responsible for providing resources to fulfill the 
obligations from this protocol and existing agreements for following the subjects 
enrolled in the clinical investigation, and  
• The site investigator or authorized designee will promptly inform the enrolled 
subjects at his/her investigation site  
If the trial is terminated, Surmod ics must comply with all applicable government regulations 
and the protocol -required subject follow -up. Should discontinuation of the study occur, the 
investigator must return all clinical study materials (including devices) to the Sponsor, and 
provide a w ritten statement to the IRB /EC explaining the reasons for the premature 
termination. All applicable clinical investigation documents shall be subject to the same retention policies, as detailed in Section 15.1. 
19.2 Procedure for Resuming the Clinical Investigation After Temporary S uspension  
When the s ponsor concludes an analysis of the reason(s) for the suspension, implements the 
necessary corrective actions, and decides to lift the temporary suspension, the sponsor will 
inform the relevant parties of the rationale and provide them with the relevant data supporting this decision. 
Concurrence will be obtained from the IRBs/ ECs and, where appropriate, regulatory 
authorities before the clin ical investigation resumes.

BLEEDING  ACADEMIC RESEARCH CONSORTIUM (BARC)1 DEFINITION FOR 
BLEEDING  
Bleeding complications are defined according to the BARC classificati on of bleeding events 
Type 0 : no bleeding 
Type 1 : bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek unscheduled 
performance of studies, hospitalization, or treatment by a  healthcare professional; may include 
episodes leading to self -discontinuation of medical therapy by the patient without consulting a 
healthcare professional Type 2 : any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage (eg, more bleeding than  would be expected 
for a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found by imaging alone) that does not fit the 
criteria for type 3, 4, or 5 but does  meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) requiring 
nonsurgical, medical  intervention by a  healthcare professional, (2) leading to hospitalization 
or increased level of care, or (3) prompting evaluation Type 3  
Type 3a  
Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to <5 g/dL  (provided hemoglobin drop is 
related to bleed)  
Any transfusion with overt bleeding 
Type 3b  
Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop ≥5 g/dL  (provided hemoglobin drop is related to 
bleed)  
Cardiac tamponade  
Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid) 
Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents  
Type 3c  
Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include microbleeds or hemorrhagic 
transformation, does include intraspinal) 
Subcategories confirmed by autopsy or imaging or lumbar puncture 
Intraocular bleed compromising vision 
Type 4 : CABG -related bleeding

Probable fatal bleeding; no autopsy or imaging confirmation but clinically  suspicious 
Type 5b  
Definite fatal bleeding; overt bleeding or autopsy or imaging c onfirmation  
CLINICALLY -DRIVEN TARGET LESION REV ASCULARIZATION 
Clinically -driven TLR is any repeat intervention of the target lesion (plus 10 mm proximal and 
distal to the index device) or surgical bypass of the target lesion  performed due to target lesion 
diameter stenosis ≥50% and either evidence of clinical or functional ischemia (e.g., 
recurrent/progressive life -limiting intermittent claudication, claudication unresponsive to 
medical therapy, critical limb ischemia ) or recurrence of the clinical syndrome for which the 
initial proced ure was performed. If the target lesion  is occluded and bypass is done to another 
artery below the knee, this should be considered TLR. 
CLINICALLY -DRIVEN TARGET VESSEL REV ASCULARIZATION 
Clinically -driven TVR  is any repeat intervention of the target vessel or surgical bypass of the 
target vessel performed due to target vessel diameter stenosis ≥50% and either evidence of 
clinical or functional ischemia (e.g., recurrent/progressive life -limiting intermittent 
claudication, claudication unresponsive to medical therapy, critical limb ischemia ) or 
recurrence of the clinical syndrome for which the initial procedure was performed. If the target 
vessel is occluded and bypass is done to another artery below the knee, this should be 
considered TVR. 
DEATH  
All-cause mortality.  
DEVICE DEFICIENCY (ISO14155:2011) 
Inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety,  or 
performance. This may include malfunctions, use error, or inadequate labeling . 
DEVICE FAILURE  
A device failure occurs when the device is used in compliance with the IFU, but  does not 
perform as described in the IFU and also negatively impacts treatment of the study subject.

purpose when used in accordance with the IFU or clinical study protocol.   
DEVICE SUCCESS  
Successful delivery, balloon inflation, deflation and retrieval of the intact study device without 
burst below rated burst pressure, and achievement of <50% residual stenosis of the target lesion 
(by core lab -assessed quantitative angiography [QA ]) without flow -limiting arterial dissection, 
using only the study device.

material in the antegrade flow.  
Grade E:  Persistent luminal filling defect with delayed run -off of the contrast material 
in the distal lumen.  
Grade F:  Filling defect accompanied by total coronary occlusion. 
EMBOLIC EVENTS OF TARGET  LIMB  
Embolism with concomitant suggestive clinical signs and symptoms, located separate from 
and distal to the target lesion. Classified by probability:  
• Definite: Angiographic evidence of distal embolization with a new intraluminal filling defect and/or abrupt occlusion of a run- off vessel distal to a lesion that is clearly not attributable to 
wire trauma or dissection, irrespective of the time  from the index procedure. 
• Probable: Suggestive clinical signs and symptoms of distal embolization occurring ≤30 days after the index procedure, in the absence of angiographic evidence.

stroke, myocardial infarction, acute onset of limb ischemia, index bypass graft or treated 
segment thrombosis, and or need for urgent/ emergent vascular surgery) within 72 hours of the 
index procedure.  
REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER  
RVD is defined as the average of normal seg ments within 10 mm proximal and distal to the 
target lesion from two orthogonal views using QA.  RESTENOSIS  
Defined as DUS PSVR ≥2.4 or by ≥50% stenosis as assessed by independent angiographic and 
DUS  core labs . PSVR is a ratio of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the lesion relative to the 
PSV of a normal segment in a  proximal reference vessel. The PSVR consequently cannot  be 
calculated in the presence of an abnormal proximal PSV, as can occur in the setting of  inflow 
disease, cardiac disease, or cardiac arrhythmias.  In the presence of abnormal reference PSV, 
the core lab uses the following additional secondary criteria to identify restenosis of the target 
lesion (≥50% in severity): 
• Focal increase in the absolute PSV at the area of visible plaque 
• Post-stenotic turbulence (PST) and/or change in the waveform shape and/or drop in 
velocity distal to the stenosis  
• Review of the B -mode images

SERIOUS ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT  
An ADE that results in any of the consequences characteristic of a SAE is considered a SADE.  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
A SAE is an AE that leads to:  
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 93 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential 1. Death,  
2. Serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in: 
a. Life-threatening illness or injury, or 
b. Permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
c. In-patient hospitalization, or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
d. Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
3. Fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
NOTE 1 : This includes device deficiencies that might have led to an SAE if a) suitable 
action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances 
had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting system. 
NOTE 2 : Planned hospi talization for pre -existing condition, or a procedure required 
by the clinical study plan, without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to 
be an SAE. A planned hospitalization is one that is scheduled prior to the patient signing the informed consent for the study. 
SUSPECTED UNEXPECTED SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTION  
A SUSAR is an AR that is both serious and unexpected. 
TARGET LESION  
A lesion that is to be treated during the index procedure. TARGET LESION REV ASCULARIZATION 
TLR is any repeat intervention of the target lesion (plus 10 mm proximal and distal to the index 
device) or surgical bypass of the target lesion  performed for restenosis or other complication 
involving the target lesion. If the target lesion  is occluded an d bypass is done to another artery 
below the knee, this should be considered TLR. In the assessment of TLR, angiograms should be assessed by the angiographic core laboratory and made available to the clinical endpoints 
committee for review . 
TARGET  LIMB AMP UTATIONS  
All amputations at the target  limb including both above the ankle (Major) amputations and 
below the ankle (Minor) amputations. 
TARGET VESSEL REV ASCULARIZATION 
TVR is any repeat intervention of the target vessel or surgical bypass of the target ves sel 
performed for restenosis or other complication involving the target vessel. If the target vessel 
TRANSCEND Study   Protocol Number: SUR17 -001 
Version  3.3  Page 94 of 95  
14 August 2020 Baim Institute for Clinical Research Confidential is occluded and bypass is done to another artery below the knee, this should be considered 
TVR. In the assessment of TVR, angiograms should be assessed by the angiographic core 
laboratory and made available to the clinical endpoints committee for review . 
TARGET VESSEL   
Superficial femoral and popliteal arteries, defined as the arterial segment from the bifurcation 
between the superficial and profunda femoris  arteries (proximal anatomical landmark) to the 
distal segment of the popliteal artery at the origin of anterior tibial artery (distal anatomical 
landmark). 
TECHNICAL SUCCESS  
Achievement of a final residual  diame ter stenosis of <50% (by core lab -assessed QA) without 
flow-limiting arterial dissection at the end of the procedure. 
THROMBOSIS  
A total occlusion documented by DUS and/or angiography at the treatment site with or without 
symptoms. Thrombosis may be categorized as acute ( <1 day), subacute (1 -30 days) and late 
(>30 days). The presence of thrombus at the target lesion must be noted as an AE in the eCRF. 
UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT  
An UADE is defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s) as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the protocol, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of a subject.  
UNEXPECTED AE 
Any AE that is not consistent in specificity or severity with the current investigator’s 
brochure/protocol, including all amendments, is considered unexpected. 
UNSCHEDULED VISIT  
An unscheduled visit is any visit that is for an index procedure -related AE or for 
revascularization of the target limb.  
USE ERROR An act or omission of an act that results in a different medical device response than intended 
by the manufacturer or expected by the user. (Note 1: Use error includes slips, lapses and 
mistakes. Note 2: An unexpected physiological response of the subject does not in itself

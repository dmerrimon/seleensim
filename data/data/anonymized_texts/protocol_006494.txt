A.Purpose/Objectives 19 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the control system in reducing 20 
hypoglycemia by comparing, in a randomized study, 24 hour control with USS Virginia 21 
versus sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy in subjects with type 1 diabetes and 22 
hypoglycemia unawareness and/ or risk for hypoglycemia. We will also evaluate the 23 
effectiveness of the control system to improve hypoglycemia counterregulation, 24 
hypoglycemia awareness, and overall glycemic control. To achieve this goal, we will 25 
conduct pre- and post-intervention inpatient assessments of hypoglycemia 26 
counterregulation and symptom awareness. Subjects randomized to USS Virginia will 27 
participate in two training visits at a monitored outpatient setting for the step-wise 28 
deployment of the cell phone based on the Artificial Pancreas (AP) system at home. The 29 
first training visit includes training on the study pump and AP system followed by 1 week 30 
use of AP system at home in Pump mode. The second training visit includes additional 31 
training on USS Virginia+AP system and confirmation of independent use by the subject 32 
followed by 4 week use of AP system at home in Closed Loop mode. Subjects 33 
randomized to sensor-augmented pump therapy will complete 5 weeks of CGM with the 34 
home pump. 35 
36 
This protocol will complement our recently completed protocol (IDE G130143) in which 37 
results demonstrate significantly improved glucose control overnight. Additionally, this 38 
protocol represents a culmination of prior clinical trials in the development of this USS 39 
Virginia system and benefits from the synthesis of those components.  40 
41 
The DiAs platform is now licensed to a local startup company, TypeZero Technologies LLC, 42 
which has further locked down its design features and re-implemented the system under the 43 
name inControl, for increased reliability and clear requirements traceability.  44 
45 
B.Study Design Overview 46 
This is a randomized, controlled trial of Unified Safety System (USS) Virginia closed-loop 47 
versus sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy for hypoglycemia prevention in subjects with 48 
type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness and/or risk for hypoglycemia.  49 
Subjects: We will recruit up to 85 subjects aged 12-70 years old with type 1 diabetes 50 
for at least the past 1 year, on insulin for at least the past 1 year, and on insulin pump 51 
therapy for at least the past 6 months to achieve a goal of 44 completed subjects. 52 
Subjects will be recruited at two clinical sites: University of Virginia and Stanford 53 
University.  54 
Procedure:  Figure 1  below presents the overall flow of the study. 55

eligibility (i.e. Average Daily Risk Range [ADRR] >40 or LBGI >2.5 from SMBG data or 60 
LBGI >1.1 from 1 week of CGM data within the prior 3 weeks) and to determine pre-study 61 
CGM use in the prior 4 weeks (active [CGM use ≥5 days/week] or no CGM use). Baseline 62 
HbA1c, hypoglycemia symptom awareness (presence of adrenergic symptoms at BG 60 63 
mg/dL) and hypoglycemia questionnaires (Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness and 64 
Fear of Hypoglycemia – APPENDIX A-5) will be assessed. Those subjects that qualify will 65 
be trained to use the study glucometer and CGM in blinded mode and complete 1 week of 66 
baseline blinded CGM and SMBG at least 4 times daily. 67 
 68 
Visit 2 : Screening 2 Visit. The blinded CGM will be downloaded and if review of the data 69 
shows that the CGM was functional >80% of the time and the subject has confirmed risk of 70 
hypoglycemia with LBGI >1.1 (#2) (per 1 week of blinded CGM), the subject will be 71 
randomized to USS Virginia AP system experimental treatment or Sensor-Augmented Pump 72 
Therapy control treatment and proceed to Visit 3. The experimental and control groups will 73 
be matched for LBGI and pre-study CGM use. The study glucometer will be downloaded 74 
and assessed for average SMBG/day and randomness of data. Subjects with average SMBG 75 
<3.5/day and/or poor randomness of SMBG testing will be reminded of SMBG requirements 76 
4-6 times daily (pre-meal, bedtime, before driving, before exercise, and as indicated). CGM 77 
data collection period may be repeated.  78 
 79 
Visit 3:  8 hr Inpatient Assessment of Hypoglycemia Counterregulation and Symptom 80 
Awareness.  The subjects will undergo hypoglycemia induction via a previously validated 81 
method (1) using subcutaneous insulin pump therapy with frequently sampled YSI glucose 82 
levels. Hypoglycemia counterregulation and symptoms will be assessed by epinephrine 83 
levels and hypoglycemia symptom scoring as the BG is decreased from 100-150 mg/dL to 84 
<60 mg/dL. Subjects will be trained on the Dexcom Share AP CGM and either proceed to 85 
Visit 4 if randomized to the experimental group or 5 weeks of CGM and home pump use if 86 
randomized to the control group. 87 
 88 
Visit 4: Study Pump & AP System  Training.  Subjects in the USS Virginia group will 89 
present to the monitored outpatient setting to complete a training session including study 90 
pump training and AP system training. Subjects will be provide a copy of the AP system 91 
manual. Subjects will then use AP system at home in Pump mode, connected to the study 92 
CGM and study pump. During this week, study staff will contact the subject daily to answer 93 
any questions and enquire about any device complaints, adverse events, and whether the 94 
adverse event was related to AP system use. Study staff will also check the number of 95 
SMBG tests entered on the AP system and will remind the subject to perform 4-6 SMBG 96 
daily. The ability of AP system to be remotely monitored in the subject’s daily environment 97 
will also be assessed with daily checks of the remote monitoring site. After completion of 1 98 
week of AP Pump mode home use, study staff will determine whether additional training 99 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 4 
   
 
and practice with the AP system is needed and whether the subject will repeat all or portions 100 
of Visit 4 and 1 week of home use (up to 1 time if needed) or proceed to Visit 5. Subject’s 101 
that cannot be adequately monitored at least 75% of the time in their local environment will 102 
not be allowed to proceed. 103 
 104 
Visit 5: USS Virginia Training.  Visit 5 may occur remotely via GoToMeeting or similar 105 
HIPAA compliant web conferencing.  This visit may also occur with visit 4 as determined 106 
by the study team. Subjects in the USS Virginia group will present to the monitored 107 
outpatient setting to complete a training sess ion including an initial AP system closed-loop 108 
training followed by independent use of the system and completion of the AP Training 109 
Checklist. The study team will be immediately available as needed. Subjects will then use 110 
the AP system at home in Closed Loop mode, connected to the study CGM and study pump.  111 
 112 
There will be an initial 3-5 day trial of the system at home in Closed Loop mode during 113 
which, the subject will receive daily contact from study staff and remote monitoring 114 
automated alerts will be in place. Study staff will also check the number of SMBG tests 115 
entered on the AP system and will remind the subject to perform 4-6 SMBG daily. Study 116 
staff will then determine whether additional training and practice is needed and whether the 117 
subject will repeat all or portions of Visit 5 and 3-5 days of the AP system home use (up to 1 118 
time) or proceed with the remainder of the 4 weeks of the system Closed Loop home use. 119 
During the 4 weeks of home use, study staff will continue to contact the subject (daily for 120 
the first 5 days, then weekly) to answer any questions and enquire about any device 121 
complaints, adverse events, and whether the adverse event was related to the AP system use. 122 
Study staff will check the number of SMBG entered on the AP system daily and contact the 123 
subject if <4 SMBG are observed on any day. The subject’s CGM data and meter data will 124 
be collected at week 2 and week 4. Subjects will be required to have average SMBG 125 
>4.5/day and random SMBG data to continue. 126 
 127 
Visit 6: 8 hr Inpatient Assessment of Hypoglycemia Counterregulation and Symptom 128 
Awareness.  Within approximately one week of completing either USS Virginia or sensor- 129 
augmented pump therapy at home, the subjects will undergo a final hypoglycemia induction 130 
using the home pump therapy with frequently sampled YSI glucose levels. Hypoglycemia 131 
counterregulation and symptoms will be assessed by epinephrine levels and hypoglycemia 132 
symptom scoring as the BG is decreased from 100-150 mg/dL to <60 mg/dL. Post- 133 
intervention HbA1c, and hypoglycemia questionnaires, and a DiAs Usability questionnaire 134 
(DiAs users only) will be completed. If a subject completes more than 1 week of either USS 135 
Virginia or sensor-augmented pump therapy and subsequently withdraws from the study 136 
intervention, they will be asked to complete Visit 6 within one week of discontinuing the 137 
intervention. 138 
C. Pilot subjects 139 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 5 
   
 
Each site will study two initial Pilot subjects: one aged 21-65 years old and one aged 15-20 140 
years old. The Pilot subjects and their respective diabetes care partners will be used to test 141 
the adequacy of the AP system training period and the system performance (in Pump mode) 142 
in the subject’s local environment. If significant changes are made to the system or to the 143 
protocol after the Pilot subjects or the AP system did not meet success criteria in the local 144 
environment, an additional two Pilot subjects (one aged 21-70 years old and one aged 12-20 145 
years old) will be studied at each site. Pilot subjects may be repeated as necessary until no 146 
further changes are needed. Those sites that have already used the identical closed-loop 147 
system (phone, pump, sensor, MAF version of AP system) in two subjects at home for at 148 
least 1 week (336 hours) each do not need to complete the Pilot subjects as the system has 149 
already been tested in the home environment.  150 
  151 
Pilot subjects will participate in Visit 1 (Consent and Screening). The study inclusion and 152 
exclusion criteria will apply to the Pilot subjects with the following exceptions: 1) the Pilot 153 
subjects will not have a significant risk of hypoglycemia (as assessed by LBGI <1.1 and 154 
ADRR <20 from the prior 30 days of meter data), and 2) the Pilot subjects will not have 155 
hypoglycemia unawareness (as assessed by a Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness 156 
score of 2 or less). If the Pilot subject is CGM-naïve,  s/he may be trained on the study 157 
glucometer and study CGM and wear an unblinded CGM for up to a week at home at the 158 
discretion of the investigator. Prior CGM wearers may skip the home CGM use if they have 159 
previously been trained on the study CGM. Within 4 weeks of Visit 1, the Pilot subjects will 160 
proceed directly to Visit 4 (Study Pump and AP Training) with a subsequent 5 days o f the  161 
AP system use in Pump mode in the subject’s local environment and with remote 162 
monitoring and automated notifications in place. The Pilot subjects will receive daily contact 163 
by the study team and the remote monitoring site will be checked daily. Success of the Pilot 164 
subjects will be determined by >80% time of functional system components including: 165 
CGM, pump, AP system, connectivity with the CGM, and AP system connectivity with the 166 
pump. There will also need to be remote monitoring capability at least 75% of the time. 167 
 168 
After the Pilot subjects at each site have successfully completed Visit 4 and 5 days of use at 169 
home in Pump mode, study enrollment and randomization may proceed at each site. The 170 
data from the Pilot subjects will not be used in the final analysis. Pilot subjects will not be 171 
counted in the enrollment tally. 172 
D. Sample Size a nd Investigational Sites 173 
The studies will be conducted at University of Virginia and Stanford and will require IRB 174 
approval at each site prior to the initiation of the trial.  175 
 176 
At the University of Virginia, all inpatient studies (Visit 3 and Visit 6) will be performed at 177 
the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) of the University of Virginia Health System with website 178

The monitored outpatient studies (Visit 4 and Visit 5) will occur at a UVa CRU. 185 
 186 
At Stanford, all inpatient studies (Visit 3 and Visit 6) will be performed at The Stanford 187 
Center for Clinical and Translational Research and Education (CTRU) with website at: 188

 190 
The monitored outpatient studies (Visit 4 and Visit 5) will in 3 rooms available for 191 
outpatient research studies through “ACCESS”, a clinical research resource available at 192 
Stanford. These rooms are available in the same building as the Endocrine Division and are 193 
adjacent to the CTRU. 194 
 195 
Forty-four subjects (N=44) with type 1 diabetes mellitus will be needed to complete the 196 
protocol.  197 
 198 
Based on our experience with similar studies and the additional requirement of 199 
hypoglycemia unawareness or risk for hypoglycemia, we estimate an expected ~40% screen 200 
failures, dropouts, or withdrawals, thus we intend to set a recruiting target of 70 subjects.  201 
 202 
Hypothesis:   203 
We hypothesize that in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and a risk for 204 
hypoglycemia, the AP system equipped with USS Virginia compared with CGM-augmented 205 
pump therapy will result in: 206 
1. Reduced risk for hypoglycemia and exposure to hypoglycemia (measured by the 207 
Low Blood Glucose Index and by CGM time in hypoglycemia).   208 
2. Restoration of hypoglycemia counterregulation (as assessed by epinephrine 209 
response measured in a hospital setting), restoration of hypoglycemia awareness, 210 
and reduced fear of hypoglycemia. 211 
 212 
Primary Specific Aim:   213 
Reduction in hypoglycemia during the study on USS Virginia versus SAP as assessed by: 214 
 LBGI from CGM during 1 week of baseline blinded use versus during the last week 215 
of intervention. 216 
 217 
Secondary Specific Aims: 218 
Reduction in hypoglycemia during the study on USS Virginia versus SAP as assessed by: 219 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 7 
   
 
 CGM time <70 mg/dL and <50 mg/dL by retrofitted CGM and SMBG trace during a 220 
24 hour period and the overnight period (11PM – 7AM) from 1 week of baseline 221 
blinded use versus the last week of intervention. 222 
 223 
Improvement in counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia at baseline versus follow-up as 224 
assessed by: 225 
 Peak epinephrine 226 
 Epinephrine area under the curve (AUC) 227 
 Epinephrine increase over baseline 228 
 229 
Improvement in hypoglycemia awareness at baseline versus follow-up as assessed by: 230 
 Hypoglycemia symptom ratings  231 
 Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness and Fear of Hypoglycemia scores  232 
 233 
Improvement in glycemic control at baseline versus the last week of intervention as assessed 234 
by: 235 
 Time within target (70-180 mg/dL) over a 24 hour period. 236 
 Time within target (80 -140 mg/dL) in the overnight period (11PM –  7AM) 237 
 Distribution of wake-up glucose levels at 7AM 238 
 239 
Sample size determination is based on literature data (#3) and on results from our previous 240 
studies of hypoglycemia unawareness (#4) Error! Reference source not found. . We 241 
estimate, conservatively, that the effect size of using the AP system+USS Virginia vs. CGM 242 
in terms of restoration of epinephrine response will be moderate ~0.35. Power calculations 243 
assuming =0.05, and power of 80% yield a required sample size of N=36 (using G*Power 244 
3 software [#5 ]). With this sample size, the power for finding significant effects on 245 
frequency and extent of hypoglycemia (Low BG Index [#6]) exceeds 0.9. Assuming a 246 
proportion of noncompliance R=20% for Intention- to-Treat (ITT) analysis (#7), 44 247 
completed subjects will adequately address the specific aims of this study. Per-protocol 248 
analysis will also be performed. In order to achieve 44 completed subjects, up to 70 subjects 249 
may sign consent given an expected screen failure, withdrawal and drop-out rate of ~40% 250 
due to the rigorous exclusion criteria and requirements imposed for the AP system use in the 251 
subject’s local environment. 252 
E. Study Duration 253 
Subject participation will last roughly 7-14  weeks depending on whether Visit 4 and/or Visit 254 
5 and the subsequent home use portions of the study need to be repeated as per Figure 1 255 
above. This includes: 1 day screening visit, 1 week baseline blinded CGM use, 1 day 256 
eligibility assessment and randomization visit, 1 day inpatient assessment of hypoglycemia 257 
counterregulation and symptom awareness, then either 5 weeks of sensor augmented pump 258 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 8 
   
 
therapy at home or the AP system+USS Virginia training and use at home. The AP system 259 
+USS Virginia training and use includes : 1 da y outpatient study pump and the AP system 260 
training, 1 week use of the system at home in Pump mode, 1 day outpatient AP system 261 
+USS Virginia training and 4 weeks use of the AP system +USS Virginia at home. Each 262 
group will additionally complete a final 1 day inpatient assessment of hypoglycemia 263 
counterregulation and symptom awareness. Up to 14 days are able to be repeated in the 264 
scheme above, up to 4 weeks may elapse between Visit 1 and Visit 3, and up to 1 week may 265 
elapse between completion of the study intervention and Visit 6. 266 
 267 
Participation for the Pilot subjects will last up to 6 weeks including: 1 day screening visit, 0- 268 
1 week use of study CGM at home,1 day outpatient study pump and AP training, and 5 day 269 
use of the AP system at home in Pump mode. Up to 4 weeks may elapse between the 270 
screening and the AP training visit.  271

 P referred foods for the subject’s self-treatment of hypoglycemia will be 457 
documented to have available in the monitored research setting. 458 
 459 
Subjects travelling from a distance or subjects wishing to be pre-screened for 460 
eligibility (e.g. review of meter download, assessment for presence of 461 
hypoglycemia unawareness, labs performed locally, etc.) may elect to have 462 
the consent +/- assent (50.53) read and explained by study staff by phone. 463 
Once all questions have been answered, the signed consent +/ -  assent will be 464 
faxed or mailed to study personnel and the subject may then have pre- 465 
screening with labs performed locally (e.g. LabCorp) prior to Visit 1. The 466 
consent +/ -  assent form will be reviewed again with the subject +/- parents at 467 
Visit 1. 468 
 469 
Once all results of the screening evaluations are available, a decision will be made to 470 
determine the subject eligibility for the study.  The study physician will have the 471 
discretion to repeat screening tests. The repeat screening tests may be conducted 472 
locally (e.g. LabCorp). The subject may request a copy of any of the results from the 473 
screening evaluation to review with their primary care provider. 474 
 If an exclusionary condition is identified, the study subject will be 475 
excluded from participation with follow up and referral to their 476 
primary care physician as needed.  477 
 If the study subject is pregnant, the study physician will discuss the 478 
results of the blood test with the subject and the subject will be asked 479 
to seek confirmation of the test and the appropriate medical care.  480 
 If an abnormal hematocrit is detected, the patient may have the 481 
hematocrit re-tested to exclude the possibility of lab error or 482 
hydration effects. If anemia is confirmed on repeat testing, the study 483 
subject will be excluded. A copy of the result will be provided and 484 
the subject will be advised to discuss the result with the personal 485 
physician for further evaluation and treatment.  486 
 Subjects may be re-screened at a later date if their clinical situation 487 
changes as determined by the study physician. Subjects that stopped 488 
study participation due to need for oral glucocorticoids (e.g. bout of 489 
poison ivy) may be re-screened and re-enrolled after there is no 490 
further anticipated need for oral glucocorticoids. 491 
 492 
The total amount of blood to be withdrawn during the screening visit is up to 493 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 14 
   
 
25 cc. If a subject meets all the study criteria, s/he will be enrolled in the trial 494 
and trained on the study glucometer and Dexcom CGM.  495 
 496 
Study Glucometer and Dexcom CGM Training: 497 
 The subj ect will be t rained on the use of the study glucometer and will 498 
demonstrate prof ic iency with a fingerstick test.  499 
 Subjects will be reminded to use the same study glucometer for all 500 
finger sticks and calibrations.   501 
 The subject will be trained on Dexcom CGM use and will be sup erv ised 502 
during the initial CGM sensor place m ent.  503 
 If the participant is a Pilot subject, s/he will use the CGM for up to 1 504 
week (unblinded) at home and will be reminded to base all treatment 505 
decisions on glucometer results, not CGM data. 506 
 For non-Pilot subjects, once the initial calibration BG is entered and 507 
the Dexcom is confirmed to be functional, the CGM will be placed in 508 
blinded mode for 1 week use of blinded CGM at home. 509 
 If the participant experiences a sensor fa ilure or issue with the CGM 510 
device while at home, the subj ect will contact th e study team. Th e 511 
subject will replace the sensor at home with guidance from the study 512 
team if appropriate or return to th e office and the study t eam will 513 
replace the sensor or device. 514 
 Subjects will be required to perform 4 -6 SMBG measurements daily 515 
(recommended before meals, about 2 hours after meals and at 516 
bedtime), and as needed to calibrate the CGM.  Additional 517 
fingersticks may be obtained, if desired.  518 
 If a subject is a CGM-wearer at screening, the subject may continue to 519 
use the home CGM during blinded study CGM use. 520 
 521 
The screening visit and training session will last approximately 3 hours. This 522 
may be shorter depending on the amount of pre-screening that was performed 523 
and the subject’s prior knowledge of study devices.  524 
 525 
If the subject cannot schedule Visit 3 within 4 weeks of screening, the 526 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be re-evaluated. The study physician will 527 
have the discretion to repeat any test as needed. 528 
 529 
2. Visit 2: Screening 2 Visit  530 
After completion of 1 week of baseline blinded CGM use, the subject will return to have the 531 
Dexcom CGM and study glucometer downloaded to assess the subject’s baseline risk for 532 
hypoglycemia and evaluate the reliability of CGM data collection. The meter data will be 533 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 15 
   
 
assessed for average SMBG/day and randomness of data. Subjects with average SMBG 534 
<3.5/day and/or poor randomness of SMBG testing will be reminded of SMBG requirements 535 
4-6 times daily (pre-meal, bedtime, before driving, before exercise, and as indicated ). 536 
 537 
In order to continue with the trial, the subject must have all of the following: 538 
 B aseline LBGI >1.1 as assessed by the prior 1 week of blinded CGM data   539 
 C GM must have been functional >80% of the time (i.e. >1600 CGM data 540 
points/week).  541 
 542 
CGM data collection period may be repeated. Eligible subjects will be scheduled for 543 
Visit 3 within 3 weeks of Visit 2. Subjects will be randomized to experimental 544 
treatment with the AP system+USS Virginia or control treatment with sensor- 545 
augmented pump therapy. Groups will be matched for LBGI and pre-study CGM 546 
use.   547 
 548 
Preparation for Visit 3: 549 
 All subjects will be given written instructions to bring their pump supplies, 550 
glucometer supplies, CGM supplies, insulin and all of their current 551 
medications (including aspirin or regular analgesics) with them for use during 552 
the admission.  553 
 These instructions will also advise the subject to contact the study team in the 554 
event of a febrile or vomiting illness within 24 hours of the admission, so that 555 
the admission can be rescheduled.  556 
 The subject will be asked to avoid the need for a pump site change during Visit 557 
3. 558 
 The subjects will be asked to arrive at the unit fasting and to not consume 559 
caffeine on the morning of admission.  560 
 Subjects will be asked to check a fingerstick BG at 03:00 and 06:00 on the 561 
morning of admission for Visit 3 and to aim for a steady BG between 100-150 562 
mg/dL upon arrival to the research unit at 07:00.  563 
 The subject may administer a correction bolus of insulin to stabilize BG or treat 564 
hyperglycemia. 565 
 The subject may consume fast acting glucose (glucose tablets, gel or liquid) to 566 
stabilize BG or treat BG <100 mg/dL. 567 
 568 
Visit 2 is anticipated to last approximately 30 minutes.  569

Visit 3 will occur within 4 weeks of the Screening Visit (Visit 1). 574 
 575 
Admission Overview: 576 
The subject will be admitted to the research unit by 07:00 for a blinded assessment of 577 
hypoglycemia counterregulation and symptom awareness. After a Run-in Period for 578 
stabilization of the subject’s BG in the ~100-150 mg/dL range, the subject will 579 
participate in a previously validated Hypoglycemia Induction (#1) where the home 580 
insulin pump therapy will be used to induce an episode of hypoglycemia with goal 581 
glucose of <60 mg/dL. After carbohydrate rescue to BG ≥80 mg/dL, the subject will 582 
receive a meal and will be monitored for at least an additional hour in the Recovery 583 
Period. The subject may then be discharged once the glucose is stable (i.e. at least 584 
the prior 2 values) between 100-300 mg/dL and fingerstick ketone level <0.6 585 
mmol/L . The subject will additionally receive training on the Dexcom CGM as 586 
needed and will receive supplies and instructions to complete the next portion of the 587 
study. The specific details of the ~8 hour inpatient admission are provided below. 588 
 589 
Clinical Research Unit (CRU) Procedures: 590 
 A  nurse will be at the bedside or on the unit throughout the study. 591 
 S tudy staff (MD or NP who has experience in diabetes management) will 592 
also be immediately available at the  bedside or on the unit throughout the 593 
entire study. 594 
 595 
Blood Sampling and Hypoglycemia Symptom Questionnaires 596 
 T he clinical centers will either use reinfusion of blood or will discard blood 597 
with each blood draw depending on the standard practice at each center’s 598 
Clinical Research Unit.  599 
 S ubjects and parents (or diabetes care partners) will be blinded to the results 600 
of the glucose testing until the Recovery Period in an attempt to eliminate 601 
bias when answering questions regarding symptoms of hypoglycemia. 602 
 O nce IV access has been established, blood will be sampled for YSI glucose 603 
every 5-30 minutes. The frequency of blood draws for YSI sampling is 604 
dependent on the value of the previous sample, according to the following 605 
ranges: 606 
o B G >200: every 30 minutes 607 
o B G >100-200: every 15 minutes 608 
o B G ≤100  mg/dL:  every 5 minutes 609 
 B lood may be sampled for YSI glucose as needed for patient safety or to 610 
recheck a suspected erroneous value (e.g. dilute sample). 611 
 B lood will be sampled for epinephrine and glucagon and Hypoglycemia 612 
Symptom Questionnaires will be performed during the admission as follows: 613 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 17 
   
 
o Run -in Period:   614 
 Blood will be sampled for epinephrine at the initial sampling 615 
time for YSI glucose after the IV access is established. 616 
 Once BG is between 100 to 150 mg/dL, baseline 617 
Hypoglycemia Symptom Questionnaires will be completed 618 
and blood will be sampled for epinephrine and glucagon at the 619 
next scheduled sampling time for YSI glucose.  620 
o Hyp oglycemia Induction Period:   621 
 Blood will be sampled for epinephrine approximately every 15 622 
minutes once the blood glucose has decreased to ≤90 mg/dL 623 
with goal of epinephrine sampling at BGs of 90, 75 , 60 and 624 
<60 mg/dL. 625 
 Blood will be sampled for glucagon when the blood glucose is 626 
<60 mg/dL, just prior to the administration of hypoglycemia 627 
rescue therapy. 628 
 A Hypoglycemia Symptom Questionnaire will be completed 629 
approximately every 15 minutes once the blood glucose has 630 
decreased to ≤90 mg/dL (any time blood is sampled for 631 
epinephrine) until hypoglycemia BG <60 mg/dL and recovery 632 
BG ≥80 mg/dL has been achieved. 633 
o Re covery Period:   634 
 Blood will be sampled for epinephrine every 15 minutes for a 635 
total of 4 samples after the nadir blood glucose. 636 
 T he actual time (rounded to the nearest minute) of all blood draws and 637 
questionnaires per the study clock set to an atomic clock will be documented 638 
on the nursing flow sheet. 639 
 T here will be about 31 blood draws for glucose sampling during the 640 
admission. Approximately 1 cc discard (at discard centers) and 1 cc sample 641 
will be taken for each blood draw for glucose. There will additionally be 642 
about 11 blood draws for epinephrine in duplicate (2 cc total per epinephrine 643 
draw) and 2 blood draws for glucagon in duplicate (2 cc total per glucagon 644 
draw). Therefore, the anticipated blood drawn for the entire admission will be 645 
about 88 cc a t centers using a discard technique and 57 cc at centers using 646 
blood -sparing procedures. 647 
 F or subjects ≥18 years old, the total blood drawn in the entire study will not 648 
exceed 400 cc. 649 
 F or subjects <18 years old, the maximum allowed volume will be determined 650 
by subject’s weight. A maximum of 4 ml/kg may be drawn within 30 days 651 
and a maximum of 7 ml/kg may be drawn in an 8 week period. 652 
 653 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 18 
   
 
YSI Instructions  654 
 O nce IV access has been established, blood will be sampled for YSI glucose 655 
every 5-30 minutes. The frequency of blood draws for YSI sampling is 656 
dependent on the value of the previous sample, according to the following 657 
ranges: 658 
o B G >200: every 30 minutes 659 
o B G >100-200: every 15 minutes 660 
o B G ≤100  mg/dL:  every 5 minutes 661 
 B lood may be sampled for YSI glucose as needed for patient safety or to 662 
recheck a suspected erroneous value (e.g. dilute sample). 663 
 In the  event of loss of IV access or loss of a functional YSI and need for 664 
continued subject monitoring, glucose measurements will be made on 665 
capillary whole blood using the study glucometer.  666 
 667 
IV Access  668 
 D uring the CRC portion of the study, intravenous access will be maintained 669 
for blood sampling and for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia or 670 
hyperglycemia during the study. If an IV fails, a new IV will be inserted.  671 
 If  there is failure of intravenous access, the study physician will be available 672 
at the bedside to make decisions about appropriate insulin and glucose 673 
adjustments. Fingerstick glucose measurements on the study glucometer may 674 
be used during times of inadequate IV access and need for glucose 675 
monitoring.  676 
 677 
Heating Device  678 
 T o facilitate IV insertion and blood drawing, and to obtain arterialized blood 679 
samples, heat may be applied to the subject’s arm using a hospital-approved 680 
Gaymar T/pump (Gaymar Industries, Inc., Orchard Park, NY).  681 
 682 
β-Hydroxybutyrate Testing  683 
 S ubject blood ketones should be evaluated from capillary blood using the 684 
ketone meter at the following times: 685 
o O n arrival to and at discharge from the clinic 686 
o G lucose ≥250 mg/dL every 60 minutes 687 
o K etones  ≥0.6 mmol/L every 60 minutes 688 
o N ausea, vomiting or abdominal pain regardless of glucose level 689 
o A  subject will be observed in the clinic until the ketone level is <0.6 690 
mmol/L 691 
 692 
Capillary Glucose Testing  693 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 19 
   
 
 In the  event of loss of IV access or loss of functional YSI, glucose 694 
measurements may be taken from fingersticks using the study glucometer. 695 
Fingersticks will be performed approximately every 30 minutes when the 696 
glucose level is >80 mg/dL and approximately every 15 minutes when the 697 
glucose level is ≤80 mg/dL. Additional fingersticks may be taken as needed 698 
for patient safety. 699 
 700 
Inpatient Hypoglycemia Treatment 701 
 G lucose <60 mg/dL will be treated orally with fast acting carbohydrate as 702 
needed until a glucose level of ≥80 mg/dL is achieved.  703 
 In the  event that there is intravenous access and the subject is at risk for 704 
severe hypoglycemia, the subject will be treated with a ~2-3 mL/kg D10 705 
intravenous glucose bolus. Risk for severe hypoglycemia is defined as any of 706 
the following situations: 707 
o G lucose <50 mg/dL 708 
o T he subject is unable to cooperate with oral treatment of 709 
hypoglycemia 710 
o T he glucose is dropping at a rate that may not respond adequately to 711 
oral treatment 712 
o T he subject experiences symptoms of neuroglycopenia (e.g. lethargy, 713 
disorientation, confusion [disordered processing of information or 714 
communication], or inappropriate behavior)  715 
o T he subject experiences symptoms of severe hypoglycemia (i.e. 716 
hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness)  717 
 In the  event that there is NO intravenous access and the subject is at risk for 718 
severe hypoglycemia (as defined above), the subject will be treated with 1 mg 719 
of glucagon subcutaneously or intramuscularly.  720 
o T he drug will be reconstituted and administered per package 721 
insert/instructions.  722 
o G lucagon may be repeated as needed every 20 minutes to achieve 723 
glucose level ≥80 mg/dL. Once the subject is able to consume oral 724 
treatment, the subject will be treated orally with fast acting 725 
carbohydrate as needed until a glucose level of ≥80 mg/dL is 726 
achieved. Orange juice and milk will be avoided after glucagon 727 
administration.  728 
o A ttempts will be made to reestablish intravenous access.  729 
 T he Hypoglycemia Induction Admission will be stopped if the subject 730 
experiences a hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness and only safety 731 
procedures will be continued. The study physician or nurse practitioner will 732 
take control over glucose sampling decisions in order to stabilize the 733 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 20 
   
 
subject’s glucose between 100-300 mg/dL and determine the appropriate 734 
subject disposition (i.e. home or medical facility).  735 
 736 
Inpatient Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment 737 
 If  the subject’s glucose is >300 mg/dL or β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 738 
mmol/L on admission, the subject will be stabilized per the procedures 739 
below. The subject will continue to be monitored until a glucose level 740 
between 100-300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate measurement <0.6 mmol/L 741 
has been achieved (or the subject is discharged to an appropriate medical 742 
team).  743 
 S ubsequently, glucose >300 mg/dL fo r > 2 hours or glucose ≥400 mg/dL at 744 
any time will prompt discontinuation of the Hypoglycemia Induction 745 
Admission. 746 
 β –hydroxybutyrate will be assessed hourly while the glucose is ≥250 mg/dl 747 
or the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 mmol/L.  748 
 If  the glucose is >300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate level is <0.6 mmol/L, 749 
corrective action will be taken only after it has been at least 90 minutes from 750 
the last subcutaneous insulin dose. Specifically, the subject will be asked to 751 
bolus with his/her pump an amount of corrective insulin that will bring 752 
him/her to a target glucose of 120 mg/dL. 753 
 If  the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 mmol/L, the cause of the elevated 754 
ketone level will be investigated (e.g. pump or pump site malfunction). 755 
Additional insulin may be administered either via insulin syringe or via a new 756 
pump site. The amount of insulin administered will be calculated using the 757 
subject’s insulin sensitivity factor and a target glucose of 120 mg/dL.   758 
 If  the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥1.5 mmol/L, the Hypoglycemia Induction 759 
Admission will be stopped and the study MD or NP will take control of th e 760 
subject's insulin dosing. The cause of the elevated ketone level will be 761 
investigated (e.g. pump or pump site malfunction). If the subject's home 762 
parameters are not felt to be working adequately due to hyperglycemia, 763 
ketonemia, or other factors (e.g. intercurrent illness), the study MD or NP 764 
will administer corrective insulin either via insulin syringe or via a new pump 765 
site using an ISF determined to be appropriate for the setting and a goal 766 
glucose of 120 mg/dL. The subject will continue to be monitored until a 767 
glucose level between 100-300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate measurement 768 
<0.6 mmol/L has been achieved (or the subject is discharged to an 769 
appropriate medical team).  770 
 771 
Acceptable Medications 772 
 T he subject may continue any home medications including his/her home 773 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 21 
   
 
over-the-counter or prescribed analgesics as long as the medication is not on 774 
the list of restricted drugs and the subject brought his/her own supply. The 775 
patient may use his/her own ibuprofen or aspirin per package labeling. 776

completed. 854 
o S ubjects and parents (or diabetes care partners) will be blinded to the 855 
results of the glucose testing until the Recovery Period in an attempt 856 
to eliminate bias when answering questions regarding symptoms of 857 
hypoglycemia. 858 
 859 
 P rocedures Related to the Run-in Period: 860 
o T he Run-in Period will nominally occur from 07:30-08:00. 861 
o T he goal of the Run-in Period is to reach a target glucose of 100-150 862 
mg/dL.  863 
o O nce IV access has been established, blood will be sampled for YSI 864 
glucose every 5-30 minutes per the Blood Sampling guidelines above.  865 
o B lood will be sampled for epinephrine at the initial sampling time for 866 
YSI glucose. 867 
o F ast acting carbohydrates may be used to stabilize the glucose or treat 868 
BG <100 mg/dL at any time during the Run-in Period.  869 
o F or glucose >150 mg/dL, correction boluses may be administered 870 
with the home pump up to every 90 minutes for a maximum of 2 871 
correction boluses. The amount of insulin administered will be 872 
calculated using the subject’s insulin sensitivity factor and a target 873 
glucose of 120 mg/dL.   874 
o O nce BG is between 100 to 150 mg/dL, baseline Hypoglycemia 875 
Symptom Questionnaires will be completed and blood will be 876 
sampled for epinephrine and glucagon at the next scheduled sampling 877 
time for YSI glucose.  878 
o T he Run-in Period may be extended until 11:00 to ensure that it has 879 
been at least 90 minutes since the last correction bolus, at least 60 880 
minutes since the last glucose <70 mg/dL, and at least 30 minutes 881 
since the last carbohydrate treatment. The subject may enter the 882 
Hypoglycemia Induction Period once these criteria are met and 883 
glucose is 100-150 mg/dL. If  these criteria are not attained by 11:00, 884 
the subject will be rescheduled. The subject MD or NP will take 885 
control of the glucose sampling and insulin management and the 886 
subject will continue to be monitored until a glucose level of 100-300 887 
mg/dL is attained prior to discharge. 888 
 889 
 P rocedures Related to Hypoglycemia Induction Period: 890 
o T he Hypoglycemia Induction Period is anticipated to last 891 
approximately 2-4 hours (~08:00-12:00). If the subject has not 892 
reached the endpoint (<60 mg/dL) within ~4 hours, the subject will 893 
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 24 
   
 
proceed to the Preparation for Discharge Period at the discretion of 894 
the investigator.  895 
o A t the start of the hypoglycemia induction, the basal insulin rate will 896 
be increased by approximately 25-50% to provide a gradual decline in 897 
blood glucose (~1 mg/dL/min). A small priming bolus dose of insulin 898 
equal to approximately one hour of the subject’s usual basal dose +/- 899 
correction dose with goal 120 mg/dL may also be given at the 900 
discretion of the investigator (e.g. trend upward) in addition to the 25- 901 
50% increase in the basal insulin. 902 
o T he basal insulin rate may be increased approximately hourly and 903 
additional bolus insulin doses may be given as described above at the 904 
discretion of the investigator in order to get a gradual decline in the 905 
glucose concentration (decline rate of ~1 mg/dL/min). 906 
o B lood will be sampled for YSI glucose every 5-30 minutes per the 907 
Blood Sampling guidelines above. 908 
o B lood will be sampled for epinephrine approximately every 15 909 
minutes once the blood glucose has decreased to ≤90 mg/dL with goal 910 
of epinephrine sampling at BGs of 90, 75 , 60 and <60 mg/dL. 911 
o B lood will be sampled for glucagon when BG <60 mg/dL, just prior 912 
to hypoglycemia rescue therapy. 913 
o A  Hypoglycemia Symptom Questionnaire will be completed 914 
approximately every 15 minutes once the blood glucose has decreased 915 
to ≤90 mg/dL (any time blood is sampled for epinephrine) and until 916 
hypoglycemia BG <60 mg/dL and recovery BG ≥80 mg/dL has been 917 
achieved. 918 
o O nce the study endpoint is reached (the first time YSI glucose is <60 919 
mg/dL), the pump will be stopped and the subject will be treated with 920 
oral fast acting carbohydrates (preferred), a 2-3 mL/kg D10 921 
intravenous glucose bolus (for BG <50 or risk of severe 922 
hypoglycemia with IV access), or a glucagon emergency kit (for 923 
severe hypoglycemia with NO IV access) per the Inpatient 924 
Hypoglycemia Treatment guidelines above to achieve a recovery 925 
glucose ≥80 mg/dL.  926 
o O nce a recovery glucose of ≥80 mg/dL is achieved, the subject will 927 
resume pump therapy with the normal basal rate and will proceed to 928 
the Recovery Period.  929 
 930 
 P rocedures Related to the Recovery Period: 931 
o O nce the procedures related to the Hypoglycemia Induction Period 932 
are complete and the subject’s glucose is ≥80 mg/dl, the subject will 933

Period.  935 
o T he meal carbohydrates will be estimated by the subject and the meal 936 
will be covered with insulin via the subject’s pump based on the 937 
subject’s individual carbohydrate ratio and insulin sensitivity factor 938 
parameters and a glucose goal of 120 mg/dL or the subject’s home 939 
glucose goal, whichever is higher. The subject may use the YSI 940 
glucose information and the insulin dosing chosen will be discussed 941 
with the study physician prior to administration. The amount of 942 
insulin given and time of administration will be documented.  943 
o D uring the 1-hour Recovery Period, blood will be sampled for YSI 944 
glucose every 5-30 minutes per the Blood Sampling guidelines above. 945 
o B lood wil l also be sampled for epinephrine every 1 5 minutes x 4 946 
samples after the nadir blood glucose.  947 
o S ubjects will then enter the Discharge Preparation Period. 948 
 949

site.  1215  
 A fter completion of 1 week of AP use Pump mode at home, study staff will 1216  
determine whether additional training and practice is needed and whether the 1217  
subject will repeat all or portions of Visit 4 and 1 week of home use (up to 1 1218  
time if needed) or proceed to Visit 5.  1219  
 S ubjects who failed to use the system for more than 80% of the time during 1220  
this phase will be ineligible to continue in the study. 1221  
 S ubject’s that cannot be adequately monitored at least 75% of the time in 1222  
their local environment by the final day of home use will be ineligible to 1223  
continue in the study. 1224  
 1225  
 1226  
6. Visit 5: USS Virginia Training 1227  
Eligible subjects in the experimental group will participate in a training session in a 1228  
monitored outpatient setting during which the subject and diabetes care partner will 1229  
be trained to use the AP system +USS Virginia. The training will include an initial 1230

understanding of the system interface and how the to react to any 1270  
messages on the system. 1271  
o T he subject and diabetes care partner will be given a printed User 1272  
Guide as a reference. 1273  
 O nce all questions are answered, the subject will then be primarily 1274  
responsible for using the system, with the study team serving as back-up 1275  
when needed.  1276  
 D uring the first part of the training session, the subject and diabetes care 1277  
partner will be re-educated as needed until they are able to complete all 1278  
system-related tasks on the AP Training (APPENDIX A-15 ) and study staff 1279  
will be immediately present for training and to respond to system issues.   1280  
 D uring the second part of the admission, study staff will be nearby and 1281  
available, but will not immediately assist the subject in completing the 1282  
described training tasks or responding to system issues (unless the study is 1283  
stopped due to a problem that is unable to be resolved by the subject). 1284  
Nursing staff will monitor the subjects during the entire admission, report 1285  
fingerstick BG values to the medical team, and ensure that Outpatient 1286  
Hypoglycemia, Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment Instructions are 1287  
followed by the subject.  1288

 1293  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 34 
   
 
Eligible subjects will be provided with the following: 1294  
 S ubjects will receive sufficient device supplies to use the AP system at home 1295  
for four weeks with the study pump and study CGM.  1296  
 S ubjects will also have any supplies replenished as needed for the Study 1297  
Emergency Kit for the treatment of low or high blood glucose. 1298  
 T he subject will continue to perform 4 -6 SMBG measurements daily 1299  
(recommended before meals, about 2 hours after meals and at bedtime), and 1300  
as needed to calibrate the CGM or follow the Outpatient Hypoglycemia, 1301  
Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment Instructions.  Additional fingersticks 1302

 T he subject will be asked to check fingerstick ketone levels per the 1305  
Outpatient Hypoglycemia, Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment 1306  
Instructions. 1307  
 1308  
7. Closed Loop Mode Home Use Trial Period 1309  
After a successful training of Closed Loop mode in Visit 5, eligible subjects will 1310  
then initiate a 3-5 day trial period of the AP system at home in Closed Loop mode, 1311  
connected to the study CGM and study pump. Remote monitoring will be in place 1312  
and designated study medical and technical staff will receive automated 1313  
notifications when alert conditions are met. 1314  
 T he subject will be instructed to use the system in a Closed Loop mode 1315  
except when no calibrated CGM sensor is available. Pump mode may be used 1316  
during times of no active CG M.   1317  
 T he subject will be instructed to perform a fingerstick and switch the system 1318  
to Exercise Mode prior to exercising or engaging in potentially dangerous 1319  
activities such as driving or operating heavy machinery.  1320  
 W hen exercising, the subject will be instructed to limit activity to no more 1321  
than one hour at no more than a moderate level of intensity. 1322  
 W hile using the AP system +USS Virginia system, the subject will be 1323  
instructed to avoid deviating from his/her regular daily routine in regards to 1324  
diet and exercise, aside from potentially limiting exercise duration and 1325  
intensity as described above.   1326  
 T he subject will specifically be asked to avoid consuming more than 3 1327  
alcoholic drinks in any one day. 1328  
 T he subject will also be instructed to avoid use of Clos ed-Loop mode during 1329  
periods of illness with an elevated temperature >101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, 1330  
periods of significant illness, or during periods of use of medications such as 1331  
epinephrine (e.g. for the emergency treatment of a severe allergic reactions or 1332  
asthma attack) and oral or injectable glucocorticoids.   1333  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 35 
   
 
 1334  
After each day of system use, clinical staff will contact the subject and assess the 1335  
subject’s system use via a review of the subject’s data from the previous day.  Study 1336  
staff will also check the number of SMBG tests entered on The AP system and will 1337  
remind the subject to perform 4-6 SMBG daily. The study team will determine 1338  
whether the subject used the system in the appropriate mode at least 80% of the time 1339  
during the day and night and whether remote monitoring was functional at least 75 % 1340  
of the time. Subjects who meet the success criteria on three days in a period of up to 1341  
five days are eligible, at the discretion of the investigator, to continue to the next 1342  
phase of the study. 1343  
 1344  
Subjects who do not meet the success criteria on three nights in a period of up to 1345  
five days may, at the discretion of the investigator, repeat part or all of the Visit 5 1346  
USS Virginia Training and then repeat the 3-5 day Closed Loop Mode Home Use 1347  
Trial Period one time.        1348  
 1349  
8. Four-Week USS Virginia Closed Loop Home Use Period 1350  
Eligible subjects will continue to use the AP system at home in Closed Loop 1351  
configuration for a total of four weeks.  1352  
 S tudy staff will continue to contact the subject daily for the first 5 days, then 1353  
weekly to answer any questions and enquire about any device complaints, 1354  
adverse events, and whether the adverse event was related to the AP system 1355  
use. Study staff will also check the number of SMBG tests entered on the AP 1356  
system and will remind the subject to perform 4-6 SMBG daily. 1357  
 S tudy staff will check the number of SMBG entered on the AP system daily 1358  
via remote monitoring and contact the subject is <4 SMBG are observed on 1359  
any day.  1360  
 C GM downloads will occur at week 2 and week 4.  1361  
 If  an alert is triggered, the staff that received the alert will log onto the remote 1362  
monitoring system to evaluate the problem and follow it until a reasonable 1363  
resolution has occurred. In some instances, this may require a call to the 1364  
subject to resolve the condition. For example, if no data was received from 1365  
the AP system and a technical alert was issued, the technical staff on call may 1366  
determine that a call is needed to find out why the system was not 1367  
communicating with remote monitoring. Attempts to contact the subject 1368  
would be made multiple times for up to 30 minutes. If the subject is not able 1369  
to be contacted within 30 minutes, the care partner would be contacted in a 1370  
similar manner. We would have additional contact information provided by 1371  
the subject at enrollment (e.g. home number, work number, other family 1372  
members, etc.) that would also be tried. If a subject is unreachable for more 1373  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 36 
   
 
than 2 hours with these attempts on more than 2 occasions, s/he may be 1374  
dropped from the study per investigator discretion. Other alerts may be 1375  
triggered that resolve without the need for subject contact. For example, a 1376  
hypoglycemia red light occurs and the medical staff gets a notification. If the 1377  
medical staff observes on remote monitoring that the subject has 1378  
acknowledge the alert, checked a BG and administered appropriate treatment, 1379  
the medical staff may decide to observe that event via remote monitoring 1380  
until the event is resolved.  1381  
 1382  
 1383  
9. Visit 6 : 8 hr Inpatient Assessment of Hypoglycemia Counterregulation and 1384  
Symptom Awareness 1385  
Within one week of completing either USS Virginia or sensor-augmented pump 1386  
therapy at home, the subjects will undergo a final hypoglycemia induction using 1387  
the home pump therapy with frequently sampled YSI glucose levels. Additionally, 1388  
if a subject completes more than 1 week of either USS Virginia or sensor- 1389  
augmented pump therapy and subsequently withdraws from the study intervention, 1390  
they will be asked to complete Visit 6 within one week of discontinuing the 1391  
intervention. 1392  
 1393  
Procedures for this visit are identical to the Visit 3 inpatient procedures with the 1394  
exception of no additional study glucometer and CGM training. 1395  
 1396  
The subject will have a post-intervention HbA1c assessed at the time of one of the 1397  
scheduled blood sampling times and will complete the hypoglycemia 1398  
questionnaires (Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness, Fear of 1399  
Hypoglycemia II and a DiAs Usability questionnaire (DiAs users only) 1400  
(APPENDIX A-5 )). 1401  
 1402  
The subject will return all study equipment and unused supplies. 1403  
 1404  
If during the trial it becomes evident that the pump parameters of a subject may 1405  
benefit from adjustment, the study physician will discuss this with the subject. 1406  
This is possible because the USS is initialized with each subject’s established 1407  
pump parameters and then works as add-on to normal pump therapy manipulating 1408  
insulin delivery around the subject’s normal insulin rate. For example, overnight 1409  
the basal rate module can attenuate basal rate smoothly to prevent hypoglycemia. 1410  
If this happens systematically, this would suggest that the normal basal rate of the 1411  
subject may be too high during certain periods. The study physician would 1412  
therefore discuss such an observation with the subject upon discharge. 1413

H. SAFETY MONITORI NG / RISK ANALYSIS 1414  
 Glucose Monitoring Risk:  1415  
 1416  
The YSI method for glucose monitoring will be employed during the inpatient 1417  
Visits 3 and 6 in order to have the most accurate method available during the 1418  
Hypoglycemia Induction procedures. 1419  
 1420  
During outpatient procedures the Accu-Chek Aviva glucometer will be used. It is 1421  
an FDA approved 510K Class II Medical Device (510K number K101299). 1422  
Subjects and diabetes care partners will be trained on the use of the glucometer. 1423  
 1424  
 H yp oglyce mic/Hyp ergly cemic and Ketone Risk:  1425  
 1426  
To decrease the risk of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, the following 1427  
schedule for monitoring blood glucose concentrations during the inpatient 1428  
procedures will be adhered to  1429  
 O nce IV access has been established, blood will be sampled for YSI glucose 1430  
every 5-30 minutes. The frequency of blood draws for YSI sampling is 1431  
dependent on the value of the previous sample, according to the following 1432  
ranges: 1433  
o B G >200: every 30 minutes 1434  
o B G >100-200: every 15 minutes 1435  
o B G ≤100  mg/dL:  every 5 minut es 1436  
 B lood may be sampled for YSI glucose as needed for patient safety or to 1437  
recheck a suspected erroneous value (e.g. dilute sample). 1438  
 In the  event of loss of IV access or loss of a functional YSI and need for 1439  
continued subject monitoring, glucose measurements will be made on 1440  
capillary whole blood using the study glucometer.  1441  
 1442  
The Inpatient Hypoglycemia Treatment and Inpatient Hyperglycemia and Ketone 1443  
Treatment instructions (below) will be followed during the inpatient portions of 1444  
the study at Visit 3 and Visit 6. 1445  
 1446  
Inpatient Hypoglycemia Treatment 1447  
 G lucose <60 mg/dL will be treated orally with fast acting carbohydrate as 1448  
needed until a glucose level of ≥80 mg/dL is achieved.  1449  
 In the  event that there is intravenous access and the subject is at risk for 1450  
severe hypoglycemia, the subject will be treated with a ~2-3 mL/kg D10 1451  
intravenous glucose bolus. Risk for severe hypoglycemia is defined as any of 1452  
the following situations: 1453  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 38 
   
 
o G lucose <50 mg/dL 1454  
o T he subject is unable to cooperate with oral treatment of 1455  
hypoglycemia 1456  
o T he glucose is dropping at a rate that may not respond adequately to 1457  
oral treatment 1458  
o T he subject experiences symptoms of neuroglycopenia (e.g. lethargy, 1459  
disorientation, confusion [disordered processing of information or 1460  
communication], or inappropriate behavior)  1461  
o T he subject experiences symptoms of severe hypoglycemia (i.e. 1462  
hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness)  1463  
 In the  event that there is NO intravenous access and the subject is at risk for 1464  
severe hypoglycemia (as defined above), the subject will be treated with 1 mg 1465  
of glucagon subcutaneously or intramuscularly.  1466  
o T he drug will be reconstituted and administered per package 1467  
insert/instructions.  1468  
o G lucagon may be repeated as needed every 20 minutes to achieve 1469  
glucose level ≥80 mg/dL. Once the subject is able to consume oral 1470  
treatment, the subject will be treated orally with fast acting 1471  
carbohydrate as needed until a glucose level of ≥80 mg/dL is 1472  
achieved. Orange juice and milk will be avoided after glucagon 1473  
administration.  1474  
o A ttempts will be made to reestablish intravenous access.  1475  
 T he Hypoglycemia Induction Admission will be stopped if the subject 1476  
experiences a hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness and only safety 1477  
procedures will be continued. The study physician or nurse practitioner will 1478  
take control over glucose sampling decisions in order to stabilize the 1479  
subject’s glucose between 100-300 mg/dL and determine the appropriate 1480  
subject disposition (i.e. home or medical facility).  1481  
 1482  
Inpatient Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment 1483  
 If  the subject’s glucose is >300 mg/dL or β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 1484  
mmol/L on admission, the subject will be stabilized per the procedures 1485  
below. The subject will continue to be monitored until a glucose level 1486  
between 100-300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate measurement <0.6 mmol/L 1487  
has been achieved (or the subject is discharged to an appropriate medical 1488  
team).  1489  
 S ubsequently, glucose >300 mg/dL fo r > 2 hours or glucose ≥400 mg/dL at 1490  
any time will prompt discontinuation of the Hypoglycemia Induction 1491  
Admission. 1492  
 β –hydroxybutyrate will be assessed hourly while the glucose is ≥250 mg/dl 1493  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 39 
   
 
or the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 mmol/L.  1494  
 If  the glucose is >300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate level is <0.6 mmol/L, 1495  
corrective action will be taken only after it has been at least 90 minutes from 1496  
the last subcutaneous insulin dose. Specifically, the subject will be asked to 1497  
bolus with his/her pump an amount of corrective insulin that will bring 1498  
him/her to a target glucose of 120 mg/dL. 1499  
 If  the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 mmol/L, the cause of the elevated 1500  
ketone level will be investigated (e.g. pump or pump site malfunction). 1501  
Additional insulin may be administered either via insulin syringe or via a new 1502  
pump site. The amount of insulin administered will be calculated using the 1503  
subject’s insulin sensitivity factor and a target glucose of 120 mg/dL.   1504  
 If  the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥1.5 mmol/L, the Hypoglycemia Induction 1505  
Admission will be stopped and the study MD or NP will take control of the 1506  
subject's insulin dosing. The cause of the elevated ketone level will be 1507  
investigated (e.g. pump or pump site malfunction). If the subject's home 1508  
parameters are not felt to be working adequately due to hyperglycemia, 1509  
ketonemia, or other factors (e.g. intercurrent illness), the study MD or NP 1510  
will administer corrective insulin either via insulin syringe or via a new pump 1511  
site using an ISF determined to be appropriate for the setting and a goal 1512  
glucose of 120 mg/dL. The subject will continue to be monitored until a 1513  
glucose level between 100-300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate measurement 1514  
<0.6 mmol/L has been achieved (or the subject is discharged to an 1515  
appropriate medical team).  1516  
 1517  
The Outpatient Hypoglycemia, Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment instructions 1518  
will be followed during Visit 4 and 5 and at any time that the study pump is in use. 1519  
The treatment guidelines are attached in APPENDIX A-12 . 1520  
 1521  
 C alibration of CGM Risk:  1522  
 1523  
During the portions of the study when CGM is used, subjects should calibrate the 1524  
CGM with fingerstick value s before meals and at bedtime and no less than every 1525  
12 hours.  1526  
 1527  
 S ter ilization Risk:  1528  
 1529  
Study equipment cannot be sterilized in an autoclave. Cl eaning instructions 1530

this case, the Principal Investigator will promptly inform the subj ect s and assure 1895  
appropriate the rapy and follow-up. Additionally the Principal Investigator w ill no tify the 1896  
IRB and DSMB if the study is temporarily stopped. The p ertinent regulatory authorities 1897  
will be informed a cco rding  to national regulations. The DSMB will meet to determine if 1898  
changes to the protocol or system are needed prior to restarting the study and whether the 1899  
study may be restarted. 1900  
 1901  
Early study stop will be documented and following information will be coll ected: 1902  
 Date and cause of the en ding 1903  
 Description of any serious ad ver se event l eading to the study ending 1904  
 1905  
A subject who does not complete the at least 1 week of the study intervention may 1906  
be repla ced. Ava ila ble data will be exploited. 1907  
 1908  
In the case of an unanticipated adverse device effects (UA DE), the overall study may be 1909  
suspended while the problem is diagnosed and the PI investigates the UADE. If the PI 1910  
determines that the U ADE poses an unreasonab le risk to subje c ts, the study should be 1911  
suspended until this UAD E can be resolv ed. If it canno t be resolved, the study should be 1912  
terminated. Termination should o ccur no later than 5 working days afte r PI makes the 1913  
decision. The result of the investigation and the PI ’s decision to terminate the study shall 1914  
be reported the site IRB,  and the FDA per 21CFR 812.46(b) (2 ). The DSMB must 1915  
deter mine if the UADE presents an unreasonable risk to subj ect s. If so, the DSMB must 1916  
ensure that all investigations, or parts of investigations presenting that risk, are te r minated 1917  
as soon as possible but no later than 5 working  days a fter the DSMB makes this 1918  
determination and no later than 15 working days a fte r first receipt notice of the UADE. 1919  
 1920  
The study may resume if the underlying pr obl em can be corrected by a protocol or 1921  
system modification that will not invalidate the results obtained prior to suspension. The 1922  
IRB and DSMB will be notified if the study is stopped, and permission to resume will be 1923  
obtained from the FDA, DSMB and IRB prior to restar tin g. 1924

J. ENDPOINTS 1944  
This study is a randomized, controlled trial involving subjects with type 1 diabetes to test the 1945  
effectiveness of the Unified Safety System (USS) Virginia closed-loop in preventing 1946  
hypoglycemia compared with sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy. We will also evaluate 1947  
the effectiveness of the control system (USS Virginia) at improving hypoglycemia 1948  
counterregulation, hypoglycemia awareness, and overall glycemic control compared with 1949  
versus SAP. To achieve this goal, we will conduct pre- and post-intervention inpatient 1950  
assessments of hypoglycemia counterregulation and symptom awareness. For the 1951  
interventions , subjects randomized to USS Virginia will participate in two training visits at a 1952  
monitored outpatient setting for the step-wise deployment of the AP system at home in Pump 1953  
mode followed by 4 weeks using AP at home in Closed Loop mode running USS Virginia . 1954  
Subjects randomized to sensor-augmented pump therapy will complete 5 weeks of CGM 1955  
with the home pump. 1956  
 1957  
The basic unit for analyse s of hypoglycemia risk and occurrence is the glucose trace of 1958  
an individual , i.e. a time-stamped series of CGM data recorded for e ac h person. Summary 1959  
characteristics and group-level analyses a re derived after the individual tra ces  are 1960  
processed to produce meaningful individual markers o f average glycemia and glucose 1961  
variation.  1962  
 1963  
The following primary endpoint of reduction in hypoglycemia will be assessed by: 1964  
1. LBGI from CGM during 1 week of blinded use versus during the last week of 1965  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 54 
   
 
intervention 1966  
 1967  
The secondary endpoints of improvement in counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia and 1968  
hypoglycemia awarenes s at baseline versus follow- up will be assessed by: 1969  
1. Peak epinephrine 1970  
2. Epinephrine AUC 1971  
3. Epinephrine increase over baseline 1972  
4. Hypoglycemia symptom ratings  1973  
5. Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness score  1974  
6. Fear of hypoglycemia scores 1975  
  1976  
Additional secondary endpoints of reduction in hypoglycemia will be assessed by: 1977  
1. CGM time <70 mg/dL and <50 mg/dL by retrofitted CGM and SMBG trace from 1 1978  
week of blinded use versus the last week of intervention  1979  
a. During 24 hours, and  1980  
b. Overnight (11PM – 7AM)  1981  
 1982  
Additional secondary endpoints of improvement in glycemic control at baseline versus the 1983  
last week of intervention will be assessed by: 1984  
1. Time within target (70-180 mg/dL) over a 24 hour period 1985  
2. Time within target range of 80- 140 mg/dL overnight (11PM – 7AM), and 1986  
3. Distribution of wake-up glucose levels at 7AM 1987  
 1988  
K. SUCCESS CRITERIA /  GOAL  1989  
As a general rule, a subject’s data will be considered useful for data analysis if the 1990  
subject completes at least 1 week of study intervention with USS Virginia+AP system or 1991  
SAP.   1992  
L. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 1993  
Sample size determination is based on literature data (#3) and on results from our 1994  
previous studies of hypoglycemia unawareness (#4)(#5). We estimate, conservatively, 1995  
that the effect size of using the AP system+USS Virginia vs. CGM in terms of 1996  
restoration of epinephrine response will be moderate ~0.35. Power calculations assuming 1997  
=0.05, and power of 80% yield a required sample size of N=36 (using G*Power 3 1998  
software [#5]). With this sample size, the power for finding significant effects on 1999  
frequency and extent of hypoglycemia (Low BG Index [#6]) exceeds 0.9. Assuming a 2000  
proportion of noncompliance R=20% for Intention- to-Treat (ITT) analysis (#7), 44 2001  
completed subjects will adequately address the specific aims of this study. Per-protocol 2002  
analysis will also be performed. In order to achieve 44 completed subjects, up to 70 2003

subjects may sign consent given an expected screen failure, withdrawal and drop-out rate 2004  
of ~40% due to the rigorous exclusion criteria and requirements imposed for the AP 2005  
system use in the subject’s local environment. 2006

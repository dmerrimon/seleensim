formatting, grammar, syntax, punctuation, and other editorial changes are not summarized in the 
table below.  
Change and Rationale  Affected Sections  
Statistical an alysis for primary and key secondary endpoint 
measurement will be analyzed using the McNemar Test, adjusted 
per FDA agreement . Furthermore, t he primary endpoint is defined 
as wounds that meet any of the following conditions:  
• Healed on Week 22 and Week 24, or 
• Healed on Week 24 and Week 26.  
The secondary key endpoint is defined as wounds that meet any of 
the following conditions:  
• Healed on Week 8 and Week 10, or  
• Healed on Week 10 and Week 12.  
Only wounds that are healed for at least two (2)  consecutive weeks 
are counted as positive responses.  Synopsis ; Section 2.2; Section 
6.2; Section 8.1; Section 8.2; 
and Section 8.7   
The protocol has been amended to add clarification around the 
assessment of the Primary Wounds, such that only the originally 
selected area at the Week 1 Visit, will be assessed at the Week 8, 
10, 12, 22, 24 and 26 Visits. The neighboring wounds which have 
received treatment during the study will not be included in this 
assessment .  Section 2.2; Section 4.2; 
Section 5.1; Section 6.2; 
Section 8.1; Section 8.2; and 
Section 8.7  
Per Agency’s recommendation, a McNemar Test has been used for 
sample size calculation. In the Phase I/II study, the response rates 
for Weeks 8 through 12 were from 70 -100% for wounds randomized 
to B-VEC and 0 -33% for wounds randomized to placebo, 
respectively. Therefore, the sample size  has been revised  to 24 
subjects assuming a response rate of 75% among wounds 
randomized to B -VEC and a r esponse rate of 25% among wounds 
randomized to placebo. With 90% power and a two -sided Type 1 
error rate of 5%, 24 subjects (i.e., 24 wound pairs) are required.

Title GEM -3: A Phase III Double Blinded, Placebo -Controlled, Efficacy and 
Safety Study of Beremagene Geperpavec (B -VEC, previously 
“KB103”) for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB)  
Study Number  B-VEC-03 
Number of Subject s Approximately 24 subjects  
Study Phase  Phase III study  
Number of Centers  3 centers  
Study Objectives  The primary objective is to determine whether administration of B -
VEC in addition to standard of care improves wound healing as 
compared to placebo in children, adolescents, and adults with 
Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB).  
Study  Design  GEM -3 is a multi -center, intra -subject randomized, placebo -
controlled, double blinded, Phase III study of B -VEC for the topical 
treatment of DEB wounds.  Each subject will serve as their own control.   
Definition of Unit Dose : Unit dose varies by wound area  
Wound Area * Unit Dose  
<20 cm2 4×108 PFU/wound  
20 to 40 cm2 8×108 PFU/wound  
40 to 60 cm2 1.2×109 PFU/wound  
* Wound area determined by the Investigator using the validated 
Canfield photography quantitation at Week 1.  Subsequent 
Secondary Wounds not selected at Week 1, will have the wound 
area determined during selection .  
 
Definition s: 
Weekly Treatment :  1 unit -dose of B -VEC or placebo  
Treatment Cycle :  Weekly Treatment until complete wound closure  
of wounds selected at baseline and any new surrounding wounds  
(neighboring wounds)  during the treatment phase.  
Maximum Weekly Dose per subject :   
Age  Maximum Weekly Dose  
≥ 6 months to < 3 years  1.6×109 PFU/w eek 
≥ 3 years  to < 6 years  2.4×109 PFU/week 
≥ 6 years  3.2×109 PFU/week 
Matche d Wound s: Two matched wound s similar in size, located in 
similar anatomical regions , and have similar appearance .  
Two matched wound s in a 1:1 ratio per subject will be selected to 
evaluate the primary  and secondary  endpoint s. The matched wound s 
will be randomized, such that one wound will receive Weekly

Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  7 of 63 Treatment of B-VEC and one wound will receive Weekly Treatment of 
placebo for a Tre atment Cycle.  
Study  Design  
(continued)  Remaining Weekly Dose : The difference between Maximum Weekly 
Dose per subject per week and the sum total of the B -VEC Dose(s) 
applied to the Primary Wound Pair  per subject per week.  The 
Remaining Weekly Dose will be used to treat Secondary Wounds. Up 
to four (4) Secondary Wounds may be selected.  
For example: If a subject 7 years of age, presents with  the primary 
wound pair < 20cm2 then the Remaining Weekly Dose during a weekly 
visit = Difference of (3.2 ×109 PFU – (4×108 PFU)) = 2.8×109 
PFU/subject/week. The Remaining Weekly Dose will be applied to 
secondary wounds for monitoring safety and efficacy.  
Re-dosing regimen  
During the study , if a neighboring wound near the primary wound 
opens up , (approximately 2 -3 cm from the original wound) that wound 
may receive treatment  at the discretion of the Investigator . When a 
matched primary wound and its neighboring wound /s close  
completely , as determined by the Investigator  during a weekly visit , 
then no treatment will occur . Weekly treatment on that wound will 
resume when the original ly selected  wound  or its neighboring wound/s  
is determined to be open by the Investigator at a weekly visit.  
The re -dosing regimen will be followed throughout the study . 
Secondary Wounds  
The Remaining Weekly Dose calculated during a weekly visit will be 
applied to  a maximum of four (4) additional wounds (“Secondary 
Wounds”). Secondary Wound(s) will receive a Week ly Treatment of 
B-VEC for the Treatment Cycle. The number of Secondary Wounds 
treated will depend on wound area of the Secondary Wound(s). The 
total dose applied to Secondary Wounds is not to exceed the 
Remaining Weekly Dose. During the study, if  a neighboring wound 
near the Secondary wound opens up , (approximately 2 -3 cm from the 
original wound) that wound may receive treatment . When the 
secondary  wound and the neighboring wound close  completely , as 
determined by the Investigator  during a weekly vis it, then that 
particular wound will stop receiving treatment . For Secondary 
Wounds, avoid selecting wounds that are in close proximity to the 
Primary  Wound Pair.  
Primary Endpoint  Wound Healing  
The primary endpoint  is the proportion of DEB primary wound s ites 
with complete wound healing  of the originally selected baseline wound 
in B-VEC versus placebo treated intra -subject  wound sites at Weeks 
22 and 24 or Weeks 24  and 26, as determined by the Investigator , to 
evaluate durability and repeat dosing . The complete wound healing is 
defined as 100% wound closure of the exact original wound surface 
area selected at baseline, specified as skin re -epithelialization without 
drainage.  
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  8 of 63 Secondary Endpoints  Key Secondary Endpoint  
• Proportion of the selected primary wound sites with 
complete wound healing  of the exact wound surface area  
selected at  baseline  (as defined in the primary endpoint) in 
B-VEC-treated versus placebo  at Weeks 8 and 10 or Weeks 
10 and  12 (as determined by the Investigator)  to evaluate 
durability . 
Secondary Endpoint  
• The mean change in pain severity  using a  VAS score per  
primary  wound site associated with wound dressing 
changes at Weeks 22, 24 and 2 6 for each treated versus 
placebo  wound , for ages 6 and  above  on the primary wound 
pair. For ages below 6  years, the Face Legs Activity Cry and 
Consolability -Revised (FLACC -R) scale will be used.  
Exploratory Endpoints  • Relative time to wound closure from baseline . 
• Duration of closure, as defined by the time from complete 
wound closure to the reopening of the Primary Wounds.  
• The mean change in Quality of Life  in addition to Skindex 
score as compared to baseline at Week 2 6. 
Safety Endpoint  • The safety and tolerability of B -VEC based on the 
assessment of adverse events, physical examinations, vital 
signs , and clinical laboratory test results.

Duration and 
Assessments  Study Treatment  
Week 1  
- Following randomization of the matched primary wound pair, wounds will 
receive one Weekly Treatment  in a double -blinded manner.  
- The Remaining Weekly Dose will be calculated  and applied  to a maximum of 
four (4) additional wounds (“Secondary Wounds”). Second ary Wound (s) will 
receive a Weekly Treatment of B -VEC. The number of Secondary Wound (s) 
treated will depend on wound area of the Secondary Wound (s). The total dose 
applied to Secondary Wound (s) is not to exceed the Remaining  Weekly Dose.  
Week 2 through 2 6  
- Subjects will return to the clinical site for assessment of all wounds by the 
Investigator.  
- The Primary Wound Pair will receive one Weekly Treatment in a double -
blinded manner. However, if one of the wounds in a matched Primary Wound 
Pair closes completely  and there are no open neighboring wounds , as 
determined by the Investigator during a weekly visit, then that particular wound  
and its neighboring wound/s  will not receive  Weekly Treatment that week.  
Once that particular wound , or its neighboring  wound/s , is determined to be 
open by the Investigator at a weekly visit, Weekly Treatment will continue.  If 
the originally selected primary wound closes, its neighboring wound/s may 
continue to receive treatment.  
- If a Secondary Wound is closed completely , as well as its neighboring 
wound/s , as determined by an Investigator, during a weekly visit , then that 
particular wound  and its neighboring wound/s  will not receive Weekly 
Treatment that week.  If the originally selected secondary wound closes, its 
neighb oring wound/s may continue to receive treatment. The total dose 
applied to secondary wounds is not to exceed the Remaining Weekly Dose.  
- Subjects will come to clinic for assessment even if the originally selected 
wounds are closed.  
Safety Follow -up/Early Termination   
- Subjects will return to the clinical site  30 days following the last dose of B -
VEC.  
- Subjects may roll into an Open Label Extension (OLE) Protocol. If subjects do 
not participate in the OLE Protocol, they will be asked to roll over into a Long -
Term Follow -up Protocol (All subject s enrolled in the study who received at 
least a Weekly Treatment) . 
Assessments  
- Safety measures include adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, and 
clinical laboratory tests. All safety analyses results will  be performed using the 
safety population. A summary of safety results will be presented for each 
treatment  group.

Analyses  Continuous variables will be summarized in tables and will include the number of 
subject s, mean, standard deviation (SD ), percent of coefficient of variance (CV%), 
median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be presented in tables as 
frequencies and percentages. A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional 
details on the approach to the analysis a nd data displays.  
Sample Size Estimation   
In the Phase I/II study, the response rates for Weeks 8 through 12 were from 70 -100% 
for wounds randomized to B -VEC and 0 -33% for wounds randomized to placebo, 
respectively. Assuming a response rate of 75% among wounds randomized to B -VEC 
and a response rate of 25% among wounds randomized to placebo , with a 90% power 
and a two -sided Type 1 error rate of 5%, 24 subjects (i.e., 24 wound pairs) are required.  
Analysis Populations  
Safety Population : 
This population is  defined as all subjects who were administered with either B -VEC or 
placebo. Safety population will be used for all the safety analyses.  
Intent -to-Treat Population : 
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes subjects whose primary wounds were 
randomized  with or without either B -VEC or Placebo administration. ITT population will 
be used for all the primary and secondary efficacy sensitivity analyses and baseline 
summaries.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat Population : 
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population  includes subjects whose primary 
wounds were randomized and received B -VEC treatment with at least one post 
baseline primary endpoint assessment. mITT population will be used for all the primary 
and secondary efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Population : 
The per-protocol (PP) population includes all the safety population subjects who 
completed the study without major protocol deviations. PP population will be used for 
all the primary and secondary efficacy sensitivity analyses.  
Missing Values and Imputations  
Multiple imputation  method will be used to handle missing data for primary efficacy 
analysis . For all the exploratory endpoints, the missing values will not be imputed.

Analyses 
(continued)  Efficacy Analyses : 
The study has a complete randomized -block design in which each subject serves as a 
block to receive all of the treatment conditions.  In this study, each subject provides 
one pair  of matched target wounds with one wound being treated with B -VEC and the 
other wound with placebo in the primary wound pair. Efficacy measurements are taken 
multiple times (or repeatedly) over the on -treatment period from each subject.  Efficacy 
measures collected pre -dosing at Visit 1 (Week 1) will be considered as the baseline 
measurement in this study.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint of the proportion of DEB primary wound sites with complete 
wound healing  of the exact wound surface area selected at baseline  will be 
analyzed using the McNemar  Test.  
The primary endpoint  is defined as wounds that meet any of the following  
conditions : 
• Healed on Week 22  and Week 24, or  
• Healed on Week 24  and Week 26.  
Only wounds that are healed for at least two ( 2) consecutive  weeks are counted as 
positive responses.  
Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The key secondary endpoint of the proportion of primary  wound sites with 
complete wound healing  of the exact wound surface area selected at baseline , will 
be analyzed using the McNemar Test.   
The primary endpoint is defined as wounds that meet any of the followin g 
conditions:  
• Healed on Week 8 and Week 10, or 
• Healed on Week 10 and Week 12.  
Only wounds that are healed for at least two (2) consecutive  weeks are counted as 
positive responses.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The following secondary endpoint will be analyzed using the Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment as the fixed effect and the baseline value as the covariate 
by the time points.  
1. The mean change  from baseline  in pain se verity VAS score per wound site 
associated with wound dressing changes at Week s 22, 24 and 26 for each 
treated versus placebo for ages 6 and above on the primary wound pair. For 
ages below 6  years, the FLACC -R scale scores will be used instead VAS 
scores.  
Safety Analyses:  
Safety measures include adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, and 
clinical laboratory tests. All safety analyses results will be performed using the safety 
population. A summary of safety results will be presented for each tr eatment group.  
Long -term 
follow -up Subject s will be asked to transfer to a long-term follow -up study, which will include up 
to 5 years of annual phone check -ins. Subjects may roll into the Long -Term Follow -Up 
Protocol at the Safety Follow -up Visit (30 days following the last dose of B -VEC).  
DSMB Reviews  A data monitoring board (DSMB) will conduct regular planned safety reviews of study 
data as outlined in the DSMB charter.

3 The matched primary wound pair will be randomized . 
4 Pain questionnaires are to be completed during the dressing change of the individual matched wound s. If subject is 6 years of age or older, they will be asked to complete the VAS questionnaire 
for matched wounds during the dressing change . If younger than 6 years of age, their pa rent/caregiver will be administered the FLACC -R questionnaire for the matched wounds during the 
dressing change  (Refer to section  6.2.2 ). 
5 Both the Quality of Life (EQ-5D) and Skindex Questionnaires will be administered to subjects 12 years of age and older at the time of consent. Questionnaires may be administered for the 
subject to complete after the visit  and bring back at the next scheduled visit.  
6 Images will be collected on both closed and open wounds . Image in the same order and orientation at each visit  prior to IP application . 
7 Primary wound closure assessment s will be evaluated by the Investigator only at Weeks 8, 10 12, 22 24 and 26. Seconda ry wound closure is assessed weekly , to determine if a new wound may  
be selected to  receive treatment, if the originally selected area  and its neighboring wound/s  has closed , as applicable .  
8 Viral shedding and infectivity swabs will be collected from the primary  matched  wound s only and will be collected whether or not the wound is open or closed . 
9 Subjects are required to bring the study visit wound dressing back to the site. Primary wounds will be separately bagged. Sec ondary wound dressing may be bagge d together. Once returned to 
the site, viral shedding swabs will be collected for all Primary Wounds dressings that came into contact with the subject’s s kin. Attempt collection of (4) four consecutive VS dressing returns, if 
unable, collect at least (4) f our dressing VS per subject . Once four (4) VS samples have been collected from the Primary Wound Pair, all dressing may be bagged together and returned to  the site 
for disposal and specimen collection will be discontinued.

15 Labs will be attempted, unless per the discretion of the Investigator, it is not in the best interest of the subject. If labs  are attempted and not obtained, documentation w ill be noted in the study 
visit. Furthermore, if labs are not attempted, justification must be recorded in the study visit.  The Investigator must determine clinical significance for out-of-range  values.  
16 Conduct all other study visit procedures prior to  B-VEC and placebo administration. Matched Wounds : IP will be applied to wounds that are open . If a matched wound  and neighboring wound  is 
closed , no IP will be applied and application will be reinitiated once the wound reopens  at a scheduled  visit, as determined by the Investigator.  Secondary Wounds : IP will only be applied to open 
wounds as determined by the Investigator, not to exceed the Remaining Weekly Dose. IP may be applied to immediate neighboring wounds . Up to four (4) unmatched Seco ndary Wounds may be 
selected to receive open -label B -VEC during the study treatment. Trace the area that is receiving treatment  (including the neighboring wounds) . Neighboring wounds are defined as wounds 
approximately 2 -3cm away from the original matched and unmatched (Primary and Secondary) wound.  
17 At the Safety Follow -up (30 days ± 4 days)  following the last dose of B -VEC, subject s may roll over into an OLE protocol or will be asked to roll over into  a LTFU protocol

1 Introduction  
1.1 Disease Background  
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a group of heritable skin diseases characterized by skin fragility, 
blister formation, milia, and scarring (Intong, 2012) . Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is one of the 
major for ms of EB and is the result of mutations to the COL7A1 gene encoding collagen VII (Varki, et al., 
2007) , (Uitto & Christiano, 1994) . Severe generalized recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa , formerly 
termed Hallipeau -Siemens, is characterized by extensive blistering and scarring of the skin and mucosal 
membranes. Blisters and erosions affect skin as well as certain mucosa exposed to disruptive external 
environment, including oropharynx, esophagus , rectum, genitourinary system and eye s. Healing of 
erosions results in debilitating scarring. Damage to the mouth and esophagus can make it difficult to chew 
and swallow food, leading to chronic malnutrition and slow growth. Complications from extensive s carring 
can include fusion of the fingers and toes, joint deformities, and vision impairment.  Given the severity of 
this disorder and the lack of effective treatment options, there exists a clear need for alternative treatment 
options that focus on the roo t cause of the debilitating symptoms and can be administered in a minimally 
invasive way.  
1.2 Phase I/II Results Summary  
Krystal conducted a Phase I/II clinical trial entitled: “A Phase I/II Study of B -VEC, a Non -Integrating, 
Replication -Incompetent HSV Vector  Expressing the Human Collagen VII Protein, for the Treatment of 
Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB).” The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of B-VEC.  
This trial was an intra -subject comparison of wounds administered topical B -VEC against wounds that were 
administered placebo. Wounds were randomized to be administered either topical B -VEC or topical placebo 
prior to administration. The first -in-human Phase I protocol enrolled 2 adult subjects, and the Phase II 
portion of the pr otocol enrolled 10 subjects: 5 adults and 5  pediatric subjects.   
1.2.1  Efficacy Results  
Efficacy was analyzed by looking at both mechanistic endpoints and clinical endpoints. Mechanistic 
endpoints include evidence of COL7 using IF and anchoring fibrils using IEM. Clinical endpoints focus on 
wound healing and measured parameters such as percen t (%) by area of wound closure, duration of wound 
closure, and time to wound closure.  
The IF analyses conducted post B -VEC administration revealed clearly detectable and correctly localized 
(at the Basement Membrane Zone, BMZ) COL7 expression by immunofluo rescence in the biopsy samples 
from both the intradermal injection sites and topically applied wounds. Expression was observed as early 
as 48 hours post -administration and was continually observed at each monthly timepoint out to Day 90. 
The presence of th e NC2 domain in conjunction with NC1 and linear deposition at the BMZ demonstrates 
production of functional COL7.  
The IEM analyses conducted post B -VEC administration revealed clearly detectable and correctly localized 
anchoring fibrils at the BMZ in biops y samples from both the intradermal injection sites and topically applied 
wounds. Anchoring fibrils were observed as early as Day  8 and as late as Day 97. Importantly, in the later 
timepoints (samples from Days 84 and 97), mature NC2 -positive fibrils were observed which strongly 
demonstrates the presence of functional full -length COL7.

Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  23 of 63 The IF and IEM results were supported by clinical wound closure data. Subject -specific wound images and 
wound closure data showing percent change from baseline of B -VEC- and placebo -administered wounds 
were used to evaluate wound area reduction, duration of closure, and time to closure.  
Findings from our previous GEM Phase I/II study in which each subject served as their own control 
disclosed an effect size of at least 0.8 for the average percent change in wound area from baseline over 12 
weeks, comparing B -VEC treatment to placebo control. The observed proportion of complete wound healing 
for Week 8 , 10 and  12 ranged fro m 67% to 85% for B -VEC treatment and from 0% to 33% for placebo 
control  and showed a statistically significant difference (p -value <.00001, based on the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test stratified by the timepoints of weeks) difference.  At Week 12, B -VEC-treated wounds showed 
a median reduction of 94%, compared to a median increase of 27% for the placebo -treated wounds 
resulting in  a statistically significant (p -value = 0.02, based on Wilcoxon rank -sum test) difference . 
Complementary analysis was performed to s how that the 87% of subjects had at least a 75% reduction in 
average wound size for the B -VEC-treated wounds at week 12, compared with 14% of subjects for the 
placebo -treated wounds.  
1.2.2  Safety Results  
In every phase of the study, the safety of B -VEC was asses sed through analysis of AEs, including clinically 
significant changes in laboratory results, vitals, and physical exam findings. In addition, viral shedding was 
analyzed through the collection of serum, urine, and skin swabs, and antibodies to HSV and COL7  were 
analyzed through collection of blood.  
There were no deaths, serious adverse events or significant adverse events reported. Thirty  (30) AEs were 
reported;  twenty -nine ( 29) were mild in severity and one (1) was moderate in severity. The moderate AE 
was facial itching and redness and unrelated to  the Investigational Product . All of the AEs resolved during 
the study and of the thirty ( 30), fifteen ( 15) were unlikely or unrelated, and fifteen ( 15) were possibly or 
probably related. Of  the fifteen ( 15) poss ibly or probably related, four ( 4) were associated with topical B -
VEC administration including rash, fever, itching and peculiar taste.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters, including liver enzymes. Changes 
from baseline wer e small (usually less than 10%) and showed no distinct shifts over time.  
Sera samples, collected pre -dose and during specific visits per the Schedule of Events , were evaluated for 
Anti-Drug Antibodies against HSV and COL7 using a qualified Plaque Reduction  Neutralization Test 
(PRNT). Existing antibodies, as well as any changes in antibodies detected after B -VEC treatment, did not 
have any apparent impact on subject safety as any possibly related AEs were mild in severity and transient. 
Efficacy was also not  impacted, as evidenced by the robust efficacy of the vector (e.g., indicated by 
improved wound healing, as compared to intra -subject placebo controls; the observed molecular correction 
of the collagen VII defect, demonstrated by linear collagen VII deposi tion and formation of anchoring fibrils 
along the Basement Membrane Zone (BMZ) by Immunofluorescence (IF) and Immunoelectron Microscopy 
(IEM) . 
2 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
2.1 Study Objective  
The primary objective is to determine whether administration of B -VEC in addition to standard of care 
improves wound healing as compared to placebo in children, adolescents, and adults with Dystrophic 
Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB).

2.2.1  Overview  
GEM -3 is a multi -center, intra -patient randomized, placebo -controll ed, double -blinded, Phase III study of 
B-VEC for the topical treatment of DEB wounds. Each site will have a designated Principal Investigator.  
Weekly Treatment : 1 unit -dose of B -VEC or placebo  
Treatment Cycle : Weekly Treatment until complete wound closure  
Maximum Weekly Dose per subject :  
Age  Maximum Weekly Dose  
≥ 6 months to < 3 years  1.6×109 PFU/w eek 
≥ 3 years  to < 6 years  2.4×109 PFU/week 
≥ 6 years  3.2×109 PFU/week 
Two (2)  matched wound s (“Primary Wounds”) , in a 1:1 ratio per subject will be selected to evaluate the 
primary and secondary end points. The matched wound pair will be randomized, such that one wound will 
receive Weekly Treatment of B -VEC and the other will receive placebo . 
Remaining Weekly Dose: The difference between Maximum Weekl y Dose per subject per week 
and the sum total of the B -VEC Dose(s) applied to the Primary Wound Pair per subject per week.  
Re-dosing regimen: During the study , if one wound in the matched Primary Wound Pair and its 
neigh boring wounds close completely , as determined by the Investigator during a weekly visit, that 
particular wound  and its neighboring wound/s  will stop receiving Weekly Treatment. Treatment of 
the Primary Wound  and its neighboring wound/s  will resume Weekly Treatment when  that particular 
wound or neighboring wound /s is determined to be open by the Investigator during a weekly visit. 
During the treatment of a Primary Wound , it the originally selected wound closes , its neighboring 
wound ( approximately 2-3cm away from the originally selected wound)  wound may continue to  
receive treatment , at the discretion of the Investigator . If treating a neighboring wound, avoid 
treating if  it is in close proximity to the other matched wound or a Secondary Wound. The re -dosing 
regimen will be followed throughout the study .  
For example,  if a subject age 4, present s with a primary wound pair <20 cm2, then the Remaining 
Weekly Dose during a weekly visit = Difference of ( 2.4×109 PFU– (4×108 PFU)) = 2.0×109 
PFU/subject /week. The Remaining Weekly Dose will be applied to Secondary Wounds for 
monitoring safety and efficacy.  
The Remaining Weekly Dose  calculated during a weekly visit will be applied to additional unmatched 
wounds (“Secondary Wounds”). A maximum of four (4) Secondary Wounds will receive a Weekly Treatment 
of B-VEC for the Treatment Cycle. The number of Secondary Wounds treated will depend on wound area 
of the Secondary Wound (s), and the total dose applied to Secondary Wounds is not to exceed the 
Remaining Weekly Dose. During the treatment of the Secondary Wounds, if a neighboring wound 
(approximately 2 -3cm from the originally selected wound) opens, then that wound may receive treatment , 
at the discretion of the Investiga tor. 
If a Secondary Wound is closed completely , as well as the neighboring wounds , as determined by an 
Investigator during a weekly visit, no treatment will occur . Treatment to neighboring wound/s may continue 
even though the originally selected Secondary Wound is closed. Avoid application to neighboring wounds 
in close proximity to a Primary Wound.  The total dose applied to Secondary Wounds is not to exceed the 
Rema ining Weekly Dose.

Confidential   Page  25 of 63 2.2.2  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of DEB primary wound sites with complete wound healing from 
baseline  in B-VEC versus placebo treated intra -subject wound sites at Weeks 22 and 24 or 24  and 26, as 
determined by the Investigator , to evaluate durability and repeat dosing . The complete wound healing is 
defined as 100% wound closure from  the exact wound area selected at  baseline, specified as skin re -
epithelialization without drainage.  If new neighb oring wounds form s, around the original traced baseline 
wound , during the primary and secondary evaluation time points , these wounds will not be included in the 
evaluation . 
 The primary endpoint is defined as wounds that meet any of the following condition s: 
• Healed on Week 22 and Week 24, or  
• Healed on Week 24 and Week 26.  
Only wounds that are healed for at least two (2) consecutive weeks are counted as positive  
responses.  
2.2.2.1  Primary Endpoint Rationale  
The GEM -3 pivotal study has been designed as an  adequate well -controlled clinical study  per Agency 
guidance (21 CFR 314.126 ) to provide substantial evidence of product effectiveness. The double -blinded, 
placebo -controlled study design will minimize bias on the part of subjects, and Investigators. The  FDA’s 
guidance Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases (July 2018) suggests that an intra -subject control approach, for 
such rare skin diseases, may be a useful design. The wounds will be matched in respect to size and 
anatomical location.  
Complete w ound healing wil l be defined as complete closure of the initial wound surface  selected at 
baseline,  specified as skin re -epithelialization without drainage  for two (2) consecutive weeks , as evaluated 
by the Investigator  at Weeks 22  and 24 or 24  and 26 . If new neighboring wounds form around the original 
traced baseline wound during the primary evaluation time points , these areas  will not be included in the 
evaluation.   
B-VEC is a transient non -integrating episomal vector that can be detected up to five days in B-VEC in vivo 
studies . The Phase I/II B-VEC completed study, that has evaluated different dosing regimens shows that 
continuous expression of COL7 during the wound healing process allows for durability of the healed wound 
with no safety outcome s. Therefore, a weekl y dosing regimen has been proposed based on life span of 
B-VEC and results from the Phase I/II clinical study that would allow for functional restoration of COL7 at 
basement membrane zone. It has been shown that the half -life of human COL7 is approximately  30 days . 
Based on a half -life assumption of about one month for COL7, a residual protein amount of 25% should be 
present after two months (Kuhl, et al., 2016) . It is known that about 30 -40% of COL7 levels are needed to 
protect  the skin from frictional damage  (Kern, et al., 2009)  (Kuhl, et al., 2016)  and even lower levels of 
COL7 may improve the phenotype of full COL7 deficiency remarkably  (Fritsch , et al., 2008)  (Alexeev, et al., 
2011)  (Schweiger -Briel, et al., 2015) . The basement membrane and its constitutive components undergo 
constant remodeling (Kivirikko, et  al., 1996)  which has implications for anchoring fibril turnover 
approximately every 60 days  to 90 days (8 weeks to 12 weeks). Therefore, the proposed evaluation of the 
primary endpoint at Weeks 22 and 24 or 24 and 26 , for two (2) consecutive weeks,  is justified.   
In addition, in the previously conducted Phase 1/2 B -VEC clinical study, the placebo response (change in 
wound area from baseline) mimicked the frequent opening and closing of untreated DEB wounds  as shown 
below : 
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  26 of 63 Figure 1. Change in Wound Area from Baseline in B -VEC v s. Placebo Treated in Phase I/II Study  
 
The usual pattern in a placebo response is often similar to active treatment with or without significant 
separation.  Due to the nature of the DEB wounds, frequent  closing and opening cycle is observed , therefore  
a fixed assessment may lead to a biased conclusion in comparing a normal treatment profile to an abnormal 
profile of a placebo response. To accommodate this variability of the placebo response, an assessmen t of 
two (2) consecutive weeks , at Weeks 22 and 24 or 24  and 2 6, are considered to evaluate durability of 
wound healing and frequency of repeat administration.   
2.2.3  Key Secondary Endpoint  
The key secondary endpoint is defined as the p roportion of primary wound  sites with complete wound 
healing from baseline (as defined in the primary endpoint) in B -VEC-treated versus placebo at Weeks 8  
and 10 or 10 and 12 (as  determined by the Investigator) to evaluate durability.  The complete wound healing 
is defined as 100% w ound closure  of the originally selected wound area  at baseline, specified as skin re -
epithelialization without drainage.  If new neighboring wounds form around the original traced baseline 
wound during the key secondary  evaluation time points, these areas  will not be included in the evaluation.    
 The key secondary  endpoint is defined as wounds that meet any of the following conditions:  
• Healed on Week 8 and Week 10, or  
• Healed on Week 10 and Week 12.  
Only wounds that are healed for at least two (2) consecu tive weeks are counted as positive 
responses.

Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  27 of 63 2.2.3.1  Key Secondary Endpoint Rationale  
As mentioned above, B-VEC is a transient non -integrating episomal vector that can be detected up to five 
days after administration in patients . Also as referenced above, it has been shown that the basement 
membrane and its constitutive components undergo constant remodeling (Kivirikko, et al., 1996)  which has 
implications for anchoring fibril turnover approximately every 60 days  to 90 days (8 weeks to 12 weeks). 
Therefore, the proposed evaluation of key secondary endpoint at Weeks 8 and 10 or 10  and 12 will help 
evaluate durability of the initial treatment.  
2.2.4  Secondary Endpoint  
The secondary endpoint is the mean change in pain sev erity using a VAS score per primary  wound site 
associated with wound dressing changes at Weeks 22, 24, and 2 6 for ages 6 and above  on the primary 
wound pair . For ages below 6  years, the Face Legs Activity Cry and Consolability -Revised (FLACC -R) 
scale will be used . 
2.2.4.1  Secondary Endpoint Rationale  
The secondary endpoint was obtained based on input from patients with DEB, and their caregivers to 
provide a complete understanding of the disease or condition.  
2.2.5  Safety Endpoints  
The safety  and tolerability of B -VEC based on  the assessment of  adverse events, physical examinations, 
vital signs,  and clinical laboratory test  results .   
2.2.5.1  Safety Endpoint Rationale  
Safety endpoints were chosen to obtain a comprehensive picture of overall safety  and tolerability of B-VEC 
across the study period.

4 Study Implementation  
Blood tests, or medical interventions may occur at the discretion of the Principal  Investigator due to clinical 
changes that require evaluation or therapy. Detailed  information  for the study  visits  is provided  in the 
sections  below  and in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). 
4.1 Study Design  
GEM -3 is a multi -center, intra -subject  randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, Phase III study of 
B-VEC for the topical treatment of DEB wounds . A schematic of the study design is shown in  Figure 2 
below.

Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  29 of 63 Figure 2. B-VEC-03 Study Design  
 
  
B-VEC: Beremagene Geperpavec , single dose/wound administered 4 ×108 PFU B -VEC/wound  (<20 cm2), 8 × 108 PFU B -VEC/wound 
(20 to 40 cm2) or 1.2  ×109 PFU B -VEC/wound ( 40 to 60 cm2) , once a week for up to 2 6 week s, Placebo, single matching dose/ wound 
adminstered once a week for up to 2 6 weeks .  
4.1.1  Study Design Rationale  
The primary objective is to determine whether administration of B -VEC in addition to standard of care 
improves wound healing as compared to placebo in children, adolescents, and adults with Dystrophic 
Epidermolysis Bullosa ( DEB) . 
The FDA’s guidance Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases (July 2018) suggests that an intra -subject control 
approach, for such rare skin diseases, may be a useful design . Based on our previous experience  
(completed  B-VEC Phase I/II study) and suggestion s from the guidance  we will continue to use the 
intra-subject  design in the Phase III study. Each subject  will serve as their own control ; subject s will have 
two matched  wounds  (primary  wounds ). The primary wounds will be randomized such that one wound will  
receive B -VEC (active treatment) and the other will receive placebo (inactive treatment). The secondary 
wounds  will receive  B-VEC (active treatment) , not to exceed the Remaining Weekly Dose . Subjects  who 
enrolled under previous protocol versions, where m ore than one wound pair was selected, the Inve stigator’s 
determined  a single pair, most closely matched in size, followed by location, to be used for efficacy analysis, 
following the Agency’s guidance.   
This Phase III protocol is designed to minimize subjec t burden by limiting blood draws  and removing the 
collection of biopsies. Experience from the  phase I/II portion of the B -VEC trial combined with the  advice 
provided in the FDA’s guidance Epidermolysis Bullosa: Developing Drugs for Treatment of Cutaneous 
Manifestations (June 2019)  justifies the proposed design . Molecular correction evaluation from all of the 
subjects from the Phase I/II study have shown full length COL7 expression by Immuno -fluorescence (IF) 
(staining for both NC1 and NC2 antibodies) and/or  anchoring fibrils by Immuno -electron microscopy (IEM). 
We believe that robust molecular correction has been demonstrated with wound healing hence the 
proposed Phase III will mainly focus on evaluation of wound healing as the efficacy endpoint.  
4.1.2  Treatment P eriod  
Each subject  visits the Investigative site at the beginning of the study for Visit 1  (Week 1)  and the matched 
wounds are randomiz ed (if entry criteria are met) and  the assessment /treatment  period  begins  and will 
continue for 2 5 weeks . Additionally, t he subject will return to the Investigative site for a single day  Safety 
Follow -up Visit 30 days ( ±4 days) from the last dose of B -VEC. 

Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  30 of 63 4.1.2.1  Guidance for Subjects Enrolled under Previous Protocol Versions  
Subjects enrolled under previous protocol versions, in which more than one (1) Primary Wound Pair was 
selected, will continue to receive their randomized  treatment  for the duration of the study . However , the 
Investigator will select a single matched pair, which most closely match in both size and  anatomical  location. 
This single Primary Wound Pair will be used for  evaluation  and will be included in the outcome 
measurements.   
For subjects who had more than four (4) Secondary Wounds, no new Secondary Wounds will be selected, 
and treatment will continue on the previously selected Secondary Wounds for the study duration. If subjects 
had less than four (4) Secondary Wounds selected, the Investigator may select additional Secondary 
Wounds , until four (4) have been selected , not exceeding the Weekly Maximum Dose .  
4.2 Study Visits  
Study visit procedures are performed only after a signed informed consent / assent  (as applicable)  is 
obtained. During the study, every effort should be made to adhere to the visit schedule provided in the 
Schedule of Events (Table 1).  
4.2.1  Sequence of Study Procedures  
The following must be taken into account regarding the sequence of study procedures:  
- Questionnaires should be completed with wound  dressing removal during the visit.  The EQ-5D and 
Skindex -29 may be administered at the end of the study visit, for the subject to complete , and return 
at their next scheduled visit.  
- At scheduled visits (refer to Table 1) in which a urine pregnancy test must  be completed, the  test 
must result negative, prior to applying B -VEC or placebo, for women of childbearing potential, as 
determined by the Inves tigator.  
- At visits in which blood is drawn, attempt collection of vital signs prior to the blood draw . 
- On days in which B -VEC and placebo administration(s) occur, all study procedures and 
assessments must occur pre -dose . 
4.2.2  Protocol Deviations  
Any d eviations from the protocol are discouraged. A protocol deviation will be defined as any excursion 
from the protocol, or any instance of protocol noncompliance . If deviations do occur, the Principal 
Investigator must inform the monitor/Sponsor, and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and 
discussed. Any paper documentation must be kept in the Investigator’s File or Subject Binder  and the 
Sponsor will  file in the TMF . If the Investigator determines a deviation is necessary, they are to contact the 
Sponsor prior to the occurrence for approval, if time permits.   
4.2.3  Screening  
If a subject has not undergone genetic testing , which is needed for inclusion crit eria, they may visit the site 
up to 60 days prior to Visit 1 (Week 1) . The genetic test may take 6  to 8 weeks to  obtain  result s.

Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  35 of 63 4.2.13  Early Termination Scheduling  
An early termination (ET) visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject, Investigator or 
Sponsor decides to terminate study treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will be 
required to complete the Safety Follow -up Visit ( ET) visit approximately 30 days ( ±4) after their last dose of 
Investigational Product . 
4.3 Sites and Trial Duration  
Approximately  three (3) sites are planned for this study in the US.   
The trial duration for each subject is about 6 months . A Safety Follow -up Visit occ urring 30 days from the 
date of final treatment with the Investigational Product , B-VEC,  will also occur . 
4.4 Study Restrictions  
Throughout the study assessments period, up to Week 2 6, topical administration of any medication (other 
than B -VEC and placebo) to a study target wound is prohibited, unless approved in advance by the M edical 
Monitor /Sponsor . Secondary wounds that are not naturally occurring, such as wounds that manifest after a 
surgical procedure  are excluded from receiving the Investigational Product.   
4.5 Concomitant Medications and Topical Treatments  
Medications including prescriptions, herbal and dietary supplements, over the counter medications, 
injections,  and topical treatments  the subject has taken within three ( 3) months  prior to the Visit 1 (Week 1)  
or Screening  visit will be obtained and documented. At subsequent visits, medication reviews will occur, 
noting if the medication is continuing or if the subject has begun any new medication.  
Topical concomitant medications or treatments deemed  necessary to provide adequate supportive care to 
non-target wounds may be prescribed  and will be documented on the concomitant medication log . 
Additionally, the Investigator may prescribe Tacrolimus, Clobetasol or Regranex, to be topically applied to 
all study target wounds, during the study .  
4.5.1  Contraception  
Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the Visit 1 (Week 1)  visit and 
must commit to using an acceptable form of contraception during the entire study period, up to three (3) 
months following the last dose of B -VEC. Acceptable forms of contraception include abstinence, intrauterine 
device, oral, implantable,  or injectable contraception, or a combination barrier method, such as female or 
male condom, a diaphragm or cervical cap and a spermicide. Women using oral contraception must have 
consistently been taking their birth control for  three  (3) months prior to Visit 1 (Week 1)  or utilize a 
combination barrier method, as stated above .  
Male subjects must be surgically sterile , prepubescent  or agree to use (you or your childbearing partner) 
an effective form on contraception from  Visit 1 (Week 1)  to three  (3) months fol lowing study completion  (last 
dose of B -VEC) , such as abstinence, intrauterine device, oral, implantable or injectable contraception, or a 
combination barrier method, such as female or male condom, a diaphragm or cervical cap and a 
spermicide.  
4.6 Subject Enro llment  
Written protocol and informed consent approval are required from the IRB prior to enrollment. Assent form 
approval is required from the IRB prior to enrolling subjects below the age of consent. All subject s or their 
respective legal guardians  must p ersonally sign and date the relevant consent  and/or assent  form before 
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  36 of 63 enrollment.  Subjects who withdraw prior to the first B -VEC administration are considered a screen failure 
and are not considered a participant and can be re -screened.  
4.6.1  Subject Identifica tion and Number Assignment  
Subject s who sign the informed consent  form are assigned a 2-digit subject  identification number  within 
each study site. Subject  identification numbers  at each site  begin  with the specific 2 -digit study site number 
(assigned by the Sponsor) followed by th e subject’s specific 2 -digit subject number (XX -XX). This number 
identifies  the subject  throughout the study and must be used on all study documen tation related to that 
subject.

20 to 40 cm2 8×108 PFU/wound  
40 to 60 cm2 1.2×109 PFU/wound 
At Visit 1 (Week 1) the wounds will be measured by an Investi gator using a validated Canfield photography 
quanti tation  system. The unit dose will be determined based on this initial measurement , which is recorded 
in the CRF,  for the Treatment  Cycle and will not exceed the Maximum Weekly Dose  based on the Subject’s 
age at the time of the vi sit. Subsequent Secondary Wounds , not selected at Week 1, will have the wound 
area determined during their initial selection . If a Secondary wound selected , exceeds 60cm2, split the 
wound , to allow it to meet the unit dose criteria  above,  and treat accordingly.  
Two matched wounds (Primary Wound Pair)  will be selected to evaluate the primary and key secondary 
end point s. The  Primary Wound Pair will be randomized, such that one wound  in the pair  will receive  one-
unit dose of  B-VEC and the o ther will receive placebo for a Treatment  Cycle. One unit of B -VEC or placebo 
weekly for 2 6 weeks , to evaluate durability and repeat dosing . During the study , the originally selected 
wound , as well as  neighboring wound s in proximity  (approximately 2 -3cm) to the originally selected wound , 
may receive treatment  and will receive treatment until both the originally selected wound and its neighboring 
wounds  have closed . Avoid application if  a neighboring  secondary  wound is  near a primary wound or 
another primar y wound . Weekly treatment on th e wound will resume when that original wound or

Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  37 of 63 neighboring wounds to the originally selected wound re-opens , as determined by the Investigator at a 
weekly visit .  
Unmatched Secondary open wounds  (up to four (4) maximum)  may be treated if there is remaining Weekly 
Dose available. For example: if a 12 month old  subject , presents with a primary wound pair  of 24 cm2 then 
the remaining weekly dose during a weekly visit = (1.6×109 PFU –8×108 PFU)= 8×108 PFU (i.e. there would 
be enough remaining weekly dose to treat  one (1) 20cm2 to 40cm2 secondary  wound ). A neighboring wound 
in close proximately (approximately 2 -3cm) to the originally selected wound may receive treatment . 
Treatment to the area will resume until the area is closed. However, avoid application  to neighboring 
wounds  in close proximity to the matched wounds .

Dose by Wound Area of 4 .0×108 PFU/20 cm2, are based on efficacy and safety data obtained from similar 
dosing regimens in the Phase II study.  Out of the 9 subjects enrolled in the Phase II study, the maximum 
weekly dose per subject ranged from 1.2×109 PFU/week to 6.0×109 PFU/week (median 4.2×109 PFU/week, 
average 2.6×109 PFU/week) with no B -VEC related adverse events .  
The proposed weekly dose of 3 .2×109 PFU falls within the doses administered to patients in Phase II. 
Furthermore, robust efficacy as eviden t by wound healing supported by molecular correction was observed 
(“surrogate measurement”) with no drug related safety events . 
The dose and the weekly dosing regimen proposed is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of B -VEC in 
subjects  chronically  open  wounds . The unit dose is based on a wound area of ≤20  cm2 because 80% of 
RDEB wounds are in the ≤20 cm2 range and occasionally span 40 to 60 cm2 or larger (Eng, et al. 2020) .  
In the Phase II study, 18 wounds ≤20 cm2 were given a unit dose between (2.0 ×108 to 6.0  ×108) PFU for 
5 consecutive treatments, daily or every other day. Therefore, a unit dose of 4.0 ×108 PFU to treat wounds 
≤20 cm2 is well within the unit dose range  seen  in the Phase II study.  
Furtherm ore, the following Maximum Weekly dose is based off the average body surface area for pediatric 
subjects below the age of 6 (Center for Disease Control 2002)  (Nelson, et al. 2006) . A proposed fixed dose 
based on age group  was determined to mitigate dosing error and allows for better compliance from the 
Investigator (Shi and Derendorf 2010) .  
The proposed unit dose by wound area and maximum weekly dose were both safe and e fficacious based 
on the results of the Phase II trial . 
5.2 Preparation and Dispensing  
Investigational Product  may be dispensed under the supervision of the Investigator or an authorized 
designee and only for the application/administration of study subjects. Fu rther details on preparation and 
application can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.3 Packaging and Labeling  
Both the Methocel™ and the B -VEC will be packaged in vials. The labeling will be in compliance with 
applicable local and national regulations. Further details on packaging, dispensing, and labeling can be 
found in the Pharmacy Manual .  
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  38 of 63 5.4 Storage and Handling  
While at the clinical site, the Investigator, or an authorized designee, will ensure that all study products are  
stored in a secure location, under re commended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements. For further instructions refer to the Pharmacy Manual .  
5.5 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or authorized unblinded designee will maintain information regarding the date s and 
amounts of study products received , Investigational Product  dispensed to the individual subjects, and study 
products  that may have been damaged in a shipment. These materials are retained by the site according 
to the Sponsor representative. The study  products and Investigational Product  will be monitored throughout 
the study by a designated monitor, who will review all records and inventory.  
5.6 Drug Disposal, Returns, or Retaining Used Drug  
The pharmacist and or unblinded authorized designee will retain  all vials used to mix the Investigational 
Product  as well as empty  syringes, as applicable, for subject administration until the study monitor has 
performed accountability. The  monitor will provide confirmation that the vials /syringes  may be disposed of 
(both used and unused drug inventory). If  authorization for onsite destruction is granted, the Investigator 
will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable policies and guidelines. 
Destruction will be documented.  
5.7 Blinding and Unbl inding  
The subjects (including their caregivers) and Investigator as well as Sub -Investigator (conducting outcome 
related assessments and procedures) will be blinded to the identity of treatment for the Primary Wounds. 
The un -blinded staff, including the p harmacist or authorized designee, and the monitor will remain separate 
from the primary study team and will not be involved in any study conduct outside their functions of 
managing the receipt, storage, preparation, dispensing and reconciliation of all stu dy products. All un -
blinded material will be secured in a secondary locked location, that is not accessible to the primary study 
team.  
The following precautions will be taken to ensure the integrity of the study blind to minimize potential impact 
on interp retation and of other efficacy and safety measurements:  
- In order to maintain the blind, if a matched wound  is determined to be closed at a weekly visit, the 
Remaining Dose will not be used to treat Secondary Wounds  and Secondary Wounds will be 
capped at fo ur (4) .  
- In addition, treatment may be unblinded in a medical emergency. Materials will be provided to the 
site for emergency unblinding and will be maintained in a secure location where study personnel 
access is limited.  
In the case of a medical emergenc y necessitating unblinding, the Investigator or designee should, whenever 
possible, contact the Medical Monitor/Sponsor directly, prior to breaking the blind to discuss if unblinding 
needs to occur. If unblinding must occur, the designated unblinded staff may provide the information to the 
Investigator and this must be captured on the CRF. If unblinded for any reason this must be reported to the 
Sponsor.  
5.8 Wound Selection  
One (1) matched wound pair will be  selected to be part of the study , that meet the inclusion criteria  (Figure  
3).  
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  39 of 63 Prior to randomization, wounds will be  selected and  labeled . The Primary Wound Pair will be labeled  P1 & 
P2. For the Primary Wound Pair, one is randomized to B -VEC and one to Placebo.  
Up to four (4) Secondary  unmatched wounds may be chosen to receive  the Remaining Weekly Dose of  B-
VEC. Secondary wounds will be labeled as they are selected starting with S1, S 2, S3 and S4 .  
Figure 3. Wound Pairing, Labeling, and Selection Example  
 
5.9 Wound Randomization  
Using a pre -generated randomization schedule, the matched wounds  are randomized to receive either B -
VEC or Placebo gel.  
5.10 Post -Administration Procedures  
Following Investigational Product  application, the subject will keep the treated wounds covered for roughly 
24 hours .

6.1 Timing of Assessments  
Timing of assessments must be performed per the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). 
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1  Wound Assessments  
6.2.1.1  Wound Measurement and Imaging  
Target wound s are imaged and measured on the study days outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). 
Wound assessments should be performed by the PI. A trained, qualified Sub -I should only perform the 
wound assessments if the PI is unavailable . A validated Canfield tracing  and imaging system will be used 
for the study.  Trace where IP will be applied at each weekly visit , including the neighboring wounds  and the 
originally selected wound, as applicable . Additional information about the Canfield system can be found in 
Appendix 1. Image the wounds in the same order and orientation at each visit.  
6.2.1.2  Investigator Assessment of Complete Wound Closure  
Investigator Assessment of Complete Wound Closure will be performed at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table 1) after removal of subject’s dressings from target wound s prior to any potential 
disruption of the target wounds (i.e., markings, bacterial cultu re of wounds for clinical purposes , or B-VEC 
administration).  
The Investigator Assessment of Complete Wound Closure of Primary and Secondary w ounds should be 
performed by the PI. A trained, medically qualified Sub -I should only perform if the PI is unavail able. 
Evaluator information  will be recorded on the applicable assessments.   
In order to reduce inter -evaluator variability, it is important that the same evaluator assess complete wound 
closure for the same subject at all  study visits, whenever feasible. If it is not possible for the same evaluator 
to continue performing the assessment, it is recommended that the primary and subsequent evaluator both 
examine and discuss their respective scoring during at least one visit.  
Wound healing will be defined as complete closure of the originally selected wound surface identified at 
baseline , specified as skin re -epithelialization without drainage, as evaluated by the Investigator.  If new 
neighboring wounds form during the key eval uation time periods at Weeks 8, 10 12, 22, 24 and 26 those 
wounds will not be included in the wound closure evaluation.  Primary efficacy wound assessment occurring 
at two (2) consecutive weeks at Week 22  and 24 or 24 and 26 will be assessed  live, followed by a review 
against the 2D and 3D images.  
6.2.2  Pain Reported Outcome  
6.2.2.1  Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability Revised Scale (FLACC -R) 
The Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability - Revised Scale (FLACC -R) will be completed at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 1) following the removal of the dressings on the matched wounds 
(Primary  Wound Pair) .  
The FLACC -R Scale is used for children, under 6 years of age, who cannot accurately report their pain, 
due to being too young or not being able to understand what is being asked of them. A child is evaluated 
for each Primary Wound dressing c hange and will receive either a 0, 1 or 2 in each category based off of 
their behavior during the dressing removal. A total score is then calculated by study personnel, to determine 
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  41 of 63 the overall pain and discomfort a subject is experiencing.  The subject’s c aregiver will complete the scale at 
scheduled visits.  
It is important that the same caregiver completes the assessment at all subject visits, whenever feasible, 
to reduce inter -evaluator variability.  Additionally, this scale should continue to be used thr oughout the study 
even if the age of the subject changes during the study.  
The FLACC -R is provided in  Appendix 2. 
6.2.2.2  Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  
The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be completed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 1) following the removal of the dressings on the matched wounds . VAS uses  a 10cm line  with 1cm 
tick marks , where subject s indicate their level of pain by marking the appropriate tick mark on the scale 
from 0  cm (no pain) to 10  cm (the worst possible pain ). VAS is used to provide indices of overall pain 
intensity  during the dressing change.  
VAS will be administered to subjects 6 years of age and older, who will complete assessment themselves 
(Appendix 3).  
6.3 Safety Assessments  
6.3.1  Medical and Medication History  
The Investigator or delegated staff performs a complete medical history  (from the time of birth), including a 
medication history  and procedure and treatment history within the past (3) months . The Investigator  or 
delegated  staff must record all clinically or medically relevant information. Medical , procedure/tr eatment 
and medication history are reviewed and updated during the study. All medication taken within the past (3) 
three  months from  Screening or  Visit 1 (Week 1)  (including prescriptions, herbal and dietary supplements, 
over the counter medications, injections,  and topical treatments) will be recorded on the CRF. The medical 
history includes respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, hematological, 
neurological, psychiatric,  and other diseases.   
6.3.2  Physical/Skin Examination  
A qualified individual perform s a complete  physical examination . Body systems evaluated include:  
General appearance  Skin 
HEENT (Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat)  Spine/Neck/Thyroid  
Respiratory  Cardiovascular  
Abdomen  Nervous System  
Musculoskeletal   
Abnormalities or changes in severity  noted during the exam  should be reported in the source document 
and on the appropriate CRF page and recorded as an AE , if noted after the initial exam .  
Abbreviated exams include evaluations of the general appearance; HEENT; abdomen; and skin  will be 
compared against the original exam  (i.e., if noted to be “abnormal skin” with erosions at the baseline, a 
subsequent visit exam would be  considered  “normal ,” if the findings are consistent to the baseline exam) . 
At other vi sits, symptom -directed PEs can be performed  at the discretion of the Investigator.   
If at any point in the study a skin cancer occurs in the region of the B-VEC administration, attempts are 
made to collect samples of the skin cancer to evaluate cells for t he presence of viral vector .

Vital sign measurements  include pulse, respiratory rate as well as temperature. Pulse and respiratory rate 
are taken after subject s are in a rested state. The method used for temperature measurement is at the 
discretion of the Investigator ; however , the same method should be used throughout the study.  Changes 
in vital signs that are reviewed and determined to be not clinically significant by the Investigator are not 
considered AEs.  
On visits in which a blood dr aw occurs, vitals should be collected prior to the blood draw.  
Vital signs are assessed monthly during the 2 6 weeks (i.e. Week 1; 5; 9; 13; 17 ; 21; 25; and SFU/ET ). 
Symptom -directed vital sign assessments can be performed  at the discretion of the Investigator.  
6.3.4  Laboratory Evaluations  
6.3.4.1  Complete Metabolic Panel with Direct Bilirubin & Compete Blood Count with Differential 
and Platelets  
The amount  of blood collected should be minimized . Reference ranges are used to assess the laboratory 
data for clinical significance. Abnormal laboratory values which are unexpected or not explained by the 
subject ’s clinical condition should be repeated as feasible until confirmed, explained,  or resolved. Changes 
from baseline  (Screening or Visi t 1) are recorded as an AE if deemed clinically significant  by the Investigator 
or qualified designee.

6.4 Principal Investigator  
At each study site, a physician with expertise caring for patients with DEB will be designated as the Principal 
Investigator (PI). In close communication and coordination with the study monitor and Sponsor, the PI will 
have the following responsibilities in addition to overseeing all other study processes at their site . 
6.4.1  Protocol Adherence  
The Investigator will review  deviations from the clinical protocol (e.g., lab results not within stated limits, 
additional clinical abnormalities not specified in protocol, exceptions to target wound criteria.) The  PI or  
designee will consult with the study monitor and Sponsor as required. All deviations from the protocol must 
be documented and handled per institutional /Sponsor  policies . 
6.4.2  Treatments  
The Investigator  will d etermine treatments  needed from complications that may arise,  either due to  the 
underlying disease (e.g., low hemoglobin or hematocrit, wound infection, other medical conditions) or B -
VEC application ( adverse events, wound infection, post -release criteria out of specificatio n); Determine if 
the subject needs additional wound or systemic treatments; Determine which procedures will occur at 
unscheduled visits; Determine  corrective actions for adverse events; and  Determine whether to re -treat or 
perform additional treatment sess ions post-adverse event . 
6.4.3  Safety Assessments  
The Investigator  will review and assess all adverse events (e.g., severity, causality); Assess laboratory 
results for clinically significant abnormalities; and assess vital signs  including  blood pressure, tempera ture, 
and heart rate at every visit  per the schedule of events ( Table 1 ) and perform abbreviated physical 
examination for clinically significant abnormalities.  
6.4.4  Adverse Events  
Throughout the course of the study ( following the initial IP application ), all a dverse events  (AEs) will be 
monitored and reported on the AE Log. If an  adverse event occurs, the first concern will be the safety of 
the study participants. All AEs occurring after administration will be followed throughout the study.  All AEs 
related to study treatments or procedures will be followed until resolved  or stabilized or until follow -up is no 
longer possible.

Confidential   Page  44 of 63 In general, even when not participating in a clinical trial, the study subjects and their caretakers 
communicate with their EB doctor on a regular basis via phone. Study subjects and their caretakers will be 
instructed to report via phone any adverse events that occur during the study while off -site. The events will 
then be transcribed to the AE Log. The Investigator is responsible for veri fying  that all serious and non -
serious adverse event are reported to the appropriate regulatory bodies.  
6.5 Definitions  
6.5.1  Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject  administered 
an investigational  product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, disease or exacerbation of a pre -existing condition tempo rally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.   
Subject s are asked a non -leading question in order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs . The question is asked in 
an open manner using language such as: “Have you experienced any change in your health or in your 
general condition since your last visit?”  
It is important to question the subject  in a non -leading way about changes in their health or concomitant 
medication usage since their last visit. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a li st of symptoms should 
be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each symptom should be listed individually.  
Each AE requires a complete description including date of onset and corrective actions taken. The intensity 
of the AE , its relationship to  the Investigational Product,  as well as its outcome, must be recorded in the  
eCRF .  
Symptoms of the disease under study/lack of efficacy should not be considered as AEs, as long as they 
are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease . However, significant 
worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE . 
A change in the value of a safety laboratory evaluation can represent an AE if the change is clinically 
relevant (as determined by the Investigator) or if, during t reatment with B-VEC, a shift of a parameter is 
observed from a normal value to a pathological value, or a further worsening of an already pathological 
value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until  
return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with B-VEC, 
and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, shoul d be taken into 
consideration. The Investigator should decid e, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject , whether a change in a laboratory parameter represents an AE. For pathological laboratory values 
that were not present at baseline, follow -up laboratory evaluations should be performed until the values 
return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation is found.  
AEs should be recorded  after the initial IP application  through SFU /ET. AEs  are to be recorded on the 
appropriate AE pages in the CRF and in source documents. Wher e possible, all AEs should be followed to 
resolut ion, or an outcome is reached.  
Medical tests and examinations are performed, as appropriate, to document resolution of event(s).  Where 
applicable and/or possible, AEs should be recorded as target wound specific.  
Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 as applicable.

Confidential   Page  45 of 63 6.5.2  Immune Response Adverse Events  
Observation of a severe immune response determined by the Investigator to be possibly, probably,  or 
definitely related to B-VEC should be relayed to the Medical Monitor/Sponsor .  
6.5.3  Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) i s any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to 
B-VEC or not) that at any dose:  
- Is fatal  
- Is life -threatening  (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
- Is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
- Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  
A hospitalization meeting the regulatory requirement for the “serious” criteria is any in patient  hospital 
admission that includes a minimum of  an overnight stay in a health care facility , that was not planned .  
Any event that does not exactly meet this definition , yet in the investigator’s opinion represents a significant 
hazard can be assigned the “other significant hazard” regulatory reporting  serious criteria.  
Additionally, important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but that may jeopardize the subject  or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above, or result  in urgent investigation, may be considered serious. Examples include allergic 
bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias.  
SAEs are collected and reported  after the initial IP application  through SFU/ET . If early termination of study 
treatment occurs , SAEs continue to be collected until the event resolves.  
6.6 Severity  
Definitions for classification of severity appear below. The Investigator will review these  definitions with the 
subject . The Investigator will determine the severity classification based o n these definitions, their clinical 
experience with DEB subjects , and/or the subject ’s description of the event.   
[Note: A “severe” AE is not the same as an “SAE” (serious adverse event), which is defined  above.]  
Mild (Grade 1) : Symptoms are barely noticeable or do not make the subject  uncomfortable.  The 
AE does not influence performance or functioning. Prescription  drugs are not ordinarily needed for 
relief of symptom(s).  
Moderate  (Grade 2) : Symptoms are of sufficient severity t o make the subject  uncomfortable.  
Performance of daily activities is influenced. Treatment of symptom(s) with  prescription drugs or 
therapies may be needed.  
Severe  (Grade 3) : Symptoms are of sufficient severity to cause the subject  severe discomfort.  
Perfo rmance of daily activities is compromised. Treatment for symptom(s)  with prescription drugs 
or therapies may be needed.  
Life-threatening (Grade 4):  Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the 
Investigator, at immediate risk of death  
6.7 Relationship  
The Investigator will categorize the subject ’s adverse event as one of the following:  
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  46 of 63 Not Related:  No evidence of any causal relationship with the trial intervention . An alternative 
etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
Unlikely Related: Little evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. the event did not occur 
within a reasonable time after administration of the Investigational  Product ) or another reasonable 
explanation for the event (e.g. another clinical condition or other concomitant treatment).  
Possibly Related:  Some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. occurrence within a 
reasonable time after administration of the  Investigational Product ), but other factors may have 
contributed to the event (e.g. another clinical condition or other concomitant treatment).  
Related: Evidence that there is an association between the event and the administration of the trial 
medication. Causes other than the Investigational Product have been ruled out and/or the event 
re-appeared on re -exposure to the Investigational Product.  
6.8 Study IP Action Taken  
The Investigator will classify the study IP action taken as a result of the AE. The action taken will be one of 
the following:  
Dose Not Changed:  Study IP  application was  not changed in response to an AE  
Drug Interrupted : Study IP application was interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug Withdrawn: Study IP application was permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not Applicable:  Action taken regarding study IP application  does not apply. Not  applicable will be 
used in such circumstances such that the AE began after treatment completed.  
6.9 Outcome  
The AE will be followed until the Investigator determines and provides a final outcome. Adverse event 
outcomes are classified as on e of the following:  
Recovered/resolved:  AE resolved with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with sequelae : AE resolved but symptoms remain,  and a new baseline is 
established since full recovery is not expected (if Lyme’s disease is the AE, the sequelae may be 
facial paralysis)  
Not recovered/ resolved (continuing) : AE has either no improvement or partial improvement, 
such that the AE remains o ngoing  
Fatal : Outcome of AE is death and may possibly be related to study IP as determined by the 
investigator  
Unknown : The outcome of the AE is unknown  (example lost to follow -up) 
6.10 Reporting Procedures  
All adverse events occurring after B-VEC administrati on observed by the Investigator or reported by the 
subject  (whether  or not attributed to B-VEC), are reported on the case report form.  
Medically significant adverse events considered related to B-VEC by the Investigator or the Sponsor are 
followed until r esolved or considered stable. The Investigator must assign the following attributes: 
description; dates of onset and resolution; severity; assessment of relatedness to B-VEC, and action taken. 
The Investigator may be asked to provide follow -up information.   
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  47 of 63 All deaths occurring on study must be reported to the Sponsor ; available autopsy reports and relevant 
medical reports may be requested.  
The Investigator should noti fy the IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse 
event re ports received from the Sponsor , in accordance with local procedures.  
It is left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an adverse event is of sufficient severity to 
require the subject ’s removal from study . A subject  may also voluntarily withdraw from study  due to what 
he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event. If either of these occurs, the subject  is asked to  
undergo an early termination  assessment and be given appropriate care under medical supervision un til 
symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable. If the subject  was permanently withdrawn from the study 
due to a serious adverse event, this information must be included in either the initial or follow -up Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form, and in the E nd of Study Case Report Form.  
6.10.1  SAE Reporting Procedures  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur after IP application  must be reported to the Sponsor . All 
subject s with an SAE must be  followed and the outcomes reported. The Investigator should supply th e 
Sponsor and the  IRB with any additional requested information (e.g., hospital discharge summary, autopsy  
reports and terminal medical reports). The Sponsor shall evaluate all SAEs and determine  if they meet FDA 
reporting requirements . In the event of an SAE,  the Investigator must:  
1. Notify the Sponsor  within  24 hours  of the Investigator’s awareness of the event.  
2. Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from 
colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject.  
3. Provide the Sponsor with a complete, written case history, including copies of supporting reports 
(e.g., progress notes, laboratory reports) and a statement from the Investigator as to whether or 
not the event was related to the use of B-VEC.  
4. Promptly inform the governing IRB /IEC of the event if  it is related. For other SAEs, notify the 
governing IRB as required by the IRB, local regulations, and the governing health authorities.  
Immediately report any SAE that meets the following to the  Medical Monitor/Sponsor and suspend study 
intervention:  
1. Occurrence of an SAE related or possibly related to the study intervention,  
2. Systemic infection determined to be related to B -VEC,  
3. Outside information is discovered that may affect the study and its p articipants.  
6.10.2  Pregnancy  
The Investigator must report all pregnancies to the Sponsor within 24  hours  of their first knowledge of the 
pregnancy. If a subject become pregnant , they must be terminated from the study immediately. Pregnancies 
occurring up to three ( 3) months after the last application of B -VEC must be reported to the Investigator. 
The Investigator should counsel the subject on the potential risks of continuing the pregnancy and possible 
effects of the fetus. The female subject or their pregnan t partner will be followed until the end of pregnancy. 
The infant will be followed for a year after birth if consent has been obtained to do so. Pregnancy itself is 
not considered an AE; however spontaneous abortion is.  
6.11 Data Monitoring Board Review and Reg ulatory Reporting  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for this study. The DSMB will be responsible 
for ensuring the safety of the subjects and to alert the Sponsor of any safety issues related to the conduct 
of the study. Members will  be completely independent Investigators who have no financial, scientific, or

conflicts of interest, as well as DSMB  objectives,  operational details  and meeting scheduling are provided 
in the DSMB Charter . 
The following will require reporting  by the Investigator  to the Sponsor for DSMB discussion : 
- Occurrence of an unexpected SAE related or possibly related to the study intervention  
- Systemic infection det ermined to be related to B -VEC 
- Evidence of allergic reaction at B -VEC treatment site  
- Evidence of malignancy at B-VEC treatment site  
- Death of a study participant  
The DSMB provides recommendations about stopping or continuing the trial and has the authority to 
recommend dose or regimen modifications for safety concerns. The DSMB may also make 
recommendations regarding the selection or retention of participants, their management, improving 
adherence to protocol -specified regimens, and the procedures for data m anagement and quality control.  
The end of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversight is approximately six (6) months after the 
last subject is enrolled.  More information can be found in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan and DSMB 
Charter.  
6.12 Expedited Re porting and Safety Letters  
Krystal Biotech, Inc. is responsible for reporting any suspected, unexpected, serious, adverse reactions 
and unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions involving the Investigational Product 
to all regulator y authorities, IRB/IECs, and other participating Investigators in accordance with ICH GCP 
and local regulatory authorities as applicable.  
Krystal Biotech, Inc. will be responsible for submitting Safety Letters to central IRB/IEC. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator or designee to promptly notify local IRB/IEC of any of the events above, 
which involve risk to the human subject.  
6.13 Safety Monitoring  
The Medical Monitor /Sponsor  will assess aggregate safety data across study sites on an ongoing basis. 
Routine  meetings  of the DSMB  will be held every six (6) months at minimum or at the DSMB’s  request.  Safety 
data,  primary  safety  endpoints,  all grade  3 and 4 adverse  events,  and all serious  adverse  events  will be 
reviewed on a regular basis.  
7 Study Completion  
7.1 Long Term Follow -Up Protocol  
The study will end after the last enrolled subject has completed the SFU/ ET visit. 
After the SFU /ET visit subject s will have the option to enroll in a long -term follow -up protocol under this 
IND, in which they will be followed for  five ( 5) additional  years  after the SFU /ET Visit. 
Any subject  who completes the study, discontinue s early, or withdraw s from the study after receipt of B-VEC 
will be asked to participate in the Long-Term Follow -Ip protocol . The subjec t will have the option to not 
follow  the Investigator’s  suggestions, but attempts will still be made to contact the subject. If a subject  does 
not follow directions or refuses to return for follow -up, attempts will still be made to evaluate them or to have  
their local physician evaluate them.

Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  49 of 63 7.2 Discontinuation, Withdrawal, Lost to Follow -Up, or Early Termination  
Subjects who discontinue due to adverse events or protocol deviations/violations will be replaced at the 
discretion of the Sponsor. Subjects who with draw prior to the first B -VEC administration are considered a 
screen failure and are not considered a participant and can be re -screened.  
A subject  is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to their future 
medical care  by the physician or at the institution. The Investigator or Sponsor may also withdraw the 
subject  at any time in the interest of subject  safety  or for other reasons . Criteria for withdrawal include:  
- Consent/assent is withdrawn  
- The subject  refuses treatmen t and/or procedures/observations  
- Occurrence of unmanageable adverse events or pregnancy  
- For other reasons (e.g., significant protocol violation, non -compliance)  
The Sponsor may be contacted if clarification is required.  The primary reason for withdrawal mu st be 
recorded on the CRF. Comments or complaints made by the subject  must also be recorded on the CRF. 
Withdrawal should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to withdrawal when possible. This 
information will be communicated to the DSMB at each mee ting in the enrollment update . 
A subject may withdraw at any time but treated participants will be followed yearly for at least 5 years  in a 
Long -Term  Follow -up Protocol . The subject will have the option to not follow the Principal Investigator’s 
suggestions, but attempts will still be made to contact the participant.  
If the subject  withdraws for other reasons, attempt s will be made  to contact them at least once per year to 
perform  safety monitoring as described above . Subjects may be contacted more frequently if it is d eemed 
necessary by the investigator . If a subject  is lost to follow up, the attempts to contact the subject will be 
documented  in an effort to show due diligence.  If a subject  is terminated early from the study, the same 
process as for “withdrawal” of a subject  will be followed  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study.  
8 Statistical Considerations  
Continuous variables will be summarized in tables and will inc lude the number of subjects , mean, standard 
deviation (SD), percent of coefficient of variance (CV%), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical 
variables will be presented in tables as frequencies and percentages. A  statistical analysis plan (SAP) will 
provide additional details on the approach to the analysis and data displays.  
8.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The following hypothesis for the primary endpoint of the proportion of DEB wounds sites with complete 
wound healing (CWH) from baseline  in B-VEC versus placebo treated intra -subject wound sites at Weeks 
22 and 24 or 24 and 26 as determined by the Investigator will be tested:  
Null Hypothesis  H0:  %CWH in B -VEC =  %CWH in Placebo   
Alternate Hypothesis  H1:  %CWH in B -VEC >  %CWH in Placebo   
Where %  CWH is the percentage of primary wounds with a complete wound healing from baseline at Week 
22 and 24 or 24 and 2 6.  A two-sided significance level of 0.05 is considered .  
The complete wound healing is defined as 100% wound closure from  the exact wound area selected at  
baseline, specified as skin re -epithelialization without drainage.  If new neighboring wounds form around the 
Krystal Biotech, Inc.  B-VEC-03 
Phase III  Protocol  Version 1.4  
 
Confidential   Page  50 of 63 original traced baseline wound during the primary evaluation time points , these areas  will not be included 
in the  evaluation.  
 The primary endpoint is defined as wounds that meet any of the following conditions:  
• Healed on Week 22 and Week 24, or  
• Healed on Week 24 and Week 26.  
Only wounds that are healed for at least two (2) consecutive weeks are counted as positive  
responses.  
8.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The following hypothesis for the key se condary endpoint of the p roportion of primary wound sites with 
complete wound healing from baseline , in B-VEC-treated versus baseline at Week 8 and 10 or 10  and 12  
(as determined by the Investigator ) will be tested:  
Null Hypothesis  H0:  %CWH in B -VEC =  %CWH in Placebo   
Alternate Hypothesis  H1:  %CWH in B -VEC >  %CWH in Placebo   
Where %  CWH is the percentage of matched wound  sites with a complete wound healing fro m baseline at 
Week 8 and 10 or 10  and 12 . A two-sided significance level of 0.05 is considered.   
The complete wound healing is defined as 100% wound closure from  the exact wound area selected at  
baseline, specified as skin re -epithelialization without drainage.  If new neighboring wounds form around the 
original traced baseline wound during the secondary evaluation time points these areas will not be included 
in the evaluation.   
 The secondary ke y endpoint is defined as wounds that meet any of the following conditions:  
• Healed on Week 8 and Week 10, or  
• Healed on Week 10 and Week 12.  
Only wounds that are healed for at least two (2) consecutive weeks are counted as positive 
responses.  
8.3 Number of Subjects  
Per Agency’s recommendation, a McNemar Test has been used for sample size calculation. In the Phase 
I/II study, the response rates for Weeks 8 through 12 were from 70 -100% for wounds randomized to B -VEC 
and 0 -33% for wounds randomized to placebo, respectively. Therefore, assuming a response rate of 75% 
among wounds randomized to B -VEC and a response rate of 25% among wounds randomized to p laceb o, 
with 90% power and a two -sided Type 1 error rate of 5%, 24 subjects (i.e., 24 wound pairs) are required.  
8.4 Data Management  
Pre-designed  CRFs are used to collect information  for safety and proof of mechanism analyse s. An 
electronic CRF (eCRF)  is mana ged and maintained by the S ponsor  for this study. The eCRF  is constructed 
based on the  CRF data entry requirements of the protocol .  Data queries are generated and resolved  within 
the eCRF . In addition, range checks of the eCRF fields, plausibility and con sistency checks across eCRF 
pages will be performed to assess consistency, accuracy and completeness of the data collected and 
entered into the eCRF. Standard SAS datasets are generated and prov ided for analysis.

The study has a complete randomized -block design in which each subject serves as a block to receive all 
of the treatment conditions.  In this study, each subject provides at least one pair of target wounds with one 
wound from each pair being treated with B -VEC and the other wound from each pair with placebo in the 
primary target wound pair. Efficacy measurements are taken multiple times (or repeatedly) over the on -
treatment period from each subject.  
All data will be presented using summary statistics or frequency tables, as appropriate, and will be analyzed 
for superiority comparisons between B -VEC and placebo treatments. The description of the sample will be 
done using summary statistic s (n, mean, standard deviation, median, and maximum/minimum) for 
continuous data and using frequency statistics (counts and percentages) for categorical data. Hypothesis

Confidential   Page  60 of 63 Appendix 1: Procedure for Digital Photography Using RUBI 3D 
Imaging  
Canfield RUBI 3D Imaging System:  
• iPad with Occipital Scanner and Canfield custom external flash  
• Canfield Capture Mobile Application (software includes modules for capturing, viewing, measuring,  
and exporting 2D and 3D object data).  
Proper Subject Preparation & Positioning:  
For the duration of the study , the only variable that should change is the are a of interest.  Any extraneous 
objects (jewelry, makeup, clothing, etc.) should be eliminated from the field to be photographed.   
For optimal imaging of the skin surface, the subject’s photographic target wound area must be non -shiny/dry 
and clean (free o f any extraneous items, e.g. lint).  There must be no hair  in the photographic target area 
field of view.  Any hair within the target area field of view must be cut/trimmed (ideally shaved) from the 
region prior to imaging.  
Careful preparation and positio ning of the subject are critical to the accuracy of the image capture. Capture 
images in a well -lit room with the same lighting, throughout the study.  
Photographic Procedures:  
1. Prior to capturing the subject images using the camera system, the photographer launches the 
Canfield Capture Mobile Application.  
2. The photographer either creates a New Subject for an initial visit or, for a return subject, highlights 
the appropriate existing Subject ID listed in the Canfield Capture database.  The visit name (as per 
the study schedule) is selected by the photographer and the image date is captured by the software.  
3. Positioning the Subject correctly in relation to the camera system depends on where the target area 
is located on the body.  
4. With the Subject’s target area p ositioned correctly within the frame of the camera system, the 
Photographer adjusts the camera distance for accurate image capture.  The initial reference image 
is a 2D image capture.  
5. The Photographer then captures the 3D image following the model on the s creen.  Once complete, 
the photographer is prompted to review the 3D build of the data model for image acceptability.  The 
Photographer either accepts the image and moves on to the next capture or does not accept and 
recaptures the image.   
6. After the 3D im age capture the image is displayed for measurement.  The Investigator or assigned 
Designee,  will annotate the involved wound area and the software will report the surface area 
measurement (cm²). If the target area is considered closed, the healed checkbox may be marked.  
7. Following the session, the Photographer submits the images to Canfield. Upon exiting, the software 
automatically reads, checksums, encrypts, packages, and duplicates the data to submit to Canfield 
via internet submission.   
A secure, validat ed, compliant web server set up at Canfield is used for secure transfer of study images by 
study sites.  Images are to be transferred the day they are recorded.  Only approved individuals by the 
Sponsor have access to the  website.

completed.   
8. Trained Canfield staff review the data files for technical quality and acceptability and communicate 
any technical comments to the site.  
9. Data Tr ansfers are provided to sponsor as per the data transfer specifications.  At the end of the 
study, a copy of site -specific subject images will be provided to each site.  This is in addition to the 
Photography Result Reports available for printing from the Clinical Services Website after each 
session.  Remote access to all images by the Sponsor is also provided.   
10. Canfield will provide each study site with the necessary hardware as well as technical support as 
needed.  All supplied photographic equipment rem ains the property of Canfield.  Any questions 
regarding the photographic portion of this study are to be forwarded to the assigned Project 
Manager at Canfield Scientific.

2.1 Background
9.5 PharmacokineticsAddition to background:
Rodatristat ethyl is a prodrug for the active tryptophan 
hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) inhibitor rodatristat.  In vitro, 
nonclinical, and human pharmac okinetic (PK) studies to 
date have provided valuab le information on the PK 
properties of rodatristat et hyl and its active moiety, 
rodatristat. Rodatristat ethyl has low to moderate oral 
bioavailability in nonclinical  species and is rapidly 
converted to rodatristat in vivo. Both rodatristat ethyl 
and rodatristat are highly protein bound and little is 
excreted in the urine.  Bilia ry excretion predominates in 
rats and no further metabolism of rodatristat has been detected in human hepatocyte preparations. However, 
preliminary investigations have also identified a 
metabolite, M15, in the plasma  of dogs and humans after 
administration of rodatrista t ethyl. After single-dose 
administration, the half-life of rodatristat ethyl and 
rodatristat are approximately 5 and 12 hours, respectively, reaching steady-state exposure, according 
to trough concentrations, by Day 5.  The highest 
exposures achieved in healt hy subjects to date were 
reached on Day 7 following 800 mg twice daily (BID) 
doses of rodatristat ethyl.
Addition of M15 metabolite in PK section.A metabolite 
profiling study 
performed in dogs led to the 
identification of 
an additional major 
metabolite, M15, 
in plasma after the start of this 
study.  Blood for 
PK samples will analyze for M15 
in addition to 
rodatristat ethyl and rodatristat.
4.5 Criteria for Study TerminationAdditional wording in Section 4.5:
The study may resume once concerns about safety, 
protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed and the IRBs/ECs and co mpetent authorities are 
satisfied. The study will only resume after prior submission and approval of the substantial amendment (if required) by the competent authority.Clarification of

should contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the 
reasons for unblinding.
At the time of Screening fo r entry into the OLE, all 
patients will be re-randomi zed to receive either 300 
mg BID or 600 mg BID rodatristat ethyl in an open-label fashion.  Patients will not know what they received in the Main Study until all patients have completed the Main Study and the database is locked.
At the time of re-randomizati on in the OLE, patients 
will be assigned a new randomization number.  Once this number has been assigned, it cannot be reused/reassigned.Additions to

4.1 Overall Design7.1.4 Open-Label 
Extension DesignWording added in bold :
Patients who participate in the OLE will continue to 
receive rodatristat ethyl for 6.5 years, until the 
Investigator or patient ch ooses to stop the IP, any 
stopping criteria in the Main Study are met, IP becomes 
commercially available, or the Sponsor stops the study 
for lack of efficacy  or a safety signal (whichever 
preceding criteria comes first). In no case will a 
patient be allowed to exceed 10 years of exposure 
unless the product is approved for a chronic 
indication.
Deletion of: 
Investigator or patient chooses to stop the IP, any 
stopping criterion in the Main Study is met, IP becomes 
commercially available, or the Sponsor stops the study 
for lack of efficacy or a safety signal.
Addition to Overall Design section:
Female patients of childbearing potential will 
undergo pregnancy testing every 4 weeks and will be 
required to use 2 reliable me thods of contraception to 
reduce the risk of pregnancy, starting at Screening,during the course of the study and for at least 4 weeks 
following the last dose of rodatristat ethyl.
If there is not a clinic visit,  a urine pregnancy test will 
be sent home with the patient and results will be 
followed up with a phone call.A stop date for 
the total time a subject can be on 
rodatristat ethyl 
has been established and

ЬCardiac Output by the Thermodilution or Fick (if 
thermodilution is not available) Method -Thermodilution is the pr eferred method for the 
estimation of cardiac output. At least 3 determinations that are within 10% variability of one another must be measured. Measurements must be repeated until this  reliability is met. The 
mean cardiac output will be defined as the average of these 3 measurements and used for the calculation of PVR. The mean value will be recorded in the eCRF. Investigators must ensure There is a Right

The last value will be recorded in the eCRF.
ЬSystemic arterial pressure  (systolic, diastolic, and

be measured until 2 consecutive mean values do not differ by more than 10%. The last value will be recorded in the eCRF. All values should be available in the source documents.
ЬPAP (systolic, diastoli c, and mean) - Pulmonary 
arterial pressures should be measured at end expiration and should be measured until 2 consecutive mean values do not differ by more than 10%. The last value will be recorded in the eCRF. All values should be available in the source documents. Mean PAP as determined by the site’s medical instrument (automatically generated) will be entered into the EDC system.If the site’s medical instrument does not 
automatically generate the mPAP, it should then 
be calculated manually using the following equation: mPAP = ([diastolic PAP × 2] + systolic PAP) ÷ 3.
ЬMean right atrial pressure (RAP) - Mean RAP 
should be measured until 2 consecutive values do 
not differ by more than 10%. If mean RAP values are less than 10 mmHg, the 2 consecutive values must not differ  by more than 1 mmHg.

Rationale:
Rodatristat ethyl is an orally bi oavailable prodrug that is rapidl y converted to the active tryptophan 
hydroxylase (TPH) inhibitor rodatristat in the systemic  circulation of multiple nonclinical species and 
humans. The clinical doses and regimens selected for this study have been selected with the goal to 
achieve optimal rodatristat exposure and serotonin (5 HT ) lowering targets associated with efficacy in 
nonclinical models of pulmonary arterial hype rtension (PAH) and pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) data in healthy subjects.
Objectives
Primary Objective:
xTo evaluate the effect of rodatristat ethyl on the percent change from baseline of pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR), as measured by right heart catheterization (RHC) in patients 
with PAH
Secondary Objectives:
xTo evaluate the effect of rodatristat ethyl  on change from baseline on the following:

Open-Label Extension Objectives:
The objective of the OLE is to evaluate the long-ter m safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rodatristat 
ethyl in patients with PAH.
See protocol Section 7.3for Open-Label Extension Endpoints.
Methodology/Overall Study Design:
This double-blind study will compare the efficacy, safet y, and tolerability of 2 doses of rodatristat ethyl 
to placebo in patients with PAH.  Eligible patients will be stratified during the randomization process 
based on the number of background PAH therapies th ey are receiving (1, 2 or 3) and use of selexipag 

Confidential(yes/no).  The number of patients who are receiving a prostanoid infusion will be capped at 50% of the 
total number of patients enrolled.  The number of pa tients who are receiving selexipag will be capped at 
20% of the total enrolled .Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, 300 mg BID, or 600 mg BID of 
rodatristat ethyl.
Patients who complete the Main Study will have the option to enroll into the OLE and continue to 
receive rodatristat ethyl (those randomized to placeb o will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive rodatristat 
ethyl 300 mg BID or 600 mg BID) for 6.5 years, until th e Investigator or patient chooses to stop the IP, 
any stopping criteria in the Main Study are met, IP becomes commercially available, or the Sponsor 
stops the study for lack of efficacy or a safety sign al (whichever preceding criteria comes first). In no 
case will a patient be allowed to exceed 10 years of exposure unless the product is approved for a 
chronic indication.
Disclosure Statement:
This is a parallel group treatment study with 3 a rms that is participant, Sponsor, and Investigator 
blinded.
Number of participants (planned):
Approximately 90 patients with PAH are expected to be enrolled at approximately 68study sites in the

ConfidentialDuration of Treatment and Length of Study:
The treatment duration will be 24 weeks.  The study will last up to 32 weeks in duration for patients 
completing the study that do not enroll into the OLE:
xScreening period: up to 28 days
xFixed dose treatment period (including Baseline): 24 weeks
xSafety Follow-Up Visit: 4 weeks after the end of  dosing if the patient does not enroll into 
the OLE
OLE will continue for 6.5 years, until the Inves tigator or patient chooses to stop the IP, any 
stopping criteria in the Main St udy are met, IP becomes commerci ally available, or the Sponsor 
stops the study for lack of effica cy or a safety signal (whichever  preceding criteria comes first). 
In no case will a patient be allowed to exceed  10 years of exposure unless the product is 
approved for a chronic indication.
Investigational Product, Dosage , and Mode of Administration:
Patients will be enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment arms in  a 1:1:1 randomization, with 30 patients per arm, 
receiving placebo or IP, taken with food for 24 weeks as follows:  
xRodatristat ethyl 300 mg + matching place bo BID (1 x 300 mg + 1 x placebo BID)
xRodatristat ethyl 600 mg BID (2 x 300 mg BID)
xMatching placebo BID (2 x placebo BID)
In order to maintain the study blind, all patients will receive 2 tablets of either rodatristat ethyl and/or 
placebo in the morning and in the evening in one of the combinations noted above.
Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations  will be allowed to manage adverse events 
(AEs)/Adverse events of special interest (AESIs), in cluding gastrointestinal AEs (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, 
or vomiting) and liver enzyme elevations occurri ng during the 24-week treatment period.  Use of 
antidiarrheal and/or anti-emetic medications will  be permitted as directed by the Investigator.
Patients randomized to a rodatristat ethyl arm in  the Main Study may continue at the dose level given 
during the Main Study in the OLE.  Patients random ized to placebo in the Main Study will be re-
randomized to one of the active rodatristat ethyl treatment arms (300 mg BID or 600 mg BID) during 
the OLE. Changing of treatment for all patients in the OLE, to receive either 300 mg BID or 600 mg 
BID, could depend on the timing and outcome of th e 24-week analysis from the Main Study.  
Tolerability and all accumulated safety and efficacy  data will be reviewed by the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  at regular intervals.
Non-Investigational Therapies:
Patients will remain on their prescribed, pre-existin g background PAH medications; doses of these 
medications should remain stable during the study.  All treatment modifications (changes in dose or 
regimen) will be documented.
Any changes to background PAH therapy during th e study should be based on clear medical need and 
should be first discussed with the Medical Monitor whenever possible.

ConfidentialStatistical methods:
A detailed description of statistical methods will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) that will be finalized prior to database lock.
Sample Size Justification:
The planned sample size is 90 patients with 30 patient s to be randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment arms 
in a 1:1:1 randomization. A sample size of 30 per group will provide at least 80% power at a 
significance level of 0.05 (2-sided hypothesis) to de tect a treatment difference of 0.75 times of standard 
deviation (SD) in the percentage change of PVR from baseline between an active arm and the placebo 
arm. For example, if the SD for PVR percent change from baseline is 24%, the study has 80% power to 
detect a difference of 18% between an active arm and the placebo arm.
Analysis Populations:Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All patients randomized into the study.  For all summaries based on the ITT 
population, patients will be assigned to the tr eatment arm to which they were randomized.
Safety: The Safety Population will consist of all patien ts who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of study medication. For all summaries based on th e safety population, patients will be assigned to 
the treatment arm corresponding to the dose they had received.
Modified Intent-to-Treat (m-ITT):  All Safety population patients that had an evaluable baseline and 
at least 1 post-baseline PVR measurement.
Per Protocol (PP): All m-ITT population patients who had no major protocol deviations.
Pharmacokinetic:
All Safety Population patients with rodatris tat ethyl or rodatristat concentration data.
Efficacy Analysis:Primary efficacy analyses will be perf ormed using the m-I TT and PP populations.
Percent change from baseline in PVR will be analyzed  using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
baseline PVR as the covariate. Additional baseline characteristics may also be evaluated as 
covariates in the model. The estimated between-treatment differences, 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) and p-values will be presented. For patients who discontinue from the study early, the last 
observation carried forward method will be used to impute the PVR at Week 24.
Secondary efficacy analyses will be perfor med using the m-ITT and PP populations:
xChange in cardiac index, mPAP, mRAP, SvO2 at rest and PAC from baseline 
xTime to Clinical Worsening
xDeath from any cause
xChange in WHO FC from baseline
xChange in 6MWD from baseline 
xChange in NT-proBNP from baseline
xChanges in right atrial size & RV function: TAPSE, tricuspid annular systolic velocity, and
RV fractional area change from baseline
xChange in PAH-SYMPACT from baseline 
xChange in the REVEAL Lite 2 score
xChange in 5-HIAA (plasma an d spot urine concentration)

ConfidentialThe change from baseline endpoints will be anal yzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as a 
fixed effect, randomization stratum and baseline assessment as covariates.  The estimated between treatment differences, 95% CIs and p-values will be presented.
The change in 6MWD from baseline will also be compared between groups using non-parametric 
analysis of covariance within the framework of the extended Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test.  For 
endpoints measured over time, a mixed effect of repeated measure model ma y be used as sensitivity 
analyses.  Details of statistical methods will be provided in the SAP.
The time from the first dose of IP
until to the first clinical worsening event will be  summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and 
compared between treatment groups using the log-rank test.
Safety Analysis:
A summary of rodatristat exposure will be perform ed using the safety population.  The safety and 
tolerability of rodatristat ethyl will be  evaluated by assessment of AE in cidences and changes in clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, ECG tr acings, and the use of concomitant medication during 
the study. Adverse events (AEs) will be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)-preferred term and system organ classifi cation. The occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) will be summarized by treatment grou p using MedDRA preferred terms, system organ 
classifications, and severity. Separate summaries of  treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and AEs considered to be related to IP will be ge nerated. All AEs will be lis ted for individual patients
showing both verbatim and preferre d terms. Descriptive summaries of vital signs, ECG parameters, and 
clinical laboratory results will be prese nted by study visit and treatment group.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis:
A population PK approach will be utilized to characteri ze the PK of rodatristat ethyl and rodatristat.  A 
detailed description of the PK and any PK/PD analysis  methods used will be provided in the separate 
analysis plan.
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics: 
Demographic and baseline characteristics for the ITT population will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.
Other Analyses:
Patient Reported Outcomes (C-SSRS, HADS and QI DS-C), PK concentration data , PD, and exploratory 
descriptive analyses will be described in the SAP finalized before database lock.
Independent Data Mo nitoring Committee:
The primary role of the IDMC which consists of inde pendent physicians with experience in the care of 
patients with PAH and the conduct of randomized cont rolled trials, and one non-vo ting biostatistician, is 
to ensure the safety of the patients enrolled in the study/OLE. A detailed description of IDMC 
procedures is provided in a separate data mon itoring committee charter maintained by the Sponsor.

Confidential 1Visits at Week 2 (Telemed/P hone Call) and Week 4 (clinic visit)  can occur within +/-2 days fro m the randomization date; Visits at  Weeks 8 (Telemed/Phone  call), 12 (clinic),
18 (clinic or home visit), 24 and 28/Follow Up (clinic) ca n occur within +/-5 days from the randomization date.
2Screening may be broken up into more than 1 visit, if necessary.  Once all screening procedures are complete and the Investigator  determines that the pati ent is eligible, the site 
must upload/send the required supporting documentation for approval by the Sponsor.
3Patients who early terminate from the IP should be asked to return for visits as scheduled for ongoing assessments through the Wee k 28 Visit.  Patients who withdraw consent 
should be asked to complete the Week 28 Visit for safety.  Patients who have not completed the study as planned (through Week 24) cannot participate in OLE.  Patients who 
withdraw consent will continue to be followed for vital status  from public records such as gov ernment vital statistics or obitu aries, as allowed by local law, or periodic contact 
(about every 6 to 12months). 
4Patients that complete the study (defined as completing all visits through Week 24) have  the option to enroll into the OLE (See Se ction 1.4).  Patients who complete through 
Week 24 but decide not to enroll into the OLE, should complete the Week  28 Follow-Up Visit. 
5Weight only (no height or BMI) will be performed at Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 28. 
6Must have a confirmed diagnosis of PAH in patients’ medical history
7Background PAH therapy dose regimens must be stabilized for > 12 w eeks prior to the screening RHC and on stable dose(s) > 8 wee ks prior to the screening RHC to be eligible.
All changes and dose adjustments in ba ckground PAH therapy must be documented.
8Pregnancy tests not required for women who are surgically sterile. FSH required for women with amenorrhea < 2 years at the Scre ening Visit only to c onfirm postmenopausal 
status.
9IP must be taken daily, morning and evening until the night before  the Week 24 visit. Patients must be told not to take a dose the  morning of the Week 24 visit. Doses should be 
taken with food.  During visits at the clin ic or home, all assessments should be done predose, except where otherwise indicated.   Patients should bring thei r IP with them for each 
visit (including any empty bottles). 
10SAEs will be collected starti ng at informed consent form signing.  AEs w ill be collected starting at first dosing.
11Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at  Screening and urine pregnancy tests over th e rest of the study. A negative urine pre gnancy test must be completed before Day 1 
procedures.  If a positive result on a urine test, a serum pregnanc y test should be completed to confirm. Pregnancy tests will b e completed in women of child-bearing potential 
every 4 weeks while on study.  Weeks 8, 16 and 20 will be perform ed at home (with a kit given to  the subject by the site) and t he results will be confirmed with the subject by a 
phone call. Additional pregnancy tests should be  completed anytime menstruation is delayed and in women with infrequent or irregula r menstrual cycles.
12Three 12-lead ECGs (at least 1 minute apart) will be collected on Da y 1 after at least 5 minutes of rest.  Single 12-lead ECGs w ill be collected at all other time points. 
13Coagulation testing will be done at Screening, Weeks 12 and 24.
14RHC results from 4 weeks prior to the Screening visit may be us ed for entry provided the RHC includes all required information a nd provided that changes to the patient’s PAH 
regimen were not made. If prior approval is obtained from the Sponsor,  the screening RHC may be performed on the same day as the  randomization procedures,  provided that all 
blood draws and other efficacy assessment s are conducted prior to the RHC procedure, and the RHC is performed prior to randomiz ation and IP dosing.  Week 24 RHC may
occur up to 7 days prior to or on the Week 24 Visit. If a patient terminates early, and at or afte r the Week 12 Visit, an RHC shou ld be performed at the Early Termination Visit.
15Echocardiography should be done in supine po sition after at least 5 minutes of rest.
16Patients will wear a wrist device for the entire duration of the study, but for endpoi nt assessments, focus will be on the 3 fol lowing periods: Day 1 to Week 4, 
Week 12 to Week 16, and Week 20 to Week 24.  All details of collection will be provided in the study manual.
17Rodatristat Ethyl and Rodatristat PK: At Day 1 and Week 4, a predose PK sample will be co llected (patients will  take study medicat ion in the clinic).  At Week 12, a postdose

Confidential 2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Background
Pulmonary arterial hypertensi on (PAH) is a severe, incura ble disease characterized by 
remodeling of the pulmonary  arterial bed, leading to elevations  in resting mean pulmonary artery 
pressures, subsequent right ventricular hypert rophy, and eventually, ri ght heart failure and 
(Agarwal & Gomberg-Maitland, 2011 ).  Current standard-of-care therapies for PAH target 
3 different pathways – namely, the endothelin- 1 pathway, the nitric oxide pathway, and the 
prostacyclin pathway – and act primarily as vasodilators.  They reduce PAH symptoms and may 
slow disease progression, but they lack  compelling disease-modifying properties.
Several lines of evidence implicate sero tonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) in the 
pathophysiology of PAH where there are findings that  5-HT plasma levels are markedly elevated 
in PAH ( Humbert et al., 2002 ); tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 1, th e key rate-limiting enzyme in 
the biosynthesis of systemic  5-HT, is overexpressed in lung tissue of PAH patients 
(Eddahibi, 2006 ), and 5-HT acts on pulmonary artery  smooth muscle cells to induce 
vasoconstriction and proliferation ( MacLean & Dempsie, 2010 ).  In addition, 5-HT acts at the 
5-HT1B receptor and the 5-HT transporter to  mediate constriction and proliferation of 
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( MacLean & Dempsie, 2010 ).  Finally, genetic deletion 
and pharmacological inhibition of TPH1 protects against the development of experimentally 
induced PAH ( Abid et al., 2012; Izikki et al., 2007 ) in nonclinical pharmacology models.  In 
aggregate, these findings indica te that modulation of the 5-HT  pathway by TPH1 inhibition is a 
novel approach that differentiate s itself mechanistically from cu rrent therapeutic options and 
offers the potential to  modify the underlying disease pathophysiology and progression of PAH
(Aiello et al., 2016; MacLean, 2018 ). 
A therapeutic strategy is needed to safely and effectively inhibit TPH1 activity in peripheral 
tissues, without unwanted central nervous system (CNS) effects th at result from inhibition of 
TPH2, the predominant TPH isoform in the CNS. 
Rodatristat ethyl is a peripherall y restricted TPH1/TPH2 inhibito r with little CNS penetration. 
Nonclinical data indicate that ne ither rodatristat ethyl nor rodatr istat cross the bl ood brain barrier 
to a pharmacologically relevant  level and do not lower brain levels of 5-HT in nonclinical 
pharmacodynamic studies in rats.  By limiting inhibition to TPH1 in the periphery, rodatristat 
ethyl may avoid potential untow ard CNS effects that could ot herwise be a consequence of 
inhibiting TPH2-mediated CNS 5-HT production ( Kim et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2008 ). 
Rodatristat ethyl is a prodrug that  is rapidly hydrolyzed to rodatristat, a potent TPH inhibitor that 
reduces peripheral 5-HT levels in the gut mucosa, lung, and serum in animal models of PAH.  In 
vitro, nonclinical, and human pha rmacokinetic (PK) studies to date have provided valuable 
information on the PK properties of  rodatristat ethyl and its active moiety, rodatristat. Rodatristat 
ethyl has low to moderate oral bioavailability in nonclinical speci es and is rapidly converted to 
rodatristat in vivo.  Both roda tristat ethyl and roda tristat are highly prot ein bound and little is 
excreted in the urine.  Biliary  excretion predominates in ra ts and no furthe r metabolism of 
rodatristat has been detected in human hepatocyte preparations. However, preliminary 
investigations have also identi fied a metabolite, M 15, in the plasma of dogs and humans after 

Confidential administration of rodatristat ethyl . After single-dose administrati on, the half-life of rodatristat 
ethyl and rodatristat are approximately 5 and 12 hours, respectively, reaching steady-state 
exposure, according to trough concentrations, by Day 5.  The highest exposures achieved in 
healthy subjects to date were reached on Day 7 following 800 mg twice daily (BID) doses of 
rodatristat ethyl.
Rodatristat ethyl was selected fo r development in the treatment of PAH based on a range of 
criteria, including achieving efficacy endpoint s in nonclinical in vivo models of PAH, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and biomarker endpoints related to both changes in systemic 
5-HT levels and PAH pathology. 
Reductions in biomarkers  indicative of decreased 5-HT bios ynthesis were observed in healthy 
subjects receiving repeat twice daily (BID) oral doses (range 100 to 800 mg BID) of rodatristat 
ethyl over 14 days.  Rodatristat ethyl doses of either 400 or 800 mg BID achieved reductions in 
5-HT by Day 14 comparable to thos e associated with efficacy in  the rodent models of PAH. 
2.2. Study Rationale
Rodatristat ethyl is expected to  have efficacy for PAH.  Re sults from nonclinical pharmacology 
studies demonstrate that rodatris tat ethyl is a potent and selective inhibitor of TPH1 with the 
potential to ameliorate disease by halting or  reversing the pulmonary  vascular remodeling 
characteristically observed.  Th rough inhibition of TPH1, rodatrista t ethyl is expected to improve 
cardiopulmonary hemodyna mics, functional capacity, PAH sy mptoms, and right ventricular 
(RV) function via its novel antiproliferative and anti-re modeling mechanism of action.
This study will evaluate rodatristat ethyl doses of 300 mg BID and 600 mg BID. Dose selection 
was guided by the goal of demonstrating a dose/exposure efficacy relationship and was 
supported by nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, and animal model efficacy data. Results 
from Phase 1 human studies suggest that these dosing regimens should be safe and generally 
well tolerated with dose-proportiona l differences in systemic dr ug exposure.  Further details 
regarding the dose rationale can be found in Section 4.7.
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
Summaries of findings from both clinical and nonclinical studies conducted with r odatristat ethyl
as well as more detailed information about th e known and expected benefits and risks and 
reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) of rodatr istat ethyl may be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  This section outlines the potential adve rse events of special interest (AESI; based 
either on preclinical or clinical data generated to date, the mechanism of action of rodatristat 
ethyl, or the prescribing information for telotris tat ethyl [a TPH inhibitor previously approved for 
the treatment of carcinoid syndrome-related diar rhea] and mitigation strate gies for this protocol.
The potential risk for QTc prolongation (described in the Investigator’s Br ochure) will be further 
evaluated in a definitive thorough QT study in the future. Until furthe r data are available in that 
regard, cardiac arrhythmia, related to an increas e in QT/QTc interval, will be treated as a 
potential AESI and has therefore also been incl uded in the table of potential risks below. 
Although any potential benefits to patients w ith PAH will not be known until the study is 
completed, the development of a drug with disease- modifying potential will certainly be of value 
to patients with this diagnosis.

Confidential4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall Design
This study will compare the efficac y, safety, and tolerability of 2 dosing regimens of rodatristat 
ethyl to placebo in patients with PAH over a 24-week treatment period . Investigational product 
(IP) will be administere d on the background of stable PAH therapy. 
Approximately ninety (90) patients will be enro lled. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to 
placebo, 300 mg BID, or 600 mg BID of rodatristat ethyl. 
Eligible patients will be stra tified based on the number of background PAH therapies they are 
receiving (1 vs 2 vs 3) and selexipag use (Yes/N o).  The number of patients who are on a 
prostanoid infusion will be capped at 50% of th e total enrolled. The numbe r of patients who are 
receiving selexipag will be capped at 20% of the total enrolled.
The study will consist of a Screening Period ( up to 28 days in duration), a Baseline Period 
(Day 1), a 24-week Treatment Period (Main Study) , and for patients that early terminate or do
not enroll an Open-Label Extension (OLE), and a 4-week Follow-Up Period (approximately 
4 weeks after the last dose), for a total study duration of 32 weeks.
Patients who complete the Main Study will have the option to enroll into an OLE and continue to 
receive rodatristat ethyl (those randomized to placebo will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive 
rodatristat ethyl 300 mg BID or 600 mg BID) fo r 6.5 years, until the Investigator or patient 
chooses to stop the IP, any stopping criteria in th e Main Study are met, IP becomes commercially 
available, or the Sponsor stops the study for lack of efficacy or a safety signal (whichever 
preceding criteria comes first). In no case will a patient be allowed to exceed 10 years of 
exposure unless the product is a pproved for a chronic indication.
All participating patient s will be required to be on a st able background therapy for PAH with 
mono, dual or triple combination therapy (whic h may include currently approved prostanoid 
therapies) at the time of Screening. All patien ts will maintain their standard of care (SOC) 
regimen at entry for the durati on of the study. Refer to Section 6.6.2 for more details.
During the 24-week Treatment Period, in addition to the Day 1/Baseline Visit and a telemedicine 
or phone call at Weeks 2 and 8, pati ents will return to the study cen ter for safety, tolerability and 
efficacy-related assessments at  Weeks 4, 12, and 24, and a clinic or home visit at Week 18, as
specified in the Schedule of Events Table, Section 1.3, as well as Follow-up at Week 28 (as 
applicable). Female patients of childbearing potential will undergo pregnancy testing every 4 weeks and will be required to use 2 reliable methods of contr aception to reduce the risk of 
pregnancy, at Screening, during the course of the study, and for at leas t 4 weeks following the 
last dose of rodatristat ethyl. Additional pregnancy testing in women whose menstruation is delayed or who have infrequent or  irregular menstrual cycles shoul d be completed as warranted.
Further details for the O LE are found in Section 7.

Confidential4.3. Treatment Assignment
Patients will be randomized to IP according to a computer-generated allocation schedule, 
prepared prior to th e start of the study.
At the Baseline Visit, eligible patients will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to one of the following 
3 treatment groups:
Treatment Arm
NameTreatment Description
Rodatristat ethyl 
300 m g BID1 x 300 mg tablet + 1 x matching placebo BID
Rodatristat ethyl 
600 m g BID2 x 300 mg tablets BID
Placebo 2 x matching placebo tablets BID
In order to maintain the study bli nd, patients will take 2 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets in 
the evening in one of the combinations noted above.
4.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria
4.4.1. Dose Reduction
All determinations of rodatris tat ethyl dose reduction should be  discussed with the Medical 
Monitor prior to implementing unless time does not allow for safety.
Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations  will be allowed to manage AEs/AESIs (or 
other instances to be discussed with the Me dical Monitor), including gastrointestinal AEs
(e.g., diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) or liver enzyme increase occurring during the 24 weeks of 
the study.  Judicious use of antidiarrheal and/or  anti-emetic medications  will be permitted. One 
level of dose reduction is available.
To reduce the IP, the patient will be instructed to ta ke one tablet in the mo rning and one tablet in 
the evening from the appropriate dispensed bot tles during the dose reduc tion period per dosing 
instructions supplied in a sepa rate document.  If AEs continue, the patient may stop taking the IP
completely for up to 7 days before restarting.
4.4.1.1. Diarrhea
In the event the patient experiences dia rrhea, the dose may be reduced. The Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v ersion 4.0 grading will be used to grade the 
severity of all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) of diarrhea. Management 
recommendations for diarrhea are based on the CTCAE grades and are detailed in Appendix 2.
In general, the patient should be treated with anti-d iarrheal drugs such as loperamide as clinically 
indicated. In addition to direc tly treating any diarrhea, possibl e intermittent or permanent 
interruption of IP and dose reduction will be possible, de pending upon the frequency and 
severity of diarrhea.

Confidential4.4.1.2. Aminotransferase (Alanine aminotrans ferase or Aspartate Aminotransferase)
Elevation
Management recommendations fo r ALT or AST elevations are based on U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Guidance for Liver Toxicity.
In general, all baseline or treatment-emerge nt ALT or AST elevations > 3X ULN should be 
confirmed within 48 to 72 hours with repeat assessments of ALT and AST as well as TBL,alkaline phosphatase (ALP), pr othrombin time/INR, and comple te blood count for eosinophil 
levels.  Further details for managing IP reducti on, restart, and discont inuation can be found in
Appendix 3 .
If at any time, the criteria as outlined in Section 8are met, the IP must be permanently 
discontinued.
4.5. Criteria for Study Termination
This study (including OLE) may be temporarily suspended or premat urely terminated if there is 
sufficient reasonable ca use. Written notification, documenti ng the reason for study suspension 
or termination, will be provided by the suspendi ng, or terminating party, to the Investigators,
Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Ethics Com mittees (EC), regulatory authorities. If the study 
is prematurely terminated or suspended, the In vestigators will promptly  inform the IRB/ECs and 
will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
xDetermination of unexpected, significant,  or unacceptable risk to participants
xDemonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping
xInsufficient compliance to  protocol requirements
xData that are not sufficiently  complete and/or evaluable
xDetermination of futility
The study may resume once concerns about safet y, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed and the IRBs/ECs and competent author ities are satisfied. The study will only resume 
after prior submission and approva l of the substantial amendment (if required) by the competent 
authority.
4.6. Scientific Ration ale for Study Design
The design of this study will provide efficacy, safe ty, and dosing information to support proof of 
concept. Two rodatristat ethyl doses will be studied. Patients with idiopathic PAH and other 
Group 1 PAH sub-types will be included in this study.
Placebo-controlled randomized stud ies provide the most robust re sults and are thus considered 
the most appropriate design. However, approve d therapies for PAH are  available, making a
placebo-controlled rodatristat ethyl monotherapy study unethical. Therefore,  rodatristat ethyl (or 
placebo) will be evaluated in addition to st andard of care (SOC) P AH-specific treatments, 
i.e., this study will only include patients on stable, approved, and available treatments at baseline. 

Confidential Patients on prior monotherapy and combination re gimens to include up to 3 agents will be 
permitted to participate. Treat ment with oral, inhaled, or parenteral prostanoids will be 
permitted.  Any changes to background PAH th erapy during the study should be based on clear 
medical need. 
In prior studies of pati ents treated with PAH therapies, up to 24 weeks of treatment with study 
medication were considered necessary to demo nstrate efficacy based on potential impact on 
pulmonary hemodynamics.  This duration of exposure  will also allow for assessment of safety,
tolerability, and possible effects on exercise abil ity, patient reported outc omes, and biomarkers. 
The OLE will provide long term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rodatristat ethyl in patients
with PAH. In order to minimize bias during the O LE, patients will remain blinded to original 
treatment assignment in th e Main Study.  Patients receiving ac tive rodatristat ethyl during main 
treatment period will continue at their origin ally randomized dose to generate additional 
long-term safety and efficacy data. Patients origina lly randomized to placebo will also have the 
opportunity to receive active rodatristat ethy l during the OLE, provi ding additional patient 
exposures for further assessment of safety and efficacy.
4.7. Justification for Dose
The dose levels selected are based on prior pharmacodynamic (PD) observa tions in nonclinical 
models of PAH and PK, PD, safety, and tolerability data in healthy subjects  receiving rodatristat 
ethyl for up to 14 days.
Disease-modifying effects of rodatristat ethyl were demonstr ated in the semaxanib (SU5416, 
SUGEN) hypoxia and the monocrotalin e (MCT) injury rat models of PAH.  In the MCT rat 
model, rodatristat ethyl decreased serum and lung 5-HT levels and reduced the extent of vascular 
remodeling. In the SU5416 hypoxia rat model, ro datristat ethyl signi ficantly reduced RV
systolic pressure, RV hypertrophy, the biomarker brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and pulmonary 
vessel wall thickness and occlusions as measured  by histological analys is, without impacting 
systolic blood pressure (SBP). These benefits were observed at GRVHVRI  100 mg/kg, which 
results in approximately a 40% re duction in 5-HT biosynthesis ( IB, 2020 ). Based on these data,
a target reduction in 5-HT (as determined by ur inary 5-HIAA excretion rate ) of at least 40% was 
the basis for the doses selected in the current study.
After 14 day BID administration to  healthy subjects, rodatristat ethyl at doses of 400 to 800 mg 
BID resulted in 50 to 60% reductions in urin ary 5-HIAA.  Dose-dependent increases in 
gastrointestinal treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; notably nausea and diarrh ea) were noted with 
rodatristat ethyl, including an event of modera te diarrhea and an overa ll incidence rate of 
44% after administration of 800 mg BID ( IB, 2020 ).  Therefore, the highest dose regimen 
selected for the current study is rodatristat et hyl 600 mg BID which is expected the maintain the 
majority of the 5-HT lowering effect while minimizing potential of gastrointestinal TEAEs.
The lower dose regimen of rodatr istat ethyl of 300 mg BID was sele cted to evaluate a lower dose 
to aid in defining potential dose-re sponse relationships and is expected to result in approximately 
40% reduction in 5-HIAA, equivalent to the re ductions observed at efficacious doses in 
nonclinical models ( IB, 2020 ). 

Aside from the dose-dependent gastrointestinal TEAEs observed in healthy subjects receiving 
higher doses for 14 days, which have all been cons idered mild with the exception of 1 event of 
moderate diarrhea, no other safety concerns were  identified following sing le doses ranging up to 
2000 mg or following repeat dosing over 14 days of up to 800 mg administered BID to healthy 
subjects.  The majority of TEAEs for all dose re gimens evaluated to date have been mild and 
have resolved without requiring intervention or discontinuation of the IP. There have been no 
SAEs reported nor any dose-limiti ng toxicities identifi ed.  Mild, transient elevations in ALT 
were reported in 5 subjects who received either si ngle or multiple doses of  rodatristat ethyl (5 of 
136 subjects [3.7%]).  Further information can be found in th e Investigator’s Brochure. 
With respect to nonclinical toxico logy studies, rodatristat ethyl a nd rodatristat exposures at the 
no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 26-week rat (female  only) or 39-week dog 
toxicology studies are > 4-fold higher than the expected exposu re after at the higher dose 
regimen of 600 mg BID ( IB, 2020 ).  Due to adverse decreases in mean body weight gain (20 
to -41.7% relative to controls) and food consump tion at all dose levels in the 26-week study in 
male rats, the NOAEL could not be established.  Exposure at the lowest dose tested in this study 
was 4-fold higher than that anticipated at the higher dose regimen of 600 mg BID.  The major 
toxicities associated with oral rodatristat ethyl administration included mortality in rats preceded 
by clinical signs of toxicity a nd body weight loss occurring at exposures > 4-fold the highest 
exposure expected in the current study.  Fi ndings in both species were indicative of 
gastrointestinal changes including decreased body we ight and/or decreased rate of weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, diarrh ea/fecal change, dehydration, di stended abdomen (rats only),

histopathologic findings of intestinal dilation with vac uolated macrophages, and increased 
mucosal thickness with regenerati on in the duodenum.  Observed liver enzyme elevations were 
not associated with adverse histopathology (h epatocellular necrosis ) and are considered 
monitorable.
Prior studies have demonstrated coadministra tion of rodatristat ethy l with food can increase 
systemic exposure of ro datristat ethyl and rodatristat from 1.1- to 1.8-fold.  Thus, the prior 
Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects evaluated rodatristat ethyl administered with a standard meal
(IB, 2020 ).  To maintain consistency with these studi es and therefore the expected PD effects, IP
will be administered BID with a standard meal.
Taken together, the nonclinical ph armacology and safety data, and pr ior clinical experience with 
rodatristat ethyl support the low and high BI D dose regimens (300 mg and 600 mg) to be 
evaluated in patients with PAH over the 24-week treatment period.
4.8. End of Study Definition
A patient is considered to have completed t he study if he/she has completed 24 weeks of 
treatment including the Week 24 visit and the Follow-up Visit (for patients that complete the study through Week 24 but decide not to rollover to the OLE), or the last scheduled procedureshown in the Schedule of Assessments(SoA; Section 1.3).   If the patient decides to continue 
into the OLE, subject must not participate in another interventional study until completing theET/final follow-up visit (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug) according to the Schedule of Assessments OLE (Section 1.4or1.5).
The end of the study for assessment of the primary endpoint is defined as the date of the last visit 
of the last patient in the Main Study or last scheduled procedure in the Main Study shown in the 
SoA for the last patient in the study globally, regardless of dura tion of participation in the OLE.

Screen failures are defined as patients who consen t to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently randomized into the study. After ob taining informed consent, study site personnel 
will enter the patient into the Interactive Res ponse Technology (IRT), and the patient will be 
assigned a unique patient number. The IRT should be updated promptly for patients who do not 
meet the criteria for participation in  the study (screen failure) and reason.
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transp arent reporting of screen 
failure patients to meet the C onsolidated Standards of Reporti ng Trials (CONSORT) publishing
requirements and to respond to que ries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information is to be 
entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC ), including demography, sc reen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any SAE.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in th is study (screen failure) may be 
rescreened on a case-by-case basis. Approval fr om the Sponsor must be obtained prior to 
rescreening.

Confidential6.3. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
The Investigator or designee must maintain accu rate records of receipt and the condition of the 
IP supplied for this study includi ng dates of receipt.  They must confirm appropriate temperature 
conditions have been maintained during trans it for all IP recei ved and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the IP.
2. Only patients enrolled in the study may rece ive IP. Accurate records must be kept of 
when and how much IP is dispensed and admin istered to each patient in the study.  Any 
reason for departure from the in structions provided in the pr otocol for dispensing of IP 
must also be recorded.  IP may be supplied at  the site, from the site to the patient via a 
Sponsor-approved courier comp any, or from the depot dir ectly to the patient where 
allowed by local regulations and approved by the patient.
3. All IP at a study site must be stored in  a secure, environmentally controlled, and 
monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to th e Investigator and authorized site staff.
4. The Investigator, institution, or  the head of the medical inst itution (where a pplicable) is 
responsible for IP accountabilit y, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records).
5. Further guidance and informa tion for the final disposition of  unused IP are provided in 
the Study Reference Manual.
6. A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) describing o ccupational hazards and recommended handling 
precautions will be supplied to the Investigator.
6.3.1. Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling
IP will be packaged in an appropriately sized bottle and labeled per local regulations.
6.3.2. Investigational Product Storage

Confidential6.3.5. Investigational Product Handling and Disposal
Patients should return all IP (including empty, partial, and full bottles) at their regularly 
scheduled clinic visits.  Reconc iliation of all IP that was dispensed, returned, or lost must be 
accounted for with documentation for any IP that was lost or missing.
Returned IP may be re-issued if the patient is continuing in the study, returned to the drug depot,
or destroyed at the site as long as the site  has procedures in place for IP destruction where
allowed by local regulations. Otherwise, all retu rned IP will be returned to the depot at 
increments throughout the study after all IP has been accounted for and verified by the monitor.
Additional instructions for IP return and destruction will be  found in the pharmacy or study 
reference manual.
6.4. Measures to Minimize Bias : Randomization and Blinding
This is a double-blind study. The Sponsor, Investig ator, patient, and study site personnel will be 
blinded to all treatment group assignments. The I nvestigator will have th e ability, in the IRT 
system, to unblind a patient, and the decision will reside solely with the Investigator. Prior to 
unblinding, if safety allows, the I nvestigator should contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the 
reasons for unblinding.
Eligible patients will be stra tified during the rand omization process based on the number of 
background PAH therapies they are receiving (1, 2 or 3) and selexipag use. The number of 
patients who are receiving a prostanoid infusion will be capped at 50% of the total number of patients enrolled. The number of patients who are receiving selexipag will  be capped at 20% of 
the total number of patients enrolled. Patients w ill be randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, 300 mg BID, 
or 600 mg BID of rodatristat ethyl using an interactive randomization system.
At the time of Screening for entry into the O LE, all patients will be re-randomized to receive 
either 300 mg BID or 600 mg BID rodatristat ethy l in an open-label fash ion.  Patients will not 
know what they received in the Main Study until all patients have comple ted the Main Study and 
the database is locked.
At the time of randomization, in the Main Study, patients will be assigned a randomization 
number.  Once this number has been as signed, it cannot be reused/reassigned.
At the time of re-randomiza tion in the OLE, patients will be assigned a new randomization 
number.  Once this number has been a ssigned, it cannot be reused/reassigned.

ConfidentialBlind Break 
(IVRS/IWRS)The Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)
will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  Only in case of an emergency, when knowledge of the IP is essential for the clinical  management or welfare of a specific patient, 
may the Investigator unblind a patient’s treatment assignment in IVRS/IWRS.  The 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a patient’s treatment 
assignment is warranted.  Patient safety must always be the first consideration in making 
such a determination.  If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the 
Investigator should make every effort to contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding a patient’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the patient.  If a 
patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours 
after breaking the blind without revealing the patient’s study treatment assignment (unless 
important to the safety of patients in the study) and that the Investigator was unable to 
contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must 
be recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF), as 
applicable.
6.5. Investigational Product Compliance
Patient compliance with IP will be assessed at ea ch visit by the site/study staff. Compliance will 
be assessed by direct questioning of the patient and counting returned tablets at each study visit 
to the study site.  Patients will be  reminded of the importance of taking their IP as directed at 
each visit including the Weeks 2 and 8 Phone Calls. Pa tients will be required to bring their IP
supplies with them to each study visit to the study site so that  a member of the study staff can 
check that the doses of IP were taken as directed.
Full compliance with the IP regimen, per s ubject, will be considered to be >80%.
Deviation(s) from the prescr ibed dosage regimen should be  recorded in the eCRF.
6.6. Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the- counter or prescription medicines, vitamins,
and/or herbal supplements) that  the patient received in the 8 w eeks prior to en rollment, is 
receiving at the time of enrollment, or receives  during the study must be  recorded along with:
xReason for use
xDates of administration incl uding start and end dates
xDosage information in cluding dose and frequency
New and existing concomitant therapy(ies) may be considered on a case-by-case basis by the 
Investigator for treatment of a medical need. Any concomitant me dication should be recorded in 
the study records, including doses  administered, the dates and tim es of administration and the 
reason for administration.
The Medical Monitor should be c ontacted if there are any questi ons regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy. (Note: Vaccines, including potenti al Covid-19 vaccines, are allowed but must be 
documented in the eCRF). 

Confidential 6.6.1. Rodatristat-Drug Interaction Potential
In vitro experiments and in si lico modeling to evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential of 
rodatristat ethyl and rodatrista t have not identified any modera te or high risks for potential 
drug-drug interactions ( IB, 2020 ).  There is the potential for weak  interactions with substrates of 
the drug metabolizing enzymes cy tochrome P450 (CYP)2C8 and CYP3A, and drug transporters 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or organic an ion-transporting polypeptide (OATP). 
Selexipag, and active me tabolite ACT-333679, are substrates of  CYP2C8 and preliminary data 
from a selexipag-rodatristat clinical interaction stud y in healthy subjects are available.  In that 
study, steady-state rodatristat ethyl 600 mg BI D coadministered with single-dose selexipag 
400μg increased selexipag AUC 1.18-fold and reduced ACT-333679 AUC by 40.5%.  These 
data suggest induction of CYP2C8 by rodatris tat ethyl/rodatristat. The magnitude of this 
interaction in PAH patients, a nd the clinical rele vance of these changes in exposure are 
unknown.  PK samples for assessment of sele xipag and ACT-333679 trough concentration at 
baseline and Week 4, in addition to safety a nd efficacy data, will be collected in this study to
further investigate this fi nding.  In the same study, a single-dose of selexipag 400 μg had no 
relevant impact on the exposure of ro datristat ethyl or rodatristat.  
Preliminary safety data from th e study show a total of 33 TEAE s in 8 subjects during the study.  
There were no SAEs or deaths. Gastrointestinal  (GI) TEAEs were the mo st frequently reported 
TEAEs over all three periods with 25 GI TEAEs occurring in 6 subjects . All TEAEs were mild 
to moderate with the exception of one TEAE in  one subject of serious diarrhea on Day 6. This 
same subject was the only subject discontinued fr om the study.  This subject was discontinued by 
the Investigator due to prolonged GI TEAEs (n ausea, vomiting, stomachache, diarrhea) during 
the rodatristat ethyl alone dosi ng period (Days 5-9).   Nausea wa s the only TEAE reported in 2 or 
more subjects when selexipag was given alone. Diarrhea, headache, nausea and stomachache ZHUHUHSRUWHGLQVXEMHFWVD t approximately the same frequen cy during both rodatristat ethyl 
alone period and the selexipag and rodatristat ethyl coadmini stration period.  There were no 
changes in laboratory parameters, vital si gns, or ECGs of cl inical significance.
No concomitant medications based on these in vi tro and clinical findings are prohibited.   
The following information is provided as guidance for th e Investigator:
xPatients using systemic narrow therapeutic range substrates of CYP2C8, CYP3A and 
P-gp should be monitored during coadministration with IP.  See Appendix 1 for a list 
of relevant substrates, for example:
oNarrow therapeutic range CYP2C8 substrates (induction of CYP2C8 is 
possible): selexipag, trepostinil , pioglitazone, and torasemide.
oNarrow therapeutic range CYP3A substrates  (weak induction or  inhibition of 
CYP3A is possible): cyclosporine, ev erolimus, fentanyl, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimus;
oNarrow therapeutic range P-gp substrat es:  digoxin, monitor serum levels 
approximately 2 weeks after initiation of IP or if patient re ports any signs of 
toxicity; 

ConfidentialxRodatristat was also identified as a substrate of liver uptake transporters 
OATP1B1/1B3.  Strong inhibitors of OATP1B1/1B3 may increase circulating 
concentrations of rodatristat and may in crease adverse effe cts. Putative strong 
inhibitors of OATP1B1/1B3 are systemic at anazavir/ritonavir,  clarithromycin, 
cyclosporine, erythromycin, faldaprevir, gemfibrozil, glecaprevir/pibrebtasvir, 
lopinavir/ritonavir, rifampin, sofosbuvir/ velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, and telaprevir. 
Note: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA re ductase inhibitors or ‘s tatins’ also transported 
by OATP are not considered  strong inhibitors of OATP.
6.6.2. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Medications
The target population of patients with PAH will be receiving SOC t reatment which can consist of 
monotherapy, dual, or triple combin ation therapy that have been ta ken for at least 12 weeks prior 
to the Screening RHC.  These medications should be prescribed at doses considered 
therapeutically appropriate (e.g., maximum tolerated) and stable (i.e., no changes in dose or 
schedule) for at least 8 weeks prior to this RHC. Any instances where doses have been missed 
for > 2 consecutive days on more than one occasion or other regular lapses in compliance during 
this 8-week period prior to RHC must be discus sed with the Medical Monitor prior to performing 
the RHC.  Changes to these PAH medications mu st not be anticipated for the duration of the 
study.
No increases in background oral PAH doses or  addition of a new PAH medication(s) will be 
allowed. Decreases in background oral PAH ther apy dosing should only be considered in the 
event of suspected IP-related a dverse effects. The Medical Mon itor should be notified of any 
change to background PAH therapy.
Permissible oral, inhaled, and i njectable PAH medications include:
xTadalafil
xSildenafil

Confidential7.4. Open-Label Extension Design
Patients in the Main Study that do not discontinue  prematurely and comple te up to and including 
the Week 24 Visit, have the option to rollover in to the OLE. Patients who continue into the OLE 
will be blinded to the treatment th ey received in the Main Study.  Patients who received active IP 
in the Main Study will remain on their regime n. Patients randomized to placebo in the Main
Study will be re-randomized to one of the 2 activ e rodatristat ethyl treatment arms (300 mg BID
or 600 mg BID) in the OLE.
Patients who participate in the OLE will continue to receive rodatristat ethyl for 6.5 years, until 
the Investigator or patient chooses to stop the IP, any stopping criteria in the Main Study are met, 
IP becomes commercially available, or the Sponsor  stops the study for lack  of efficacy or a 
safety signal (whichever preceding cr iteria comes first). In no case will a patient be allowed to 
exceed 10 years of exposure unless the pr oduct is approved for a chronic indication.
During the OLE patients will be followed by the Inve stigator according to clinical practice, with 
formal (per protocol) safety as sessments. These safety assessments  will include AEs, clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and concomitan t medications. Female pati ents of childbearing 
potential will be required to use 2 reliable me thods of contraception to reduce the risk of 
pregnancy during the course of the study and for at least 30 days  following the last dose of 
rodatristat ethyl.
During the first 24 weeks of the OLE patients, will also undergo efficacy assessments.  These 
efficacy assessments will include 6MWT, RHC, echocardiogram, WHO FC, and plasma 
NT-proBNP level. Urine pregnancy tests will be  performed every 4 weeks in women of child-
bearing potential only, while the pa tient is on IP and once at 4 week s post dose.  If there is not a 
clinic visit, a urine pregnancy test will be sent ho me with the patient and results will be followed 
up with a phone call. Additional pregnancy testin g in women whose menstruation is delayed or 
who have infrequent or irregular menstrua l cycles should be conducted as warranted.
See SoA in Section 1.4and Section 1.5.
7.5. Number of Patients and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
The maximum number of patients enrolled in to the OLE will be the number of patients who 
complete the Main Study (Week 24).
7.6. Inclusion Criteria
1. Patient must have completed study assessm ents and procedures up to and including 
Week 24 in the Main Study.
2. Female patients of childbearing potential must  have a negative serum or urine pregnancy 
test at the Week 24 visit and must agree to use contraception as detailed in Section 5.4.1
for at least 4 weeks after the last dose of IP . A female patient of childbearing potential is

The Investigator may discontinue/w ithdraw a study patient’s partic ipation in the study if any of 
the following criteria apply:
xBehavioral or ad ministrative reason
Any clinical AE, laboratory abnorma lity, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that 
continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the patient. When
applicable, patients should be informed of circum stances under which thei r participation may be 
terminated by the Investigator without their consent.
8.1.1. Temporary Discontinuation
Temporary discontinuation of IP of up to 7 day s will be allowed for extenuating circumstances
or to manage AEs.
8.2. Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study
Patients may withdraw from the st udy at any time at his/her own request or may be withdrawn at 
any time at the discretion of th e Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative 
reasons.  This is expected to be uncommon.
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected be fore such a withdrawal of consent.
Replacement patients may be enrolled in cons ultation with the Spons or’s Medical Monitor.
8.2.1. Investigational Product Discontinuation
If a patient is permanently discon tinued from the IP, but agrees to  study visits, the patient will 
come in for the Early Termina tion Visit and continue attending clinic visits as scheduled through 
the 24-week visit (from first dose). A final follow-up visit will not be required.
If a patient prematurely discontinues IP prior to the Week 24 Visit, the Investigator will make 
every attempt to perform a RHC, as clinically  feasible, prior to or within 7 days of IP
discontinuation (but after at l east 12 weeks of IP), and prior to initiation of any new PAH 
medications.
8.2.2. Study DiscontinuationIf a patient who discontinues IP de cides to end all study participat ion, an Early Termination Visit
should be conducted, as shown in the SoA (Section 1.3), if possible. 
Patients who withdraw should be asked if they may be contacted  by the study site  by telephone 
unless they explicitly withdraw their consent to be followed up.
If a patient withdraws consent, he /she may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the investigator must docu ment this in the site study records.

A patient will be considered lost to follow up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
The following actions must be taken if a patient fa ils to return to the c linic for a required study 
visit:
xThe site must attempt to c ontact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the patie nt on the importance of main taining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the pa tient wishes to and/or  should continue in 
the study.
xBefore a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or  designee must make 
every effort to regain cont act with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and,
if necessary, a certified letter to the patie nt’s last known maili ng address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts  should be documented in the patient’s 
medical record.
xShould the patient continue to be unreachable , he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.
xPatients who withdraw consent will continue  to be followed for vital status from 
public records such as government vital sta tistics or obituaries,  as allowed by local 
law, or periodic contact (about every 6 to 12 months).

Confidential9. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study procedures and thei r timing are summarized in the SoA in Section 1.3for the Main Study
and in Section 1.4and Section 1.5for the OLE.
Safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediatel y upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the patien t should continue or discontinue IP.
Adherence to the study design requ irements, including those specified  in the SoA, is essential 
and required for study conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed an d reviewed to confirm that potential patients
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
patients screened and to confirm eligibility or reco rd reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Once all screening procedures are complete and the Investigator determines that the patient is 
eligible, the site must upload/send the requi red supporting documenta tion for approval by the
Sponsor. The required information will include the RHC report (including tracings), PFTs 
obtained (may use PFTs completed in the 24 we ek period prior to screening or obtained at 
Screening), the screening echocardiogram, as well  as specific information about the patient’s 
medical history and disease state to further en sure the appropriateness of each patient being 
enrolled into this study. Approva l from the Sponsor must be obtained prior to randomization.
All assessments should be completed predose unless otherwise stated.
If assessments are scheduled for the same nominal time, then the assessme nts should occur in the 
following order whenever possible: ECGs, vita l signs, safety blood draws, PK blood draws.
Note: The timing of the assessments should allow th e blood draw to occur as close as possible 
to the nominal time but before dosing.
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for sa fety reasons or due to technical issues with 
the initial samples.
9.1. Efficacy Assessments
The efficacy-related assessments, as outlined below,  will be obtained at time points indicated in 
the SoA in Section 1.3and Section 1.4.
9.1.1. Right Heart Catheterization
The RHC is a common procedure used to diagnose PAH.Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics will be assessed by RHC. All required RHC parameters must 
be collected using the same methods at  Screening/Randomization and Week 24. The 
Screening/Randomization RHC will be required to c onfirm the diagnosis of PAH, and data from 
this RHC will serve as the baseline value for the primary and secondary analyses of 
cardiopulmonary hemodynamic para meters. Since the study is enro lling treatment-experienced 
patients, results from a historic al RHC conducted prior to the Scr eening Visit are not expected to 
reflect the patient’s current disease status un less it was performed within 4 weeks of the 
Screening visit, includes all re quired information, and provided th at changes to the patient’s 
PAH regimen were not made subs equent to that catheterization.

ConfidentialIf prior approval is obtained from the Sponsor , the screening RHC ma y be performed on the 
same day as the randomization procedures, provided that all bl ood draws and efficacy 
assessments are conducted prior to the RHC procedure, and the RHC is performed prior to 
randomization and IP dosing. The hemodynamic assessment will be conducted in the supine position under resting conditions. The original RHC tracings will be maintained at the site. The 
RHC tracings will have all personal health info rmation removed and will be labeled with the 
following: patient number, patient initials, protocol number, and date recorded. 
Full details available in RHC manual.
9.1.2. Time to Clinical Improvement
TTCI will be evaluated by a multicomponent  improvement score including WHO FC and 
6MWT measurements: a > 10% increase in 6MWD or 30 meters AND an improvement to or 
maintenance of WHO FC II sympto matology, in the absence of a deterioration in clinical 
condition or death during the 24 weeks of the Main Study.
9.1.3. Time to Clinical Worsening
TTCW is defined as the first occurrence of a co mposite end point of: 1. Death from any cause, 
2. Hospitalization for worsening PAH (any hospitaliz ation for worsening P AH, lung or heart and 
lung transplantation, atrial septos tomy, or initiation of parenteral  prostanoid therapy), 3. Disease 
progression defined as a decrease of more than  15% from baseline in the 6MWD combined with 
WHO FC III or IV symptoms at 2 consecutive visits separated by at least 14 days (adjudicated).
9.1.4. Six-Minute Walk Test/S ix-Minute Walk Distance
The 6MWT is a simple, commonly used, standard ized measure of functional exercise capacity 
and endurance. It is a commonly us ed measure of efficacy in PA H clinical studies. The change 
from baseline in 6MWD following intervention in dicates symptomatic improvement over that 
time-period. Improvement in 6MWD has been correlated with improvements in quality of life.
Refer to Appendix 6 .
9.1.5. Echocardiography
Patients will undergo resting card iac echocardiography at specif ied visits. Echocardiographic 
endpoints will include right atrial size and meas ures of RV function (TAPSE, tricuspid annular 
systolic velocity, and RV frac tional area change). There will be  a core imaging laboratory for 
centralized blinded ad judication of the echoc ardiographic endpoints.
Full details available in echocardiograph manual.
9.1.6. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)
PFTs (performed with or without  bronchodilation) should be comple ted at Screening if there are 
no historical results from tests complet ed within 24 weeks prior to Screening.

Confidential9.1.7. World Health Organization Functional Class
PAH functional disease severity is classified acco rding to WHO FC.  Patients are classified into 
1 of 4 functional classes on the basis of their degree of physical limi tation and associated 
symptoms. Refer to Appendix 7 for full description of each Functional Class.
9.1.8. N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide Level
NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of disease pr ogression and mortality in PAH patients. Current 
PAH treatment guidelines reco mmend measurement of NT-pro BNP levels for both risk 
assessment and longitudinal follow up. NT-proBNP le vels are also a good marker of response to 
treatment.
9.1.9. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-S ymptoms and Impact Questionnaire
The PAH SYMPACT Questionnaire is the first instrument for quantifying PAH symptoms and 
impacts. It is a brief, disease- specific patient-reported outc ome (PRO) instrument possessing 
good psychometric properties.
The questionnaire consists of two parts:
xDay 1 to Day 6: The Questionnaire asks 13 questions regarding the patient’s PAH 
symptoms for the past 24 hours. The patient is required to complete these questions 
each day for Days 1 to 6.
xDay 7: The Questionnaire asks 12 questions regarding the patient’s PAH symptoms 
for the past 24 hours and an additional 11 questions about the “I mpacts” that best 
describes how the patient’s life was affected by PAH.
Prior to departing the study site at the Screening Vis it, patients will be inst ructed and trained on 
how to complete the questionnaire. Patients will  start the PAH-SYMPACT questionnaire 6 days 
prior to the visit for which PAH-SYMPACT is co llected, with the Day 7 being completed on the 
day of the visit.
An example of the PAH SYMPAC T Questionnaire can be found in Appendix 9 .
9.1.10. Registry to Evaluate Early and Long -term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
Disease Management Lite 2 R isk Assessment Calculator
REVEAL Lite 2 includes 6 non-invasive variab les: FC, vital signs (SBP and HR), 6MWD, 
NT-proBNP, and renal insufficiency (by eGFR). REVEAL Lite 2 will be a calculated parameter
(by statistician) at Baseline and Week 24 of the Main Study and Week 24 of the OLE (this 
calculation will not be in the eCRF).

9.2.1. Pregnancy Testing
Serum pregnancy tests will be obtained for all female patients of childbearing potential at 
Screening and every 4 weeks while on IP. Urine  pregnancy tests will be obtained at all 
subsequent visits and must be  confirmed negative at  the Baseline Visit before randomization and 
IP dispensation. Additional pregnancy tests should be completed anytime menstruation is 
delayed and in women with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycles. A positive urine test will be 
confirmed by a serum test.
Serum pregnancy test and FSH levels will be obtained at the Screening Visit for any 
postmenopausal women with amenorrhea for < 2 years to confirm FSH level (must be
> 35 IU/mL). If FSH value is confirmed as postme nopausal at Screening, no further pregnancy 
tests are required.  If level doe s not confirm postmenopausal status , urine pregnancy tests will be 
required at all scheduled visits and patients must agree to us e an approved method of highly 
effective contraception (refer to Section 5.4.1 ).
Planned time points for all safety asse ssments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3, Section 1.4,
and Section 1.5).
9.2.2. Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will include, at  a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological systems. Height ( only at Screening) and weight 
will also be measured and recorded.
Investigators should pay special at tention to clinical si gns related to previous serious illnesses.
9.2.3. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be measured after 5 minutes re st and will include temperature, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, respir ation rate and oxygen saturation.
9.2.4. Electrocardiograms
Three 12-lead ECGs, one minute apart, will be obt ained after at least 5 minutes of rest at
Baseline. Single 12-lead ECGs will be performed at all other time points.
Each ECG performed during the study will be obtained using an ECG machine that 
automatically calculates the HR and meas ures PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals.
The corrected QT interval (QTc) using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) will be used for each 
individual patient to determine study eligibility and for all on-study ECGs. The QTcF interval 
will be based on the ECG machine’s algorithm.
Clinically significant ECG findings that are present prior to initia tion of IP, if not exclusionary, 
must be documented in the Me dical History section of the eC RF. Any clinically significant
abnormality that represents a change from baseline will be repor ted as an AE and followed until 
resolution.

therapy and tolerability of thera py. If it is not collected at the Baseline/Day 1 visit, it may be 
collected at any time during the treatment period.  Providing th ese blood samples is optional and 
not required for participation in the study.
9.2.7. Optional Blood Sample for Future Research
In addition to the study-specific informed consent to be signed by each patient participating in 
the study, a separate, specific si gnature will be required to docu ment a patient’s agreement to 
provide additional samples or to  allow the use of the remainder of their already collected 
biomarker specimens for optional non-genetic futu re research, once approved by local authorities 
as applicable according to specific local regulati ons.  The specimens collect ed for optional future 
research will be used to increase our knowledge  and understanding of th e biology pathogenesis, 
progression and/or treatment outcomes, including efficacy, AE s, and the process of drug 
absorption and disposition.  
A plasma sample will be obtained from all patients at the Day 1/Ba seline visit and at the end of 
the treatment or ET (as applicable) visit of the Main Study for future  research use.  Samples will 
be collected and archived by the sponsor for up to 10 years.
9.2.8. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring
Rodatristat ethyl acts to decrea se peripheral 5-HT levels and it was designed to not cross the 
blood-brain barrier; therefore, CN S 5-HT levels are not expected to be significantly impacted.
However, patients being treated with IP should be  monitored appropriately  and observed closely 
for suicidal ideation and behavior  or any other unusual changes in  behavior, especially at the 
beginning and end of the course of  treatment, or at the time of dos e changes, either increases or 
decreases. IP in patients who experience signs of  suicidal ideation or behavior following a risk 
assessment (see Section 8.1) must be stopped.
Screening and Baseline assessments ( within 1 month) of su icidal ideation and behavior as well as 
potential treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be monitored during the study 
using the C-SSRS.
Suicidal ideation and behavior as well as mood a nd anxiety assessments, as detailed below, will

Confidential 9.2.8.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C-SSRS is a valid, reliable, evidenced-based suicidal ideation and be havior rating scale,
which was developed by multiple institutions, including Columbia University with National 
Institute of Mental Health support,  to evaluate suicide risk ( CLP, 2016 ).  The
rater-/clinician-administered versio ns of the C-SSRS for research assess severity and intensity of 
suicidal ideation, types of suicidal  behaviors, and lethality of suic ide attempts at time points and 
over time periods that are t ypical for randomized control st udies. The C-SSRS has been 
identified by the FDA ( FDA, 2012 ) as acceptable for use in clinical  research and has been used 
extensively in clinical studies throughout the U.S. and around the world. 
Training should be completed by any study staff delegated to perfo rm this assessment.  Online 
training is available, and a certificate of completion is issued once the training is completed and must be filed at the site.  Tr aining must be current within th e previous 2 years. The sign-up and 
training portal can be found at the following link:   
https://cssrs.columbia.edu/training/training-research-setting/ An example of the C-SSRS can be found in Appendix 10.

The HADS is a 14-item, self-rated measure designed to be used as a brief screen for depression 
(7 items) and anxiety (7 items) disorders among nonpsychiatric, medically ill, outpatient 
populations ( Zigmond & Snaith, 1983 ).  As a screening instrume nt, the HADS does not provide 
a definitive diagnosis, but is the first step in a multistage process of selecting individuals at 
elevated risk for disorder to be evaluated through clinical interview.
An example of the HADS can be found in Appendix 11.
9.2.8.3. Quick Inventory of De pressive Symptomatology 
The 16-item QIDS ( Rush et al., 2003 ) is designed to assess the se verity of depressive symptoms. 
The QIDS is available in the clinician-rated ( QIDS-C) and self-reported versions (QIDS-SR). 
Both versions assess all the criterion symptom domains designated by the American Psychiatry 
Association Diagnostic and Sta tistical Manual of Mental Di sorders - 4th edition (DSM-IV)
(APA, 1994 ) and the 5th edition adds reference to diagnose a majo r depressive episode. The 
QIDS-C version will be used in this study.  The QIDS-C is sensit ive to change with medications, 
psychotherapy, or somatic treatments,  making it useful for both rese arch and clinical purposes.  
The psychometric properties of the QIDS-C have been estab lished in various study samples.
An example of the QIDS-C can be found in Appendix 12.

Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 14 .
AEs will be reported by the patient (or, when a ppropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
patient’s legally authorized representative).
The Investigator and any qualified designees ar e responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for follow up
of AEs that are serious, considered related to the IP or study procedures, or that caused the 
patient to discontinue the study (see Appendix 14 ).
9.3.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest
AESIs include:
ЬSevere constipation (and/or severe, pers istent, or worsening abdominal pain)
ЬDepression/other significant mood-related disturbance (active suicidal ideation or 
behavior, severe depressive and/or anxious symptoms, othe r severe psychiatric TEAE)
ЬElevations in hepatic enzymes (see Appendix 3 )
ЬDiarrhea (see Appendix 2 )
9.3.2. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event, Adverse Events of 
Special Interest, Serious Adverse Event Information
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of  the ICF until the Follow-Up Visit at the time
points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). All AEs will be collected from the first dose of IP.
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP but after obtaining in formed consent will be 
recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical  Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE 
section.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to th e Sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 14 . The Investigator will 
submit any updated SAE data to the Spons or within 24 hours of it being available.
Adverse events of special interest must be reported to the Sponso r should they meet the 
definition of an SAE, and a ll timelines for repor ting of SAEs should be adhered to.
Investigators are not obligate d to actively seek AEs or SA Es after conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator lear ns of any SAE, includ ing a death, at any time 
after a patient has been discharg ed from the study, and he/she  considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the IP or study participatio n, the Investigator mu st promptly notify the 
Sponsor.

Confidential9.3.3. Method of Detecting Adverse Events, Ad verse Events of Special Interest, and 
Serious Adverse Events
The method of recording, evaluating, and a ssessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and tran smitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 14 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when  detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of  the patient is the preferre d method to inquire about AE
occurrences.
9.3.4. Follow-up of Adverse Events, Adverse Ev ents of Special Interest, and Serious 
Adverse Events
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactivel y follow each patient at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AESIs (as defined in Section 9.3.1 ), will 
be followed until resolution, stabi lization, the event is otherwise e xplained, or the patient is lost 
to follow up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow- up procedures is given in
Appendix 14 .
9.3.5. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
Prompt notification by the Invest igator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsib ilities towards the safety of patients and the safety of an IP
under clinical inve stigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulator y authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of an IP under clinical inves tigation. The Sponsor will 
comply with country-specific regulatory requi rements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must  be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions
(SUSARs) according to local regulatory require ments and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report desc ribing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SA Es) from the Sponsor will re view and then file 
it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will  notify the IRB/IEC, if  appropriate, according 
to local requirements.
9.3.6. Pregnancy
Patients will be instructed that if they/their part ner become pregnant durin g the study, this should 
be reported to the Investigator. The Investigator  should also be notified of any pregnancy that 
occurs during the study but not confirmed until after completion of th e study for at least 
5 terminal half-lives (4 weeks) after the last dose. In the event that a patient/patient’s partner is subsequently found to be pregnant  after being included in the st udy, then consent will be sought 
from the partner and, if granted, any pregnancy w ill be followed, and the status of the mother 
and/or child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery.

ConfidentialAny patient reporting a pregnancy during the study will be discontinued from the IP. The patient
will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of 
the mother and child will be forwarded to th e Sponsor. Generally, follow up will be no longer 
than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated deliver y date. Any premature termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported. Abnormal pregnanc y outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal 
death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4 .
9.4. Treatment of Overdose
Prior to this study, there has been no experience with rodatristat ethyl in patients with PAH. In 
healthy subjects, no safety concerns were id entified following single doses ranging from 100 mg 
to 2000 mg or following repeat dosing over 14 da ys of up to 800 mg administered BID or up to 
800 mg administered once daily (QD).
An overdose in this study is defined as a dose > 1200 mg on any single dosing occasion, or 
> 2400 mg in any 24-hour period.
Altavant Sciences GmbH does not recomm end specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should:
1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately
2. Closely monitor the patient for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities as applicable
3. Obtain an unscheduled plasma sample fo r PK analysis if requested by the Medical 
Monitor (determined on a case-by-case basis)
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as  well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifi cations will be made by the Investigator in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the patient.

Confidential9.5. Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples for PK analysis of plasma rodatris tat ethyl, rodatristat, M15  metabolite, selexipag, 
and ACT-333679 will be collected by indwelling cannula or venipuncture at the time points 
indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Note, selexipag/ACT-333679 PK samples will only be
collected in subjects using sele xipag at baseline. The actual date  and time of each blood sample 
collection will be recorded.
The date and time of the dose of IP taken prior to the collection of each PK sample will be 
recorded and if the meal the dose was taken with  was high in fat, should also be recorded.
Sample analysis will be perform ed under the control of the Spons or. Plasma concentrations of 
rodatristat ethyl, rodatristat, M15, selexipa g, and ACT-333679 will be determined using 
validated liquid chromatography-tandem ma ss spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. Raw data 
will be archived at the bioanalytical site(s). Once  the sample(s) has been analyzed for rodatristat 
ethyl, rodatristat, M15, selexipag, and ACT-333679, a ny remaining sample may be analyzed for 
other rodatristat-related metabolites and the results may be reported separately.
Samples will be collected into appropriate tube s as specified by the bi oanalytical laboratory. 
Details of blood collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the laboratory
manual.
Rodatristat ethyl and rodatristat concentration information that would unblind the study will not 
be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel (including the Sponsor) until the study has 
been unblinded.
9.6. Pharmacodynamics
Blood samples for determination of plasma 5-HIAA will be colle cted by indwelling cannula or 
venipuncture at the time points in dicated in the SoA in Section 1.3. The actual date and time of 
each blood sample collection will be recorded.
Urine samples will be collected for determination of 5-HIAA (bioanalytical lab) and urine 
creatinine (central laboratory; for determinati on of creatine corrected 5-HIAA concentration) at 
the time points indicated in the SoA in Section 1.3and Section 1.4.
Sample analysis will be performed under th e control of the Sponsor. Plasma and urine 
concentrations of 5-HIAA will be determined  using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Raw data

Confidential10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
A detailed description of statistical methods will  be provided in a separa te Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) and the SAP will be fina lized prior to database lock.
10.1. Statistical Hypotheses
No formal hypotheses are planned for the study.
10.2. Sample Size Determination
The sample size for this study was not based on a formal hypothesis testing. It is expected that 
30 patients per arm will provide sufficient da ta to assess the safety and efficacy. Power 
calculations were conducted to examine the pr obability of detecting a difference among 
treatment groups for th e percentage change of PVR from baseline.
A sample size of 90 patients with 30 patients to be  randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment arms in a 
1:1:1 randomization is planned. A sample size of 30 patients per arm will provide at least 
80% power at a significance level of 0.05 (2-sided hypothesis) to de tect a treatment difference of 
0.75 times of standard deviation (SD) in the percentage change from baseline of PVR from 
baseline between an active arm and the placebo arm. If the SD for PVR percent change is 24%, 
the study has 80% power to detect a differenc e of 18% between an active arm and the placebo 
arm.
10.3. Populations for Analyses
For purposes of analysis, the fo llowing populations are defined:
Population Description
Enrolled All patients who sign the ICF
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) All patients randomized into the study. For all summaries based 
on the ITT population, patients w ill be assigned to the treatment 
arm to which they were randomized.
Modified Intent-to-Treat (m-ITT): All safety population patients th at had an evaluable baseline
and completed at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment.Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment theyactuall
yreceived.
Per Protocol (PP) All m-ITT population patients who had no major protocol 
deviations and completed the Week 24 visit.
Safety All patients randomly assigned to IP and who take at least 1 dose 
of IP. Patients will be analyzed  according to the treatment they 
actually received.

The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the patient
populations to be included in the analyses a nd procedures for accounting for missing, unused, 
and spurious data. This section is a summary of th e planned statistical analyses of the primary 
and secondary endpoints.
10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary Primary efficacy analyses will be performed using the m-ITT and PP 
populations.Percent change from baseline in PVR will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) with Baseline PVR as the covariate. Additional baseline characteristics may also be ev aluated as covariates in the model.
The estimated between-treatment di fferences, 95% confidence intervals
(CIs), and p-values will be presented. For patients who discontinue from the study early, the last-observation-carried -forward method will be used to impute 
the PVR at Week 24.
Secondary Secondary efficacy analyses will be  performed using the m-ITT and PP 
populations:Change in cardiac index, mPAP, mRAP, SvO2 at rest, and PAC from baseline to 
Week 24
xTTCW
xChange in WHO FC
xChange in 6MWD from baseline
xChange in NT-proBNP
xChange in right atrial size & RV function: TAPSE, tricuspid annular 
systolic velocity, and RV fracti onal area change from baseline
xREVEAL Lite 2 score
xChange in PAH-SYMPACT from Baseline to Week 24
xChange in 5-HIAA (plasma a nd spot urine concentration)
The change from baseline to Week 24 endpoints will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model with treatment  as a fixed effect, ra ndomization stratum and 
baseline assessment as covariates. The estimated between-treatment differences, 95% CIs, and p-va lues will be presented.
The change in 6MWD from baseline to Week 24 will also be compared between 
groups using non-parametric analysis of covariance within the framework of the 
extended Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. For endpoints meas ured over time, a 
mixed effect of repeated measure model may be used as sensitivity analyses.
Details of statistical methods will be provided in the SAP. The time from the 
first dose of IP until to the first clinical worsening event will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compar ed between treatment groups using the 
log-rank test.

10.4.2. Safety Analyses
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by assessment of AE incidence and changes in clinical 
laboratory tests, physical examin ations, vital signs measuremen ts, ECG readings, and suicidal 
ideation and behavior ratings at various time points during the study.
The following AE summaries will be generated:
xAdverse events
xSerious adverse events
xAdverse events leading to discontinuation
xAdverse events by severity
xAdverse events by relationship to the IP
AE verbatim text will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). All AEs, both serious and nonseri ous, will be listed. AE summaries by treatment 
group and consisting of the number a nd percent of patients reporting each event at least once will 
be generated.
Clinical values will be listed for each patient an d flagged high or low relative to the normal range 
where appropriate. Descriptive summary stat istics will be created by treatment and visit.
Other safety data (e.g., physical examination) w ill be summarized descriptively by treatment and
visit.
10.4.3. Other Analyses
Patient reported outcomes (HADS and QIDS-C), PK, PD, and exploratory descriptive analyses 
will be described in the SAP finalized before  database lock.  Population PK and any PK/PD
analyses will be documented in a separate an alysis plan and may be reported separately.
The planned analyses for the OLE portion of the study will be provided in the SAP.
10.5. Interim Analyses 
An external, multidisciplinary, IDMC will review the progress of the study and perform interim 
reviews of unblinded safety da ta at regular intervals and provide recommendations to the 
Sponsor whether the nature, frequency, and seve rity of AEs and AESIs associated with IP
warrant the early termination of the study in the best interests of  the patients, whether the study 
should continue as planned, or whether the study should continue with modifications. The 
IDMC may also provide recommendations as needed regarding study design. While the IDMC 
will be asked to advise the Sponsor regarding fu ture conduct of the study, including possible 
early study termination, the Sponsor retains final decision-making authority on all aspects of the 
study.
A separate SAP will describe the planne d interim analyses in greater detail.

ConfidentialAPPENDIX 4. COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION
Definitions
Woman of childbearing potential
A woman is considered fertile following menarc he and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).If fertility is unclear (e.g., amenor rhea in adolescents or athletes ) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of IP, additional evaluation should be considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing potential
1. Premenarchal
2. Premenopausal female with one of the following:
xDocumented hysterectomy
xDocumented bilateral salpingectomy
xDocumented bilateral oophorectomy
3. For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than
 the
above,
(e.g., Müllerian agenesis, androgen inse nsitivity), Investigator di scretion should
be applied to determining study entry.
4.Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the patient’s medical
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
5.
Postmenopausal female
xA postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative
medic
al cause.
A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH ) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement th erapy (HRT). However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmati on with more than one FSH measurement 
is required.
xFemales on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non-estrogen hormonal hi ghly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwi se, they must discontinue their HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausa l status before study enrollment.

ConfidentialCollection of Pregnancy Information
Male patients with partners who become pregnant
xThe Investigator will attempt to collect pr egnancy information on any male patient’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in this study. This 
applies only to male patients who receive the investigational product.
xAfter obtaining the necessary signed inform ed consent from the pregnant female 
partner directly, the Investigator will record pregnanc y information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the Sponsor within  24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
Sponsor. Generally, the follow up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless 
of fetal status (presence or absence of a nomalies) or indication for the procedure.
Female Patients who become pregnant
xThe Investigator will coll ect pregnancy information on any female patient who 
becomes pregnant while participating in th is study. Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and s ubmitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a 
patient's pregnancy.
xThe patient will be followed to determin e the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow-up information on the patient and the neonate, and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow up will not be 
required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.
xWhile pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE), any pregnancy comp lication or elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an AE or  SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any poststudy 
pregnancy-related SAE considered reasonabl y related to the i nvestigational product
by the Investigator will be reported to  the Sponsor as described in Section 9.3.5 .
While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former 
study patients, he or she may learn of  an SAE through spontaneous reporting.
xAny female patient who becomes pregnant  while participating in the study will 
discontinue the inves tigational product and be withdrawn from the study.

ConfidentialAPPENDIX 6. SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST GUIDELINES
The six-minute walk test (6MWT) should be performed in accordance with the American 
Thoracic Society Guidelines. Please refer to the ATS guidelines and the following general 
procedures for conducting the 6MWT:
Testing Location:
xThe 6MWT should be performed indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor 
with a hard surface that is seldom travele d.  The location should be quiet and free of 
distractions and drafts.
xThe walking course must be 30 meters in le ngth (any deviations from this must be 
reviewed with and approved by the Medica l Monitor/Sponsor prio r to initiating the 
study). A 100-foot hallway is, therefore, requ ired. The length of the corridor should be 
marked every 3 meters. The turnaround points s hould be marked with a cone (such as an 
orange traffic cone). A starting line, which marks the beginning and end of each 60 meter
lap, should be marked on the floor  using brightly colored tape.
Required Equipment:
xCountdown timer (or stopwatch)
xMechanical lap counter
xTwo small cones to mark the turnaround points
xA chair that can be easily m oved along the walking course
xWorksheets (to be provided) on a clipboard
xA source of oxygen
xSphygmomanometer
xAutomated electronic defibrillator
Testing:
Patient Preparation:
xComfortable clothi ng should be worn
xAppropriate shoes for wa lking should be worn
xPatients should use their usual walking ai ds during the test (cane, walker, etc.)
xThe patient’s usual medical regimen should be continued on testing days
xA light meal is acceptable before early morni ng or early afternoon tests, at least 2 hours 
before testing
Patients should not have smoke d or exercised vigorously with in 2 hours of beginning the test

ConfidentialTesting Conditions:
xThe patient should sit at rest in a chair, lo cated near the starting position, for at least 
10 minutes before the test st arts. During this time, check for contraindications, measure 
pulse and blood pressure and make sure that clothing and sh oes are appropriate.
xTo reduce the variability of the 6MWTs, it is of utmost importance that the eligibility tests 
(Screening and Baseline) and all follow ing 6MWTs are performed under the same 
conditions:
RThe same tester should ad minister the 6MWT for a given patient throughout the trial 
whenever possible
RThe same time of day for conducting the 6MWT for a given patient should be used 
whenever possible to minimize intra-day variability
RPatients who used walking aids at the eligibility tests (Screening and Baseline,
e.g., cane or walker) need to use the same  walking aids at every subsequent 6MWT
xSite staff will need to document if a walking aid (and what type) was used at
each test, if applicable
xIf the patient
normally requires supplemental oxy gen when walking, then the test should be 
performed on the patient’s “usual” walking oxyg en flow rate at Ba seline and during all 
subsequent 6MWTs whenever possible.  If the patient usually breathes room air while 
walking, they should perfor m the test on room air.
RPatients who add supplemental oxygen after the Baseline Visit s hould walk without 
oxygen during subsequent walk tests when ever possible so that data will be 
comparable to baseline conditions. However, if this is not possible (from a patient 
safety perspective) then the 6MWT may be conducted with the supplemental oxygen 
and this should be noted in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
RFor patients on supplemental oxygen at Baseline, if the oxygen flow rate must beincreased during the trial due to wors ening gas exchange, 6MWTs should be 
conducted using the same oxygen flow rate that was used at the Baseline Visit 
whenever possible.  However, if this is not possible (from a patient safety 
perspective) then the 6MWT may be conducte d at the increased flow rate and this 
should be noted in the eCRF.
RIf the patient reduces or discontinues supplemental oxygen use during the study, the 
patient should still perform th e 6MWT with the same oxygen flow rate that was used 
at the Baseline Visit.
Instructions for the Patient and Test Administrator:
xA “warm-up” period should not be  performed before the test
xSet the lap counter to zero and the timer to 6 minutes.  Assemble all necessary equipment and 
move to the starting point.
xThe Tester/Investigator should st and near the starting line duri ng the test but should not walk

possible in 6 minutes.
xThe tester should not influence the walking pace of the patient.
xDuring the walk, the patients will be allowed to stop intermittently  and stand or sit, or lean 
against the wall, to rest if the patient can no longer continue, but they should resume walking 
as soon as they feel able to do so (see below for instructive language th at should be used in 
this instance). The clock must con tinue to run during the brief rests.
xThe Tester can stop the test at any time for safety-related reasons  (e.g., chest pain, intolerable 
dyspnea, leg cramps, pale or ashen-looking appearance).
Patient Instructions Before the Test - The person administering the test will use the following 
dialog with the patient immediately before the test (repeat the entire set of instructions if the 
patient does not seem to understand):
R“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes. You will walk back 
and forth in this hallway. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you will be exerting 
yourself. You will probably get out of br eath or become exhausted. You are 
permitted to slow down, to stop, and to re st, as necessary. You may lean against the 
wall while resting but resume walking as soon as you are able. You will be walking
back and forth around the cones. You s hould pivot briskly around the cones and 
continue back the other way without he sitation. Now I’m going to show you. Please 
watch the way I turn without hesitation.” ( The tester then demonstrates by walking 
one lap and pivots around a cone briskly ). 
R“Are you ready to do that? I am  going to use this counter to  keep track of the number 
of laps you complete. I will c lick it each time you turn ar ound at this starting line. 
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE fo r 6 minutes, but don’t 
run or jog.” ( The tester should position the patient  at the starting line and ask the 
patient if he/she has any questions about th e test and should confirm that the patient 
understands what he/she is expected to do.  Re peat the entire set of  instructions if the 
patient does not seem to understand).
R“Start now, or whenever you are ready.”
xPatient Instructions During the Test – As soon as the patient starts  to walk, start the timer. 
The person administering the test  should not walk with the patie nt.  The Tester should not 
talk to anyone during the tes ting. Only standardized phrases for encouragement can be used 
during the test.  To best ensure reproducibility  and consistency of the testing, standardized 
phrases should be used every minut e according to the following pattern:
RAfter the 1stminute, tell the patient the follow ing (in even tones): “You are doing 
well. You have 5 minutes to go.”
RWhen the timer shows 4 minut es remaining, tell the pati ent the following: “Keep up 
the good work. You have 4 minutes to go.”
RWhen the timer shows 3 minutes  remaining, tell the patien t the following: “You are 
doing well. You are halfway done.”
RWhen the timer shows 2 minut es remaining, tell the pati ent the following: “Keep up 
the good work. You have only 2 minutes left.”

decides that they should not continue), wheel  the chair over  for the patient to sit on, 
discontinue the walk, and note on the worksh eet the distance, the time stopped, and 
the reason for stopping prematurely. 
RWhen the timer is 15 sec onds from completion, say this: “In a moment I’m going to 
tell you to stop.  When I do, just stop right  where you are, and I will come to you.”  
When the timer rings (or buzzes ), say this: “Stop!”  Walk over to the patient.  Mark 
the spot where they stopped. 
RIf the patient walked for less than 6 minutes (i.e., stops prior to 6 minutes and does 
not start again), record the time walked as well as the distance.
xPost-Test Procedures:
RThe Tester will record the number of laps from the counter and the additional distance 
covered (the number of meters  in the final lap).  Calculate the total distance walked, 
rounding to the nearest meter, a nd record it on the worksheet.
RFollowing the 6MWT, the Tester will always  obtain and record the post-walk Borg 
Dyspnea Score.

ConfidentialAPPENDIX 7. BORG SCALE AND INSTRUCTIONS
Instructions:  Use this rating scale to report how strong your perception is. It can be exertion, 
pain or something else. First l ook at the verbal expressions. Start with them and then the 
numbers. Of these ten (10) or ”Ext remely strong”, “Maximal” is a v ery important in tensity  level. 
This is the most intense percep tion or feeling yo u have ever had.
If your experience or feeling is “Very weak”, you should  say “1”, if it is “Moderate”, say “3”. 
Note that “Moderate” is “3” and thus weaker th an “Medium”, “Mean” or “Mid dle”. If the 
experience is “Strong” or “Heavy” (it feels “Difficu lt”) say “5”. Note that “Strong” is abou t half 
of “Maximal”. If your feeling is “Very strong”, choose a numbe r from 6 to 8. If your perception 
or feeling is stronger than  ”10”, - “Extremely strong”, “Maximal” – you can use a larger numb er, 
e.g. 12 or still higher (that’s why “Absolute maximum” is marked with a dot.
It's very important that you re port what you actually experience or feel, not what you think you 
should rep ort. Be as spontaneous and honest as possible and try to avoid u nder- or 
overestimatin g. Look at the verbal de scriptors and  then choose a number.
When rating exertion give a numb er that correspo nds to how hard and strenuou s you perceive the 
work to be. The perception of exer tion is mainly felt as strain a nd fatigue in your muscles and as 
breathlessness or any aches.
0 ”Nothing at all”, means that you don’t feel any exertio n wh atsoever, no muscle fatig ue, no  
breathlessness or di fficulties breathing.
1 “Very weak” means a very light exertion. As taking  a shorter walk at yo ur own  pace.
3 “Moderate” is somewhat but no t especially hard. It feels go od and not difficult to go on.
5 “Strong”. The work is hard and tiring , but con tinuing isn't terribly diff icult. Th e effo rt and  
exertion is about half as intense as “Maximal”.
7 “Very strong” is quite strenu ous. You  can still go on, but you really have to pu sh yourself and 
you are very tired.
10 “Extremely strong – Maximal” is an extremely strenuou s level. For most people th is is the 
most strenuous exertion they have ever experienced previous ly in their lives.

CLASSIFICATION OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
Reference:  (Klinger et al., 2019 ) CLASS DESCRIPTION
Class IPatients with pulmonary hypertensi on (PH) but without resulting 
limitation of physical activity.  Ordina ry physical activity does not cause 
undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope. 
Class IIPatients with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They 
are comfortable at rest.  Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea 
or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope. 
Class IIIPatients with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity.  They 
are comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea 
or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope. 
Class IVPatients with PH with inability to car ry out any physical activity without 
symptoms.  These patients manifest signs of right-heart failure.  Dyspnea 
and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity. 

ConfidentialAPPENDIX 14. ADVERSE EVENTS:  DEFINITIONS AN D PROCEDURES 
FOR RECORDING, EVALUA TION, FOLLOW UP, AND 
REPORTING
Definition of Adverse Event
Adverse Event Definition
xAn adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurr ence in a patient, temporally associated with 
the use of investigational product (IP), whet her or not considered related to the IP.
xNOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of IP.
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition 
xAny abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clin ical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, radiological s cans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from Baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment
of the investigator (i.e., not relate d to progression of underlying disease).
xExacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-ex isting condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or inte nsity of the condition.
xNew conditions detected or diagnosed after IP ad ministration even though it may have been present 
before the start of the study.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequel ae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either IP or a concomitant 
medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/serious adverse event (SAE) unless it is 
an intentional overdose taken with possible suicid al/self-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be 
reported regardless of sequelae.
x“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmaco logical action” per se will not be reported as an 
AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, 
symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from l ack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if 
they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition 
xAny clinically significant abnormal laboratory fi ndings or other abnormal safety assessments 
which are associated with the underlying disease,  unless judged by the Investigator to be more 
severe than expected for the patient’s condition.
xThe disease/disorder being studied or expect ed progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more se vere than expected for the patient’s condition.
xMedical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE.
xSituations in which an untoward medical occurr ence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospital).
xAnticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at 
the start of the study that do not worsen.

ConfidentialDefinition of Serious Adverse Event
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then  it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptom s of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
1. Results in death
2. Is life-threatening
The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious ' refers to an event in wh ich the patient was at risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to  an event, which hypothetically might have caused 
death, if it were more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient h as been detained (usually  involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospital or em ergency ward for observation and/or  treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills an y other serious criteria, 
the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-exis ting condition that did not worsen from Baseline is 
not considered an AE.
4. Results in persistent disability/incapacity
xThe term disability means a substantial disrup tion of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.
xThis definition is not intended to include experi ences of relatively minor medical significance such 
as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
6. Other situations:
xMedical or scientific judgment should be ex ercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important  medical events that may not be immediately life
threatening or result in death or hospitalizati on but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the other outcomes listed in the above definition.
These events should usually  be considered serious.
xExamples of such events include invasive or  malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronc hospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization, or devel opment of drug dependency or drug abuse.

ConfidentialRecording and Follow Up of Adverse Ev ents and/or Serious Adverse Events
Adverse Event and Seriou s Adverse Event Recording
xWhen an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports , and diagnostics reports) related to the event.
xThe Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the case report form.
xIt is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the patient’s medical records to 
Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE case report form page.
xThere may be instances when copies of medical re cords for certain cases are requested by Sponsor.
In this case, all patient identifiers, with the excep tion of the patient number, will be redacted on the 
copies of the medical records before submission to Sponsor.
xThe Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnos is of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or 
other clinical information. Whenever possible, th e diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) 
will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The Investigator will make an assessment of in tensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study 
and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
xMild: An event that is easily tolerated by the patient, causing minimal discomfort, and not 
interfering with everyday activities.
xModerate: An event that causes sufficient di scomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.
xSevere: An event that prevents normal everyday ac tivities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an 
event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
xAn event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in 
the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
xThe Investigator is obligated to assess the re lationship between IP and each occurrence of each 
AE/SAE.
xA “reasonable possibility” of a relationship convey s that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, ra ther than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
xThe Investigator will use clinical j udgment to determine the relationship.
xAlternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as 
well as the temporal relationship of the event to IP administration will be considered and 
investigated.
xThe Investigator will also consult the Investig ator’s Brochure and/or Product Information, for 
marketed products, in his/her assessment.
xFor each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
xThere may be situations in which an SAE h as occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.

ConfidentialAssessment of Causality
xThe Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and 
send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
xThe Investigator is obligated to perform or ar range for the conduct of s upplemental measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as  requested by the Sponsor to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as po ssible. This may include additional laboratory tests 
or investigations, histopathological examinati ons, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.
xIf a patient dies during participation in the st udy or during a recognized follow-up period, the 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of any post-mort em findings including 
histopathology.
xNew or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed case report form.
xThe Investigator will submit any up dated SAE data to the Sponsor wi thin 24 hours of receipt of the 
information. 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Serious Adverse Event Reporting to the Spons or via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
xThe primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
tool.
xIf the electronic system is unavaila ble, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see 
next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours).
xThe site will enter the SAE data into the elect ronic system as soon as it becomes available.
xAfter the study is completed at a given site, the el ectronic data collection tool will be taken off-line 
to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
xIf a site receives a report of a new SAE from  a study patient or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the electronic data co llection tool has been taken off-line, then the 
site can report this information on a paper SAE fo rm (see next section) or to the Sponsor’s medical 
monitor/SAE coordinator by telephone.
xContacts for SAE reporting can be foun d on the Contact Information page.
Serious Adverse Event Reporting to th e Sponsor via Paper Case Report Form
xEmail transmission of the SAE paper case report  form is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the Sponsor’s Medical  Monitor or the SAE Coordinator.
xIn rare circumstances and in the absence of f acsimile equipment, notifi cation by telephone is 
acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service.
xInitial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign 
the SAE case report form pages within the designated reporting time frames.
xContacts for SAE reporting can be found on the Contact Information page.

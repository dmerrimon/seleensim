AN OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY  AND KEY INFORMATION  
 
Why is this study  being done?  
The purpose of this research study  is to find out if a virtual reality emotion recognition  
intervention ( Impact VR ) is effective for reducing conduct problems . We think that youth who 
receive the Impact VR  will see greater improvements than youth who do not receive the 
intervention. This study  will allow us to learn more about the intervention’s effectiveness. We 
also want to understand  if the intervention affects other behaviors, such as emotion regulation, 
antisocial behaviors, and emotion recognition . 
 
What will happen if I participate?  
You will be asked to complete questionnaires and interviews about your child’s behavior, 
personality, and experiences, as well as your own behaviors, personality, and experiences. Your 
child will also complete questionnaires and interviews about their beha vior, personality, and 
experiences. This session will take you and your child about one to two hours to complete.  
 
Your child will also be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to one of two groups, either the 
control group or the Impact VR  group. If your child is assigned to the control  group, your child 
will complete a brief PowerPoint presentation on emotional faces and how to identify these 
emotions . If your child is assigned to Impact VR , your child will receive Impact VR, which 
includes four 20 -minute sessions of virtual reality intervention over four weeks. One session will 
be conducted each week.  
 
For all participants , you and your child will be invited to complete the same surveys again at 4 
weeks and 3 months.  If this is  not convenient, we will arrange a time for you and your child to 
complete the follow -up session over the phone or the internet.  
 
You and your child’s participation in this study  will last up to 3 months. Approximately 150 
people  will participate in this study .  
 
What alternative treatments  or procedures are available?  
You have the option to take a paper survey instead of an electronic one. Ask the study  staff  if 
you would like a paper survey. This is a testing study  only. No alternative treatment  is provided.   
 
What are the risks and benefits  of participating?  
There are both risks and benefits  of participating in research studies. We want you to know 
about a few key risks right now.

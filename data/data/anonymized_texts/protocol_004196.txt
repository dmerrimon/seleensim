TITLE: 
A Long-term Study to Evaluate Growth and Development Outcomes in Patients with Infantile-Onset 
Pompe Disease Who Are Receiving Alglucosidase Alfa 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY CENTERS: 
The number of study centers will not be limited prospectively. 
OBJECTIVES: 
The overall objective is to evaluate long-term growth and development of patients with infantile-onset 
Pompe disease who begin treatment with alglucosidase alfa before 1 year of age.  Patients will be followed for a 10-year period.  An additional objective is to collect long-term safety data on patients 
with infantile-onset Pompe disease.  As an exploratory objective, the effect of alglucosidase alfa 
treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated.  For research purposes only, cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) status and GAA mutation analysis will be evaluated. 
METHODOLOGY: 
This is a multicenter study of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease who begin alglucosidase alfa 
treatment prior to 1 year of age.  Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease who begin  alglucosidase alfa treatment prior to their first birthday will be followed in this study for 10 years.   
The patient’s legal guardian(s) must sign the informed consent form prior to performance of any of the 
study assessments outlined in Table 9-1 .   
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety information on an ad hoc basis as outlined in the DSMB charter, which is maintained separately from the study protocol. 
An independent Allergic Reaction Review Board (ARRB) will be consulted on an ad hoc basis as 
outlined in the ARRB charter, which is also maintained separately from this protocol. 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: 
The number of patients followed in this study will not be limited prospectively.   
DIAGNOSIS/INCLUSION CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria
: 
(1) the patient’s legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent prior to study assessments 
being performed; (2) the patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease as determined by deficient endogenous GAA activity or GAA mutation analysis; and (3) the patient must be <1 year of age at time of study enrollment (and receive  alglucosidase alfa treatment before 1 year of age), or the 
patient must be between 1 year and 24 months of age and must have initiated alglucosidase alfa 
treatment prior to turning 1 year of age. 
Exclusion Criteria
: 
(1) the patient is participating in another clinical study using alglucosidase alfa or any investigational 
therapy.

AUTHORITY USE ONLY: 
 Alglucosidase alfa will be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight as prescribed by the treating physician 
every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion.  If clinically feasible, all patients will continue at the same dose throughout the study.  Any modification to the dose and/or frequency of dosing is not permitted unless it is due to disease progression or to an adverse event (AE), in which case it is not a protocol deviation, but the Investigator must consult with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and Global Safety Officer in the event of a dose change.  The dosing change and the reasons for it will be documented on 
the appropriate case report forms.  
It is recommended that the reconstitution and admi nistration instructions in the current prescribing 
information be followed. Patients who meet specific criteria may have the option for home infusions.  Because of the possibility of 
anaphylactic reactions, personnel competent in rec ognizing and treating adverse reactions (including 
anaphylactic reactions) should be readily available throughout the home infusion.  The following criteria must be documented in the patient’s medical record: 
o The patient must be clinically stable with no history of moderate or severe IARs within 6 months prior to planned transition to home infusion. 
o The patient must have no ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may impact the patient’s ability to tolerate infusion. 
o The home infusion agency staff must be trained by the Investigator prior to beginning home infusions.  Any new staff member must be trained by the Investigator prior to beginning home infusions. 
o The home infusion agency staff must have access to and be trained on proper safety equipment, including but not limited to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment. 
o If recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions occur, the Investigator should 
assess whether or not it is safe for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion. 
Genzyme should be notified about all IARs and consulted (as needed) if the patient experiences IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Section 9.5.2 ). 
o Home Infusion Agency must keep source documentation of the infusion, including documentation of any AEs.  Home Infusion Agen cy must be amenable to providing specific 
source documentation to Genzyme and agree to be monitored.  The Principal Investigator is still 
responsible for all study procedures and patient’s safety even when delegating infusion 
responsibilities to the home care company. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for approving a patient’s initiation with home infusions and is ultimately responsible for the safety of the patient during this clinical study.  Refer to the Study Manual and Home Infusion Manual for further details regarding home infusions. 
REFERENCE TREATMENT: 
There will be no comparator treatment or placebo in this study. 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: Efficacy
: The following efficacy assessments will be performed at scheduled visits during the study: 
• Growth as measured by recumbent length/height, weight and head circumference

• Motor development and function, as measured by changes in the motor subscale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age), Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) and Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) 
• Cognitive Development, as measured by the cognitive and language subscales of the Bayley 
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age), change in the 
Brief IQ score of the Leiter International Performance Scale – Revised (Leiter-R) and/or the change in the Nonverbal IQ score of the Leiter International Performance Scale - 3
rd Edition 
(Leiter-3) (starting at the final assessment of the Bayley-III before 42 months of age). 
For patients treated with alglucosidase alfa prior to age 1 (prior to study entry), available retrospective growth and development data will be collected.  Parameters for retrospective data collection will include 
available standard-of-care growth (height, weight, head circumference) and motor milestone information 
(e.g. head support, sitting, standing, and walking ability) from the time of treatment initiation. 
Safety
: The following safety assessments will be performed during the study: AE monitoring, laboratory 
tests (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), anti-rhGAA antibody (immunoglobulin G [IgG]) 
collection, neuroimaging (at the discretion of the Investigator), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), physical examin ations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), hearing testing 
and visual screening. 
Additional safety evaluations will include the assessment of: (1) immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum 
tryptase, complement activation and skin testing, when clinically indicated following moderate, severe, or recurrent IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity; and (2) circulating immune complex detection when clinically indicated by symptoms suggestive of immune complex disease. 
Inhibitory antibody (activity and uptake) will be assessed when clinically indicated (e.g., requirement for 
new invasive ventilator use, plateau or decline in response in the presence of adequate dosing). 
EXPLORATORY: 
The effect of alglucosidase alfa treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated. 
RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY: 
The potential effect of CRIM status and GAA mutation on efficacy outcomes will be analyzed. 
STATISTICAL METHODS: 
The statistical analysis of all growth and developmen t parameters and other efficacy outcomes and safety 
measurements will be conducted on all patients who receive alglucosidase alfa.  All data collected in this 
study will be documented using summary tables, figures and patient data listings.  For categorical 
variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented.  For continuous variables, descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be presented.   
Analyses will be performed using the SAS® statistical software system.  Detailed descriptions of the 
analyses will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL :  02 DECEMBER 2014 4. INTRODUCTION 
Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic muscle disease caused by the deficiency 
of acid α glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme that degrades lysosomal glycogen. As opposed to the 
exclusively cytoplasmic accumulation of glycogen that occurs in other glycogen storage disorders, Pompe disease is characterized by  organelle bound (lysosomal) and extra-lysosomal 
accumulation of glycogen in many body tissues, ultimately leading to multisystemic pathology. 
Historically, Pompe disease has been arbitrarily classified into different subtypes based on the 
age at onset of symptoms, extent of organ i nvolvement, and rate of progression to death.  
Essentially, there is a broad spectrum of disease ranging from a rapidly progressive form 
(infantile-onset) to a more slowly progressive form (late-onset) with considerable variability and 
overlap existing between these extremes ( Chen, 2000, Mol Med Today ; Hirschhorn, 2001, The 
Metabolic and Molecular Base s of Inherited Disease ; van den Hout, 2003, Pediatrics ).  It is 
important to note that all pres entations of Pompe disease shar e a common underlying pathology; 
i.e., deficiency of GAA with subsequent accumulation of glycogen.  
At the most rapidly progressive end of the disease spectrum are patients with the infantile-onset 
form of Pompe disease.  These patients typically present with symptoms within the first 
12 months of life.  A massive deposition of glycogen  in the heart and skeletal muscle results in 
rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy and gene ralized muscle weakness and hypotonia.  
Moreover, motor development is often completely arrested, or if motor milestones are achieved, they are subsequently lost.  Death from cardiac and/or respiratory failure generally occurs before 
most patients reach 1 year of age ( Hirschhorn, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of 
Inherited Disease ).  Patients presenting with this typical disease course have been described in 
the literature as having ‘classical’ infantile-onset Pompe disease.  A subset of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease that survive be yond 1 year has been described by Slonim and 
colleagues ( Slonim, 2000, J Pediatr ).  The clinical course of disease in these patients is 
characterized by a slower progression of card iomyopathy and longer survival, with patients 
generally developing respiratory failure between 1 and 2 years of  age.  Although some patients 
die before 1 year of age, others may survive beyond 2 years. 
The late-onset form of Pompe disease progresses less rapidly than the infantile-onset form.  
Symptoms appear during childhood or as late as th e sixth decade of life.  Patients present with 
progressive myopathy, predominantl y of the proximal muscles in th e pelvic and shoulder girdles, 
and a variable progression of respiratory involve ment.  Typically these patients develop minimal 
or no cardiomyopathy ( Chen, 2000, Mol Med Today ; Laforêt, 2000, Neurology ; Hirschhorn, 
2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Ba ses of Inherited Disease ).  The course of late-onset 
Pompe disease is less predictable than the infantile form, with some patients experiencing a rapid deterioration in skeletal and respiratory musc le function leading to loss of ambulation and

progression of skeletal and resp iratory muscle involvement ( Laforêt, 2000, Neurology ).  
Eventually, most patients become wheelchair-bound, require ve ntilator support and ultimately 
succumb to respiratory failure ( Chen, 2000, Mol Med Today ; Hirschhorn, 2001, The Metabolic 
and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease ). 
Genzyme Corporation has been involved in deve lopment of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
for the treatment of Pompe disease since 1998.  Initially, the clinical development program 
focused primarily on demonstration of safety and efficacy in patients with the infantile-onset 
form of Pompe disease.  Based on the finding s of the clinical trials, Myozyme received 
marketing approval in the United States (US) , European Union (EU) and Canada in 2006 for 
long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease while research to 
establish the benefit of alglucosidase alfa in  late-onset Pompe disease continued.  Lumizyme 
received marketing approval in the United Stat es (US) in 2010 for use in late-onset Pompe 
disease patients 8 years of age and older. In  2014, the indication was expanded for Lumizyme to 
include all patients with a conf irmed diagnosis of Pompe disease, irrespective of age or 
phenotype. The recommended dosage regimen of alglucosidase alfa is 20 mg/kg of body weight administered once every 2 weeks as an intravenou s solution.  A brief overview of results of ERT 
in Pompe disease is provided below. 
In the infantile-onset patients, alglucosidase alfa markedly extended survival as compared to an 
untreated historical cohort ( Kishnani, 2007, Neurology ).  ERT with alglucosidase alfa also 
reversed indices of cardiomyopathy and improved cardiac function in the vast majority of 
patients.  Moreover, cons istent gains in motor function were observed, with a subset of patients 
achieving independent ambulation.  These findings contrast sharply to th e severe and unremitting 
clinical deterioration observed in virtually all untreated patie nts with infantile-onset Pompe 
disease ( van den Hout, 2003, Pediatrics ). 
In patients with late-onset Pompe disease, alglucosidase alfa was associated with maintenance or 
improvements in pulmonary func tion, muscle strength, gross motor function, and functional 
status/disability.  In a study of 5 pediatric patients with late-onset Pompe disease, improvement in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Six Minute  Walk Test (6MWT) resu lts were observed after 
26 weeks of treatment with alglucosidase alfa in 3 patients.  While all 5 patients were 
symptomatic at Baseline, they were still ambul atory and ventilator-free during daytime hours, 
suggesting significant residual muscle function prior to initiation of alglucosidase alfa.  It is likely that such preservation of muscle function contributed to their response to treatment.  In 
contrast, published data on the use of ERT in patients with advanced late-onset Pompe disease have reported major clinical improvements in a patient after years rather than weeks of treatment (Winkel, 2004, Ann Neurol ).  Given the severity of illness in these patients and the progressive

patients could represent clinical stabilization of  the disease by ERT with alglucosidase alfa. 
4.1 Summary of Potential Risks 
Identified safety risks of alglucosidase alfa treat ment include development of infusion-associated 
reactions (IARs) including hypersensitivity a nd life-threatening anaphylactic shock and/or 
cardiac arrest; immune-mediated reactions, immunologic response and acute cardiorespiratory 
failure associated with fluid overload.  Patients in this study will be closely monitored for IARs 
and other adverse reactions.  As with all ongoing  clinical studies of alglucosidase alfa, an 
independent Data Safety Monito ring Board (DSMB) appointed by Genzyme will review safety 
data on an ad hoc basis and an independent A llergic Reaction Review Board (ARRB) appointed 
by Genzyme Corporation will also be consulted, when necessary, to review information and provide treatment recomm endations for IARs.   
For further details concerning warnings, precau tions, and contraindications, the Investigator 
should refer to the appropriate section of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
4.2 Summary of Potential Benefits 
Alglucosidase alfa is a lysosomal glycogen-specific enzyme indicated for patients with Pompe 
disease (GAA deficiency) and is an element of the standard of care.  Enzyme replacement 
therapy with alglucosidase alfa has shown positiv e effects on survival, invasive ventilator-free 
survival, and motor development in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease.   
The treatment administered and assessments performed during this study are not expected to 
provide a direct benefit to the individual patient beyond the sta ndard of care, other than to 
evaluate the long-term growth and development outcomes in patients with infantile-onset Pompe 
disease who are receiving ERT with alglucosidas e alfa. The data obtained in this study are 
expected to benefit the populati on of patients with Pompe diseas e as a whole through collection 
of long-term safety data. 
 
5. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The overall objective is to evaluate long-term growth and development of patients with infantile-
onset Pompe disease who begin treatment with algluc osidase alfa before 1 year of age.  Patients 
will be followed for a 10-year period.  An additional objective is to collect long-term safety data on patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease.  As an exploratory objective, the effect of alglucosidase alfa treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated.  For research 
purposes only, cross-reacting immunologic material  (CRIM) status and GAA mutation analysis 
will be evaluated.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL :  02 DECEMBER 2014 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
6.1 Study Design 
This is a multicenter study of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease who begin 
alglucosidase alfa treatment prior to 1 year of ag e.  Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe 
disease who begin alglucosidase alfa treatment prior to their first birthday will be followed in this study for 10 years.  The number of patients followed in this study will not be limited prospectively. 
The patient’s legal guardian(s) must sign the in formed consent form prior to performance of any 
of the study assessments outlined in Table 9-1 . 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety information on an ad 
hoc basis as outlined in the DSMB Charter, which is maintained separately from the study 
protocol. 
An independent Allergic Reaction Review Board (ARRB) will be consulted on an ad hoc basis 
as outlined in the ARRB Charter, which is also maintained separately from this protocol. 
Efficacy will be evaluated in terms of physical growth, as measured by changes in recumbent 
length/height, weight and head circumference; motor development and function, as measured by 
changes in the motor subscale of the Bayley Scal es of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-
III) (up to 42 months of age), Gross Motor F unction Measure (GMFM-88) and Pompe Pediatric 
Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI); and cognitive development, as measured by 
changes in the cognitive and language subscales of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler 
Development (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age) , change in the Brief IQ score of the Leiter 
International Performance Scale – Revised (Leiter-R) and/or the change in the Nonverbal IQ 
score of the Leiter International Performance Scale – 3
rd Edition (Leiter-3)  (starting at the final 
assessment of the Bayley-III before 42 months of ag e).  As an exploratory objective, the effect of 
alglucosidase alfa treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated.  For research 
purposes only, cross-reacting immunologic materi al (CRIM) status and GAA mutation will be 
evaluated. 
For patients treated with alglucosidase alfa prio r to age 1 (prior to study entry), available 
retrospective growth and development data will be collected.  Parameters for retrospective data 
collection will include available standard-of-care growth (height, weight, head circumference) and motor milestone information (e .g. head support, sitting, standing, and walking ability) from 
the time of treatment initiation. 
Safety will be evaluated in terms of AE monitoring, laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis), anti-rhGAA antibody (IgG) formation, neuroimaging (at the 
discretion of the Investigator), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate , respiratory rate, and

screening. 
Additional safety evaluations will include the assessment of: (1) IgE, serum tryptase, 
complement activation and skin testing, when clin ically indicated following moderate, severe, or 
recurrent IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity; and (2) circulating immune complex detection 
when clinically indicated by symptoms sugges tive of immune complex disease.  Inhibitory 
antibody activity and uptake will be assessed when clinically indicated (e .g., requirement for new 
invasive ventilator use, plateau or decline in response in the presence of adequate dosing). 
7. PATIENT POPULATION AND SELECTION 
Male and female patients with Pompe disease may participate. 
 
7.1 Inclusion Criteria 
Patients must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study: 
1. The patient’s legal guardian(s) must provide  written informed consent prior to study 
assessments being performed; 
2. The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease as determined by 
deficient endogenous GAA activit y or GAA mutation analysis; and 
3. The patient must be <1 year of age at  time of study enrollment (and receive  
alglucosidase alfa treatment before 1 year of age), or the patient must be between 1 year and 24 months of age and must have initiated  alglucosidase alfa treatment prior to turning 1 year of age. 
7.2 Exclusion Criteria 
A patient will be excluded from this study if the following criterion is met: 
1. The patient is participating in another clin ical study using alglucosidase alfa or any 
investigational therapy. 
7.3 Patient Withdrawal 
A patient’s legal guardian(s) is free to withdraw  authorization and discont inue participation in 
the study at any time, and without prejudice to furt her alternate treatment.  If a patient’s legal 
guardian(s) decides to discontinue  participation in the study, the Investigator should immediately 
contact the patient’s legal guardian in order to obtain information about the reason(s) for 
discontinuation.  The Investigator should collect  information pertaining to current AEs and 
follow-up ongoing AEs.  All patients should have final clinical assessments conducted. 
All AEs ongoing at the time of withdrawal or study termination require a 30-day follow up.  The 
Investigator will be asked to follow all SAEs that were ongoing at the time of withdrawal or 
study completion until resolution, until follow-up is deemed no longer medically necessary or

report form (CRF) describing the reason for discontinuation. 
In the event that a patient dies, permission will be sought (through a separate informed consent 
form) from the patient’s legal guardian(s) for a res earch autopsy or post-mortem research biopsy.  
Samples collected from this procedure will be used for research purposes only and data will not 
be provided to the Investigator or be included in any study analyses.  Refer to the Study Manual 
(SM) for research autopsy and post-mortem research biopsy procedural guidelines. 
A patient's participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  The following may be justifiable r easons for the Investigator to remove a patient 
from the study: 
• The patient and/or patient’s le gal guardian(s) is uncooperative, including failure to appear 
at study visits. 
• The patient was erroneously included in the study. 
• The patient develops an exclusion cr iterion or suffers an unmanageable AE. 
• The study is terminated by the Sponsor. 
• The patient and/or patient’s legal guardian(s) refuses algl ucosidase alfa administration. 
• Participation in an investigational study without the prio r authorization of Genzyme. 
To facilitate long-term data co llection, patients will be  encouraged to enroll in the Pompe 
Disease Registry via their treating physicia n after study completion or discontinuation. 
7.4 Study or Site Termination 
If the Sponsor, an Investigator, a clinical monitor, or national regulatory authority official 
discover conditions during the study that indicate the study or a study site should be terminated, this action may be taken after a ppropriate consultation between the Sponsor, the Investigator, the 
clinical monitor, and the DSMB, as appropriate.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the 
study or a study site include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or una cceptable risk to patients enrolled in the 
study. 
• The decision on the part of Genzyme Corporation to end the study. 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with pertinent regulatory authorities. 
• Submission of knowingly false information from  the research facility to the Sponsor, the 
clinical monitor, or regulatory authorities. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL :  02 DECEMBER 2014 8. TREATMENTS 
 
8.1 Treatments Administered 
Alglucosidase alfa will be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight as prescribed by the treating 
physician every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusi on.  If clinically fe asible, all patients will 
continue at the same dose throughout the study.   Any modification to the dose and/or frequency 
of dosing is not permitted unless it is due to disease progression or to an AE, in which case it is not a protocol deviation, but the Investigator mu st consult with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
and Global Safety Officer in the event of a dose change.  The dosing change and the reasons for 
it will be documented on the appropriate CRFs. 
It is recommended that the reconstitution and administration instructions in the current 
prescribing information be followed. 
Patients who meet specific criteria may have th e option for home infusions.  Because of the 
possibility of anaphylactic reactions, personnel competent in recognizing and treating adverse 
reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) should be readily available throughout the home 
infusion.  The following criteria must be documented in the patient’s medical record: 
o The patient must be clinically stable with no history of moderate or severe IARs within 6 
months prior to planned transition to home infusion. 
o The patient must have no ongoing SAEs that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may impact the patient’s ability to tolerate infusion. 
o The home infusion agency staff must be traine d by the Investigator prior to beginning 
home infusions.  Any new staff member must be trained by the Investigator prior to 
beginning home infusions. 
o The home infusion agency staff must have access to and be trained on proper safety 
equipment, including but not limited to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment. 
o If recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity/anaphyla ctic reactions occur, the Investigator should 
assess whether or not it is safe  for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion. 
Genzyme should be notified about all IARs and consulted (as needed) if the patient 
experiences IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Section 9.5.2). 
o Home Infusion Agency must keep source documentation of the infusion, including 
documentation of any AEs.  Home Infusion Agency must be amenable to providing 
specific source documentation to Genzyme and agree to be monitored.  The Principal 
Investigator is still responsible for all study procedures and patient’s safety even when 
delegating infusion responsibilities to the home care company. 
The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for approving a patient’s initiation with home 
infusions and is ultimately responsible for the safe ty of the patient during this clinical study.  
Refer to SM and Home Infusion Manual for further details regarding home infusions.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL :  02 DECEMBER 2014 8.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications/Therapies 
From the time informed consent is obtained thro ugh study completion, all medications taken by 
the patient for AEs, pre-infusion medications and medications for long-term disease management 
will be recorded in the Concomitant Medication CRF.  Concomitant therapies and assistive 
devices will be recorded in the Concomitant Therapies CRF. 
8.3 Treatment Compliance 
The patient’s compliance with the treatment regimen will be monitored in terms of the patient 
receiving the alglucosidase alfa infusion on a regular basis.  Misse d or incomplete infusions will 
be clearly documented and considered in the statistical analyses. 
9. EFFICACY, SAFETY, AND EXPLORATORY VARIABLES 
 
9.1 Schedule of Assessments 
The study will be conducted in conjunction with the patient’s standard of care as outlined in the 
following sections.  Table 9-1  summarizes the Schedule of Assessments at each visit period for 
patients enrolled into this study.  With the ex ception of the Baseline, Day 0 and biweekly study 
assessments, all other assessments  have a window of +/- 60 days.  Any assessments conducted as 
standard of care 30 days before start of first study infusion may be utilized for baseline assessment provided all re quired information is captured.  Infusions received after signing of the 
informed consent form and before completion of  baseline assessments will be captured as a 
Concomitant Medication on CRF.  Details of the assessments are provided in the SM.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL : 02 DECEMBER 2014 The Schedule of Study Assessments will be repeated in 12 month modules (e.g. Year 1, Year 2, etc.).  With the exception of the Baseline, Day 0 and biweekly 
study assessments, all other assessments have a window of +/- 60 days. 
1 Informed consent must be obtained prior to enrollment into the study. 
2 Available retrospective growth and development data including motor milestone information (e.g., head support, sitting, standin g and walking ability) for those 
patients treated with  alglucosidase alfa prior to study entry wi ll be collected to summarize clinical status information for e ach patient at the time of initiation of 
treatment with  alglucosidase alfa to allow for assessment of changes in growth and development over time with treatment with  alglucosidase alfa for all 
patients enrolled. 
3 At each time point, growth measurements (recumbent length or height, weight and head circumference) will be measured 3 times in  a row and averaged.  All 
measurements should be recorded to the nearest tenth of a centim eter.  The measurement of recumbent length or height, weight an d head circumference should 
be performed by an individual, who does not have access to the records of the patient’s earlier measurements in the study and, as far as possible, by the same 
individual at each patient visit.   
4 Bayley-III is to be discontinued when the patient reaches 42 months of age.  The Bayley-III will be administered to patients f rom 1 month of age until the 
maximum score on each of the 3 administered scales has been obt ained.  Once the maximum score for a scale has been achieved, on ly the remaining scales will 
be administered. 
5 Additional anti-alglucosidase alfa IgG antibody testing should be performed upon determination of any notable deterioration in  a patient’s motor function. 
6 Modified Leiter-R Scale or updated Leiter-3 Scale assessment is to be performed at the last assessment of the Bayley-III Cogni tive and Language Scales prior 
to the patient reaching 42 months of age and annually thereafter until the patient reaches the end of the follow up period. If previous assessments have been 
performed using Leiter-R and switch to Leiter-3 Scale is planned, then both assessments need to be performed at the same time o f the initial administration of 
the Leiter-3, in order to create a baseline. The dates of the two tests should be recorded appropriately in the CRFs and the sc ores recorded on the appropriate 
test score sheets. 
7 Oligosaccharide (Hex4) testing will be performed every 6 months until the 24th month and then yearly.   
8 Genzyme Corporation or their designee will perform the CRIM analysis in skin biopsies.  CRIM will be conducted only if written  results are not available. 
9 GAA mutation analysis is to be conducted only if written results are not available.   
10 To be collected every 3 months up to Study Month 24 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24) and annually thereafter.  Additional test ing should be performed upon 
determination of any notable deterioration in a patient’s motor function.  Serum IgG samples should always be collected pre-inf usion at each time point. 
11 Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. 
12 In addition to a Baseline vital sign measurement, vital signs will be monitored prior to the start of each infusion, at the end  of each infusion, and upon the 
occurrence of any IARs. 
13 Prior to each infusion, the patient should be assessed by the PI or appropriate designee to determine if the patient is free o f acute illness and clinically stable to 
receive the infusion.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL :  02 DECEMBER 2014 Recumbent length will be measured in young children (generally those less than 3 years of age) 
using a firm box with an inflexible board that accommodates the head on one side and has a 
movable slab on the other side that  can be pressed against the soles of the feet with the legs fully 
extended.  Standing height will be measured in older children using a stadiometer that has been 
calibrated immediately prior to measurement of height if it has not been calibrated in the 
previous 4 hours.  Weight will be measured with  the patient unclothed.  Head circumference will 
be measured using a measuring tape that is placed over the mid forehead and that is extended 
circumferentially to include the most prominent por tion of the occiput so that the greatest volume 
of the cranium is measured.  Head circumference will be measured beyond 2 years of age to rule out the potential concern of glycogen deposition in the central nervous system with resultant macroencephaly. 
Length/height, weight, and head circumference will each be performed 3 times in a row and the 
average of these 3 measurements (refer to the SM for additional instructions) will be entered in the CRF for the appropriate measurement.  All measurements should be recorded to the nearest 
tenth of a centimeter.  To the extent possible, the individual performing the measurements of 
recumbent length, height, weight and head circ umference should not have access to records of 
the patient’s earlier measurements.  As far as possible, these measurements will be performed by 
the same individual at each patient visit. 
9.2.2 Cognitive Function and Motor Development Assessments 
9.2.2.1 Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) 
The Bayley-III ( Bayley, 2005, Bayley Scales of Infant and T oddler Development, Third Edition ) 
will be administered by a trained clinician to assess cognitive language and motor development.  
The Bayley-III consists of three administered scales (cognitive, language and motor) with 5 
subtests (cognitive, receptive language, expressive language, fine motor and gross motor).  The Cognitive Scale assesses how a child thinks, respo nds and learns about the world.  The Language 
Scale assesses how well a child can communicat e using gestures, sounds and words in the 
Expressive Communication subscale, and how well a child recognizes sounds and understands instructions and spoken language in the Recep tive Communication subscal e.  The Motor Scale 
assesses how well a child can use his or her hands and fingers to perform activities in the Fine Motor subscale, and how well a child can move his or her body in the Gross Motor subscale.  Normative data is available for the Bayley-III from 1 month to 42 months of age and was derived 
from a sample of US infants and children in 2004.  Data was also collected from 668 children 
with specific clinical diagnoses, including Do wn syndrome, prematurity, cerebral palsy, 
language impairment, pervasive developmental diso rder and fetal alcohol exposure.  Raw scores, 
scaled scores, and composite scores with percentile rank and confidence intervals will be reported for each of the three administered scales  for patients from 1 month to 42 months of age.

manual.  The Bayley-III will be administered to patients from 1 month of age up to 42 months of 
age or until the maximum score on each of the 3 administered scales has been obtained according 
to the times specified in Table 9-1 .  Once the maximum score for a scale has been achieved, only 
the remaining scales will be administered.  Test administration takes approximately 90 minutes. Test results will be centrally scored by a trained clinician. 
9.2.2.2 Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R) & Leiter International 
Performance Scale-Updated (Leiter-3) 
The Leiter-R Scale ( Roid, 1997, Leiter International Perf ormance Scale-Revised ) and/or the 
updated Leiter-3 Scale ( Roid, 2013, Leiter International Pe rformance Scale- 3
rd Edition (Leiter 
3)) will be administered by a trained clinician to assess intellectual ability.  The Leiter Scale was 
designed as a nonverbal measure of intellectual function, memory and atte ntion for individuals 
who could not be validly assessed with standard in telligence tests.  Special populations for whom 
the Leiter Scale was intended include those with communication disorders, hearing impairments, 
motor impairments, and certain types of learning disabilities.  
The Leiter-R Scale consists of two groups of subtests, the Visualization and Reasoning Battery 
(VR Battery) and the Attention and Memory Battery (AM Battery).  Four subtests of the VR 
Battery have been assembled into a Brief Scale IQ test for the estimation of intellectual ability.  The subtests in the Leiter-R are Figure Ground, Form Completion, Sequential Order and 
Repeated Patterns. The Brief Scale IQ test will be administered in this study to estimate global 
intellectual ability.  Raw and scaled scores will be reported for each of the administered subtests in addition to the Brief Scale IQ Composite score.   
The Leiter-3, published in 2013, is an updated version of the Leiter-R.  The Leiter-3 consists of 
two groups of subtests, the Cognitive Battery an d the Attention/Memory Battery.  Nonverbal 
Intelligence will be used in this study to estimate global intellectual ability.  The first four 
subtests of the Cognitive Battery are compiled to  assess Nonverbal Intelligence. These subtests 
are: Figure Ground, Form Completion, Sequential Orde r, and Classification-Analogies.  The fifth 
subtest (Visual Patterns) is an optional subtest, which may be administered if one of the four subtests is compromised.  Raw and scaled scores will be reported for each administered subtest 
in addition to the Nonverbal IQ Composite score. 
All clinicians administering the Leiter-R and /or the Leiter-3 will be provided with a training 
video and instruction manual.  The Leiter-R and/or the Leiter-3 will be administered to patients 
starting at the last assessment of the Bayley-III Cognitive and Language Scales prior to the patient reaching 42 months of ag e and annually thereafter until the patient reaches the end of the 
follow up period, as specified in Table 9-1 . If previous assessments have been performed using 
Leiter-R and switch to Leiter-3 Scal e is planned, then both assessmen ts need to be performed at

9.2.2.3 Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) 
The GMFM-88 was designed to measure gross moto r function in children with cerebral palsy.  
The GMFM-88 was developed specifically to detect quantitative changes in gross motor 
function.  There is no age cut-off for the GMFM-88. 
The GMFM-88 consists of 88 items  organized into 5 dimensions: 
o lying and rolling 
o sitting 
o crawling and kneeling 
o standing 
o walking, running and jumping 
Items were selected to represent motor functions  typically performed by children without motor 
impairments by age of 5 years. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (i.e., 0 = cannot do; 1 = initiates [< 10% of the 
task]; 2 = partially completes [10 to < 100 % of the task]; 3 = task completion).  The score for 
each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension.  The total 
score is obtained by adding the percentage scor es for each dimension and dividing the sum by 
the total number of dimensions.  Therefore, each d imension contributes equall y to the total score.  
Test results will be centrally scored by a trained clinician. 
Validity and reliability has been shown in patients with cerebral palsy.  The GMFM-88 was 
validated on 136 children with cerebral palsy, 25 children with acute head injuries and 
34 children without motor delays who ranged in age from 1 month to 4.3 years.  The subjects 
were measured twice over a period of 6 months.  Change scores were correlated with the ratings 
of change by independent physical therapists from videotapes on the initial and 6-month test in random order.  The correlation made between the GMFM-88 change scores and the ratings made from the videotapes was 0.82. 
In addition, the GMFM-88 has been validated in children with Down syndrome.  One hundred 
twenty-three children were assessed twice over  a period of 6 months using the GMFM-88 and 
the Modified Bayley Scales of Infant Development II.  Test-retest and inter-rater variability were 
all > 0.90 ( Russell, 1989, Dev Med Child Neurol ).  While not originally validated for children 
with diagnoses other than cerebral palsy, the GMFM-88 has been used for other children with

9.2.2.4 Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) 
A disease-specific version of the PEDI was developed to assess functional capabilities and 
performance in children with Pompe diseas e from 2 months through adolescence ( Haley, 2005, 
Dev Med Child Neurol ; Haley, 2004, Pediatr Neurol ; Haley, 2003, Pediatr Rehabil;  Haley, 
2003, Dev Med Child Neurol ).  All patients will be administered the Pompe PEDI, regardless of 
age.  The Pompe PEDI includes all items from the original PEDI, as well as additional items in the Functional Skills Mobility and Self-Care domains to reflect clinically relevant functional 
skills for children with Pompe disease.  Norm-based scoring was developed for these new items 
and scoring algorithms for the PEDI have been adjusted to reflect the additional normative data collected for the Pompe PEDI.  A trained clinician will administer the Pompe PEDI with input 
from the patient or patients’ legal guardian.  Test adminis tration requires approximately 
60 minutes.  The Pompe PEDI will be centrally scored.  Results are reported as raw score, 
normative standard score (with standard error) and scaled score (with standard error). 
9.2.3 Urinary Oligosaccharid e (Hex4) Levels 
As an exploratory measure, collection of urine for oligosaccharide levels will be performed at the times specified in Table 9-1 .  A tetraglucose oligomer, Glc α1-6Glcα1-4Glcα1-4Glc, designated 
Glc4 (Hex4), has been shown to be elevated in the urine ( Hallgren, 1974, Eur J Clin Invest ; 
Chester, 1983, Lancet ; Peelen, 1994, Clin Chem ; An, 2000, Anal Biochem ; An, 2005, Mol Genet 
Metab ) in patients with Pompe disease.  Hence determination of Hex4 may be a means by which 
the efficacy of treatments may be monitored.  HPLC-UV ( An, 2000, Anal Biochem ) and stable 
isotope dilution ESI-MS/MS ( Young, 2003, Anal Biochem ) are two different methods available 
for the analysis of Hex4 in bi ological fluids as the butyl-p-a minobenzoate (BAB) derivative.  
Oligosaccharide levels in urine will be measured by a central laboratory, and additional 
information for the collection and handling of these samples can be found in the SM. 
9.2.4 CRIM Status 
The potential effect of CRIM status will be investigated for research purposes only. 
The GAA Western blot will be used to assess CRIM status in baseline skin biopsy samples from 
patients with Pompe disease.  The CRIM Western blot assay was developed to detect the major 
protein forms of GAA known to exist in the cell, including 110, 95, 76, or 70 kDa forms.  A patient is considered CRIM positive if the presence of any bands corresponding to the apparent 
molecular weight of these forms of GAA is detect ed in samples prepared from patient fibroblasts 
in the Western blot assay.

9.2.5 GAA Mutation Analysis 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) will be isolated  from peripheral blood samples obtained from 
enrolled patients using established methods.  DNA sequencin g will be performed on these 
samples to fully characterize both deleterious mutations and background variation within the 
GAA gene.    GAA mutation analysis is to be con ducted only if written results are not available. 
 
9.3 Safety Assessments 
9.3.1 Neuroimaging Assessment 
In previous clinical trials, a small number of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease have 
been found to have a pattern of delayed myelin ation and/or white matte r signal abnormalities in 
the brain, as evaluated by neur oimaging assessments conducted prior to and following the onset 
of treatment with alglucosidase alfa.  Conseque ntly, serial brain MRIs will be conducted at the 
discretion of the Investigator as sedation for th is procedure may be required for young patients 
and may pose an unacceptable risk in patients who have cardiopulmonary involvement.  MRIs 
will be conducted according to standard procedures  (specified in the SM) at the times specified 
in Table 9-1  in order to evaluate possible changes in brain structures over time. 
If clinically significant changes in neuroimaging findings as compared to Baseline results are 
noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE CRF.  Clinical significance is defined 
as any variation in neuroimaging findings that  has medical relevance and may result in an 
alteration in medical care.  The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the 
parameter returns to Baseline or until the Investigator determines that follow-up is no longer 
medically necessary. 
9.3.2 Hearing Testing 
Hearing loss has been reported in patients with glycogen storage disorders ( Galton, 1976, Acta 
Paediatr Scand ; Jurecka, 1985, Arch Dermatol ).  Furthermore, cochlear involvement has been 
demonstrated in a mouse model of Pompe dis ease, and hearing loss found in patients with 
infantile-onset Pompe disease ( Kamphoven, 2004, Neurobiol Dis). 
Hearing will be assessed at the times specified in Table 9-1  using an age-appropriate method of 
hearing assessment, as determined by the Investigator.  Refer to Table 9-2  for a list of commonly 
available hearing tests appropria te for infants and children of various ages.  Abnormal hearing 
tests should be confirmed by more  than 1 method, and should be correlated with the presence or

*BAER should only be performed if the results of other hearing testing are inconclusive as BAER may require 
sedation in young children which could pose unacceptable risks to patients who have significant cardiopulmonary compromise.  BAER should only be performed at the discretion of the investigator. 
If clinically significant changes in hearing as compared to Baseline results are noted, the changes 
will be documented as AEs on the AE CRF.  Clinical significance is defined as any variation in hearing tests that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care.  The 
Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parameter returns to Baseline or until 
the Investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary. 
9.3.3 Visual Screening 
As visual impairment may impact the patient’s ability to perform developmental tests, vision 
testing is being performed in this study to help in the interpretation of developmental testing.  
Ophthalmologic evaluation is to be performed by the Investigator in accordance with the 
guidelines described by the American Association of Pediatrics ( AAP, 1996, Pediatrics ).  The 
type of visual screening will be determined by the patient’s age at the time of the assessment.  All patients will have an exam of the eye, test ocular motility and the red reflex exam.  Patients 3 years of age and over will have the same assessments described previously plus a visual acuity 
test.  Patients 4 years of age and over will have each of the previously described assessments plus 
fundoscopy.  In accordance with AAP guidelines for vision screening, abnormal vision screening 
results should be followed with evaluation by an ophthalmology specialist and follow up should 
include slit lamp examination, if deemed necessary.  Testing will occur at the times specified in 
Table 9-1 .

9.3.4 Electrocardiogram 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be c onducted at the times specified in Table 9-1 .  The following 
will be assessed: heart rate, rhythm, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTc, QRS axis, R voltage V6, S voltage V1, LVH criteria, RVH criteria, and repolarization changes. 
The ECG should be reviewed by a site cardiologist, preferably a pediatric cardiologist, in a 
timely manner for derivation of study data and clinical management of the patient.  Interpretation will include an assessment of heart rate, cardiac rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, and 
overall cardiac impression for each patient.  QTc should be analyzed using both the Fridericia 
and Bazett’s correction formulae in accordance with the FDA’s Guidance for Industry E14 
Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc  Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-
Antiarrhythmic Drugs  and Questions and Answers (R1); references to these documents can be 
found in the SM.   
If clinically significant ECG changes from Baseline are noted, the changes will be documented 
as AEs on the AE CRF.  Clinical significance is defined as any variation in ECG parameters that 
has medical relevance resulting in an alteration in medical care.  The Investigator will continue 
to monitor the patient with additional ECGs until the ECG returns to Baseline or the Investigator 
determines that follow-up is no longer necessary. 
9.3.5 Safety Laboratory Assessments 
Safety laboratory assessments will be performed pre-infusion at the times specified in Table 9-1 .  
The following chemistry and urinalysis variables will be measured: 
• Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucos e, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, 
total protein, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvi c transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, 
total bilirubin, creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase muscle, brain isoform (CK-MB). 
• Complete blood count with differential. 
• Urine appearance, specific gravity, pH, prot ein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, and blood.  
Microscopy will be performed if clinically indicated. 
Analysis of blood and urine samp les will be conducted and reported by each participating site’s 
laboratory.  The Investigator should re view lab reports in a timely manner. 
The Investigator must indicate if out of range laboratory values are either clinically significant 
(CS), or not clinically significant (NCS).  It is  anticipated that some laboratory values may be

Investigators should use their clinical judgment wh en considering clinical significance.  Clinical 
significance is defined as any variation in la boratory parameters, which has medical relevance 
and may result in an alteration in medical care.   If CS laboratory changes from Baseline are 
noted, the changes will be documented on the AE CRF.  The Investigator will also assess the 
relationship of all clinically sign ificant out of range values to alglucosidase alfa as being not 
related, remote/unlikely, possible, probable, or definite.  The Investigator will continue to 
monitor the patient with additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have reached normal 
range and/or Baseline, or, (2) in the judgment of the Investigator, out of range values are not 
related to the administration of alglucosidase alfa or other protocol -specific procedures. 
9.3.6 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate , and temperature) will be recorded at 
baseline, prior to the start of each infusion, at the end of each infusion, and if the patient experiences an IAR, as specified in Table 9-1 .  All IARs should be captured on the SAE/IAR 
page and submitted to Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology per Section 9.5.2 . 
9.3.7 Immunologic Testing 
9.3.7.1 Routine Anti-rhGAA IgG Antibody Testing 
Serum samples for anti-rhGAA IgG antibody testin g will be obtained pre-infusion at the times 
specified in Table 9-1 .  Additional anti-glucosidase IgG antibody testing should be performed 
upon determination of any notable deterioration in a patient’s mo tor function.  Refer to the SM 
for guidelines on the collection and shipment of serum samples. 
9.3.7.2 Inhibitory Antibody Testing 
Inhibitory antibody (activity and uptake) will be assessed when clinically indicated (e.g., plateau 
or decline in response in the presence of adequate  dosing).  Refer to the SM for guidelines on the 
collection and shipment of serum samples. 9.3.7.3 Additional Testing for Moderate or Severe or Recurrent IARs 
In the event that a patient experiences a mode rate, severe, or recurr ent IAR, additional blood 
samples should be collected as described in Sections 9.3.7.3.1  to 9.3.7.3.3.  At the request of 
Genzyme, after consultation with the Investigat or, additional blood sample s may be collected for 
recurrent IARs suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction.  Refer to the SM for guidelines on the 
collection and shipment of samp les.  Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology should be 
apprised of sample shipments.  Testing is conducted for resear ch purposes to gain additional 
information as to individuals’ responses to algl ucosidase alfa, and is not intended as the sole 
means of clinical management of patients.  Skin testing may also be performed, if clinically 
indicated, as described in Section 9.3.7.3.4.  Suggested guidelines for the management of IARs

(e.g., proteinuria), serum samples will be obtained for the evaluation of circulating immune 
complexes.  Immune complex results will be used as a tool to assist in the clinical evaluation of 
the patient and clinical management will not be dependent solely on these results.  The patient will continue to be monitored for immune complex symptomatology, and serum samples will 
continue to be obtained for the evaluation of circulating immune comple xes, as appropriate.  
Consideration for further evaluation of possible immune complex disease (i.e., renal biopsy) will 
be at the discretion of the Investigator.  Refe r to the SM for guidelines on the collection and

9.4 Other Assessments 
9.4.1 Concomitant Medications/Therapies 
From the time of informed consent through stud y completion, all medicati ons and therapies (e.g., 
tube feeds) taken by the patient to treat AEs and any long-term disease management will be 
recorded on the CRFs. 
9.5 Adverse Events 
AEs will be assessed at screening/baseline.  At every infusion visit the patient’s legal guardian(s) 
will be asked “Since your last questioning or visit, has the patient experienced any health 
problems?” 
An AE is defined as any undesirable physical, psychological or behavioral effect experienced by 
a patient or subject during their pa rticipation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the 
use of the drug or biologic, whether or not produc t-related.  This includes any untoward signs or 
symptoms experienced by the patient from the time of signing of the informed consent until completion of the study. 
AEs may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by the patient or subject and/or 
observed by the Investigator or medical staff 
• Findings at physical examinations 
• Laboratory abnormalities of clinical significance 
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnor malities already existing prior to the use of the 
product (i.e., prior to participation in the AGLU03606 study) are not
 considered AEs after 
treatment unless  they recur after the patient has rec overed from the preexisting condition or in 
the opinion of the Investigator they represent a clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or 
frequency.

If clinically significant worsening from Baseline is noted, the changes will be documented as 
AEs on the AE CRF.  Clinical significance is defi ned as any variation in signs, symptoms, or 
testing that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care.  The 
Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parameter returns to Baseline or until 
the Investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary. 
9.5.1 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening experience 
• Required or prolonged in patient hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Congenital anomaly 
• Important medical events that may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Life-threatening experience : Any AE that places the patient, in the view of the reporter, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e., does not include an AE that had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity:  Any AE that resulted in a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to  conduct normal life functions. 
Important medical events  that may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above: AEs that 
may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropr iate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient 
or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the adverse drug/biologic experience 
using the following categories: Mild, Moderate, and Severe.  This assessment is subjective and 
the Investigator should use medical judgment to compare the reported AE to similar type events 
observed in clinical practice.  Below are listed guidelines for severity assessment: 
• Mild: Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the subject/patient or does not make the 
subject/patient uncomfortable.  The AE does not influence performance or functioning.  
Prescription drugs are not ordinarily  needed for relief of symptom(s).

• Severe: Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the subject/patient severe discomfort.  
Severity may cause cessation of treatment with the study drug.  Treatment for symptom(s) 
may be given. 
Severity is not equivalent to seriousness. 
9.5.1.1 Autopsy and Post-Mortem Biopsy 
In the event that a patient dies, permission will be sought (through a separate informed consent 
form) from the patient’s legal guardian(s) for a res earch autopsy or post-mortem research biopsy.  
If consented, samples collected from this procedure will be sent to Genzyme Corporation and 
used for research purposes only; data will not be provided to the Investigator or be included in 
any analyses.  Refer to the SM for research autopsy and post-mortem research biopsy procedural 
guidelines. 
9.5.2 Infusion-Associat ed Reactions 
Infusion-associated reactions are defined as AEs th at occur during the infusion or within up to 24 
hours after the start of infusion a nd are considered as related or possibly related to the ERT by 
the Investigator or the Sponsor. An event occurring ≥ 24 hours after the start of an infusion may 
be judged an IAR if a delayed reaction is consider ed possible by the Investigator or the Sponsor.  
These events should be reported to Global Phar macovigilance and Epidemiology within 24 hours 
of the Investigator’s first knowle dge of the event.  Refer to Section 9.3.7.3 for additional testing 
in the event a patient experiences a moderate, severe, or recurrent IAR.  Suggested guidelines for 
the management of IARs are summarized in the cu rrent version of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
9.5.3 Adverse Experience and Serious Adverse Experience Reporting 
The necessity and time requirements for reporting of AEs to Genzyme or designee and/or 
regulatory agencies are as follows: 
• All SAEs and IARs (non-serious and serious) should be reported within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s first knowledge of the event, ev en if the experience does not appear to be 
related to alglucosidase alfa.  Such co mmunications are to be directed to:

through completion of the final st udy assessments must be reporte d as described and recorded on 
the CRF.   
After completion of the final study assessments, all patients must be followed an additional 30 
days.  At the follow-up assessment, outcome for ongoing AEs and SAEs should be documented 
in the CRF as not yet recovered.  Ongoing SAEs should, however, continue to be followed (and 
information reported to Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemio logy) until resolution, until the 
Investigator deems follow-up is no longer medically necessary or until the patient is lost to 
follow-up.

deviation, minimum and maximu m).  Categorical variable s will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages. Baseline demographic and background variables will be summarized and also presented in 
patient listings.  Efficacy endpoints include physical growth, development, and cognitive 
function. 
Physical growth is assessed by body height/length, weight and head circumference.  Changes 
from baseline to study time points will be summarized descriptively for body height/length, weight and head circumference.  Changes in Z- scores (standardized age and gender adjusted 
values) for height/length, weight and head circumference with reference to Center for Disease Control (CDC) Growth Charts will also be summarized descriptively.   
The Bayley-III consists of 3 administered scales – cognitive, language and motor and will be 
administered to patients from 1 month to 42 months of age.  Changes from baseline to study time 
points in the raw scores, scaled scores and co mposite scores reported for each of the 3 
administered scales will be summarized descriptively. 
Cognitive function is assessed by the Leiter-R and/ or the updated Leiter-3 instrument for patients 
42 months of age and older.  Th e Brief Scale IQ (Leiter-R) and/or Nonverbal IQ Scale (Leiter-3) 
that will be administered each consist of 4 subtests. All data collected will be presented in the 
patient listings.  The changes from baseline to study time points in the raw and scaled scores for 
the 4 subtests may be summarized descriptively. 
The GMFM-88 will be used to measure the change over time in the gross motor abilities of the 
patients.  Change from baseline to study time points in the total score and dimension scores will 
be summarized descriptively. 
The Pompe PEDI was developed to assess functional capabilities and performance in children 
with Pompe disease. Changes from baseline to study time points in the raw scores, normative 
standard scores and scaled scores for the Functional Skills Mobility and Self-Care domains will be summarized descriptively. 
The potential effect of urinary oligosacchar ide levels, CRIM status, and GAA mutation on 
efficacy outcomes may be analyzed. 
Safety assessments include neuroimaging, hearing testing, visual screening, ECG, laboratory 
assessments, immunologic testing.  All data from safety assessments  will be presented in patient

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT  
 
The specific aims of this study are to compare patient experience with and without a 
proparacaine drop after povidone iodine. To ensure the extra drop does not interfere with 
antisepsis, conjunctival cultures will be obtained from patients undergoing intravitreal injection 
before and after the application of the extra eye drop.  
A. Background information: 
1. Intravitreal injections  
Intravitreal injections are used to treat patients with many ocular conditions including: 
exudative age related macular degeneration, endophthalmitis, CMV retinitis, forms of choroidal neovascularization, e.g. diabetic retinopat hy, and macular edema.   
2. A feared complication, endophthalmitis Endophthalmitis is a post -injection complication with great morbidity. A comprehensive 
review published in 2004 outlining the risk of endophthalmitis after intravitreous injection found 
a 0.2% prevalence per injection, which increased to 0.6% prevalence for injection with 
triamcinolone acetonide.  All other injected medications had a risk of 0.1% per injection.[ 1] A 
2011 study published in Retina reported that 1 out of every 4000 to 8000 injections of anti- VEGF 
medications results in endophthalmitis.[ 2] Finally, a study using a Medicare database found that 
of 41,000 injections, the rate of post-injection endophthalmitis was about 0.09% per injection.[ 3] 
The specific bacteria that cause post -injection endophthalmitis have been reported in a 
study by McCannel as most commonly coagulase- negative Staphylococcus  species in 65.4% of 
cases where a bacterium was identified.  Streptococcus  species were identified in 30.8% of 
endophthalmitis cases; most commonly viridans group streptococci (VGS), S. salivarius , and S. 
mitis . [4] 
3. Preventative measures  
To prevent endophthalmitis, sterilization is attempted before injections using 5% 
povidone- iodine (PI), Betadine, which has been demonstrated to be as effective as topical 
antibiotics. [ 5] Povidone iodine’s use prior to IVI is supported by a number of studies.[ 6, 7]  Apt 
et al. demonstrated that one drop of povidone iodine administered preoperatively reduced 
bacterial colonies in conjunctival cultures by 91% versus 33%  for control eyes. [8]  Isenberg 
demonstrated that preoperative administration of povidone iodine was as effective as neomycin, polymyxin B, and gramicidin (Neosporin, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) ophthalmic 
solution given three consecutive days prior to surgery in reducing conjunctival cultures.

STUDY NAME  
  
Neosporin plus povidone iodine was more effective than either alone, leading to a 99.9% 
decreased colony count. [6]  Overall, povidone iodine is nontoxic to the eye in the appropriate 
concentrations, has a broad antimicrobial spectrum (including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses), has a low propensity to select for bacterial resistance, is inexpensive, and is wide ly 
available. [9]   
4. Antimicrobial properties of proparacaine  
The antibacterial properties of proparacaine have been previously reported.  A study on 
the effects of topical anesthetics on bacteria using a disk diffusion technique studied proparacaine 
and 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125% concentrations found that proparacaine inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus  at 1,250 µg/mL, and inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth at 2,500 
µg/mL. [ 10] Proparacaine has also been demonstrated to have antimicrobial properties against 
Staphylococcus epidermidis  and viridans group streptococci (VGS).  It has been shown to reduce 
the number of culture-positive eyes, with 4 of 40 eyes being culture- positive after proparacaine, 
versus 12 of 36 eyes being culture-positive after receiving control solution, containing only 
preservative. [11]  The mechanism by which proparacaine acts as an antimicrobial has been 
studied; it is thought to disrupt bacterial cell membranes causing permeability and lysis. [12, 13 ]  
Finally, benzalkonium chloride, the preservative component of proparacaine , has been 
demonstrated to have antimicrobial effects, with an in vitro study showing that benzalkonium 
chloride inhibits S. aureus growth.[ 14]   
5. Background research (see attachment):  
We have previously conducted a study comparing the minimum inhibitory concentrations 
(MICs) of topical anesthetics utilized prior to intravitreal injection (proparacaine, tetracaine, lidocaine), preservative benzalkonium chloride, and antiseptic povidone iodine for bacteria 
causing endophthalmitis. Lidocaine (8.53x10
-5mol/mL) had MICs of 4.27x10-5-8.53x10-5 mol/mL, 
and tetracaine (1.89x10-5mol/mL) had MICs of 9.45x10-6 mol/mL for all isolates. Proparacaine 
(1.7x10-5 mol/mL) had MICs of 1.32 to 5.3x10-7 mol/mL, 4.25x10-6 mol/mL for S. epidermidis, 
VGS, respectively) .  Benzalkonium chloride (3.52x10-7 mol/mL) had MICs of 1.86x10-9-1.1x10-8 
mol/mL, 4.40x10-8 mol/mL for S. epidermidis,  VGS, respectively.  Povidone iodine (1.37x10-4 
mol/mL) had MICs of 2.14x10-6-4.28x10-6 mol/mL, 8.56x10-6 mol/mL for S. epidermidis,  VGS,  
respectively.   
Proparacaine was the anesthetic with lowest MICs, lower than that of povidone iodine.  
Benzalkonium chloride had a lower MIC than proparacaine. All tested topical anesthetics and

povidone iodine inhibited growth of S. epidermidis  and VGS a t commercially available 
concentrations.   
We also previously studied synergy and antagonism for all isolates using povidone iodine 
at 25% and 50% of its MIC.  Proparacaine with povidone iodine demonstrated synergy against all 
VGS studied and additivity or indifference against all strains of S. epidermidis. Benzalkonium 
chloride with povidone iodine demonstrated synergy against 80% of S. epidermidis isolates 
studied  and addi tivity or indifference against all VGS.    
6. Significance  
Intravitreal injections are one of the most common procedures performed by 
ophthalmologists.  As its indications expand and the population with conditions treated with intravitreal injections grows, it is beneficial to know how to prevent complications such as endophthalmitis.  It is often the case that patients will have a painful injection and refuse 
additional vision -saving treatment.  A study to compare the timing of eye drops could help 
improv e patient experience.   It will also be important to compare conjunctival cultures of patients 
treated with proparacaine alone and with povidone iodine may be informative from an antimicrobial standpoint.   
From the perspective of patient experience, recent  studies have demonstrated great 
patient dissatisfaction with the application of povidone iodine.  In a study by van Asten et al., 
more patients (26%) reported povidone iodine application than intravitreal injection (10%) to be the most bothersome part of the intravitreal injection process. [15] The current expert guidelines 
for IVI stress the importance of 5.0% povidone iodine use.  The guidelines recommend that povidone iodine should be the last agent applied before performing injections, and physicians should be careful as the anesthetic may interfere with the contact of povidone iodine to the 
conjunctival surface.  Therefore, the guidelines recommend applying povidone iodine before and 
after topical anesthetic.  It is possible, though, that the antimicrobial effects of proparacaine allow it to be applied following the povidone iodine in patients who find PI unpleasant.  
It would also be useful to determine the impact of proparacaine and povidone iodine on 
each other.  In our preliminary studies, proparacaine with povidone iodine demonstrated synergy against all VGS studied.  Benzalkonium chloride with povidone iodine demonstrated synergy against 80% of S. epidermidis isolates studied.  These results may influence choice of topical 
anesthetic.

STUDY NAME  
  
Proparacaine 
(http://www.micromedexsolutions.com/ micromedex2/librarian/PFDefaultActionId/eviden
cexpert.DoIntegratedSearch# )  is a topical anesthetic commonly used prior to 
intravitreal injections. This proposal recommends deviating from the usual protocol of one drop of proparacaine prior to povidone iodine to adding an addition drop of proparacaine after the povidone iodine as proparacaine has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial properties and assist with patient comfort.  
 
GENERAL INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
Study rationale - Intravitreal injections are one of the most common procedures performed 
by ophthalmologists. The study endpoints are to improve the patient experience while minimizing 
negative outcomes, one of the most worrisome of these outcomes is endophthalmitis.  The study 
will address first patient experience and ensure that the treatment is not detrimental to antisepsis .  
Indication- To compare the effects of proparacaine before and after povidone iodine 
application on patient experience, and to compare bacterial colonies in  conjunctival cultures 
obtained from patients undergoing intravitreal injection  to ensure adequate antisepsis.  
General approach/Treatment plan  (See figure 1) - The study will take place during 
intravitreal injections.  The anticipated study is as follows: After a procedural time out to 
verify patient, agent, and laterality, proparacaine will be applied to the ocular surface.  A 
conjunctival culture will then be obtained followed by the application of povidone-iodine 
to the eyelashes and eyelid margins.  The eyelids will then be retracted away from the 
intended injection site for the duration of the procedure.  At this point, half of the patients 
will be randomized to receive 5% povidone-iodine drop to the conjunctival surface 
followed by conjunctival culture then re-application of 5% povidone-iodine drop to the 
conjunctival surface. A needle will then be inserted perpendicular to the sclera, 3.5-4.0 
mm posterior to the limbus between the vertical and horizontal rectus muscles.  The other 
half of patients will undergo application of another drop of topical anesthetic followed by 
conjunctival culture.  After the culture, this group of patients will have 5% povidone 
iodine applied to the conjunctival surface. A needle will then be inserted perpendicular to 
the sclera, 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus between the vertical and horizontal rectus 
muscles.

 Human subjects  
Sixty patients (male and female) undergoing intravitreal injection who do not have active eye 
infections will be enrolled after undergoing informed consent.   
Exclusion criteria: 1. Age less than 18. 2. Patients with active eye infections  
The main risk encountered by human subjects would be infection given extra manipulation 
prior to intravitreal injection.  These risks will be minimized by using sterile culture techniques.  All cultures will be followed by application of povidone iodine to comply with current recommendations to sterilize conjunctiva prior to intravitreal injection.  It is also possible that patients will experience increased discomfort due to the conjunctival cultures.  Per the protocol, cultures will follow topical anesthetic application.

 a. Conjunctival cultures  
Bacterial cultures will be performed from conjunctival samples.  Bacterial speciation will be 
performed on any bacteria that grows using the usual procedure to determine the bacterial species collected by the study.    b. Proparacaine Eye drops  
Proparacaine 0.5% with preservative benzalkonium chloride 0.01% (Akorn) will be analyzed for its effect on bacterial growth in vivo  with and  without povidone iodine.  
c. Data analysis and interpretation  
Whether cultures are positive or negative will be compared between groups.  Outcomes will also 
be measured by comparing the semiquantitative number of bacterial cultures (the microbiology 
lab w ill report cultures as 1+ through 4+)  according to the Mayo Clinic Microbiology laboratory 
protocol.  P atients who have positive cultures will have specific bacterial species determined 
which will also be analyzed.

Safety  
The current protocol for intravitreal injections requires that patients be treated with 
povidone iodine immediately prior to intravitreal injection for antisepsis.  The protocol 
for this study will not deviate from the standard protocol in that way.  The safety of the 
study will be monitored by the PI. If more than 4 patients are noted post-procedurally to 
require additional return visits for conjunctival irritation or infection, the study will be 
discontinued.

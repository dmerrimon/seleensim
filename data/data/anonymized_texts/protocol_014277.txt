Clinical Protocol CA204006
BMS -901608 Elotuzumab
Tumor assessments, based on the EBMT criteria, must be conducted every 4 weeks (-1/+3 days) relative to the first 
dose of study medication until disease progression, death or withdrawal of consent. The date of progression, best 
response and date of response used in the effic acy analysis will be based onthe independent review committee 
(IRC). Subjects will be followed at least every 16weeks, or more frequently, after disease progr ession for survival 
and subsequent myeloma therapy. Cross -over between the arms is not permitted.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the safety of the trial on a routine basis. In addition 
there will be an interim analysis for safet y and efficacy once the following two conditions have been met: at least 
338progression events (70%) have been observed and all subjects have been randomized.
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity analysis will be collected in all subjects who received 
elotuzumab.
Study Population :
Subjects who are newly diagnosed w ith symptomatic Multiple Myeloma and who:
have not received any prior systemic anti -myeloma therapy AND
have measurable disease AND
are not candidates for high -dose therapy plus s tem-cell transplantation because of age ( 65 years) or coexisting 
conditions
Study Assessments and Primary Endpoint : 
Tumor response assessment by EBMT criteria w ill be evaluated during the trial for all randomized subjects. An IRC 
(Independent Review Committee) will conduct a blinded, independent review of these tumor assessments. The 
primary endpoint of PFS will be based on the IRC assessment. 
Statistical Methods :
Power
The primary objective in this study is to compare PFS between treatment groups at the two-sided, 5% type I error 
rate. There will be 1 interim analysis of PFS, which will allow  for early stopping for superiority. An O’Brien and
Fleming function will be em ployed to determine the stopping boundaries for superiority. The com parisons of PFS 
will be carried out using log-rank tests stratified by stage of disease (International Staging System 1 -2 versus 3), 
ECOG performance status (0 versu s 1 -2), and age (< 75 years old versus 75years old).
Approximately 750 subjects will be randomized to the 2 treatment groups in a one-to-one ratio to obtain at least 
482progression events (as per IRC) , ie, documented progressions or deaths. Four hundred eighty two (482) events 
ensure that a two-sided test procedure with a family -wise type I error rate of 5% and 1 interim  analysis after 70% of 
the total events (338) will have 90.5% power if the median PFS times in the control and experimental arms are
25and 33.75 months, respectively, ie, if the hazard ratio of the experimental to control arm is 0.74. Assuming an 
accrual rate of 24subjects per month, it will take approximate 60 months to obtain the required number of events, 
31months for accrual and 29 months for PFS follow -up.
Survival, a key secondary endpoint, will be com pared at an interim analysis between the two arms at the time of the 
interim analysis of PFS provided that PFS and ORR analyses are positive . The final survival analysis will take place 
after 354deaths, which is projected to occur 7years (84months) after the initiation of the study. An O’Brien and 
Fleming -spending function will be used to obtain the nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses 
of survival. Three hundred and fifty-four (354) deaths ensure that a two-sided 5% level sequential test procedure 
with one interim analysis will have80% power for a 8.7percentage point improvement in 4-year survival rate from 
59.0% to 67.7%, ie, for a HR = 0.74.
Power calculations were done using East v5.1 software. (See Section 8.1, Sample Size Determination, for more 
detail.)
Endpoint Definition s and Analyses
The primary endpoint in this study is progression -free survival (PFS), which is defined as the time from 
randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by the IRC using EBMT criteria,

or to death. Subjects who neither progress nor die will be censored on the date of their last disease assessment, 
provided death does not occur more than 10 weeks a fter the last tumor assessment.
The follow ing censoring rules will be applied to PFS:
Subjects who receive system ic secondary anti-myeloma therapy prior to documented progression will be 
censored on the date of their last tumor assessment prior to initiation of new therapy
Subjects who have an event > 10 weeks after the last prior tumor assessment will be censored atthe last prior 
assessment
Subjects who do not progress and who do not receive subsequent therapy will be censored at their last tumor 
assessment
See Section 8.3, Endpoint Definitions, for more detail on the definition of PFS.
A stratified log -rank test w ill be used to compare PFS between treatment arms. The factors w ill be the same as those 
used in the randomization. The hazard ratio of the experimental to the control arm and corresponding tw o-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the sole 
covariate. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method w illbe used to display PFS curves and PFS rates at 1 -5 years will 
be obtained from those curves. Each rate will be estimated after all subject s have been follow ed for the appropriate 
time.
The key secondary endpoints are:
Objective response rate
Overall survival
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who have a best overall response 
ofpartial response orbetter . Overall survival is the time from randomization until death. Subjects who do not die 
will be censored at the date of last contact.
A hierarchical procedure will be used to ensure a two sided family -wise type I error rate of 5% for testing the one 
primary and two key secondary endpoints. If there is a statistically significant improvement in PFS, then ORR will 
be com pared betw een arms at the two -sided 5% level. If the comparison of ORR is also statistically significant, then 
survival will be comp ared between arms using a two -sided 5% level sequential test procedure. 
Objective response rate will be compared between randomized arms using a two-sided 5% level Cochran -Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the same factors used in the analysis of PFS. An associated odds ratio and 
95% confidence interval will be calculated. The response rate and its corresponding 95% confidence interval will 
also be calculated for each treatment arm. There w ill be no interim comparison of this endpoint.
Survival willbe compared between treatment arms using two-sided, stratified log-rank tests at the interim and final 
looks. The family -wise type I error rate for the sequential testing procedure will be 5% and the stratification factors 
will be the same as those used for the randomization. The significance level at the interim  and final analyses of 
survival will be determined using an O’Brien and Fleming spending function.
Other Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in mean score of pain severity and mean score of pain 
interference using the BPI -SF. The tw o endpoints will be tested at the 2 -sided 2.5% level each and will not be part of 
the hierarchical testing procedure. For these two endpoints, comparison will be conducted using a longitudinal 
mixed model with treatment arm and time point (categorical) and baseline score as fixed effects and a banded 
covariance matrix (covariances are constant on each diagonal of the matrix).

The study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/I ndependent Ethics 
Committee (I RB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion prior to initiation of the study .
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediate ly. A serious breach is a 
breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study  or the protocol, 
which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safet y or physical or mental integrity  of the 
subjects of the study  or the scient ific value of the study .
Study  personnel involved in conducting this study  will be qualified by education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective task(s).
This study  will not use the services of study  personnel where sanctions have been invoked or 
where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
2.2 Institutional Review  Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study  initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment materials/process 
(eg,advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to subjects. The 
investigator or sponsor should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy  of the I nvestigator Brochure 
or product labeling, information to be provided to subjects and an y updates. 
The investigator or sponsor should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other 
information (eg, expedited safet y reports, amendments and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory  requirements or institution procedures.
2.3 Informed Consent
Investigators must ensure that subjects, or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by 
subjects, their legall y acceptable representatives, are clearly  and f ully informed about the 
purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they 
volunteer to participate. 
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1)Provide a copy  of the consent form and written information about the study  in the language 
in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study  participation. The language 
must be non- technical and easily  underst ood
2) Allow time necessary  for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study
3)Obtain an informed consent signed and personally  dated by the subject or the subject's 
legally  acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion

4)Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent 
form and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the 
study , and after any  revisions ar e completed for new information
5)If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of making and communicating their 
informed consent during the study , then consent must additional ly be obtained from the 
subject
6)Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study . This communication should be 
documented
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have direct 
access to subject records. 
The rights, safet y, and well -being of the study  subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTI GATIONA L PLA N

Tumor assessments, based on the EBMT criteria, will be conducted every  4 weeks (-1/+3 days) 
relative to the first dose of study  medication until disease progression, death or withdrawal of 
consent. The date of progre ssion, best response and date of response used in the primary  efficacy  
analyseswill be based on the independent review committee (IRC) assessments as well as the 
investigators . All subjects must continue to have protocol -specified tumor assessments until 
disease progression (even if the subject is off study  therapy  or has started on a new anti -myeloma 
therap y, as specified in the ITT definition of PFS in Section 8.3.1), death, or withdrawal of 
consent from the study . Once subjects reach disease progression, they shall be followed at least 
every  16weeks after disease progression for overall survival and subsequent myeloma therapy . 
Cross -over between the arms is not permitted.
An independent DMC will conduct regular safet y reviews throughout this trial . In addition, there 
will be a pre-planned interim anal ysis for safety  and PFS once the following two conditions have 
been met: at least 338 (70%) progression events have been observed perIRC and all subjects 
have been randomized. 
Subjects who receive any non-protocol specified systemic anti-myeloma therap y prior to 
documented progression will be discontinued from study  treatment (see Section 3.5). However, 
tumor assessments should continue at 4 week intervals until documented progression to compl y 
with the int ent to treat analy sis (Section 8.3.1).
Subjects will continue to be followed until the last subject has the last follow -up visit which is 
projected to occur approximately  7 years from the first randomized subject.
3.2 Post Study  Access to Therapy
At the conclusion of the study , subjects who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive study drug. Study  drug will be provided via an extension of the study , a 
rollover study  requiring approval by responsible health authorit y and ethics commi ttee or 
through another mechanism at the discretion of the sponsor. The sponsor reserves the right to 
terminate access to study drug if any of the following occur: a) the marketing application is 
rejected by responsible health authority ; b) the study  is terminated due to safet y concerns; 
c)thesubject can obtain medication from a government sponsored or private health program; or 
d) therapeutic alternatives become available in the local market.

3.2.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects should be encouraged to continue participation in the trial until the laboratory  definition 
of disease progression is met (Section 5.4.5.5). Subjects who discontinue study  therap y before 
progression (eg, due to toxicity ) should be encouraged to allow the necessary  laboratory  results 
(eg, M-protein data, radiologic data, calcium results) to be collected until progression criteria are 
fulfilled, even if the subject is on subsequent therap y (as per the PFS ITT definition in 
Section 8.3.1). These data can be obtained by the subject’s local health care provider or the site 
staff and then anal yzed and entered into the CRF/database by  the central or local lab. Withdrawal 
of consent should be minimized because:
1. T he subject in this trial who discontinues study  therap y before progression will most likely  
subsequently  be followed in any case by a healthcare provider locall y or at the site via 
routine standard of care assessments (ie, monthly  M-protein data, calcium, etc) and
2.In most cases, this protocol would not require any additional samples beyond those 
considered standard of care
If there is uncertaint y about the progression criteria, investigators are encouraged to contact the 
BMS medical monitor/study  director prior to:
1.starting a subject on another my eloma regimen or 
2.performing the end of tre atment visit for progression
Subjects who request to discontinue study  drug will remain in the study  and must continue 
protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject specifically 
withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously  authorized by 
subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify  the investigator of the decision to 
withdraw consent from future follow -up in writing , whenever possible. The withdrawal of 
consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by  the investigator (and entered onto 
the appropriate CRF page), as to whether the withdrawal is from further:
1.study  medication but subject is willing to continue to perform visits for PFS follow -up. study  
medicat ion and study  visits for PFS but agrees to provide the results of future myeloma 
assessments from another site/local site
2.study  treatments, results from another site/local sites, but agrees to be contacted for overall 
survival follow-up
In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly 
available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
3.2.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to

follow -up is defined by the inability  to reach the subject after a minimum of three documented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. 
All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death. 
If investigator’s use of third- party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study  
has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor -retained third- party  repres entative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact 
information or other public vital status data necessary  to complete the follow -up portion of the 
study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public
health registries, obituary  listings, and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. 
If after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive date as 
determined by the investigator should be reported and docu mented in the subject’s medical 
records.

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and 
dexamethasone) for an y of the following reasons:
Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any  reason).
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory  abnormality  or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study  is not in the 
best interest of the subject.
Pregnancy  (Subject must discontinue elotuzumab and lenalidomide).
Termination of the stud y byBristol -Myers Squibb (BMS).
Loss of abilit y to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily  incarceration 
for treatment of either a psy chiatric or ph ysical (eg, infectious disease) illness.
Progressive Disease (see Section 5.4.5.5 for defi nition of disease progression).

Subjects who receive any non-protocol specified systemic anti-myeloma therap y prior to 
documented progression will be discontinued from all study  treatment (including 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone), however, tumor assessments must continue at 4 week 
intervals until documented progression.
Subjects experiencing a Grade 4 infusion reaction must discontinue elotuzumab. Subjects 
may continue lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment. Refer to Section 4.3.2.2.
Subjects experiencing angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, 
Stevens -Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrol ysis related to lenalidomide must 
discontinue lenalidomide. Subjects in the elotuzumab arm may continue elotuzumab and 
dexamethasone.
Subjects experienc ing a 28 day delay in all study  drugs lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and 
elotuzumab due to an adverse event(s) related to study  treatment must be discontinued from 
study  drug. Subjects experiencing delay s unrelated to study  therap y, for example due to 
radiat ion therapy  may delay  study treatment up to 42days. Delay s greater than 28 days must 
be discussed with the medical monitor.
All subjects who discontinue should comply  with protocol specified follow -up procedures as 
outlined in Section 5. The only excepti on to this requirement is when a subject withdraws 
consent for all study  procedures or loses the ability  to consent freely (ie,is imprisoned or 
involuntarily  incarcerated for the treatment of either a ps ychiatric or ph ysical illness
).
If a subject was withdrawn before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal must be 
entered on the appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Study  Drug Study  Follow up
PFS and OS are key endpoints of the study . Post treatment study  follow -up is essential to 
preservi ng subject safet y and the integrity  of the study . Subjects who discontinue study  treatment 
prior to progression must continue to be followed for collection of protocol -defined PFS. 
Subjects who discontinue study  therap y must also continue to be followed for overall survival 
data until death or the conclusion of the study .
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all randomized subjects outside of the 
protocol defined window , Table 5.1-3.
At the time of this request, each subject will be contacted to determine their survival status 
unless the subject has withdrawn consent for all contact.

4.1.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as follows:
A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study , including products alread y with a marketing authorization but used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authorized personn el according to local regulations.
In this protocol, investigational product(s) is/are: Elotuzumab powder for solution for infusion, 
lenalidomide (Revlimid) capsules 5mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 25 mg, dexamethasone tablets and 
concentrate for solution for IV infusion.
4.1.2 Noninvestigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be 
considered as noninvestigational products. 
In this protocol, non -investigational product(s) are: diphenhy dramine (or equivalent H1 blocker), 
ranitidine (or equivalent H2 blocker), acetaminophen, warfarin, low-molecular weight heparin 
and aspirin.
4.1.3 Handling and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity ) as determined by the Sponsor. If 
concerns regarding the quality  or appearance of the study  drug arise, do not dispense the study 
drug and contact the Sponsor immediately .
The investigator (or assigned designee, ie, study  pharmacist) will dispense the proper number of 
each strength tablet to the subject to satisfy dosing requirements until the subject’s next visit. The 
subject must be instructed to return all unused study  medications in the provided packaging at 
each subsequent visit.
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of an ticancer drugs should be considered.
4.1.3.1 Elotuzumab
The lyophilized elotuzumab drug product should be stored at 2to 8C. Prior to administration 
the drug product must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, and then further 
diluted in 0.9% so dium chloride normal saline, USP, as per the instructions in Appendix 6. After 
the dose is diluted in normal saline, the elotuzumab infusion must be administered within 8 hours 
if stored at room temperature. If a delay  is anticipated, the prepared dose may be refrigerated at

2to8C for up to 24 hours. If stored under refrigerated conditions, the prepared study  drug 
solution should be equilibrated to room temperature (process takes 2 - 2.5 hours) and the 
container must be gentl y inverted to mix well before administration. Do not use the accelerated 
warming method. If administration is delay ed beyond the specified time, the prepared dose 
solution must be discarded, and the reason documented by the pharmacist in study  drug 
accountability  records. The dose of elotuzumab to be adm inistered to a subject will be calculated 
by multiply ing the subject’s weight (kg) by 10 mg/kg (20 mg/kg for Cycle 19 and beyond). The 
subject’s predose weight on Day  1 of each cy cle will be used to calculate the dose for each cy cle. 
Subjects will receive a dose of elotuzumab IV on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the first 2cycles and 
on Days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles (day 1 only for Cycle 19 and beyond). Each dose should 
be infused as per instructions in Appendix 6.
4.1.3.2 Lenalidomide
Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that 
causes severe life-threatening human birth defects. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy , it 
may cause birth defects or death to an unborn baby . Females should be advised to avoid 
pregnancy  while taking lenalidomide (Revlimid) and for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of 
lenalidomide. Furthermore, subjects taking lenalidomide should refrain from donating blood 
until at least 8 weeks or sperm until at least 90 days after last dose of lenalidomi de.
Because of this potential toxicity  and to avoid fetal exposure to lenalidomide, lenalidomide is 
only available under a special restricted distribution program.42This program is called the 
Revlimid Risk Management Plan. Under this program, only prescribers and pharmacists 
registered with the program can prescribe and dispense the product. In addition, lenalidomide 
must only be dispensed to subjects who are registered and meet all the conditions of the 
Revlimid Risk Management Plan. Subjects who have the potential of pregnancy  in the Revlimid 
Risk Management Plan must be instructed about contraception and undergo the scheduled 
pregnancy  tests. 
Please see the US package insert/SMPC48for additio nal information for prescribing to, female 
subjects and male subjects about this restricted distribution program.
4.2 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
After the subject’s eligibility  is established and informed consent has been obtained, the subject 
must be enrolled into the study  by calling an interactive voice response system (IVRS) to obtain 
the subject number. The following information is required for subject enrollment:
Date of Birth
Site number
Date that informed consent was obtained
Instructions on the use of interactive voice response sy stem will be provided at site initiation.

When it has been determined that a subject is eligible for randomization, a call will be placed to 
IVRS to obtain treatment assignment. Subjects will be randomized to 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone + elotuzumab (Arm A) or lenalidomide/dexamethasone alone 
(Arm B) in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization will be stratified by  the following factors:
Stage of Disease (International Staging S ystem 1 -2 versus 3)
Age (< 75 years old ver sus 75 years old)
ECOG Performance Status (0 versus 1 - 2)
and will be carried out via permuted blocks within each stratum.
4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
4.3.1 Study Drug Administration
Dexamethasone
On weeks without elotuzumab (including the control arm), administer the weekl y dose of 40mg 
dexamethasone on Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 (-1 to +3 days). At the investigator’s discretion, the oral 
dexamethasone may  be given as a split dose over 2 consecutive day s each week.
On weeks of elotuzumab infusion, administer dexamethasone as a split dose of:
28 mg po ( between 3 -24 hours prior to the start of elotuzumab infusion) AND
8 mg IV (on the day  of elotuzumab infusion at least 45 min prior to the start of infusion).
At the discretion of the investigator, the oral dexamethasone component may be given as a 
split dose 12 -24 and 3 hours prior to elotuzumab.
Elotuzumab
Elotuzumab will be administered intravenously  at a dose of 10 mg/kg weekly  (Day s 1, 8, 15, and 
22 of a 4-week cycle) of the first 2 cycles and every  2 w eeks (Day  1 and Day 15) for cycles3 
through 18, then at a dose of 20 mg/kg every  4 weeks Cycle 19 (Day  1) and beyond. A window 
of -1 to + 3 day s is permitted in Cy cles 1 and 2.
In Cycle 1 and 2, an elotuzumab dose that falls outside of the pre-specified window must be 
skipped.
In Cycles 3 and beyond, elotuzumab dosing may be delay ed for up to 1 week as clinically 
indicated. The reason for the delay  must be recorded on the CRF. If unable to administer within 
1 week, then the dose should be skipped and resumption of the elotuzumab continues per the 
protocol defined schedule.
In addition, the following must also be administered 30 - 90 min prior to any elotuzumab:
H1 blocker: diphenh ydramine (25 - 50 mg po or IV) or equivalent;
H2 blocker: ranitidine (50 mg IV) or equivalent
acetaminophen (650 -1000 mg po)

4.3.1.1 Premedication Regimen in Subjects Without a Prior Infusion Reaction 
Consult the Sponsor for further guidance regarding premedication management eg,alternative 
medications for subjects allergic or intolerant to any premedication or to determine if locall y 
used equivalent medications are acceptable.
On weeks of elotuzumab infusion, the weekly dexamethasone will be split into a po and IV 
administration (described in Section 4.3.1) which will also serve as premedication for 
elotuzumab.
Intravenous and po dexamethasone doses are calculated to prevent an imbalance in 
dexamethasone exposure between the control and investigational arms (Refer to Section 
4.3.1.2 for premedication in su bjects with prior infusion reaction).
In addition, the following must also be administered 30 - 90 minutes prior to elotuzumab:
H1 blocker: diphenh ydramine (25 - 50 mg po or IV) or equivalent;
H2 blocker: ranitidine (50 mg IV) or equivalent
acetaminophen ( 650 - 1000 mg po)
4.3.1.2 Premedication Regimen in Subjects With a Prior Infusion Reaction
To be re-treated with elotuzumab, subjects with prior infusion reaction must receive H1, H2 
blockers and acetaminophen at maximum doses specified (ie, 50 mg diphenh ydramine , 
50mgranitidine, and 1000 mg acetaminophen).
To prevent imbalance in dexamethasone exposure between the two arms in the study , doses of 
intravenous dexamethasone above 10 mg require a decrease in the po dexamethasone. 
Recommended dexamethasone dosing issummarized below and in Table 4.3.1.2-1. Decisions to 
use more aggressive premedication schemes in subjects with only  prior Grade 1 or only  one prior 
Grade 2 infusion reaction must be approved b y the Sponsor or designee.
For subjects with prior Grade 1 infusion reaction, the same dexamethasone premedication 
regime as in Section 4.3.1 may be used.
For subjects with prior Grade 2 infusion reaction, administer 10 mg IV dexamethasone 
(instead of 8 mg) as the premedication steroid at least 45 minutes prior to elotuzumab. 
Subjects should still take 28 mg oral dexamethasone either as a single dose or split dose 
(16 mg 12 -24 hours AND 12 mg at least 3 hours prior to elotuzumab).
For subjects with Grade 3 or recurrent Grade 2 elotuzumab infusion reactions, consult ation 
with the Sponsor or designee is recommended. For these subjects, administer 18 mg IV 
dexamethasone as the premedication steroid at least 45 minutes prior to elotuzumab. To 
prevent imbalance in dexamethasone exposure between the two arms in the study , on the 
weeks that subjects receive 18 mg IV dexamethasone, they must only receive a total of 
16mg oral dexamethasone (8 mg 12 - 24 hours AND 8 mg at least 3 hours prior to 
elotuzumab). Eighteen mg of IV dexamethasone has similar exposure to approximately
24mg oral dexamethasone.

aFor prior infusion reactions, use maximum doses H1, H2 blockers and acetaminophen as described in 
Section 4.3.1.2 .
bAt the discretion of the investigator, the oral dexamethasone component may be given as a split dose 12-24 and 
3 hours prior to elot uzumab.
cSubjects with prior Grade 1 infusion reaction may be premedicated as per Grade 2 infusion reactions.
dSubjects with pri or Grade 2 infusion reaction may be premedicated as per Grade 3 infusion reactions.
If a subject with a prior Grade 2 - 3 infusion reaction also requires dose reduction of 
dexamethasone, the weekly  dexamethasone on the days of elotuzumab infusion should be no 
lower than 8 mg IV (on the day  of elotuzumab infusion at least 45 minutes prior to elotuzumab).
The oral portion of dexamethasone may  be split between the day  prior and day  of infusion as this 
may further reduce the incidence of infusion reactions. For example, for subjects with only a 
prior Grade 1infusion reaction, the following split dose may be given: 12 mg dexamethasone po 
(12- 24 hrs prior to elotuzumab) AND 16 mg dexamethasone po (at least 3 hrs prior to 
elotuzumab) AND 8 mg IV dexamethasone a t least 60 minutes prior to elotuzumab.
Subjects with Grade 4 infusion reaction are not eligible to receive additional elotuzumab. These 
subjects should still continue to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
4.3.2 Guidelines for Elotuzumab Infusion in Subject s with Infusion Reactions
4.3.2.1 Grade 1 Infusion Reaction
Grade 1 elotuzumab infusion- related reactions by definition, require,no intervention; however, 
increased monitoring is recommended.
4.3.2.2 Grade 2 Infusion Reaction
Infusion reactions during the elotuzumab infusion : For a Grade 2 elotuzumab 
infusion- related reaction, the infusion must be interrupted. The subject should be treated as 
clinically  indicated with one or more of the following medicat ions or interventions: antiemetics, 
antihistamines, analgesics, corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, oxygen inhalation, 
epinephrine, bronchodilators, or other supportive measures as indicated. Subjects with a Grade 4

BMS -901608 Elotuzumab
elotuzumab infusion reaction must have elotuzumab permanently  discontinued. These subjects 
should continue to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone per protocol.
Once the elotuzumab infusion -related reaction has resolved to Grade 1, the infusion can be 
restarted at 0.5 mL/minute. If symptoms do not recur after 30 minutes, the infusion rate may be 
increased in a stepwise fashion starting at a rate per investigator ’sdiscretion, and increasing 
up to a rate per investigator’s discre tion, up to a maximum of 5 mL/ minute .
Subjects who experience an infusion reaction require vital signs to be monitored every  30 
minutes for 2 hours after the end of the elotuzumab infusion. If the elotuzumab infusion reaction 
recurs, the infusion must be s topped and not restarted on that day . Appropriate therapy  should be 
administered to address the subject’s signs and symptoms. The infusion can be reattempted at the 
next protocol defined infusion time point at the investigator’s discretion with additional 
premedication as described in Table 4.3.1.2 -1
Infusion reactions after the completion of elotuzumab infusion : Should a Grade2infusion 
reaction occur following completion of an elotuzumab infusion, the subject should be treated as 
clinically  indicated with 1 or more of the following medications or interventions: 
diphenhy dramine, acetaminophen, hydrocortisone, H2 inhibitor, leukotriene inhibitor, oxygen 
inhalation, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or other supportive measures as indicated.
Elotuzumab infusio ns on subsequent weeks after a prior Grade 2 infusion reaction : 
Subjects with prior Grade 2 or higher infusion reactions should have the next infusion started at 
0.5 ml/min and then escalated in a stepwise fashion (0.5 mL/minute every  30 minutes to a 
maximum of 2 mL/min). If no Grade 2 infusion reaction occurs, the next infusion may be
increased in a stepwise fashion starting at a rate per investigator ’s discretion, and up to a 
maximum of 5mL/minute .If tolerated, all subsequent infusions may start at a rate per 
investigator’s discretion, up to a maximum rate of 5 ml/minute.
4.3.3 Dose Delay or Interruption
If the dose of one drug in the regimen (ie, lenalidomide, dexamethasone or elotuzumab) is 
delay ed or interrupted, the treatment with the other drugs may continue as scheduled. Subjects 
experiencing a 28 day delay in all study  drugs lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and elotuzumab 
due to an adverse event(s) related to study  treatment must be discontinued from study  drug. 
Subjects experiencing delay s unrelated to study therap y, for example due to radiation therap y 
may delay  study  treatment up to 42 day s. Delay s greater than 28 day s must be discussed with the 
medical monitor.
Each cycle is 28 days. While dose delay s or interruptions are permitted, the start of each cycle 
cannot be delay ed and is fixed relative to Cycle 1 Day 1. Adjustments to the Cycle1Day 1 
anchored schedule should not be performed. Missed doses should be skipped, not delay ed, if not 
given within the allowed window.
Subjects may continue on study  therap y even if components of the study  therap y must be 
discontinued. For example, a subject on lenalidomide and dexamethasone may  continue on study 
therap y even if dexamethasone must be discontinued for an adverse event. Likewise, a subject on

Please consult the BMS medical monitor or any questions regarding dose interruption or study 
therap y discontinuation.
4.3.3.1 Elotuzumab
In Cycle 1 and 2, an elotuzumab dose that falls outside of the pre-specified window 
(-1to+3days) must be skipped.
In Cycles 3 and beyond, elotuzumab dosing may be delay ed for up to 1 week. If unable to 
administer within 1 week, then the dose should be skipped and resumption of the elotuzumab 
continues per the protocol defined schedule.
4.3.3.2 Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone delay  should be performed as clinically  indicated at the discretion of the 
investigator.
For subjects receiving elotuzumab, the weekl y dexamethasone dose that coincides with or is 
temporally  closest to the elotuzumab dosing must be administered as part of the premedication 
for elotuzumab per the guidance in Section 4.3.1.
4.3.3.3 Lenalidomide
Lenalidomide delay  should be performed as clinically  indicated at the discretion of the 
investigator.
Subjects should be instructed that if a dose of lenalidomide has been missed and it has been less 
than 12 hours since the subject’s regular dosing time, to take lenalidomide assoon as the subject 
remembers. If it has been more than 12 hours, the dose must be skipped. Subjects should not take 
2 doses at the same time.
4.3.4 Recommended Dose Reductions
The criteria presented in this section for dose modification are meant as general guidelines, and 
they are based on current US standards of clinical practice. Local standards may differ and may 
be followed. Dose modification may occur in the setting of lower grade toxicity  if the 
investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor/Spon sor, believes that it is in the interest 
of subject safety .
4.3.4.1 Elotuzumab 
No dose reduction is allowed for elotuzumab.
4.3.4.2 Dexamethasone Reductions 
Dexamethasone dose reductions for toxicity  must be performed as clinically  indicated. 
Recommended management is d escribed in Table 4.3.4.2 -1and Table 4.3.4.2 -2. Deviations to the 
recommended dose reductions are allowed based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.

Lenalidomide Dose Adjustments in Subjects with Renal Impairment
Since lenalidomide is primarily  excreted via the kidney , adjustments to the dose of lenalidomide 
are provided based on the lenalidomide country  prescribing information. The regimen of 21day 
dosing every  28 day s remains the same despite the dose reductions described below.

Impairmenta
Creatinine Cleara nce (CRCL): Recommended Course
Moderate renal impairment
(30 CRCL< 60 mL/min)10 mg, every 24 hours
Severe renal impairment (CRCL < 30 mL/min, 
not requiring dialysis)15 mg every 48 hours
End Stage Renal Disease (CRCL < 30 mL/min, 
requiring dialysis)5 mg once daily. On dialysis days, dose should be 
administered following dialysis
aSource: Lenalidomide USPI
Dose Adjustments During Treatment for Other Grade 3 and 4 Toxicities
Angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, Stevens -Johnson syndrome or toxic 
epidermal necrol ysis requires permanent discontinuation of lenalidomide. For Grade 2 - 3 skin 
rash judged to be related to lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered.
Forother Grade 3 and 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide, hold treatment and restart 
lenalidomide at the next lower dose level when toxicity  has resolved to Grade 2.
4.4 Blinding/Unblinding
Not applicable.
4.5 Treatment Compliance
Starting at Cycle 1Day 1, all treated patients will be assessed for drug compliance of all 
treatments administered during the course of the study . Treatment compliance will be monitored 
by drug accountability  and recorded in the subject’s medical record. For those medicatio ns taken 
at home (lenalidomide and dexamethasone), subjects will be provided with a medication diary  in 
which to record study  drug doses and will be instructed to bring this diary  and study  drug 
containers (lenalidomide and oral dexamethasone) to clinic visits.

5.3 Safety  Assessments
Only  data for the procedures and assessments specified in this protocol should be submitted to 
BMS. Additional procedures and assessments may be performed as part of standard of care; 
however, the data for these assessments should remain in the subject’s medical record and should 
not be provided to BMS, unless specificall y requested from the Sponsor. The local safety  labs 
(CBC, electroly tes, coagulation test) may be collected up to 3days prior to the visit. The local 
urine pregnancy  test (collected within 24 hours of dosing) for females of reproductive potential 
must be negative for these subjects to proceed to dosing. The serum 2 microglobulin and 
albumin will be sent to the central lab for anal ysis for ISS stratification.

Vital signs (body temperature, respiratory  rate, seated blood pressure and heart rate) will be 
recorded as outlined in Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2 , and Table 5.1-3. Blood pressure, respiratory 
rate and heart rate should be measured after the subject has been seated quietly  for at least 
5minutes prior to dosing. Subjects in the control arm will have vit al signs measured once at each 
visit. Subjects randomized to the elotuzumab arm will have additional vital signs as follows:
Prior to pre- medication administration
Prior to the start of the elotuzumab infusion
Thirty  minutes after the start of infusion
At the end of the infusion
Thirty  and 120 minutes post completion of the elotuzumab infusion for Cy cle1and 2
Cycle 3 and bey ond post infusion vital signs will be measured at 30 minutes
Subjects who experience a Grade 2 infusion reaction require vital signs to be monitored

5.4 Efficacy  Assessments
Efficacy  endpoints will be based on serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP), 
corrected calcium (serum calcium and serum albumin), and bone marrow assessments at 
predefined intervals as specified in Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2, and Table 5.1-3. Assessments for 
SPEP and UPEP will be based on central lab results, whereas assessments of bone marrow, bone 
lesions , extramedullary plasmacy tomas, and corrected calcium will bebased on local analysis at 
the site. Serum 2 microglobulin will be performed centrally  at screening for stratification. If 
SPEP and UPEP M protein areperformed at a local laboratory , results must be recorded in the 
CRF/eCRF as requested by  Sponsor to properly  assess efficacy  per protocol criteria .
5.4.1 Efficacy Assessment
Response criteria according to Section 5.4.5 will be used for the efficacy  analyses. For the 
purposes of this study , all subjects’ tumor assessments by SPEP M protein and UPEP M protein

quantification, corrected calcium (calcium and albumin), and serum free light chain 
(when indicated for CR assessment), should be re-evaluated per the protocol -stated frequency  
relative to the date of first dose of study  drug until disease progression based on the EBMT 
criteria, irrespective of dose delays or treatment cycle. If subject does not have documented 
EBMT -based disease progression as defined in Section 5.4.5.5 (eg, disease progression was 
determined by sFLC or other non-protocol -defined criteria) at time of study drug 
discontinuation, then tumor assessments must continue to be performed according to the 
same schedule described above until disease progression even if a subsequent anti -myeloma 
treatment is initiated prior to disease progression. Subjects will be followed every  16 weeks 
(or more frequently ) after disease progression for survival, subsequent myeloma therapy , and 
development of second primary  malignancy .
All efficacy  laboratory assessments should be done through the central laboratory , except 
corrected calcium, and bone marrow assessments for plasma cell percentage and light chain 
restriction (clonality  by IHC or flow cytometry ). All bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy 
samples should be assessed locall y. For an y SPEP or UPEP assessment performed locally , in lieu 
of a central lab assessment, (ie, if the subject cannot complete a visit at the study  site), M protein 
absolute quantification (eg,g/dL or g/L for SPEP and mg/24 hrs for UPEP) must be performed.
Any laboratory  samples analyzed locally , including for efficacy , must be entered on the 
appropriate CRF as requested by  Sponsor to properly  assess efficacy  per protocol criteria.
5.4.2 Laboratory Assessments for Myeloma
All serum and urine lab tests must be sent to the central lab, except serum calcium and albumin 
which are performed locally , until disease progression or withdrawal of consent, even if the 
subject is discontinued from study  therap y and has started new m yeloma therap y. 
Subjects without measureable urine M protein (< 200 mg/24 hours )at baseline and at the next 
two consecutive assessments do not have to submit q4 week urine samples with each cycle (but 
must submit q12 week urine samples) until SPEP M protein becomes undetectable. Therefore , at 
the time SPEP becomes undetectable, 24-hr UPEP collection should promptly  resume and 
continue q4 weeks until SPEP becomes detectable.
Assessment of UPEP M protein and urine immunofixation at the time of possible CR/sCR is 
mandatory for all subjects , that is negative urine immunofixation for a minimum of 6 weeks is 
required to fulfill CR/sCR criteria, even in subjects with nonmeasurable values at baseline. Any 
local serum and urine myeloma lab tests that may also have been performed must also be 
reported in the CRF as requested b y Sponsor to properly assess efficacy b y protocol criteria .
1)Serum: serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) for M protein quantification ,total serum 
protein, immunofixation, and quantitative immunoglobulin assay .
a)Immunofixation of serum is required at baseline and to confirm CR regardless of whether 
measurable M -protein was present at baseline .
b)All other serum tests will be followed at each tumor assessment. Confirmation of PR is 
required at least 6 weeks later.

except for those subjects with no measurable M protein in the urine at baseline and at next 
two consecutive assessments.

2) subject is immunofixation negative in serum and urine and flow  cytom etry is not available at the site.
bGenetic assessments ( karyotype and FISH) should be performed by the central laboratory on a fresh bone marrow  
sample. However, if a new bone marrow  sample collection is not feasible and if this assessment was performed 
locally within the 28 days prior to randomization, the loc al results must be entered into the eCRF.
4)Serum free light chain : Serum should be collected at baseline and time of serum and urine 
IFE negativity  for a minimum of 6 weeks to confirm CR and be sent to the central lab for 
serum free light chain analy sis. Two values at least 6 weeks apart should be provided. The
measurement of sFLC is required to document sCR using Section 5.4.5, but is not a criteria 
for determining disease progression (see Sec tions 5.4.1 and5.4.5.5).

5.4.3 Imaging Assessments for Myeloma
5.4.3.1 Skeletal Survey
Skeletal survey , by conventional radiograph y, for metastatic disease will be performed at 
screening (within 28 daysprior of randomization), and on study  if clinicall y indicated 
(development of compression fracture does not exclude response). Use of conventional or low 
dose CT scan (ie, of the spine) or MRI  bone survey  is acceptable. If imaging is performed on 
treatment for assessment of progression, the site must use the same modality  of imaging as used 
in screening. The number and location of skeletal lesions and whether they are lytic should be 
recorded on the eCRF. On treatment survey  should record whether there is an increase in the 
number or size of ly tic lesions.
5.4.3.2 Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma
CT or MRI should be performed in all subjects if clinically  indicated at baseline to assess for the 
presence of extramedullary  plasmacy toma. To minimize unnecessa ry radiation in myeloma 
subjects where progression is primarily  based on serum and urine M-protein, on study  
assessments should only be performed if clinically  indicated (ie, pain, concern for disease 
progression), whether or not present at baseline, and at the time of CR/sCR assessment.
A sum of the products of the longest diameters and longest perpendicular diameter for all 
measurable lesions will be calculated at baseline. This sum will be used as the reference for 
on-study  assessments by  which to charac terize the objective tumor response.
All tumor measurements must be made in millimeters. All documented measurable lesions are to 
be followed throughout the trial. All assessments to be used for tumor response evaluation, 
including the baseline assessment, must be performed using the same method for repeat 
assessment. CT and MRI scanning are the preferable methods of assessment. Conventional CT 
and MRI  should be performed with contiguous cuts of 10mm or less or with cuts of 
5(or10)mm if spiral CT scanni ng is used. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
by clinical examination. Evaluation by  chest x-ray is less preferable than CT or MRI , and should 
only be used for well- defined lesions surrounded by aerated lung. Clinical examination is only 
acceptable when lesions are superficial, such as a skin nodule or palpable lymph node. Skin 
lesions must be documented by a photograph with a ruler. Ultrasound is not acceptable for 
documentation of measurable disease.
Duplicate copies of all imaging studi es used for tumor response evaluation will be made 
available for review b y the Sponsor upon request.
Measurable disease are lesions that can be accuratel y measured in 2 dimensions and both 
diameters must be 20 mm when evaluated by standard CT scanning or10 mm when 
evaluated by spiral CT scanning. The minimum diameter size should be at least twice the slice 
thickness.

small (ie, do not meet above criteria), occur within a previousl y irradiated area (unless they are 
documented as new lesions since the completion of radiation therap y), bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion (exception for effusions 
documented by cytology  as not malignant or present at baseline without progression), 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not pathologically/cytologicall y 
confirmed and followed by  imaging techniques, and cy stic lesions.
5.4.4 Independent Review Committee
The followi ng information will be submitted to an Independent Review Committee (IRC) for 
final assessment of objective response based on:
1.The subject’s laboratory  results (electronicall y and via CRF)
2.All imaging results via CRF
3.Local pathology  results via CRF
4.Local pathology  results of bone marrow samples for confirmation of stringent CR.
The criteria for IRC review are defined in a separate I RC charter.
5.4.5 Definitions of Response
5.4.5.1 Complete Response (CR)/stringent CR (sCR)
A CR requires that all of the following criteria be achieved:
1.Negative immunofixation (“IF”) on both serum and urine, maintained for a minimum of 
6weeks and
2.A bone marrow aspirate or biopsy  containing < 5% plasma cells. I t is not essential to perform 
a trephine biopsy , but if a biopsy  is performed thismust also contain < 5% plasma cells 
(although not required for documentation of CR using the EBMT criteria, light chain 
restriction (flow or IHC for kappa and lambda light chain in the bone marrow should also be 
assessed to assist in classification of stringent CR using the IMWG criteria)17and
3.If skeletal survey  showed osteoly tic bone lesions, there should be no increase in the size or 
number (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response) and
4.If screening scans showed extramedullary  plasmacy tomas, complete disappearance of any 
must be noted.
5.For assessment of stringent CR, per IMWG criteria, all criteria for CR must be upheld. In 
addition, bone marrow sample must be assessed for light chain restriction (as mentioned in 
bullet 2 above) and serum free light chains must be normalized at two time points at least 
6 weeks apart, at the time of CR assessment.

5.4.5.2 Partial Response (PR)
Subjects in whom some, but not all, the criteria forCR are fulfilled are classified as PR, 
providing the remaining criteria satisfy  the requirements for PR. This includes subjects in whom 
routine electrophoresis is negative but in whom IF has not been performed.
1.Greater than or equal to 50% reduction in serum M-protein, maintained for a minimum of 
6weeks.
2. Reduction of 90% in urinary  light chain excretion or a decrease to < 200 mg/ 24hours, 
maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
3.Greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the size of extramedullary  plasmacy tomas present 
at baseline (b y radiography or clinical examination using bidimensional measurements).
4.If a skeletal survey  is performed, no increase in the size or number of lytic lesions 
(development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).
5.4.5.3 Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)
VGPR, a subset of PR, is not formally  included in the EBMT criteria but is derived from the 
IMWG criteria.17Because VGPR is commonl y used to measure depth of response in MM, this 
response must be reported by  investigator and IRC and is defined by :
1.Serum and Urine M -protein detectable by  immunofixation but not on electrophoresis and that 
is confirmed in a subsequent assessment OR
2.90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level < 100 mg per 24h 
and that is confirmed in a subsequent assessment.
5.4.5.4 Minor (Minimal) Response (MR)
Subjects who have reduction in M-protein or plasmacy toma but do not meet the criteria for PR 
are classified as MR if they meet all the following definition:
1.Between 25 - 49% reduction in serum M -protein, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
2.Between 50 -89% reduction in urinary  light chain excretion which still exceeds 
200mg/24 hours, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
3.Between 25 - 49% reduction in the size of extramedullary  plasmacy tomas.
4.If a skeletal survey  is performed, no increase in the size or number of lytic lesions 
(development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).

5.4.5.5 Progression of Disease (PD)
Prog ression
Progression describes a definite increase in disease activit y relative to the nadir in 2 consecutive 
assessments in subjects not in CR, whereas the term “relapse from CR” applies to a recurrence of 
evident disease in subjects previously  in CR. The date of EBMT based disease progression is the 
first date of two consecutive values fulfilling the criteria for disease progression. 
Any of the following list is sufficient for PD:
1.Increase of > 25% in serum M-protein (also an absolute increase of at least 5 g/L) and 
confirmed b y at least 1 investigation.
2.Increase of > 25% urinary  light chain excretion (which must also be an absolute increase of 
at least 200 mg/24- hours and confirmed by  at least 1 investigation.
3.Increase of > 25% plasma cell percentage in the marrow (which must also be an absolute 
increase of at least 10%).
4.Definite increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions or extramedullary 
plasmacy tomas (development of a compression fracture does not exclude continued response 
and may  not indica te progression).
5.Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium greater than 11.5 mg/dL; 
2.8mmol/L) not attributable to any other cause.
Relapse from CR (for subjects in CR)
Subjects who have documented CR and then achieve at least one of the following criteria are 
classified as relapse from CR. According to the EBMT criteria, relapse from CR is considered to 
be progression of disease. The date of EBMT based relapse from CR is the first date of two 
consecutive values fulfilling the criteria for rel apse. 
1.Reappearance of serum or urinary  M-protein onimmunofixation or routine electrophoresis, 
confirmed b y at least one further investigation and excluding oligoclonal reconstitution.
2.Greater than or equal to 5% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or on trephine bone 
biopsy .
3.Any of the definitions met for Progression.

All three questionnaires will be administered per the schedule in Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2, and 
Table 5.1-3. Subjects should fill out the questionnaire prior to any study -related procedures, 
treatment or clinician assessment in order to prevent these variables from influencing QoL

transitions developed and recommended for each instrument.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The BPI-SF is a 15 -item (Appendix 5) instrument designed to assess pain in patients with cancer 
and other diseases.50,51It measures the pain intensity  (5-item sensory  dimension), and it also 
includes questions to measure the interference of pain in the patient’s daily  life, including 
general activity , mood, ability  to walk, normal work both outside the home and housework, 
relations to other people, sleep, as well as enjoyment of life (7-item reactive dimension).52In 
multiple myeloma patients, significant associations were found between pain intensity  measured 
by the BPI-SF and mood disturbance scores. As pain interference increased, so did levels of 
mood disturbance. A joint predictive model explained 74.6% of the variability  in total QOL 
scores.53The BPI-SF has demonstrated both reliability  and validity  across cultures and 
languages, and has been used to study  the effectiveness of pain treatment.50A score of 6 on a 
scale of 0 to 10 on an y single item is generally considered to be clinically significant.54
Pre-testing was carried out in the UK, Norway , Sweden, Denmark, and Germany . Field testing of 
the module has been conducted in a range of Phase 3 trials.55The module has been validated in a 
large number of languages (see www.eortc.be/home/qol).

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persist ent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medic al and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event (See Section 6.6for the defin ition of potential DILI).
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, any organism, virus or infectious particle, 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic) via the study  drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potential DILI are not always serious by regulatory 
definition, these events must be handled as SAEs for data transmission purposes 
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emerge ncy room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or event life 
threatening)

medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remed ying ill health state and was 
planned prior to entry  into the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , care -giver respite, fam ily circumstances, administrative).
Admission for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any  other SAEs
(applies to oncology  protocols).
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 60 days of discontinuation of dosing or within 30 days of the last visit for screen 
failures .
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report must be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study  
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narra tive section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnan cy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy  
surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not 
functioning. In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile 
(fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number:  Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electron ic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission,

paper forms must be used and submitted immediately . When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms a re to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if new information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Thecollection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the s ubjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug, or those that are present at the end of study  
treatment as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the 
nonserious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory  Test Abnormalities
The following laboratory  abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF page or 
SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug discontinued or 
interrupted
Any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject to receive speci fic corrective therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term would be used 
by the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently  discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure,

including during at least time to washout (90 days) plus one ovulatory  cycle(30 days) for a total 
of 120 days,or plus one spermatogenesis cycle (90 days) for a total of 180 daysafter product 
administration, the investigational product will be permanently  discontinued in an appropriate 
manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y). Protocol -required procedures for study 
discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by 
pregnancy  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be 
considered if indicated.
The investigator must immediate ly notify  the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee)of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours 
and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section 6.1.1 . 
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form. 
Any pregnancy  that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
the sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically  important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (See Section 6.1.1. for reporting details).
Potential DILI is defined as:
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times uppe r limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2.Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3.No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited t o, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations

as appropriate, and reported accordingly .
Second primary  malignancies (SPMs) will be collected throughout the study  which includes 
assessments during survival follow -up. All SPMs that occur during the screening period and 
within 60 day s of discontinuation of dosing will be reported as an SAE regardless of relationship 
to study  drug. Additio nally , any SPM that occurs after this timeframe and considered related to 
study  drug will be reported as an SAE. All other SPMs will be collected and reported as adverse 
events.
7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE A ND OTHER EXTE RNA L 
COMMITTEES
A data monitoring comm ittee (DMC) will be established before the first subject is treated and 
will monitor safet y throughout the study . (The DMC will receive SAE tables every  4months and 
more comprehensive safety  data every  8 m onths.) In addition, the DMC will review safety  and 
efficacy  data, including a formal comparison of PFS for early stopping, once the following two 
conditions have been met: at least 338 progression events have been observed and all subjects 
have been randomized . A separate charter will describe the activities of this committee. (Also see 
Section 8.5, I nterim Analy ses, for details on the interim anal yses of safet y and efficacy).
8 STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The number of events and power for PFS were calculated assuming an exponentia l distribution 
in each arm. One interim analy sis of PFS is planned. The comparisons of PFS will be carried out 
using log-rank tests stratified by stage of disease (International Staging System 1 - 2 versus 3), 
ECOG performance status (0 versus 1 -2), and age (<75years old versus 75 years old). The 
interim analy sis will allow for early stopping for superiorit y. An O’Brien and Fleming 
spending function will be employ ed to determine the stopping boundaries. 
Approximately  750 subjects will be randomized to the 2 treatment groups in a 1 to 1ratio in 
order to obtain at least 482 progression events, ie, documented progressions or deaths as 
determined by the IRC. Four hundred and eight y-two (482) events ensure that a two-sided, 5% 
level, sequential test procedure with 1 interim analy sis after 70% of the total events (338) will 
have 90.5% power if the median PFS times in the control and experimental arms are 25 and 
33.75 months, respectively, ie, if the hazard ratio of the experimental to control arm is 0.74.
Assuming an accrual rate of 24subjects per month, it will take approximately  60months to 
obtain the required number of events, 31 months for accrual and 29 months for PFS follow -up. It 
is projected that at the time of final PFS analysis (at least 482 events), an observed hazard ratio 
of 0.84 or less, which corresponds to a 4.8 month or greater improvement in median PFS (25 vs 
29.8 months), would result in a statistically significant improvement in PFS for the 
elotuzumab -containing arm. In view of evolving results with frontline lenalidomide therap y, a 
reassessment of the sample size could be made. The decision to reevaluate sample size would be 
based on external data only and would not involve a change in the required number of PFS 
events.

Survival, a keysecondary  endpoint, will be compared between the two arms at the time of the 
interim analy sis of PFS (if and only if both PFS and ORR are positive), and again after 354
deaths, which is projected to occur 7years (84months) after the initiation of the study. An 
O’Brien and Fleming -spending function will be used to obtain the nominal significance levels 
for the interim and final analyses of survival. Three hundred and fifty-four (354) deaths ensure 
that a two-sided 5% level sequential test procedure with one interim analy sis will have 80% 
power for a 8.7 percentage point improvement in 4-year survival rate from 59.0%36to 67.7%, 
ie,for a HR = 0.74.
Power calculat ions were done using East v5.1.
8.2 Populations for A nalyses
The following subject populations will be used in this study :
Randomized subjects: all subjects who were randomized to either treatment group
Treated subjects: all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study  treatm ent
Analy ses of baseline characteristics, including demograph y, patient -reported outcomes, and 
efficacy  will be carried out on all randomized subjects. Analy ses of safety  will be based on all 
treated subjects.
8.3 Endpoint Definitions
8.3.1 Progression -Free Surviva l
The primary  definition of progression-f ree survival (PFS) isthe time from randomization to the 
date of the first documented tumor progression, using the criteria in Section5.4.5.5, or to death 
due to any cause, provided death does not occur more than 10 weeks (2 or more assessment 
visits) after the last tumor assessment. Clinical deterioration will not be considered progression. 
The following censoring rules will be applied for PFS:
Subjects who receive systemic secondary  anti-myeloma therap y prior to documented 
progression will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the initiation of 
the new therap y.
Subjects who have an event (documented progression or death) > 10 weeks (2assessment 
visits) after the last prior tumor assessment will be censored at the last prior assessment.
Subjects who do not progress and who do not receive subsequent therapy  will be censored at 
their last tumor assessment.
The main analysis of PFS will be by  IRC assessments.
IRC PFS also will be analy zed appl ying an intent- to-treat (ITT) definition that utilizes all data on 
each randoml y assigned subject until either a progression event or the end of the study . PFS 
under the ITT definition will be defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first
documented tumor progression or to death due to any cause. Clinical deterioration will not be 
considered progression. Subjects who neither progress nor die will be censored on the date of

their last tumor assessment. There will be no censoring for subsequ ent therap y prior to 
progression or for progression events following missing assessments. 
Finally , PFS based on investigator assessments will also be analyzed apply ing both the primary  
and the ITT definitions.
8.3.2 Objective Response Rate
Best overall response is determined as the best assessment based on all study efficacy  data for 
the subject. Subjects with objective response are subjects with a best overall response on study  of 
partial response (PR) or better based on criteria in Sec tion5.4.5.
Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with objective response 
among all randomized subjects. The main ORR analy sis will be based on IRC assessments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.3.6 Survival
Survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. A subject who has not 
died will have his or her survival duration censored at the date of last contact (‘last known date 
alive”).

8.4 Analyses
8.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Subject characteristics including demographics, baseline performance status, disease 
characteristics, and baseline laboratory  parameters will be summarized by randomiz ed treatment 
arm as well as pooled across randomized arms using descriptive statistics.
8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
8.4.2.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  endpoint for the study  is progression -free survival based on IRC assessment . The 
primary  analysis of PFS will beto compare the 2 randomized arms at the interim and final looks 
via two-sided, log-rank tests stratified by stage of disease (International Staging System 1 -2 
versus 3), ECOG performance status (0 versus 1 -2), and age (<75 years old versus 75 years 
old). An O’Brien -Fleming spending function will be employ ed to determine the significance 
levels and stopping boundaries at the interim and final looks. (See Section 8.5, Interim Anal ysis, 
for more detail). 
Further analysis of PFS will includ e the computation of hazard ratios and estimation of PFS 
functions. The PFS hazard ratio of lenalidomide/dexamethasone + elotuzumab to 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone alone and an associated two- sided confidence interval will be 
computed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment arm as the sole 
covariate. The alpha level () for the confidence interval will be the same as the nominal 
significance level for the hypothesis testing. The stratification factors will be the same as those 
used in the randomization. The PFS functions for each randomized arm will be estimated using  
the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method. Two-sided, 95% confidence intervals for median PFS 
and the first and third quartiles will be computed by randomized arm.

8.4.2.3 Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The key  secondary  endpoints are:
Objective response rate (ORR)
Overall survival
A hierarchical procedure will be used to ensure a two-sided, family -wise type I error rate of 5% 
for testing the one primary  and two key secondary  endpoints. If there is a statistically  significant 
improvement in PFS, ORR will be compared between a rms at the 5% level. If the comparison of 
ORR is also statistically  significant at the 5% level, then survival will be compared between arms 
using a 5% level sequential test procedure.
Objective response will be compared between randomized arms using a two-sided 5% level 
Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the same factors used in the analysis of PFS. 
An associated odds ratio and 95% confidence interval will be calculated. The response rate and 
its corresponding 95% confidence interval will also be calculated for each treatment arm. There 
will be no interim comparison of this endpoint.
Survival will be compared between treatment arms using two-sided, stratified log-rank tests at 
the interim and final looks. The family -wise type I error rate for the sequential testing procedure 
will be 5% and the stratification factors will be the same as those used for the randomization. 
The significance level at the interim and final analy ses of survival will be determined using an 
O’Brien and Fleming α spending function.
Other Secondary  objectives are:
Change from baseline of mean score of pain severity  and change from baseline of mean score 
of pain interference (BPI -SF)
Each of the two comparisons will be made at the two-sided type I error of 2.5% and will be 
tested independent of the significance of the comparison of the progression -free survival, 
objective response rate and overall survival. See Section 8.4.7.1 for details about anal yses.   
8.4.3 Safety Analyses
Summary  tables will be presented on safet y parameter s for each treatment arm. Toxicity  rates 
(worst CTC grade per subject) of adverse events and laboratory  tests, both of any  occurrence and 
severe (Grade 3) will be tabulated. Shift tables for selected laboratory  parameters will be 
produced.

8.4.7 Outcomes Research Analyses
8.4.7.1 Analysis of HRQoL Data
All analyses will be conducted on randomized subjects. Questionnaire completion rate, defined 
as the proportion of questionnaires actuall y received out of the expected number (ie, the number 
of subjects still on treatment), will be calculated and summarized at each assessment point. 
Subjects without any  post- baseline assessment will be excluded from the analy sis.
The comparison between the 2 treatment arms of the change from baseline in the mean score of 
pain severity  will be conducted using a longitudinal mixed model with treatment arm, time point 
(categorical), and baseline score as fixed effects and a banded covariance matrix (constant 
covariances on each diagonal of the matrix). Similar model will be used to analyze change from 
baseline in mean sco re of pain interference.
Adjusted mean change from baseline at each assessment point will be graphicall y presented by 
randomized arm for the three questionnaires  and BPI -SF).
 
 
 
8.4.8 Other Analyses
 
 
PFS rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5years will be estimated from the KM curve. Each analysis will be

8.5 Interim A nalyses
A data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established before the first subject is treated and 
will monitor safet y throughout the study . (The DMC will receive SAE tables every  4months and 
more comprehensive safety  data every  8 m onths.) In addition, the DMC will review safety  and 
efficacy  data once the following two conditions have been met: at least 338 progression events 
have been observed and all subjects have been randomized.
A key feature of the interim analy sis after at least 338 (70%) progression events will be a formal 
comparison of PFS between treatment arms. This formal comparison of PFS will allow for early 
stopping for superiority . The stopping boundaries will be derived based on the O’Brien and 
Fleming spending function in East v5.1. (Under current accrual assumptions, the 
338progression event milestone will occur approximately  41 months after study  start.)
The stopping boundaries for superiority  will depend on the actual number of events observed at 
the time of the interim analy sis, and will be determined using the interim monitoring tool in East 
v5.1. However, if there were exactly  338 events the DMC could stop the study  for superiority if 
the p -value were 0.0148. (It should be noted that survival follow -up would continue even if the 
study  were stopped at the interim analy sis of PFS for superiorit y.)
A formal interim analy sis of OS will be conducted provided that both the analyses of PFS and 
ORR are positive (refer to Section 8.4.2.3 for further detail). The final analysis of survival, 
provided that the survival portion of the study  is not stopped early , will take place after at least 
354 deaths have been observed, which is projected to occur approximately  7years after the first 
subject is randomize d. The nominal significance levels for the interim and final survival 
comparisons will be determined by  an O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending function.

APPENDIX 6 PREPA RATION AND ADMINISTRA TION OF ELOTUZ UMA B
Note: Subjects must be premedicated as described in Section 4.3.1 prior to elotuzumab infusion.
Dose Preparation Instructions
After dilution in normal saline, elotuzumab infusion must be completed within 8 hours if kept at 
room temperature (25C). In the United States and Puerto Rico, where a shortage of normal 
saline has been reported, dextrose 5% water (D5W) may be used. Normal saline is the preferred 
diluent and D5W should only be used if normal saline is not available. If a delay  is anticip ated 
after the dose has been diluted in normal saline, the prepared dose (properly  identified) may be 
refrigerated at 2C to 8C for up to 24hours. If stored under refrigerated conditions, the study 
drug solution should be equilibrated to room temperatu re (takes about 2 to 2.5 hours), and the 
container must be gently inverted to thoroughl y mix the contents before administration. If the 
storage time limit is exceeded, the prepared dose solution must be discarded and the reason 
documented b y the pharmacist in the study  drug accountability  records.
Elotuzumab will be administered to each subject as an IV infusion, using an automated infusion 
pump set at the appropriate rate according to the dose administration section (seeAdministration 
Instruction section below). The dose of elotuzumab will be calculated using the subject’s predose 
weight on Day  1 of each cy cle, and then added to 0.9% saline for infusion.
Reconstitute elotuzumab lyophilized study drug, as described in steps 1 to 5 .
Step 1:  For a 440 mg vial of lyophilized elotuzumab, draw 17 mL of Sterile Water for Injection 
(SWFI), USP into a sy ringe equipped with an 18 -gauge or smaller needle.
Step 2:  Remove the flip-top from the elotuzumab vial.
Step 3:  Place the vial upright on a flat surface and, using standard aseptic techniques, insert the 
syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber stopper and deliver 17mL (into the 
20-mL vial containing 440 mg elotuzumab) SWFI , USP, into the vial. Slowly  remove the sy ringe 
needle out of the vial. The final volume of the reconstituted solution is approximately  17.6mL, 
which includes the volume displaced by the solid cake. The concentration of elotuzumab in the 
reconstituted solution is approximately  25mg/mL.
Step 4:  DO NOT SHAKE. Hold the vial upright and gently  swirl the solution by  rotating the vial 
to dissolve the lyophilized cake. Then gentl y invert the vial a few times in order to dissolve any 
powder that may be present on top of the vial or the stopper. Finally , hold the vial upright again
and gentl y swirl the solution a few more times to dissolve any remaining particles. Avoid 
prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE.  
Step 5:  After the remaining solids are completely dissolved, allow the reconstituted solution to 
stand for 5 to 10 minutes.
It is acceptable to have small bubbles and/or foam around the edge of the vial. The reconstituted 
preparation results in a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution 
containing approximately  25mg/mL of elotuzumab.

Step 6:  Once the reconstitution is completed, withdraw the calculated drug volume and further 
dilute with 100-500 ml of normal saline into an infusion bag (see Pharmacy  Manual for details). 
The volume of saline or D5W can be adjus ted so as not to exceed 5 ml/kg of patient weight at 
any given dose of elotuzumab. The resulting elotuzum ab concentration must be from 1.0 mg/ml 
to6.0 mg/ml. Elotuzumab solutions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride and polyolefin bags. 
Examples of such bags include Viaflo, MacoPharma Easyflex N, Macoflex N, B Braun Excel, 
and Braun Ecobag.
Drug volume will be calculated based on subject weight: For example, a subject receiving 
10mg/kg elotuzumab who weighs 80 kg on Day 1 [predose] will require 800mg of study  drug 
for infusion. Withd raw 32 mL of elotuzumab (25mg/mL) from 2 vials and add to an infusion 
bag alread y containing 230 mL  saline, for a total of 262 mL  to be infused. 
Similarly , an 80 kg subject receiving 20mg/kg elotuzumab [predose] will require 1600 mgof 
study  drug for infusion. Withdraw 64 mL of elotuzumab (25 mg/mL ) from 4 vials and add to an 
infusion bag alread y containing 340 mL saline, for a total of 404 mL to be infused.  
Use a new sterile needle for withdrawing solution from each vial.
The same vial must not be used to prepare elotuzumab for more than one subject. Used 
elotuzumab vials will be stored until study  drug accountability  has been completed by the BMS 
designee, and destruction or return is authorized. Used vials do not need to be refrigerated.
Note: Subjec ts must be premedicated as described in Section 4.3.1 prior to elotuzumab infusion.
Administration Instructions
1. Administer through a low-protein- binding 0.22 - micrometer or smaller in-line filter (placed 
as proximal to the subject as is practical). Prime the infusion line with study  drug before 
starting the infusion.
2.Set the IV pump to deliver the infusion at the rate of 0.5 mL per minute (including the drug 
in the line). The total time of infusion will vary depending upon the maximum tolerated 
mL/min infu sion rate as discussed above.
3.Record every  time the infusion is started and stopped and the reason why the start and stop 
occurred.
4.Monitor the IV setup and the subject’s IV site frequently  during infusion, checking for the 
correct infusion rate and IV site infiltration.
5.Ensure that the full volume of elotuzumab is infused.
6.After elotuzumab has been infused from the line, discontinue the infusion, disconnect the 
IVtubing, and dispose of materials appropriately  according to the facility ’s standard 
procedure .
The first dose of elotuzumab will be administered following premedications (described in 
Section 4.3.1) to each subject as an IV infusion, using an automated infusion pump set at an

initial rate of 0.5 mL per minute (30 mL/hour). Please refer to Section 4.3.2 for detailed 
information on the management of infusion reaction and re- initiation of infusion.
If a patient is in cy cle 1, infusion rate escalation may  begin at the second infusion of elotuzumab, 
if no infusion reaction was noted with the first IV administration. If subjects are beyond cycle1, 
subjects may begin infusion rate escalation at any subsequent cycle, as long as no infusion 
reaction was noted for greater than 4 doses.  
For those in cy cle 1 : 
The second dose of elotuzumab must be initiated at an infusion rate of 3mLper minute if no 
infusion reactions were observed with the first elotuzumab infusion. If the subject does not 
experience an infusion reaction during the first 30 minutes of the second dose of elotuzumab, 
escalate the infusion r ate to 4 mLper minute.
The third dose of elotuzumab must be initiated at an infusion rate of 5 mLper minute if no 
infusion reactions were reported with the second elotuzumab infusion.
The fourth and subsequent doses of elotuzumab must be initiated at an infusion rate of 5mL
per minute if no infusion reactions were reported. 
Elotuzumab Infusion Rate (10 mg/kg)
The elotuzumab infusion rate will be increased graduall y to a maximum of 5 mL/min as

If no infusion reactions were observed during the infusion rate escalation over these four doses 
of elotuzumab, all following doses must commence at the maximum rate of 5 mL per minute so 
long as there are no infusion reactions. Escalation abov e 5mL per minute is not permitted.
For subjects bey ond cy cle 1 who have not escalated the infusion rate:
Subjects who have not escalated elotuzumab infusion rates beyond 2 mL per minute, despite 
administration of more than 4 doses of elotuzumab, and who have not experienced any infusion 
reactions, must begin the rate escalation paradigm as described above. That is, a subject in 
cycleX day1 of study  therap y must begin the elotuzumab infusion rate escalation, aiming first 
for an infusion rate of 3 mL  per m inute as described for the second dose of elotuzumab above. If 
the subject does not experience an infusion reaction during the first 30 minutes of the second 
dose of elotuzumab, escalate the infusion rate to 4mL per minute. On the next dose of 
elotuzumab, ie,cycle X day 15, the elotuzumab infusion rate must start at 5 mL per minute as 
described above for the third dose of elotuzumab, if no infusion reactions were noted. With the 
next dose of elotuzumab (ie, cycle X+1 day 1), if no infusion reactions were noted, the subject 
must maintain the infusion rate at 5 mL per minute as described above for the third and 
subsequent doses of elotuzumab.

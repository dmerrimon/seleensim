The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
  
Amendment Rationale  
The quantification of radium -223 radioactivity in Xofigo ® is based on the primary 
standardization performed by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  
The NIST Standard Reference Material is used to calibrate the instruments in production and 
quality control of both the drug substance and  drug product.  Additionally, the calibrated 
instruments in production at the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE, Norway) are used to 
prepare the NIST traceable radium -223 reference material, which are then sent to the treatment 
sites (e.g., nuclear medi cine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial setting of their dose 
calibrators, to allow verification of the patient dose.  A reassessment of the primary 
standardization was initiated by the NIST.  A discrepancy of approximately 10% between the 
published NIST primary standardization (Cessna, 2010, NIST 2010) and current measurements 
was confirmed and a revised NIST primary reference standard has been issued (Zimmerman, 
2015, NIST update).  As a result of the revised NIST primary standardization, an a daption of the 
numerical description of patient dose and the description of radioactive concentration of the drug 
product solution becomes necessary.  This concerns Xofigo® for commercial use and product 
used in clinical trials.   
After the implementation of the new standard (NIST update) the numerical description of the 
patient dose will be adjusted from 50 kBq/kg to 55 kBq/kg, and the numerical description of the 
radioactivity in the vial will be changed from 1,000 kBq/mL to 1,100  kBq/mL  
The values in this protocol have been revised as per the United States National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization update.  
Bayer has submitted a variation application to the FDA.   The current standard (NIST 2010), dial 
setting and dose will remain in effect  for this study until  Bayer has confirmed  the unique 
implementation date in the 2nd quarter of  2016 as agreed with FDA and notified  the Principal

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol Title : A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Sipuleucel -T With or Without Radium -223 IN 
Men With Asymptomztic or Minimally Symptomatic Bone -Metastatic Castrate -Resistant 
Prostate Cancer  
 
Protocol Number : 
 
Phase: II 
 
Study Centers: 4-5 centers in the U.S.  
 
Investigational  Product, Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  
 
Radium -223 (Xofigo®) is an alpha -emitting radioisotope developed by Algeta ASA.  Radium -
223 is  indicated for treatment of men with castrate -resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) with 
symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease . The approved dose and 
schedule of radium -223 is 50 kBq  (or 1.35 microcurie) (55 kBq/kg (or 1.49 microc urie)) after 
implemen tation of  the NIST update)  per kg  body weight  intravenous (IV) infused at 4 week 
interval for 6 injections.  
 
Sipuleucel -T (Provenge ®) is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to 
stimulate an immune response against prostate cancer. Sipuleucel -T is indicated for use in 
patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).  A dose of 
sipuleucel -T is prepared using PBMCs from a single leukapheresis procedure. A minimum of 50 
million antigen presenting cells ( APCs , the biologically active component of sipuleucel -T) are 
administered via a single IV infusion. A complete treatment of sipuleucel -T will inc lude 3 doses 
of autologous cells, infused at approximately 2 -week intervals.  
 
Primary Objective   
 
• To determine whether addition of radium -223 to sipuleucel -T enhances immune response 
to sipuleucel -T measured by peripheral PA2024 -specific T -cell prolifera tion compared 
with sipuleucel -T alone in men asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic bone -metastatic 
CRPC  
 
Secondary Immune Objectives  
 
• To evaluate peripheral antigen -specific T -cell proliferation over  time 
• To evaluate peripheral antigen specific T-cell activation  to sipuleucel -T over time

The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 • To evaluate antigen specific antibody response  to sipuleucel -T over time  
• To evaluate the  sipuleucel -T product immune parameter s 
 
Secondary Clinical Objectives  
 
• To evaluate  safety of combined  use of radium -223 and sipul eucel -T.  
• To evaluate PSA50 response (at least a 50% decline in PSA)   
• To evaluate time to radiographic  or clinical progression .  
Study Design and Duration:  
 
This is a randomized  study designed to assess the antigen -specific immune response of 
sipule ucel-T when administered with or without radium -223.   
 
Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sipuleucel -T 
and radium -223 or sipuleucel -T alone ; 
 
Arm 1 : 6 infusions of radium -223 with 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T starting after second  
dose of radium -223 
 
Arm 2: 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T alone  
 
Subjects in both arms will undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed 
approximately 3 days later by an IV infusion of sipuleucel -T. This process will  occur a total of 3 
times at  approximately 2 -week intervals . Subjects in Arm 1 will receive a total of 6 infusions of 
radium -223 at IV dose of 50 kBq/kg  (55 kBq/kg after implementation of the NIST update)  at 4-
week interval  
  
Research visits  will be schedu led at screening, at each  radium -223 infusion, prior to each 
leukapheresis (preleukapheresis visit), and week 32, 45 and 58 for Arm 1 (radium -223 and 
sipuleucel -T combination arm) and at screening, prior to each leukapheresis (preleukapheresis 
visit), and  week 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 for Arm 2 (sipuleucel -T alone arm)  for physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECOG performance status, adverse event (AE) monitoring, anticancer 
therapies, first opioid use for cancer -related pain, and  laboratory tests. Serum  PSA will be  
assessed at baseline, and week  16, 32, 45, and 58 for Arm 1 and at baseline, and week 10, 26, 39, 
and 52 for Arm 2.  There is a ±  7 day window for each visit to accommodate holidays, vacations, 
etc. 
Imaging studies  including bone scintigraphy t est (bone scan) or Na -F PET or C11 acetate PET 
and abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI will be obtained at screening and week 16, 32, 45, and 58  for 
Arm 1 and at screening and week 10, 26, 39 , and 52 for Arm 2. After the last study visit , imaging 
studies will be obta ined according to the participating institution’s standard and/or at the 
investigator’s discretion.

Immune monitoring blood samples  will be drawn at screening and at 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 
weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel -T in both arms . Additional blood sample s will be 
obtained at baseline, first pre -leukapheresis visit (only in Arm 1), and weeks 14 and 52 post the 
first infusion of sipuleucel -T for exploratory antigen spread assessment.  
 
After last study research visit, safety , treatment -related AEs, survival status, PSA, first opioid use 
for cancer -related pain (if applicable), and anticancer therapies will be assessed every 3 months  
for additional  1 year  or until the subject’s death.

The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 Statistical Considerations   
 
The study is designed to test the null hypothesis of no difference  in immune response to 
sipuleucel -T evaluated on the basis of PA2024 -stimulated T cell proliferation via 3H-thymidine  
uptake between sipuleucel -T alone  and sequential administration of radium -223.  
 
For primary endpoint, PA2024 -specific 3H-thymidine uptake was selected because it has 
demonstrated the highest signal to noise ratio and showed the strongest correlation with OS of all 
cellular and humoral assays evaluated in prior studies of sipuleucel -T.  
 
With 15 subjects  in each arm , we seek to detect a 3.6 -fold difference  between the arms with 80% 
power in me an SI of PA2024 -specific 3H-thymidine uptake at week 6 after the first infusion of 
sipuleucel -T    
 
The immune response population will consist of all subjects who receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel -T and at least 4 infusions of radium -223.  
 
The intent -to-treat population is defined as all randomized subjects, regardless of whether they 
receive treatment. Analysis of non -immune response efficacy endpoints will be performed using 
this analysis population.   
 
The safety population will include all subjects who undergo at least 1 leukapheresis procedure or 
receive at least 1 dose of  radium -223.

 1.0   INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1  Background and Rationale  
 
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in the United States, with estimated 238, 
590 new cases and 29,720 deaths in 2013  [3]. Approximately 80% of prostate cancer cases are 
diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the primary site  (localized prostate cancer) . But 
12% prostate cancers are diagnosed as locally advanced  stage and 4% as metastatic disease.   
 
Localized prostate cancer  can be treated with various local therapies and some selected cases can 
be followed with active surveillance. However, approximately 20% to 40% of patients who have 
been treated with a curative intent develop disease recurrence  [4]. While some select ive patients 
with PSA -only recurrence with no evidence of disseminated disease can be treated with local 
salvage therapies, majority of patients with recurrent disease require systemic therapy such as 
ADT with or without concomitant  antian drogen agents. Despite high rate of initial response to 
ADT , virtually all patients will progress  to metastatic disease, the disease condition called 
metastatic castrate -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). When patients develop mCRPC, the 
disease is considered noncurable an d lethal with a median  survival around 2 years.  
 
There has been tremendous advance in the treatment of mCRPC over the last decade since the 
approval of docetaxel in 2003 . Currently 6 therapeutic agents with various mechanisms that have 
shown survival benefit have been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of mCRPC. While the approval of multiple agents have resulted in increased overall 
survival and improved quality of life  and provided wider therapeutic options for the patients , it 
has created challenges of establishing the optimal use of these therapeutics including the optimal 
sequence and possible combination of those agents.      
 
Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate a n immune 
response against prostate cancer . Sipuleucel -T has improved survival in patients with 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC in 3 phase III trials  [5-7]. Despite the survival 
benefit, majority of patients treated with sipuleucel -T do not experience radiographic or PSA 
response, making the assessmen t of treatment response difficult . Furthermore, there is no 
established clinical or molecular marker  to predict the response to sipuleucel -T immune therapy. 
However recently published analysis of immune responses from these 3 trials showed that 
antigen -specific immune responses to sipuleucel -T, both humoral and T -cell response s, correlate 
with survival benefit  [8], confirming the immune -based mechanism of action of sipuleucel -T and 
also suggesting  the possibility that producing a stronger immune response may translate to the 
better clinical outcome.  
 
It has been suggested that immune modulation can be enhanced by radiation therapy through  a 
variety of mechanisms . Radiation -induced cell deat h has been shown to stimulate tumor -specific 
19 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 immune responses by enhanced display of tumor associated antigens and upregulation of tumor 
suppressive proteins and inflammatory cytokines  [9]. This synergistic a ntitumor effect of 
combined immune therapy and radiation therapy has been evaluated in various cancer types. In 
prostate cancer, a  phase I/II study of i pilimumab in co mbination with radiotherapy in m CRPC  
showed a promising antitumor effect including PSA de cline and radiographic tumor reduction .  
 
Similar  to external  radiotherapy , radiopharmaceutical agent also has shown to upregulate tumor 
antigen s in prostate cancer model s. In a study by Chakraborty et, al., the exposure to  beta particle 
emitting radiopharmaceutical, s amarium -153-ethylenediaminetetrame -thylenephosphonate 
(153Sm-EDTMP), resulted in upregulation of the prostate cancer antigens, such as PSMA and 
PAP [10]. Such 153Sm-EDTMP -induced phenotypic changes in tumor cells rendered these tumor 
cells more susceptible to T cell –mediated killing.  
 
Radium -223 is  an alpha-emitting radioisotope which is a bone -seeking calcium mimetic. It 
selectively  targets the area with increased bone turnover , especially within the microenvironment 
of osteoblastic or sclerotic metastases  [11]. It has been approved by FDA for the treatment of 
mCRPC with symptomatic bone metastases and without known visceral disease  based on its 
ability to extend overall survival as shown its pivotal phase III trial  [12]. Unlike  beta particl e 
emitting radiopharmaceutical s, radium -223 emits high -energy alpha particles of short range 
(<100 μm) thus saving the  surrounding healthy tissues  and significantly reducing unwanted 
myelotoxicity  [13]. 
 
Based on the immune -modulatory effects of radiotherapy  and radiopharmaceutical  shown in the 
previous studies , we hypothesized that combined use of radium -223 and sipuleucel -T can 
enhance the sipuleucel -T-induced immune response, which translates to better clinical outcome. 
Since more than 90% of patients with  mCRPC have bone metastases  [14], this approach can be 
widely applied to early stage of mCRPC when patients are asymptomatic or minimally 
symp tomatic from the bone lesions when the greatest clinical benefit can be obtained with 
immune -based therapies  [15]. 
1.2   Study Agents  
 
1.2.1   Sipuleucel -T 
 
Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate an immune 
response against prostate cancer. It consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs), including antigen presenting cells (APCs, defined as large CD54 -positive PBMCs) 
that have been activated in vitro with prostate antigen PA2024, a recombinant fusion protein 
composed of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte -macrophage colon y-
stimulating factor (GM -CSF).

Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 Sipuleucel -T was approved in the United States in 201 3 for the treatment of men with 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC. In the pivotal trial D9902B (IMPACT), 512 
patients were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel -T (N=341) or control (N=171)  [7]. Overall 
surviva l was longer in the sipuleucel -T group (median of 25.8 months versus 21.7 months; 
hazard ratio (HR) =0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62, 0.98; P=0.03). More than 3,339 
infusions of sipuleucel -T and control (a product manufactured from PBMCs without a ctivation 
with the PA2024 antigen), have been administered to men with prostate cancer in clinical trials.  
 
Clinical data to support the safety of sipuleucel -T are provided from 904 subjects (sipuleucel -T, 
N=601; control, N=303) who participated in 4 multi center, randomized, double -blind, controlled 
Phase 3 studies. Three of these studies were conducted in men with mCRPC (studies D9902B, 
D9901, and D9902A), and 1 study was conducted in men with androgen dependent prostate 
cancer (ADPC)  [5-7;16] . In the 4 randomized Ph ase 3 studies, AEs reported in ≥ 20% of all 
subjects were chills, fatigue, pyrexia, and back pain. The most common AEs (observed in ≥ 5% 
of sipuleucel -T subjects as well as at least twice the rate of that in control subjects) included 
chills, pyrexia, head ache, myalgia, influenza -like illness, and hyperhidrosis. The majority of 
these events occurred within 1 day of infusion; were grade 1 or 2 in severity; and were generally 
of short duration (i.e., resolved in ≤ 2 days). Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in  27.6% of 
subjects in the sipuleucel -T group, compared with 28.4% in the control group.  
 
1.2.2   Radium-223 
 
Radium -223 ( Bayer Pharmaceuticals, NJ) is a calcium mimetic which localizes to bone at areas 
with increased bone turnover. Radium -223 decays via a chain of short -lived daughter nuclides to 
lead, producing four alpha -particles  [13]. The high energy of alpha particle induces effective 
double stranded DNA breaks with short range of less than 100 μm, minimizing  
myelo suppression and causing limited effects on normal tissue.  
 
Radium -223 was approved by the US FDA o n Ma y 15, 2013  based on the interim results from a 
Phase III randomized trial, the ALSYMPCA study (Alpharadin in the treatment of patients with 
symptomatic bone metastases in castration -resistant prostate cancer). In this trial, 921 patients 
who had receiv ed, were not eligible to receive, or declined docetaxel were randomly assigned in 
a 2:1 ratio to receive six injections of radium -223 (at a dose of 50 kBq per kilogram of body 
weight intravenously  (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST standard update)  every 4 weeks 
or matching placebo. At the interim analysis, which  involved 809 patients, radium -223, as 
compared with placebo, significantly improved overall survival (median, 14.0 months vs. 11.2 
months; HR =0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; two -sided P=0.002).  The updated analysis involving 
921 patients confirmed the radium -223 survival benefit (median, 14.9 months vs. 11.3 months; 
HR=0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83; P<0.001). The rate of AEs was consistently lower in the radium -
223 group than in the placebo group f or all AEs (93% vs. 96%), grade 3 or 4 AEs (56% vs. 
21 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 62%), and serious AEs (47% vs. 60%).  There w ere no clinically meaningful differences in the 
frequency of grade 3 and 4 hematologic AEs. Only one  
 patient developed grade 3 febrile neutropenia in the radiu m-223 group. For serious AEs that 
occurred in at least 5% of patients in the radium -223 group or the placebo group, the respective 
frequencies were as follows: disease progression (11% and 12%), bone pain (10% and 16%), 
anemia (8% and 9%), and spinal cord compression (4% and 5%). Also a significantly higher 
percentage of patients who received radium -223 had a meaningful improvement in the quality of 
life according to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Prostate (FACT -P) total score 
during the period  of study -drug administration (25% vs. 16%, P=0.02).  
 
2.0   OBJECTIVES

The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
  
Arm 1 : 6 infusions of radium -223 with 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T starting after second 
dose of radium -223 
 
Arm 2 : 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T alone  
 
Subjects in both arms will undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed 
approximately 3 d ays later by an IV infusion of sipuleucel -T. This process will occur a total of 3 
times at approximately 2 -week intervals. Subjects in Arm 1 will receive a total of 6 infusions of 
radium -223 at IV dose of 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of the NI ST update) at 4-
week interval.  
  
All participants are allowed to receive the best supportive care which includes secondary 
hormonal manipulation (including flutamide, bicalutamide or nilutamide -but not abiraterone or 
enzalutamide) as required. No chemother apy, external -beam radiation, or other radionuclides are 
allowed while on active treatment but are permitted after completion of active treatment. 
Glucocorticoid -containing treatments should be minimized to less than the equivalent dose of 
prednisone 10mg daily if feasible for the 3 months following sipuleucel -T therapy . All patients 
continue medical or surgical castration during treatment.  
 
Research visits  will be scheduled at screening, at each radium -223 infusion, prior to each 
leukapheresis ( preleukapheresis visit), and week 32, 45 and 58 for Arm 1 (radium -223 and 
sipuleucel -T combination arm) and at screening, prior to each leukapheresis (preleukapheresis 
visit), and week 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 for Arm 2 (sipuleucel -T alone arm)  for physi cal 
examinations, vital signs, ECOG performance status, adverse event (AE) monitoring, anticancer 
therapies, first opioid use for cancer -related pain, and laboratory tests. Serum PSA will be  
assessed at baseline, and week  16, 32, 45, and 58 for Arm 1 and a t baseline, and week 10, 26, 39, 
and 52  for Arm 2 . There is a ±7 day window for each visit to accommodate holidays, vacations, 
etc. 
 
Imaging studies  including bone scintigraphy test (bone scan) or Na -F PET or C11 acetate PET 
and abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI wi ll be obtained at screening and week 16, 32, 45, and 58  for 
Arm 1 and at screening and week 10, 26, 39, and 52 for Arm 2 . After the last study visit , imaging 
studies will be obtained according to the participating institution’s standard and/or at the 
inves tigator’s discretion.  
 
Immune monitoring  blood samples will be drawn at screening and at 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 
weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel -T in both arms. Additional blood samples will be 
obtained at baseline, first pre -leukapheresis v isit (only in Arm 1), and weeks 14 and 52 post the 
first infusion of sipuleucel -T for exploratory antigen spread assessment.

5.0   STUD Y TREATMENTS  
 
5.1   Radium -223 
 
5.1.1   Dosage Forms and Strength  
 
Radium -223 is available in single -use vials containing 6 mL of solution at a concentration of 
1,000 kBq/m L (27 microcurie/mL)  (1,100 kBq/mL  (29.7 microcurie/mL) after implementation 
of the  NIST update)  at the reference date with a total radioactivity of 6,000kBq/vial  (162 
microcurie/vial)  (6,600 kBq/vial  (178 microcurie/vial)  after implementation of the NIST update)  
at the reference date.  
 
5.1.2   Preparation  
 
Radium -223 is a ready -to-use solution and should not be diluted or mixed with any solutions. 
Each vial is for single use only.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container 
permi t. 
 
5.1.3   Dosage  
 
The dose regimen of radium -223 is 50 kBq  (1.35 microcurie) (55 kBq /kg (1. 49 microcurie /kg) 
after implementation of the NIST update)  per kg body weight, given at 4 week intervals for 6 
injections.  
27 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
  
The volume to be administered to a given patient should be calculated using the:  
 
– Patient’s body weight (kg)  
– Dosage level 50 kBq/kg body weight (55 kBq/kg after implementation of the NIST 
update) or 1.35 microcurie/kg body weight  (1.49  microcur ie after implementation of the 
NIST update)  
– Radioactivity concentration of the product (1,000 kBq/mL ; 27 microcurie/mL  (1,100 
kBq/ mL after implementation of the NIST update ;29.7 microcurie/mL) at the reference 
date 
– Decay correction factor to correct for physical decay of radium -223. 
 
The total amount ( volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a patient should be 
calculated as follows:   
 
Volume to be administered (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (50 kBq/kg b.w)a 
                                                          DK factor x 1,000 kB q (0.027 mCi)/mLb

b 1,100 kBq  (29.7 microcurie i)/mL after implantation of the NIST update  
 
Decay Correction Factor Table  
 
 
 
The Decay Correction Factor Table is corrected to 12 noon Central Standard Time (CST). To 
determine the decay correction factor, count the number of days before or after the reference 
date. The Decay Correction Factor Table includes a correction to account  for the 7 hour time

update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 difference  between 12 noon Central European Time (CET) at the site of manufacture and 12 
noon US CST, which is 7 hours earlier than CET.  
 
Immediately before and after administration, the net patient dose of administered  radium -223 
shou ld be determined by  measurement in an appropriate radioisotope dose calibrator that has 
been calibrated with a National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) traceable radium -
223 standard ( a new reference vial will be sent to each center correspondi ng to the updated NIST 
reference material ) and corrected for decay using  the date and time of calibration. The dose 
calibrator must be calibrated with nationally recognized standards, carried out at  the time of 
commissioning, after any maintenance procedur e that could affect the dosimetry and at intervals 
not to exceed  one year.  
 
Each center must perform the Radium Ra 223 dichloride dial setting on their relevant dose 
calibrator(s) (upon notification by Bayer each center is required to update the dial setti ng to 
correspond to the new NIST standard). The current dial settings are to remain in effect until 
Bayer obtains FULL approval from the FDA for implementation. In preparation for 
implementation of the NEW dial setting, the clinical study center will recei ve a sealed vial 
labeled NIST standard containing a Radium Ra 223 dichloride solution for calibration only. The 
vial is identical to the vials used for study treatment. The amount of Radium Ra 223 dichloride in 
the vial will be stated on the label. Instruc tions for the dial setting, including the calibration log 
form, will be enclosed with the dispatch of the calibration sample.  
 
All sites will be notified by Bayer when FINAL regulatory approval from the FDA is in place 
and the updated NIST standardization is to be implemented.  
 
5.1.4   NIST Standardization Update  
 
The qualification of radium -223 radioactive in Xofigo (radium -223 dichloride; BAY 88 -8223) is 
based on the primary standardization performed by the US NIST. National Institute of Standards 
and Technology prepares the standard reference material (SRM) using an official dial setting 
(primary standardization) as published [20]. The NIST SRM is used to calibrate the instruments 
in production and quality control for both the drug substance and drug product. Additionally, the 
NIST SRM is used to prepare the NIST traceable Ra -223 reference materials which are then sent 
to the en d-users (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial -setting of 
their dose calibrators, to allow verification of the patient dose.  
 
In 2014, NIST performed a re -assessment of the primary standardization based on preliminary 
infor mation suggesting a potential discrepancy of approximately 8 -10% between the published 
NIST primary standardization [20] and results obtained by other national metrology institutes 
(United Kingdom, Germany, Japan). After completion of the re -assessment, NI ST reported their 
findings [21] and had issued a revised NIST SRM in 2015. The discrepancy in the NIST 
29 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 standardization was determined to be -9.5% between activity values obtained using the old 
reference standard relative to the new primary standardization.  Consequently , the current 
numerical values need to be corrected by approximately +10.5%  
 
The current NIST standard for radium -223 dichloride will remain in effect until the FDA has 
fully approved the regulatory variation submitted for Xofigo and is antici pated in the 2nd quarter 
of 2016. All sites are expected to begin preparation for the updated NIST standardization and 
obtain all necessary IRB approvals. Bayer will continue to notify sites about the status of the 
regulatory approval and the date that the  updated NIST standardization is to be implemented. 
Upon notification, and prior to the implementation, all sites are expected to add a new dial 
setting to their dose calibrators for the new NIST standardization for radium -223 dichloride, 
which should be d ocumented on the appropriate study forms.  
 
The change in the numerical description of the patient’s dose, product strength and labeled vial 
activity does not impact the safety or efficacy of Xofigo. The change in the NIST radium -223 
standard has no impact  on subjects; dose subjects are receiving, and will continue to receive. 
Subjects will receive the same actual dose and volume that was studied in Study 15245 (BCI -06 
dosimetry study) and is associated with the proven safety and efficacy of radium -223 dich loride, 
though the stated nominal radiation dose received is being updated to reflect the new standard. 
The formula for the calculation of the volume to be administered has to be changed respectively. 
(see dose section) Subjects who are on -treatment at the  time the new NIST reference standard 
goes into effect should be notified of this change and should be required to sign a Patient 
Information Sheet to acknowledge that they have received information on the updated NIST 
standard calibration. All patients ra ndomized after the new reference standard is in effect should 
sign a revised Informed Consent Form that contains the updated NIST standardization.  
 
5.1.5   Administration  
 
Radium -223 should be administered by slow IV injection over 1 minute. The IV access line or 
cannula should be flushed with isotonic saline before and after injection of radium -223. 
 
5.1.6   Handling  and Patient Protection  
 
Radium -223 is primarily an alpha emitter, with a 95.3% fraction of energy emitted as alpha -
particles. The fraction emitted as beta -particles is 3.6%, and the fraction emitted as gamma -
radiation is 1.1%. The external radiation exposure associated with handl ing of patient doses is 
expected to be low, because the typical treatment activity will be below 8,000 kBq (216 
microcurie).   (8,800 kBq  (238 microcurie)  after implementation of the NIST update) In keeping 
with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) p rinciple for minimization of radiation 
exposure, it is recommended to minimize the time spent in radiation areas, to maximize the 
distance to radiation sources, and to use adequate shielding. Any  unused product or materials

Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 used in connection with the prep aration or administration are to be treated as radioactive waste 
and should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. The gamma radiation associated 
with the decay of radium -223 and its daughters allows for the radioactivity measurement of 
radiu m-223 and the detection of contamination with standard instruments.  
 
General warning  
 
Radium -223 should be received, used and administered only by authorized persons in designated 
clinical settings. The receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal of radiu m-223 are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organization.  
 
Radium -223 should be handled by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate asepti c precautions should be taken.  
 
Radiation protection  
 
The administration of radium -223 is associated with potential risks to other persons (e.g., 
medical staff, caregivers and patient’s household members) from radiation or contamination 
from spills of bodi ly fluids such as urine, feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection 
precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations.  
 
For drug handling  
 
Follow the normal working procedures for the handling of radiopharmaceuticals and use  
universal precautions for handling and administration such as gloves and barrier gowns when 
handling blood and bodily fluids to avoid contamination. In case of contact with skin or eyes, the 
affected area should be flushed immediately with water. In the e vent of spillage of radium -223, 
the local radiation safety officer should be contacted immediately to initiate the necessary 
measurements and required procedures to decontaminate the area. A complexing agent such as 
0.01 M ethylene -diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution is recommended to remove 
contamination.  
 
For patient care  
 
Whenever possible, patients should use a toilet and the toilet should be flushed several times 
after each use. When handling bodily fluids, simply wearing gloves and hand washing wi ll 
protect caregivers. Clothing soiled with radium -223 or patient fecal matter or urine should be 
washed promptly and separately from other clothing.  
 
5.2   Sipuleucel -T 
 
31 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 The patients included in the study are scheduled for standard treatment with commerc ially 
available sipuleucel -T according to institutional practice and the approved product information  
(available at; http://www.dendreon.com/prescribing -information.pdf ). 
 
5.2.1   Leukapheresis and Infusion Scheduling  
 
Leukapheresis appointments will be scheduled at approximately 2 -week intervals. The clinical 
trial site will schedule the subject’s infusion appointments based on this schedule. If the subject 
is subsequently deemed ineligible, the clinical trial site will  be informed and the leukapheresis 
and infusion appointments will be canceled.  
 
5.2.2   Leukapheresis  
 
The collection of blood cells to manufacture sipuleucel -T is analogous to that for autologous 
blood transfusions. Subjects undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis to harvest 
PBMCs (primarily lymphocytes and monocytes).  
 
5.2.3   Product Quality assessment   
 
Prior to infusion, small samples (3%  to 4%) of cellular components from pre and post -culture 
(PA2024) cells will be used to assess product potency as part of the normal sipuleucel -T 
manufacturing process. Sipuleucel -T quality assessments include total TNC count, CD54+ cell 
count and CD54 upr egulation.  
 
5.2.4   Sipuleucel -T Infusion  
 
Each sipuleucel -T dose is released for infusion approximately 3 days following the leukapheresis 
procedure. Subjects will be infused according to the infusion guidelines (available at; 
http://www.dendreon.com/pre scribing -information.pdf ). 
 
5.2.5   Sipuleucel -T Product Failures and Leukapheresis Rescheduling  
 
In the event that a subject’s leukapheresis procedure fails, sipuleucel -T does not meet quality 
release specifications, or infusion is not possible for any other reason, the subject may be 
scheduled to undergo a repeat leukapheresis procedure. A minimum of 2 days must have elapsed 
since the last leukapheresis procedure. Sched uling will depend upon capacity of the 
leukapheresis and Dendreon manufacturing facilities. If the second or third leukapheresis 
appointment is delayed or rescheduled for any reason, a physical examination and all other pre -
leukapheresis procedures must be  repeated within the 5 days prior to the next leukapheresis 
procedure.

Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 5.3   Treatment Compliance  
 
Study drugs will be administered or dispensed only to eligible patients under the supervision of 
the investigator or identified sub -investigator(s).  The appropriate study personnel will maintain 
records of study drug receipt and dispensing.  
 
5.4   Drug Accountability  
 
Study drugs  should be kept in a secure place and must be administered only to patients in the 
trial. A log of study drug (received, administered to patients and destroyed) must be maintained 
and signed by the person responsible for drug handling at each cente r. Study  site/institution 
personnel will record all study drug  administered during this trial on the drug -dispensing log. 
Description of monitoring of the overall drug accountability will be detailed in study and site 
specific procedures.  
 
The nuclear medicine spe cialist or radiation oncologist at the center is responsible for drug 
accountability for radium -223. When the drug accountability has been monitored, the vials can 
be destroyed in accordance with hospital procedure for the handling of radioactive material,  
normally after storage for 4 months from date of receipt (>10 half -lives) before disposal; they 
may then be disposed as non -radioactive waste  
 
5.5   Concomitant Medications  
 
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood an d blood products, 
antibiotics, antiemetics, or other therapies, in accordance with standard practice at the clinical 
trial site. Subjects receiving ADT, bisphosphonate therapy such as zoledronic acid (Zometa®), or 
denosumab (Xgeva®) at the time of registra tion should continue the therapy at a stable dose 
during radium -223 treatment.  
 
All concomitant medications administered from screening through the last research visit  at week 
58, including indication, dose, route, frequency and treatment dates, will be r ecorded in the 
subject’s medical record and on the CRF. After the last research visit  at week 58 , only anticancer 
therapies will be recorded. The first opioid taken for cancer -related pain will be recorded, 
regardless of when it is started.   
 
5.6   Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments  
 
Subjects on ADT must continue this therapy until the post -treatment visit or disease progression, 
whichever occurs first.

Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 The following medications and interventions must not be initiated until the completion of 
radium -223 treatment or disease progression, whichever occurs first:  
 
• Investigational vaccines or other investigational products.  
• Ipilimumab  or nivolumab .  
• Hemibody radiation  
 
Glucocorticoid -containing treatments should be minimized to the equivalent dose  of prednisone 
10mg daily or less if feasible for the 3 months following sipuleucel -T. Use of inhaled, intranasal, 
intra-articular, and topical steroids is acceptable, as well as a short course (i.e., ≤ 1 day) of 
prophylactic steroid therapy prior to admin istration of IV contrast for CT imaging.  
 
5.7   Discontinuation from Study Treatments or Assessments  
 
5.7.1    Patient withdrawal  
 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, patients have the right to withdraw from the 
study at any time for any reason, without prejudice to their medical care.  The investigator also 
has the right to withdraw patients from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 
• Consent withdrawal by the subject for any reason.  
• Occurrence of AEs, if discontinuation of study m edication is considered necessary by 
the Investigator and/or patient.  
• The subject develops any condition requiring a prohibited treatment (Section 5. 6).  
• Lack of patient compliance  
• Protocol violation.  
• Study termination.  
• The subject is lost to follow -up.  
• Progressive disease (patients will only come off study after meeting PCWG2 and/or 
RECIST criteria for radiographic progression and not for PSA)  
 
Subjects who withdraw consent, or lose the ability to freely provide consent, will be followed by 
the investigat or for survival every 3 months using the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) and 
National Death Index (NDI). Date of death, where available, will be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and on the CRF.  
 
Whenever possible, subjects discontinuing from the study will undergo a post -treatment visit. All 
AEs considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment(s) that are ongoing at the time 
of discontinuation will be followed by the investigator un til resolution or until the subject returns 
to baseline. The investigator should make every reasonable attempt to ensure that the subject is

update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 contacted (via telephone or during a post -treatment visit) to obtain the final status of any AEs 
and concomitant me dications.  
 
5.7.2   Discontinuation from Sipuleucel -T Treatment  
 
Subjects who are unable to, or refuse to, undergo leukapheresis or receive at least 1 partial 
sipuleucel -T infusion should discontinue sipuleucel -T treatment.  
 
Subjects who have received at  least 1 partial (> 0 mL) infusion of sipuleucel -T may discontinue 
sipuleucel -T without the requirement to discontinue radium -223. These subjects will continue all 
protocol -specified assessments in the active phase.  
 
Any toxicity requiring sipuleucel -T discontinuation will be recorded as an AE in the subject’s 
medical record and on the CRF.  
 
5.7.3   Discontinuation from Radium -223 Treatment  
 
Radium -223 administration may be delayed by no more than four weeks for recovery of adverse 
events. In case of a tr eatment delay greater than four weeks, treatment should be discontinued. It 
is important to note that in general (unless otherwise agreed), in cases where study drug has been 
ordered, the time window is reduced to -3 days to + 3 days, due to decay. If admi nistration has to 
be postponed more than 3 days after drug has been ordered, replacement of the drug order is 
required.  Dose reduction for radium -223 will not be permitted and subjects with any toxicity 
requiring radium -223 dose reduction must discontinue radium -223 treatment.  
 
Any toxicity requiring radium -223 discontinuation will be recorded as an AE in the subject’s 
medical record and on the CRF.  
 
5.7.4   Study Termination  
 
The whole study may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator in the event of any of 
the following:  
 
• Occurrence of AEs not seen previously which by virtue of their nature, severity and 
duration are considered to necessitate study termination . 
• Hematologic adverse events criteria for study termination  
– >2 events of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia  in the first 10 subjects  
– >3 events of grade ≥ 3 anemia  in the first 10 subjects  
• Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study . 
• Bayer  is unable to provide  radium -223 for the subject.  
• Dendreon is  unable to manufacture siptuleucel -T in > 2 of first 10 patients .

Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 • Difficulties in the recruitment of patients . 
 
5.8.   Lost to Follow -Up  
 
If the subject fails to respond to requests for follow -up, the clinical trial site will send a registered 
letter, at a minimum, to the subject requesting contact with the clinic. All attempts to resume 
contact (including copies of written correspondence) will be included in the source 
documentation. Subjects who do not respond to requests for follow -up after all reasonab le 
attempts to establish contact will be considered “lost to follow -up”. Subjects who are lost to 
follow -up will be followed by the investigator for survival every 3 months using the SSDI and 
the NDI. Date of death, where available, will be recorded in the  subject’s medical record and on 
the CRF.  
 
5.9   Disease Progression  
 
Disease progression is determined by the investigator per the definition below. The earliest date 
of disease progression will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF. 
Following disease progression, all study treatments will cease, the subject will undergo a post -
treatment visit and will be treated at the investigator’s discretion.  
 
5.9.1   PSA Progression  
 
Any 1 or more of the following events constitutes PSA progressi on:  
 
• PSA Progression based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria [1]:  
 
– Decline from baseline: the first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the 
nadir, and which is  confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (i.e., a 
confirmed rising trend).  
– No decline from baseline: PSA progression ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks 
from baseline.  
 
PSA measurements obtained during the treatment should not be used as the sol e criterion for 
determining progression. Study treatments may be continued in equivocal cases where there is 
PSA progression but no clear evidence of disease progression or clinical deterioration, and where 
the investigator feels the subject is deriving cl inical benefit from the study treatments and subject 
safety is not compromised.

update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 6.2   Registration  
 
After eligibility screening, patients who are selected to participate will be registered with the 
study site/institution. A record of patients who fail to meet entry criteria (ie, screen failures) will 
be maintained by each individual site. Patient registration must be complete before beginning 
any treatment or study activities.  
 
Prior to prot ocol enrollment and initiation of treatment, subjects must sign and date an IRB -
approved consent form.  To register a patient, the following documents must be completed a nd 
faxed or emailed to the Lead Center Program Coordinator:  
 
• Signed patient consent fo rm 
• Registration Form  
• Copies of the prostate cancer pathology report, baseline laboratory studies including CBC 
with differential, liver and kidney function tests, testosterone, PSA , and CT/bone scan .  
Other materials may also be sent if considered pertinent for confirming patient eligibility.  
 
The Lead Center will review the documents to confirm eligibility.  To complete the registration 
process the Lead Center will:  
 
• Assign a patient study number  
• Register the patient on the study with SKCCC’s Clini cal Research Office  
• Fax or e -mail the patient study number to the participating site  
 
6.3   Randomization  
 
Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive  6 infusions of 
radium -223 and 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T starti ng after  second dose of radium -223 ( Arm 1) or 
3 infusions of sipuleucel -T alone  (Arm 2).  
 
Arm 1 : 6 infusions of radium -223 with 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T starting after second 
dose of radium -223 
 
Arm 2 : 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T  
 
6.4   Demographics  
 
Demographic information, including birth date, race and ethnicity will be recorded in the 
subject’s medical record and on the CRF.

Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
  
Clinical assessments will be performed at the times noted in Table 1.  
 
6.5.1   Medical History  
 
Significant historic and current medical conditions or illness, allergies to medications, and prior 
surgical interventions will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF. 
Information regarding the subject’s history of smo king and other risk factors for CVEs will also 
be recorded.  
 
Symptoms that are ongoing at the time of, or that develop after the subject provides informed 
consent and before registration, will also be considered medical history.  
 
Medical history will inc lude the subject’s 6 most recent PSA values, vaccinations in the two 
years prior to registration, and all prior anticancer therapies.  
 
6.5.2   Physical Examination  
 
Physical examinations will be performed at the times noted in Table 1 and must be conducte d by 
an appropriately qualified investigator listed on the Form FDA 1572.  
 
The physical examinations conducted at screening and at pre -leukapheresis visits will include a 
review of the skin, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurologic systems, abdomen, and 
extremities. A review of additional body systems will be at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
For all other visits that call for a physical examination, the body systems reviewed will be at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
 
Each physical examination will include weight measurement. Height will be measured at 
screening only.  
 
Abnormal physical examination findings at screening will be considered part of the medical 
history and will be recorded on the Medical History CRF. Any new or worsening physical 
examination findings identified after the subject’s registration will be considered AEs and will be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF.  
 
6.5.3   Vital Signs  
 
Vital signs (respiration rate, temperature, heart  rate, and blood pressure) will be measured at the 
times noted in Table 1. Vital signs will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the  
CRF.  
43 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 6.5.4   ECOG Performance Status  
 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status will be assessed  at the times noted in 
Table 1. The assessment must be conducted by an appropriately qualified investigator listed on 
the Form FDA 1572 . The ECOG performance status will be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record and on the CRF.  
 
6.5.5   Imaging  
 
Subjec ts must have a bone scintigraphy test  (bone scan) or Na -F PET or C11 -acetate PET and 
CT or MRI scan of the abdomen and pelvis within 56 days prior to registration. If a bone scan is 
used, solitary lesions or lesions which could be attributed to causes other than metastatic prostate 
cancer must be confirmed with a second modality (i.e., CT or MRI).  
 
When available, standard of care scans will be used to demonstrate metastatic disease at 
screening. If scans meeting the eligibility criteria are not available, scans may be obtained during 
the screening phase. If post -screening radiographic imaging is pe rformed per standard of care to 
assess disease progression, the same modalities used at screening should be used.  
 
6.6    Safety Assessments  
 
Safety assessments will be performed in conjunction with all visits as indicated in Table 1.  
 
6.6.1   Adverse E vents and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events, including serious AEs (SAEs) will be assessed at all visits and as needed during 
the course of the study.  
 
All non -serious AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment, will be collected 
from registration through the week 20  and will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and 
on the CRF. Following  week 20,  only new treatment -related AEs and SAEs will be recorded.   
 
Only treatment -related AEs  and SAEs ongoing at week 2 0 visit will be fo llowed by the 
investigator until resolution, return to baseline, or a determination by the investigator that no 
further improvement is expected.  
 
See Section 7.0 for information regarding AE and SAE reporting.

The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 The subject’s current prescription and nonprescription medications will be reviewed at the 
screening visit and recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF. Medications taken 
from registration through the  week 20  will also be recorded. Any medicatio ns associated with a 
possible or probable treatment -related AE will be recorded on the CRF, regardless of when they 
are taken. The concomitant medication administered, indication, dose, route, frequency, and start 
and stop dates will be recorded in the sub ject’s medical record and on the CRF.  
 
6.7.1   Anticancer Therapies  
 
All anticancer therapies received prior to screening and through the end of the follow -up will be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF. Anticancer therapies include, but are 
not limited to, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, investigational cancer therapies, all 
other systemic therapies, and surgery. The start/stop date and dose of anticancer therapies will be 
recorded.  
 
6.7.2   First Cancer -Related Opioid Use  
 
Each subject’s first cancer -related opioid use, as determined by the investigator, will be recorded 
in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF. Cancer -related opioid use is defined as use for 
cancer -related pain that is of at least 2 consecutive days in duration.  
 
Opioid analgesic use for treatment or prevention of infusion reactions, such as chills or rigors, 
post-procedural pain, or for indications clearly unrelated to cancer pain (e.g., cough, pain due to 
an injury or accident) should NOT be consid ered cancer related.  
 
6.8   Survival Status  
 
Confirmation of survival status will be obtained by speaking directly with the subject on the 
telephone or in person. Death certificates will be obtained as a source document for the date and 
cause of death rec orded on the CRF.  
 
If a death certificate cannot be obtained, one or more of the following documents (in preferential 
order) will be the source document for the date and cause of death:  
 
1. SSDI/NDI (date of death only).  
2. Hospital report.  
3. Hospice report.  
4. Clinical chart note.  
5. Other medical records.

response to 10 off -target antigens which were previously identified  from  subjects in the 
sipuleucel -T arm of IMPACT  study using protein microarrays (ProtoArrays) [17]. Serum IgG 
level against each antigen will be measured usi ng Luminex xMAP.     
 
Exploration of new secondary antigens will also be performed by detecting significant IgG 
responses using  the protein microarray .     
 
At each time points  (baseline, 1st pre-leukapheresis visit  (only in Arm 1), and weeks 14 and 52 
post-first sipuleucel -T infusion) , the following research blood samples should be collected and 
processed as outlined below:  
 
• Draw approximately 10 mL of peripheral blood into 2 plain (red top) or SST (gold top) 
tubes, each containing  ≥ 5 mL of blood per vacutainer . 
• Allow blood to coagulate for 20 minutes, then centrifuge at 250C, 1500 x g (2700 -3000 
rpm), for 15 minutes.  
• Pipette the serum into 10 cryotubes (about 0.5 mL/tubs).  
• Store cryotubes frozen, at - 80 0C , until the time of ana lysis 
 
Antigen Spread analysis  will be performed in the Laboratory of Charles Drake MD/PhD at 
Johns Hopkins. Plasma pharmacokinetic samples collected at outside institutions should be 
shipped on dry ice (a minimum of 5 kg) to laboratory at Johns Hopkins, a t the address below.

sphygmomanometer and thermometer for vital signs assessments. A current and fully stocked 
advanced cardiac life support cart will be immediately available on th e premises. The clinical 
trial site will also have a refrigerated centrifuge, a monitored and alarmed refrigerator, and a 
freezer ( -20°C or below) as well as containers and dry ice for shipment of blood samples.  
 
The clinical trial site will provide all materials required for accurate documentation of subject 
visits and study activities.  
 
Materials needed for the collection of laboratory samples, including immune monitoring 
samples, will be provided by Dendreon.  
 
7.0   ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject while on study that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal la boratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the treatment, whether or not considered related to the treatment. 
Adverse events include exacerbation of a pre -existing illness, an increase in frequency or 
intensity of a pre -existing epis odic event or condition, a condition detected or diagnosed after 
product administration (even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study) or a 
continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at screening that worsen following the sta rt of 
the study.  
 
7.1   Categories for Ranking Severity of Adverse Events  
 
The NCI CTCAE [2] will be used to score AE severity. In general, the following general severity 
definitions apply:  
 
48 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 Mild (Grade 1):  The AE results in mi ld, easily tolerated symptoms, or is asymptomatic 
with clinical or diagnostic observations only. Intervention is not 
usually indicated.  
Moderate (Grade 2):  The AE produces moderate symptoms with discomfort sufficient to 
interfere with some aspect of the s ubject’s normal daily activity. 
Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is required.  
Severe (Grade 3):  The AE is medically significant but not immediately life threatening, 
results in discomfort or disability which is incapacitating and prevents 
most  normal daily activities, clearly damaging to the health, requiring 
hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization or 
complicated treatment.  
Life Threatening  
(Grade 4):  The AE could reasonably result in death unless immediate medical 
intervention is undertaken.  
Fatal (Grade 5):  The AE results in death.  
 
7.2   Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatments  
 
The following categories will be used to determine related ness of AEs to study treatments:  
 
None:  The AE is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s clinical 
state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant 
medications administered to the subject.  
Possible:  The AE follows a  reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of study treatment, but could readily have been produced by the 
subject’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of 
therapy or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
Probable:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of study treatment and cannot readily have been produced by the 
subject’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of 
therapy or concomitant medications administered to the sub ject. 
 
7.3   Adverse Events Reporting   
 
The principal investigator will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies of any SAEs occurring 
during the study period, regardless of causality. These agencies include the Sidney Kimmel 
Comprehensive Cancer Cente r (SKCCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) of the 
Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI). The representatives of Dendreon will also be 
notified. Expedit ed reporting to the PI within 24 hours is required for all SAEs (see Section 
7.4.1). For SAEs that are fatal, life -threatening, or treatment -related but non -life threatening: 
IRB/IBC reporting by the PI is required within 3 days. For unrelated SAEs, IRB/IB C reporting 
49 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 by the PI is required within 15 days. All other AEs should be documented on CRFs and 
submitted according to the standard data management guidelines.  
 
Adverse event information will be collected continuously throughout the duration of the study . 
Participants will be instructed to notify their treating provider of any new signs or symptoms, and 
providers will actively assess patients for adverse events at each visit (including by evaluation of 
laboratory studies). The investigator will assess eac h AE for its severity and for its relationship to 
the study drug, and all events Grade 1 or higher will be documented on CRFs and then reported 
as described above within the required time frame. Any AE occurring while a patient is on study 
(i.e. after info rmed consent has been signed) or within 30 days of study termination requires 
reporting. AEs occurring later than this must still be reported if a causal relationship with the 
study drug is suspected.  
 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain i nformation to adequately determine the 
causality and outcome of the event, and to assess whether it meets criteria for a SAE. In addition, 
follow -up of an AE is required until the event either resolves or stabilizes.  
 
The principal investigator must keep copies of all CRFs and other AE information, including 
correspondence with the IRB and/or FDA, for as long as required to comply with national and 
international regulations.  
 
7.4   Serious Adverse Events  
 
An SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, subject hospitalization or 
prolongation of an existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a 
congenit al anomaly/birth defect. An important medical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical o r surgical intervention  
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
 
7.4.1   Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
 
All SAEs and unknown/unexpected reactions that occur from the signing of the study-specific 
consent through the duration of the post -therapy adverse event collection  should be reported to 
the Study Coordinator , Dendreon Safety Manager , and Bayer  Global Pharmacovigilance within 
24 hours of being made aware of the SAE . If the Study Coordinator  cannot be reached within 24

7.5   Death Reports  
 
Death is an expected outcome of this study. Deaths that meet any of the following criteria must 
be reported as an SAE:  
 
• Deaths that occur within 30 days of receiving the last study treatment.  
• Deaths that are the outcome of a SAE that occurs within 30 day s from the last study 
treatment and are not due to disease recurrence.  
• Deaths that occur at any time during the study and are considered by the investigator to 
be possibly or probably related to the study treatment.

The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured on the AE CRF or SAE Report Form 
as appropriate:  
 
• Any clinically significant result that is not part of another reported clinical diagnosis.  
• Any result that meets the definition of an SAE.  
• Any result leading to study drug discontinuation or interruption.  
• Any result that required therapeutic interventio n or a change in subject management.  
 
Laboratory abnormalities not meeting the above conditions will not be reported on the AE CRF 
or SAE report form.  
 
8.0   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1   General Considerations  
 
This randomized phase 2 study is designed to test the null hypothesis of no difference in immune 
response to sipule ucel-T based on  PA2024 -stimulated T cell proliferation via tritiated -thymidine 
uptake between sipuleucel -T alone and sequential administratio n of radium -223  
 
8.2   Sample Size Determination  
 
The study is designed to test the null hypothesis of no difference  in the stimulation index (SI) 6 
weeks after the first vaccination with sipuleucel -T between sipuleucel -T alone and sequential 
administration of radium -223 and sipuleucel -T using PA2024 -stimulated T cell proliferation via 
3H-thymidine uptake  as the assay . With 15 patients per treatment group , there is 8 0% power to 
detect a 3.6 -fold increase in mean SI betwe en the sequential radium -223 and sipuleucel -T and 
sipuleucel -T alone (data from OpenACT trial) at 6 weeks after the first sipuleucel -T infusion  
[18]. These power calculations are bas ed on one -sided tests at the 0.05  level.   The calculations 
assume that SI values are lognormally distributed with the same SD in each group, namely 1.4. 
The value of 1.4 comes from the P09 -1 (OpenACT) trial.   
 
To allow for drop -outs and subjects who may not receive 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T or 4 
infusions of radium -223, 34 subjects will be enrolled.   
 
8.3   Populations for Analyses  
 
The immune response population will be defined as subjects who receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel -T and 2 infusions of radium -223. Analysis of immune response endpoi nts, including 
53 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 the primary endpoint, will be performed using this population. This population will also be used 
to perform supplementary analyses of non -immune response efficacy endpoints.  
 
The safety population will include all subjects who receive at le ast 1 leukapheresis procedure or 
receive at least 1 dose of radium -223. All safety variables (e.g., AEs, laboratory data, and vital 
sign data) will be analyzed based on the safety population.  
 
8.4   Study Termination  
 
The whole study may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator in the event of any of 
the following:  
 
• Occurrence of AEs not seen previously which by virtue of their nature, severity and 
duration are considered to necessitate study termination.  
• Hematologic adverse events criteria f or study termination  
– >2 events of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in the first 10 subjects  
– >3 events of grade ≥ 3 anemia in the first 10 subjects  
            Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study.  
• Bayer  is unable to provide radium -223 for the subject.  
• Dendreon is unable to  manufacture siptuleucel -T in > 2 of first 10 patients.  
• Difficulties in the recruitment of patients.  
 
8.5   Endpoints

• Peripheral PA2024 -specific T -cell prol iferation using a tritiated thymidine (3H-
thymidine) incorporation assay at week 6 after the first sipuleucel -T infusion in each arm 
reported as stimulation index (SI), defined as 3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence 
of PA2024 antigen divided by 3H-thymidine incorporation with media alone.   
 
8.5.2   Secondary Endpoint(s)  
 
8.5.2.1   Secondary Immune Endpoint(s)  
 
• The mean peripheral PA2024 -and PAP -specific T -cell proliferation using a 3H-thymidine

The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
  
8.6.1   Subject Disposition  
 
Subject disposition will include, but will not be limited to, the following:  
 
• Number of subjects registered .  
• Number of subjects infused.  
• Number of subjects who prematurely discontinued the study (i.e., refused further study 
assessments [with the possible exception of survival status]).  
• Reason(s) for premature discontinuation from the study.  
• Number  of subjects who died.  
• Cause of death summary.  
• Number of subjects in the immune response and safety analysis sets.  
 
In addition, the number of subjects screened for the trial will be summarized for the overall study 
population.  
 
8.6.2   Demographics an d Baseline Characteristics  
 
Demographic information and baseline disease information and characteristics will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics for all analysis populations .  
 
8.6.3   Efficacy Analyses  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the two randomized groups in terms of SI measured 
6 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel -T. We will compute the logarithms of each patient’s 
SI and use these data in a t test to compare the two groups.   
 
A secondary analysis will look at the trends in SI over time.  This analysis will consist of a 
repeated measurement analysis of immune response over time evaluated using PA2024 -
stimulated T cell proliferation via 3H-thymidine uptake based on the immune res ponse 
population. The logarithm of response will be used for analysis. Fixed -effect terms in the model 
will include treatment arm, visit as a class effect, and a treatment -by-visit interaction. The 
correlation of responses across time within a subject will  be modeled using several candidate 
variance -covariance structures including unstructured, compound symmetry, heterogeneous 
compound symmetry, autoregressive, and heterogeneous autoregressive. The variance -
covariance structure providing the smallest Bayesi an information criteria will be selected for the 
final model. Fixed -effect terms in the model will be tested for significance using type III sums of 
squares. The formal test for difference between the studies will be based on the p -value for the 
treatment effect unless we find a significant treatment -by-visit interaction (p < 0.05), in which 
case by -visit treatment comparisons will be made using appropriate contrast statements.

The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 This trial is being conducted under one or more clinical trial agreements that contain, among 
other terms, the publication policy, indemnity agreements, and financial arrangements for the 
study.  
 
10.2   Lead research program coordinators  
 
A Lead Research Program Coordinator at the SKCCC coordinating center will be assigned to the 
study. A Lead Research Program Coordinator will manage the study activities at each of the 
participating sites. The responsibilities of the Lead Research Program Coordinator include 
project compliance, data colle ction, data entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem 
resolution and prioritization, and coordination of the activities of the protocol team.  
 
10.3   Case report forms  
 
Case report forms will be generated by Staff at the Lead Site Coordinating Center at SKCCC for 
the collection of all study data. The data should be entered in a timely manner, (within 2 weeks 
of the visit). Investigators will be responsible for ensuring th at the CRFs are kept up -to-date.  
 
10.4   Source documents  
 
Study personnel will record clinical data in each patient’s source documents (ie, the patient’s 
medical record). Source documentation will be made available to support the patient research 
record. Study monitors will review entries on the CRFs at regular intervals, comparing the 
content with source documents.  
 
10.5   Study Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan (12/6/2012). The 
SKCCC Compliance Monitoring Program will provide external monitoring for JHU -affiliated  
sites in accordance with SKCCC DSMP (Version 6.0, 02/21/2019). The SMC Subcommittee will  
determine the level of patient safety risk and level/frequency of monitoring.  
The Clinical Research Office will perform an audit after the first subject has been treated and 
then periodically depending on the rate of accrual and prior audit results. All trial monitoring and 
reporting will be reviewed annually by the SKCCC Safety Moni toring Committee.  
 
The PI is responsible for internally monitoring the study. Data must be reviewed to assure the 
validity of data, as well as, the safety of the subjects. The PI will also monitor the progress of the 
trial, review safety reports, and clin ical trial efficacy endpoints and to confirm that the safety 
outcomes favor continuation of the study.”

The values for radium -223 in this protocol has been revised as per the US NIST standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 10.6   Protocol Amendments  
 
Before starting the study, the protocol must be approved by each institution’s IRB or 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). Any changes to the protocol or discontinuation of the trial 
require a written protocol amendment or statement, respectively. The Investigators  and IEC/IRB 
must approve the protocol amendment or statement. The Principal Investigator(s)  will sign the 
protocol amendment.  
 
10.7   Record retention  
 
The investigator will maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. After study closure, the 
investigator will maintain all source documents, study -related d ocuments, and the CRFs.  
 
Because the length of time required for retaining records depends upon a number of regulatory 
and legal factors, documents should be stored until the investigator is notified that the documents 
may be destroyed. In this study, rec ords are to be retained and securely stored for a minimum of 
7 years after the completion of all study activities.  
 
10.8   Publication policy  
 
Bayer recognizes the right of the investigator to publish results upon completion of the 
study.   All Investigator  Initiated studies are the property of the investigator and publications 
generated from such studies are at the discretion of the investigator. Bayer strongly encourages 
investigators to publish the results of all studies supported through the Investigator  Initiated 
Research (IIR) Program.  
As an important milestone to the IIR, we encourage all investigators to submit  a draft manuscript 
of the supporting publication(s) or abstract to submission for a courtesy review  prior to 
submission of the final version for publication or congress presentation.   This will be reviewed 
promptly and will not be withheld unreasonably.  All relevant aspects regarding data reporting 
and publication will be part of the contract between Bayer and the investigator/institution  
The P rincipal Investigator should ensure that the information regarding the study be publicly 
available on the internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov . 
 
10.8.1    Publications and NIST  
 
Bayer recommends inclu sion of the new NIST standard in abstracts/ publications submitted OR 
pending  publication January 2016 onwards  from IIRs and other non - Bayer supported 
abstracts/publications for consistency. Investigators may choose to add a footnote to the 
publication or  within the body of the publication include the new NIST standard.

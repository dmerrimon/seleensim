Project Narrative for Prospective Research  Project Title: Adjustable ankle orthosis STTR Investigator: Zachary Lerner, PhD  Project Abstract Background  CP is the most common cause of pediatric physical disability in the U.S. and worldwide [1]. Imagine a child who is unable to keep up with her friends at school and is physically and socially isolated with a level of habitual activity well below guidelines [2]. As a young adult, she develops metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, fatigue, weakness, osteoporosis, chronic pain, depression, and anxiety [3], [4]. This is the reality for many of the 500,000 children in the U.S. with cerebral palsy (CP), and the likely fate for many of the 10,000 children diagnosed with CP in the U.S. every year [5]. Current treatment does not fully address long-term gait deficits from CP [6]. Neuromuscular dysfunction caused by CP often results in pathological walking patterns [7], such as crouch gait [8]. Surgery [9], [10], anti-spastic injections [11], and physical therapy [12], can reduce severity of gait impairments, but long-term deficits typically remain [13], [14] (Fig. 1). AFOs are often prescribed as a standard of care for the majority of ambulatory children with cerebral palsy. However, current AFOs restrict undesired movements, such as plantarflexion to assist toe-clearance, but also interfere with desired movements like stance-phase plantarflexion required for push-off propulsion, often leading to toe-walking and reduced ankle power [15]. AFOs make it difficult or impossible to safely navigate graded terrain, like stairs [16].   The design of the most commonly prescribed AFOs for children with CP is ripe for change. Solid Ankle-Foot Orthoses, stiff boot-like structures that encase the foot and lower leg to prevent ankle movement, are the most commonly-prescribed AFO for CP [15]. Posterior Leaf Spring Ankle-Foot Orthoses AFOs have an ability to return energy during the gait cycle, and are often made from carbon fiber leaf springs located behind the limb. These AFOs allow for a custom stiffnesses by modifying the lever arm or the leaf spring thickness, but the stiffness is set (static) from the time of fabrication [17]. Most recently, spring-like dorsal leaf spring AFOs with differential stiffness have demonstrated an improved ability to preserve positive ankle power [18], and improve efficiency as compared to AFOs provided in usual care.  Why do we need quickly adjustable AFO stiffness? Improving mobility in the community requires adjustable ankle stiffness. Ankle joint stiffness varies considerably across different speeds and terrains, which suggests the same for optimal AFO stiffness. Unfortunately, commonly prescribed AFOs are unable to easily or quickly vary the joint stiffness; most are not able to vary stiffness at all. The result, at best, is a single AFO stiffness that is only optimized for ambulating in a single condition at a single speed. AFOs are typically too stiff for slower speeds, often even prevent children from getting off the ground, and yet also unsuitable for stair climbing, ramp ascent or descent, and running. Research has demonstrated that individually tuned stiffness is critical for maximizing improvements in walking performance in CP [19]. There is a need to create an AFO where children can change the stiffness themselves “on the fly.” Why do we need differential AFO stiffness? There may be long-term danger of locking the ankle and preventing plantarflexion during walking [20].  AFOs typically resist ankle plantar flexion by the same amount that they resist ankle dorsiflexion, resulting in a dramatic reduction in active neuromuscular engagement of the plantar flexor muscles, reduced range of motion, and minimal ankle push-off power [20]. One paper demonstrated that spring like differential stiffness preserves ankle power and work in CP, whereas a rigid configuration did not [18]. There is a need to create an AFO that allows users to maintain some ability to plantarflex at the ankle.

Project Narrative for Prospective Research Why do we need a modular design? A design that allows the calf cuffs and footplates to be customized and interchanged based on changing needs or growth has several benefits. First, it reduces waste for expensive and hard to recycle composite materials (e.g., carbon fiber). Second, it reduces the need for custom molding sessions. Third, it may allow us to reduce fabrication costs by benefiting from economies of scale when manufacturing common sizes and form factors. There is a need to create an AFO that grows with the child and adapts to their needs.   Purpose:  Our long-term goal is to establish effective therapies that restore function and improve mobility to enable increased levels of habitual physical activity for improved quality of life and longitudinal health outcomes in individuals with CP. The primary goal of this study is to validate the benefits of, and customer need for, differential and adjustable stiffness AFO features.  Our first aim is to confirm that the differential and adjustable stiffness (DAS) AFO improves plantarflexor push-off power and range of motion compared to standard (physician prescribed) AFOs during walking in CP.  Our second aim is to confirm that the differential and adjustable stiffness (DAS) AFO improves plantarflexor muscle activity while maintaining improved posture compared to standard AFOs during walking in CP.  Our third aim is to validate the need and usability of real-time stiffness adjustment during play and school activities; obtain feedback from the children, their parents, and orthotists to design the MVP.    Lay Summary:  This study seeks to determine how an adjustable stiffness ankle braces affects walking performance and biomechanics in cerebral palsy.

Non-significant risk device information. The passive ankle brace help support the use. This and other similar investigational devices have been classified by the Food and Drug Administration as a nonsignificant risk device because they do not meet the definition of significant risk under 812.3(m) of the investigational device exemption (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812 and outlined in HRP-418 Checklist: Non-Significant Risk Device). In other words, the braces:  • are not an implant; • are not supporting or sustaining life; • are not used for diagnosing/curing/mitigating/treating disease; and • do not present the potential for serious risk to health or safety.  Following 21 CFR 812.2 (as outlined in HRP-307 Worksheet: Medical Devices), our devices fit within the abbreviated IDE requirements as: • our activities are testing the safety and efficacy of the research devices; • they are nonsignificant risk devices;  • they are not banned from use by the FDA; and  • informed consent and documentation of informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Further, following the requirements for an abbreviated IDE, the investigator will follow regulations and reporting requirements as appropriate (21 CFR 812.150).

Project Narrative for Prospective Research Overview: We have developed a differential and adjustable stiffness AFO (DAS-AFO): Differential stiffnesses allows for customizing the stiffness in the plantarflexor and dorsal directions separately to maximize neuromuscular engagement and positive biological ankle power during push-off; A “real-time” stiffness adjusting slider allows for rapid and easy adjustment for different ambulatory conditions (e.g., walking, stairs, running). The primary goal of this study is to validate the benefits of, and need for, differential and adjustable stiffness AFO features. Our first aim is to confirm that the differential and adjustable stiffness AFO improves plantarflexor push-off power and range of motion compared to standard (physician prescribed) AFOs during walking in cerebral palsy (CP). Our second aim is to confirm that the differential and adjustable stiffness AFO improves plantarflexor muscle activity while maintaining improved posture compared to standard AFOs during walking in CP. Our third aim is to validate the need and usability for real-time stiffness adjustment during play and school activities; obtain feedback from the children and their parents.   Experimental Protocol for Aim 1 and 2: Participants will complete two 30-minute practice sessions, and a final assessment. On the final assessment, participants will walk on an instrumented treadmill for 6 minutes with their normal AFOs and with the DAS-AFO tuned to provide just enough dorsiflexor assistance to address drop foot (if present). Testing order will be block randomized. Treadmill speed will be set to each participant’s preference, as will the stance phase plantarflexor stiffness for the DAS-AFO.   Experimental Protocol for Aim 3: Participants will complete a series of play and school activities using the DAS-AFO and their normal AFOs; order will be block randomized. During the DAS-AFO condition, participants will be instructed to adjust stiffness using the simple slider as desired. Activities will include a series of floor-seated, chair-seated, standing, walking, and running (if applicable) tasks to capture the breadth of possible movements encountered during a typical school day. We will use video recording to observe and characterize interactions. These sessions will be followed by dedicated discussion time and validated product evaluation/usability questionnaires.   Outcome Measures: The following experimental data may be collected under each experimental protocol: • Electromyography • Ground reaction forces • Motion capture marker trajectories  • Metabolic cost of transport • Pictorial pediatric exertion scale • System Usability Scale questionnaire • Video recordings  Recruitment: We will recruit people from our network of individuals/families of a child with CP and from PT clinics and hospitals across the state of Arizona.

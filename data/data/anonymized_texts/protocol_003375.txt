patients.   
Diagnosis  and Main  
Inclusion  Criteria  Healthy adults  ages 18-50 years  with non-osteoporotic  
femoral or tibial shaft  fracture s who are treated  with 
intramedullary  fixation  will be enrolled . Only  acute  fractures  
will be eligible.  
Treatment  Groups  and 
Study  Products  Each  participant  will be randomized  to 1 of 4 treatment  
groups:  1) 150,000  IU loading  dose vitamin  D3 plus daily  dose 
placebo;  2) loading  dose placebo  plus 4,000  IU vitamin  D3 per 
day; 3) loading  dose placebo  plus 600 IU vitamin  D3 per day; 
or 4) loading  dose placebo  plus daily  dose placebo . All doses  
of vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be provided  in a 
blinded  manner.  The daily  treatment  will commence  within  1 
week  of injury  and will be taken  for 3 months.   The loading  
dose vitamin  D3 supplements/ placebo  will be given  within 1 
week  of injury and at 6 weeks  post-injury.  All doses  of vitamin  
D3 and the placebo  will be obtained  from  Bio-Tech  Pharmacal,  
Inc. (Fayetteville,  AK).

terminal  telopeptides  of type I collage n (CTX)  and amino -
terminal  procollagen  propeptides  of collagen  type I (PINP).   
 
The secondary  outcome  will be assessed  by measuring  
25(OH)D  serum  levels .  Correlations  will be assessed  between  
participants ’ 25(OH)D  levels  at enrolment , changes  in 
25(OH)D  levels  from  enrolment  to 3 months,  and 25(OH)D  
levels  at 3 months  and fracture  healing  as described  above . 
 
The other  secondary  outcomes  will include  assessing  
supplementation  adherence  between  daily  and loading  doses,  
confirming  participant  safety  as measured  by adverse  events  
(AEs ) and serum  levels  of calcium  and parathyroid  hormone  
(PTH),  and assessing  protocol  adherence  (e.g. completion  of 
outcome  assessment  and participant  follow -up). 
Sample  Size 96 patients  will be included.

Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
Vitamin  D supplements  are increasingly  being  recommended  to healthy  adult  fracture  
patients  without  an osteoporotic  injury .1 Although  this is a relatively  new practice  pattern,  
the basis  for this adjunct  therapy  is grounded  in the high hypovitaminosis  D prevalence  
rates  (up to 75%)  among  healthy  adult  fracture  patients,1 and the strong  biologic  rationale  
for the role of vitamin  D in fracture  healing.2–6  Briefly,  expe rimental  animal  studies  have  
demonstrated  that the concentration  of vitamin  D metabolites  is higher  at a fracture  callus  
compared  to the uninjured  contralateral  bone,3–5 vitamin  D supplementatio n leads  to 
decreased  time to union  and increased  callus  vascularity,2 and increases  mechanical  bone  
strength  compared  to controls.6 While  evidence  to confirm  that vitamin  D supplementation  
improves  fracture  healing  in clinical  studies  does not exist,  the pre-clinical  data are 
compelling  and worthy  of further  investigation.  
 
With  modern  orthopaedic  surgical  care,  rates  of complications  following  tibia and femoral  
shaft  fractures  can be as high as 15%.  Complications,  including  delayed  union,  nonunion,  
or infection  often  require  secondary  surgical  procedures7–9 and result  in profound  personal  
and societal  economic  costs.10–12 While  surgeons  continue  to seek advances  in surgical  
technique,  it is becoming  increasingly  obvious  that innovations  in orthopaedic  techniques  
or implants  are unlikely  to eliminate  complications.13 As a result,  considerable  attention  is 
currently  focused  on adjunct  biologic  therapies,  such as vitamin  D.14–16  
 
A recent  survey  of 397 orthopaedic  surgeons  showed  that only 26% routinely  prescribe  
vitamin  D supplementation  to adult  fracture  patients.17 Of the 93 surgeons  who indicated  
that they routinely  prescribe  vitamin  D supplementation,  29 different  dosing  regimens  were  
described  ranging  from  low daily  doses  of 400 IU to loading doses  of 600,000  IU.17 This 
suggests  a high level  of clinical  uncertainty  surrounding  the use and optimal  dose of 
vitamin  D supplementation  in adult  fracture  patients.  If vitamin  D supplementation  
improves  fracture  healing  outcomes,  then there  is a large  opportunity  to increase  its use; 
however,  before  widespread  adoption  occurs,  research  is needed  to optimize  the dosing  
strategy,  establish  the dosing  safety  in the immobili zed fracture  healing  population,  and 
overcome  potential  medication  adherence  issues  among  the often -marginalized  patients  
that suffer  trauma.  
 
The long-term goal of our research  program  is to conduct  a large  phase  III RCT  to 
determine  which  dose of vitamin  D3 supplementation  optimally  improves  acute  fracture  
healing  outcomes  in healthy  adult  patients  (18-50 years).  The current  proposed  phase  II 
exploratory  trial will perform  important  preliminary  work  to test the central  hypothesis  that 
vitamin  D3 dose and timing  of administration  is critical  for improving  fracture  healing  at 3 
months . This trial will also inform  the feasibility  of the large  phase  III RCT . This trial is 
registered  at clinicaltrials.gov  (Identifier  number:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  2.0 STUDY  AIMS  AND  OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary  Aim 
The primary  aim is to assess  the effect  of vitamin  D3 supplementation  on fracture  healing  
at 3 months .  Fracture  healing  will be assessed  as follows : 1) clinical  fracture  healing  will 
be measured  using  the Function  IndeX for Trauma  (FIX -IT),18 2) radiographic  fracture  
healing  will be measured  using  the Radiographic  Union  Score  for Tibial  fractures  
(RUST),19–22 and 3) biological  fracture  healing  will be measured  using  serum  levels  of 
cross -linked  C-terminal  telopeptides  of type I collagen  (CTX)  and amino -terminal  
procollagen  propeptides  of collagen  type I (PINP).23  
 
2.2 Secondary  Aim 
The secondary  aim is to determine  if 25(OH)D  serum  levels  are associated  with fracture  
healing  at 3 months . 
 
2.3 Othe r Secondary  Objective  
The other  secondary  objective  is to confirm  study  protocol  feasibility  for a larger  definitive  
phase III efficacy  RCT  to determine  the optimal  vitamin  D3 dosing  regimen  to reduce  re-
operations  for fracture  healing  complications  in healthy  adult  patients.   
 
2.4 Hypotheses  for the Primary  and Secondary  Objectives  
Primary  Objective:  Lower  extremity  shaft  fractures  heal via callus  formation  and 
secondary  bone  healing.  This seminal  process  begins  within  a few weeks  of injury  and 
vitamin  D metabolites  have  been extensively  implicated  in this stage  of healing.  During  
these  early  weeks,  circulating  vitamin  D levels  are most  likely  to be critical  to bone  healing;  
therefore,  we hypothesize:   
1) High  doses  (loading  or daily)  will increase  healing  compared  to low daily  dose. Using  
high doses  will rapidly  increase  the circulating  vitamin  D available  during  fracture  
callus  formation.   
2) High  loading  dose increases  healing  comp ared to high daily  dose.  Loading  doses  will 
overcome  medication  adherence  issues  and increase  circulating  vitamin  D even  more  
rapidly  than daily  doses.   
3) Low daily  dose will increase  healing  compared  to placebo . While  the low daily  dose is 
not expected  to increase  circulating  vitamin  D as rapidly  as the high dose strategies,  
this comparison  will determine  if rapid  serum  increases  are necessary  to improve  
fracture  healing.   
 
Secondary  Objective:  Based  on experimental  data and the role of vitamin  D on bone  
metabolism,  a correlation  between  circulating  vitamin  D levels  and fracture  healing  is 
expected;  however,  the efficacy  of various  supplementation  strategies  may be dependent  
on the patient’s  baseline  vitamin  D status  or other  related  changes.  For example,  it is known  
that the dose response  of supplementation  varies  depending  on the patient’s  serum  
25(OH)D  levels , with larger  increases  seen in patients  with serum  levels  <20ng/ml .

Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  3.0 METHODS  
 
3.1 Study  Setting  
This study  will be coordinated  jointly  by the University  of Maryland,  R Adams  Cowley  
Shock  Trauma  Center  (STC),  Baltimore , MD and McMaster  University,  Center  for 
Evidence -Based  Orthopaedics  (CEO),  Hamilton,  ON. Patients  will be enrolled  from  the 
STC. The CEO will be responsible  for the protocol,  data management , and data analysis.    
 
3.2 Eligibility  Criteria  
The inclusion  criteria  are: 1) adult  men or women  ages 18-50 years;  2) closed  or low grade  
open  (Gustilo  type I or II) tibial or femoral  shaft  fracture ;24 3) fracture  treated  with a 
reamed,  locked,  intramedullary  nail; 4) acute  fracture  (enrolled  within  7 days of injury);  
and 5) provision  of informed  consent.  Fifty  years  was selected  as the upper  age limit to 
minimize  potential  confounding  with post-menopausal  endocrine  changes  that affect  bone  
metabolism.  For the purposes  of the study,  femoral  shaft  fractures  will be defined  as any 
injury  in which  the majority  of fracture  line is distal  to the lesser  trochanter  and proximal  
to the distal  metaphyseal  flare of the femoral  condyles  (Figure  1). Intertochanteric  
extension  or distal  articular  extension  is permitted.  Similarly,  a tibial  shaft  fractur e will be 
defined  as an injury  with a primary  fracture  line between  the proximal  meta -diaphyseal  
flare to the distal  metaphyseal  region  ending  one joint width  proximal  to the tibial  plafond  
(Figure  2). Intra -articular  extension  is permitted.  
 
The exclusion  criteria  are: 1) osteoporosis;  2) stress  fractures;  3) elevated  serum  calcium  
(>10.5  mg/dL);  4) atypical  femur  fractures  as defined  by American  Society  for Bone  and 
Mineral  Research  (ASBMR)  criteria;25 5) pathological  fractures  secondary  to neoplasm  or 
other  bone  lesion;  6) patients  with known  or likely  undiagnosed  disorders  of bone  
metabolism  such as Paget’s  disease,  osteomalacia,  osteopetrosis,  osteogenesis  imperfecta  
etc.; 7) patients  with hyperhomocysteinemia;  8) patients  with an allergy  to vitamin  D or 
another  contraindication  to being  prescribed  vitamin  D; 9) patients  currently  taking  an over 
the counter  multivitamin  that contains  vitamin  D and are unable  or unwilling  to discontinue  
its use for this study;  10) patients  who will likely  have  problems,  in the judgment  of the 
investigators , with maintaining  follow -up; 11) pregnancy;  12) patients  who are 
incarc erated;  13) patients  who are not expected  to survive  their injuries;  and 14) other  lower  
extremity  injuries  that prevent  bilateral  full weight -bearing  by 6 weeks  post-fracture.  
 
Patients  with multiple  injuries  or multiple  tibial  and femoral  shaft  fractures  will be eligible  
for inclusion;  however,  only the most  severe  eligible  fracture  will be included  (as 
determined  by the treating  surgeon  using  the grade  of soft tissue  injury  using  the Tscherne  
classification  system  for closed  fractures26 and the Gustilo  classification  system  for open  
fractures).24    
 
3.3 Recruitment  Strategy  and Patient  Screening  
All patients  presenting  to participating  surgeons  between  the ages of 18 to 50 years  with a 
tibial  or femoral  shaft  fracture  will be screened.  Potentially  eligible  patients  will be 
approach ed to participate  in the trial. All screened  patients  will be classified  as included  or 
exclud ed.  
Page  10 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018   
3.4 Randomization  Methods   
Each  participant  will be randomized  to 1 of 4 treatment  groups:  1) 150,000  IU loading  dose 
vitamin  D3 plus daily  dose placebo;  2) loading  dose placebo  plus 4,000  IU vitamin  D3 per 
day; 3) loading  dose placebo  plus 600 IU vitamin  D3 per day; or 4) loading  dose placebo  
plus daily  dose placebo . The daily  vitamin  D3 supplements/ placebo  will be provided  in a 
blinded  manner . The daily  treatment  will commence  within  1 week  of injury  and will be 
taken  for 3 months .  The loading  dose vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be given  within  
1 week  of injury  and at 6 weeks  (+/- 2 week s) post-injury.   
 
Allocation  to the 4 study  groups  will be concealed  using  a centralized  24-hour 
computerized  randomization  system  that will allow  internet -based  allocation.  The 
treatment  allocation  will be stratified  on the following  prognostic  factors  to ensure  balance  
between  the intervention  groups:  fracture  type (closed  vs. open)  and long bone  fracture  
(tibia  vs. femur) . 
 
3.5 Vitamin  D3 (Cholecalciferol)  Treatment  Groups  
3.5.1  Blinded  administration   
The loading  dose of 150,00 0 IU will consist  of 3 50,000  IU capsules  of vitamin  D3.  The 
loading  dose placebo  will consist  of 3 capsules  that are identical  to the 50,000  IU capsules  
with no active  ingredient . The loading  dose vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be given  
within 1 week  of injury  and at 6 weeks  (+/- 2weeks)  post-injury  while  in hospital  or at the 
outpatient  fracture  clinic .  
 
The daily  vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be provided  in a blinded  manner  and the 
daily  treatment  will commence  within  1 week  of injury.   The daily  doses  (4,000  IU, 600 
IU, and placebo)  will be identical  and will be comprised  of one capsule .  Patients  will be 
given  a bottle  of either  active  vitamin  D3 or placebo  capsules  and will be instructed  to take 
one capsule  daily  for 3 months.  The placebo  capsules  will have no active  ingredients  and 
will be identi cal to the vitamin  D capsules.  To measure  supplementation  adherence,  
participants  will be asked  to bring their bottles  to their follow -up visits.  At the 3-month  
visit,  participants  will return  their bottle  to the clinical  research  coordinator .  If the 
participant  does not return  the bottle,  the clinical  research  coordinator  will provide  them  
with an enve lope to return  it via mail.   
 
All doses  of vitamin  D and placebo  will be obtained  from  Bio-Tech  Pharmacal,  Inc. 
(Fayetteville,  AK).  The unblinding  protocol  can be found  in Figure  3. Following  the 
completion  of the study,  participants  may be unblinded  their treatment  group  upon  request.   
 
3.5.2  Vitamin  D3 dose rationale  
The doses  selected  are based  on biologic  rationale,  current  practice  patterns,  and existing  
guidelines.  The goal of the high dose arms  is to rapidly  increase  circulating  vitamin  D and 
serum  25(OH)D  during  the early  callus  fracture  healing  periods.  Conversely,  while  the low 
daily  dose is not expected  to increase  circulating  vitamin  D as quickly  as the high dose 
strategies,  this treatment  arm will determine  if rapid  serum  increases  are necessary  to 
improve  fracture  healing.  Finally,  the placebo  control  arm is needed  to demonstrate  the 
Page  11 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  relative  efficacy  of each treatment  arm and is also necessary  to represent  current  practice  
at most  trauma  centers  in North  America.   
• High  loading  dose:  150,0 00 IU D3 loading  doses  can be administered  easily  with three  
50,000  IU D3 pills.  We expect  this dose to increase  circulating  vitamin  D levels  the 
fastest.  While  we acknowledge  that many  non-orthopaedic  clinicians  may prefer  more  
frequent  large  doses,  such as 50,000  IU weekly,  our loading  dose strategy  has been  
chosen  to corresp ond with the standard  post-operative  clinical  follow -up schedule.  This 
is important  for generalizability  and is likely  to overcome  potential  supplementation  
adherence  issues  within  the adult  fracture  population  that is often  predominantly  lower  
socioeconom ic patients.  This high loading  dose is also in the mid-range  of other  
previous  large  loading  doses  used safely  in fracture  patients  and is similar  to the total 
cumulative  3-month  dose of our high daily  dose group.   
• High  daily  dose:  4,000  IU D3 represents  an alternative  high dose strategy  and it 
corresponds  to the tolerable  upper  daily  intake  level  suggested  by the Institute  of 
Medicine  (IOM).27 While  this is the IOM’s  upper  limit, the Endocrine  Society  has 
recommended  adults  can safely  take up to 10,000  IU per day,28 further  suggesting  that 
our 4,000  IU dose should  be well-tolerated.   
• Low daily  dose:  600 IU D3 is a common  dose and approved  indication  for maintaining  
general  bone  health.  600 IU is also the IOM’s  Recommended  Dietary  Allowance  for 
all individuals  ages 1-70 years.27 This represents  our most  conservative  
supplementation  strategy,  but its use is common  among  surgeons  prescribing  vitamin  
D and previous  studies  have shown  its efficacy  for increasing  serum  25(OH)D  levels.  
• Placebo:  Finally,  we are including  a placebo  group  because  it is important  to include  
placebo -controlled  comparisons  to our active  supplements  during  this exploratory  
phase  of research.  Not only does placebo  reflect  our usual clinical  practice  of no 
supplementation,  this Phase  II comparison  will define  our rationale  and selection  of the 
control  group  for the definitive  trial. If there  are no preliminary  efficacy  differences  
between  low dose supplementation  and placebo,  then the low dose supplement  could  
be used as the control  group  in the Phase  III trial. This would  obviate  potential  
criticisms  for performing  a Phase  III placebo -controlled  trial in a population  with a high 
prevalence  of hypovitaminosis  D. Given  the small  numbe r of patients  receiving  placebo  
(n=24),  the Phase  II screening  design  of this trial, and the fact that receiving  placebo  
does not represent  an increased  risk of study  participation  since  it is our standard  
clinical  practice,  we do not believe  this poses  an ethical  concern.  We have used a similar  
rationale  to explain  the placebo  blinding  in the FAITH -2 pilot trial and this has been  
accepted  at over 20 research  ethics  boards,  with no clinical  site disallowing  the 
protocol.  
 
3.5.3  Storage  and administration  
As per the standard  operating  procedures  at the STC,  the study  supplements /placebo  will 
be stored  at room  temperature  in accordance  with the manufacturer’s  recommendations.  
The research  personnel  will maintain  an inventory  and temperature  log to ensure  the 
integrity  of the supplements.  Study  supplementation  will begin  within  1 week  of injury,  
and it is expected  that the research  personnel  will provide  the supplementation  to the 
participant  upon  discharge  from  the hospital.  Therefore,  the hospital  pharmacy  will not be 
used to administer  this out-patient,  over-the-counter  medication.  The research  personnel  
Page  12 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  have  previous  experience  administering  vitamin  D supplements /placebo  to study  patients  
at the recruiting  hospital,  the STC. 
 
3.5.4  Potential  adverse  events  associated  with vitamin  D 
A recent  systematic  review  comprehensively  examined  the effectiveness  and safety  of 
vitamin  D supplementation  among  all ages of adult  fracture  patients.27 The majority  of 
research  has been  performed  in elderly  fracture  populations;  however,  the safety  of a wide  
range  of doses  is well established.  Studi es with doses  of 4,000  IU daily  and loading  doses  
from  50,000  IU for up to 7 days or single  loading  doses  up to 500,000  IU have been  used 
without  complication.29  
 
Since  vitamin  D regulates  PTH  and serum  calcium  levels,  it is theoretically  possible  that 
vitamin  D supplementation  could  lead to hypercalcemia.  Of the 1,088  patients  included  in 
the systematic  review,  4 cases  of hypercalcemia  were  reported  (0.4%).30 Furthermore,  there  
have  been  no cases  of hypercalcemia  in several  high loading  dose clinical  trials.  
Regardless,  we will monitor  serum  calciu m levels  at enrolment,  6 weeks,  and 3 months  
post-fracture,  and clinical  signs  of hypercalcemia  will be sought  at all clinical  encounters.  
If hypercalcemia  is identified,  participants  will be instructed  to stop their vitamin  D 
supplementation  immediately  and the hypercalcemia  will be treated  as indicated.  
 
Finally,  we will monitor  for increased  falls among  the study  participants.  While  we do not 
expect  to observe  this adverse  event  (AE) in our 18 to 50 year-old adult  population,  a recent  
study  of 200 elderl y fracture  patients  found  that a 60,000  IU monthly  loading  dose and 
24,000  IU monthly  loading  dose plus 300 µg of calcifediol  were  associated  with increased  
falls compared  to the control  group.31 This single  study  contradicts  several  other  high 
loading  dose clinical  trials,  and these  concerns  have not been  borne  out of the healthy  adult  
fracture  population.  This may be a result  of the fact that supplementation  in the non-
osteoporotic  fracture  population  has not been extensively  studied  (highlighting  the need for 
the proposed  research),  or because  these  concerns  regarding  the risk of falls do not apply  
to healthy  adults  without  osteoporosis.   
 
3.5.5  Concomitant  calcium  supplementation  
In addition,  although  calcium  supplementation  is often  recommended  concomitantly  with 
vitamin  D for osteoporosis  prevention,  for our non-osteoporotic  study  population  the 
necessity  of calcium  supplementation  is controversial  and will not be provided  because  of 
the increased  risk of kidney  stones,  hypercalcemia,  and potential  confounding.  This 
rationale  has also been outlined  by other  researchers  performing  RCTs  involving  vitamin  
D supplementation.  
 
3.6 Surgical  Technique  and Post-Operative  Rehabilitation  
3.6.1  Surgical  technique  
The study  protocol  will not dictate  the surgical  technique.  Based  on the study’s  eligibility  
criteria,  all participants  must  receive  a reamed,  locked,  intramedullary  nail for their tibial  
or femoral  shaft  fracture.  The number  and orientation  of locking  screws is at the discretion  
of the treating  surgeon , as there  have been  no studies  that demonstrate  clinical  superiority  
Page  13 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  of any locking  screw  strategy . Any concomitant  fracture  lines that extend  into the adjacent  
articular  areas  may be treated  with additional  fixation  as indicated.  
 
3.6.2  Post-operative  rehabilitation  
Full weight -bearing  as tolerated  is recommended  for all isolated  tibial  and femoral  shaft  
fractures.  In the presence  of additional  lower  extremity  fractures,  intra-articular  extension,  
or other  concomitant  soft tissue  injuries,  participants  may be restrict ed to protected  weight -
bearing  (partial or no weight)  for up to 6 weeks  post-fracture.  If additional  contralateral  
injuries  are present,  both limbs  must  be eligible  for full weight -bearing  by 6 weeks  post-
fracture.  
 
3.7 Primary  and Secondary  Outcome  Measur es 
3.7.1  Primary  outcome  
Fracture  healing  will be assessed  as follows : 1) clinical  fracture  healing  will be measured  
using  FIX-IT, 2) radiographic  fracture  healing  will be measured  using  the RUST,  and 3) 
biological  fracture  healing  will be measured  using  serum  levels  of CTX  and PINP.  
 
Clinical  Healing:  FIX-IT is a standardized  measure  of weight -bearing  and pain in patients  
with lower  extremity  fractures,  specifically  tibia and femur  fractures.18 Prelimina ry 
validation  of the FIX-IT has demonstrated  high inter-rater agreement  and moderate  
correlation  with the physical  scores  of the Short  Form -36.18 It has been  used in other  studies  
to assess  clinical  fracture  healing.  
 
Radiographic  Healing : The RUST  score  assesses  the presence  of bridging  callus  or a 
persistent  fracture  line on each of 4 cortices.19–22 This score  has been  previously  validated  
and found  to have greater  inter-rater reliability  when  compared  with surgeons’  general  
impression  of the cortical  bridging .19–22 RUST  has been  widely  used to assess  radiographic  
fracture  healing.19–22 An orthopaedic  surgeon  who is independent  of the study  will review  
the images  and assign  a RUST  score.  
 
Biological  Healing:  CTX  is a bone -resorption  marker  and previous  research  has found  that 
it rises 1 week  after fracture  of the tibial  shaft  and remains  elevated  throughout  fracture  
healing.23 PINP  is a bone -formation  marker  and prior  research  has found  that it is highest  
at 12 weeks  after fractures  of the tibial  shaft  and proximal  femur.32  
 
The primary  time point  for assessing  fracture  healing  will be at 3 months  post-injury.  This 
time point  was selected  because  it coincides  within  the standard  clinical  follow -up 
schedule,  and because  it has the greatest  potential  to detect  differences  in short -term 
fracture  healing.  While  we expect  the 1-year fracture  union  rate to be approximately  95% 
for the femur  fractures32 and 75% for the tibia fractures  (unpublished  data from  the SPRINT  
trial),7 improved  early  fracture  healing is biologically  plausible.  The median  time to 
fracture  union  for tibia fractures  is 4 months;  therefore,  many  patients  are still experiencing  
morbi dity from  their injury  at the 3-month  visit and decreasing  the time to union  would  be 
an important  patient  benefit.   
Page  14 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  3.7.2  Secondary  outcome  
The secondary  outcome  will be assessed  by measuring  25(OH)D  serum  levels.   
Correlations  will be assessed  between  participants ’ 25(OH)D  levels  at enrolment,  changes  
in 25(OH)D  levels  from  enrolment  to 3 months,  and 25(OH)D  levels  at 3 months  and 
fracture  healing  as described  above.  
 
3.7.3  Other  secondary  outcomes  
The other  secondary  outcomes  will include  assessing  supplementation  adherence  between  
daily  and loading  doses,  confirming  participant  safety  as measured  by AEs and serum  
levels  of calcium  and parathyroid  hormone  (PTH),  and assessing  protocol  adherence  (e.g. 
completion  of outcome  assessment  and participant  follow -up). 
 
Adherence  with vitamin  D supplementation  will be assessed  by participant  self-report,  by 
counting  the tablets  for the daily  doses  at each follow -up, and by direct  observation  for the 
loading  doses.  
 
Participant  safety  will be assessed  by AEs,  defined  as any symptom,  sign,  illness,  or 
experience  that develops  or worsens  in severity  during  the course  of this study .  Within  the 
AEs collected,  fracture  healing  complications  will be identified,  and will include  nonunion  
(defined  as failure  of the fracture  to progress  towards  healing  for 2 consecutive  months  
and at least 6 months  post-fracture),  delayed  union  (defined  as a failure  of progression  of 
fracture  healin g beyond  the expected  median  healing  time of 4 months  with pain at the 
fracture  site),  hardware  failure  (defined  as broken  or bent nail or locking  screw),33 wound  
healing problems  (previously  published  criteria  by Anglen  2005),  and infection  (superficial  
and deep  as defined  by Centers  for Disease  Control  and Prevention  (CDC)  criteria).  Wound  
healing  problems  and infection  are a part of the composite  fracture  healing  complication  
outcome  because  previous  animal  and infectious  disease  clinical  research  has suggested  
that vitamin  D can improve  wound  healing and reduce  infections.34–37 In addition  to AEs,  
serum levels  of calcium  and PTH  will be monitored  and we will record  results  of the 
participants’  pre-operative  metabolic  profile.  These  data will be used to understand  the 
baseline  metabolic  health  of the participants  and will be used as needed  in the event  of 
suspected  AEs.   
 
Participant  adherence  with the protocol  will be assessed  by monitoring  the completion  of 
outcome  measures , including  clinic  assessments  (FIX -IT), radiographs  (RUST),  and blood  
work  (CTX,  PINP,  25(OH)D,  calcium,  and PTH) , documentation  of AEs and re-operations,  
and completion  of follow -up to 12 months.    
 
3.7.4 Data  collection  and participant  follow -up 
Upon  providing  informed  consent,  baseline  demographics  will be collected  from  the patient  
and from  their medical  chart  (Table 1). This includes  demographic,  medical  history,  pre-
operative  blood  work -up details  (e.g. kidney  and liver function  tests,  calcium,  phosphate,  
and albumin),  injury  details,  fracture  characteristics,  details  on the surgical  management  of 
their fracture , and rehabilitation  details . Participants  will have blood  drawn  within  the 
fracture  clinic  that will be analyzed  for calcium  levels  and for CTX,  PINP,  25(OH)D,  and 
Page  15 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  PTH  (See Section  3.7.5) .  Post-operative  x-rays will be taken  as per standard  of care (See 
Section  3.7.6).   
 
Participants  will be followed  at standard  clinical  visit intervals  for 12 months  post-injury  
including  6 week s, 3 months,  6 months,  9 months,  and 12 months.   The Schedule  of Events  
(Table  1) details  the requirements  and procedures  for each visit.   Participants  will have  
blood  drawn  within  the fracture  clinic  that will be analyzed  for calcium , CTX,  PINP,  
25(OH)D,  and PTH  serum  levels  at 6 weeks  and 3 months  (See Section  3.7.5).   Post-
operativ e x-rays will be taken  as per standard  of care at each follow -up visit (See Section  
3.7.6).   Participants  will be assessed  clinically  for FIX-IT at each visit.  All study  outcomes  
(as defined  above)  will be documented  on the case report  forms  (CRFs)  at each follow -up 
visit.  A 12-month  follow -up was selected  because  is a standard  follow -up period  for 
patients  with tibial  and femoral  shaft  fractures  and it is a commonly  used follow -up period  
for similar  fracture  trials.7,38 In addition,  it is a commonly  referenced  time period  for 
fracture  healing  complications  requiring  reoperation,  and will further  inform  decision s 
surrounding  the larger,  definitive  phase  III RCT.   
 
3.7.5  Analysis  of blood  samples  
Serum  calcium  testing  will be performed  by the hospital  laboratory  and will be part of the 
unblinded  medical  chart  for patient  safety.  The remainder  of serum  samples  (PTH , 
25(OH)D,  PINP,  CTX)  will be analyzed  in a blinded  manner  at the end of the study.  
Laboratory  personnel  at the University  of Maryland’s  Muscle  Research  Laboratory  will 
process  the samples  for storage  in the -80 C freezer . Upon  completion  of all blood  work  
for the study,  the serum  samples  will be transferred  to the Institute  for Clini cal and 
Translational  Research  Clinical  Research  Unit Core  Laboratory  to be analyzed  as a single  
batch  to eliminate  inter-batch  assay  variability.   The results  of the analy ses will be sent to 
the CEO  to be added  to the REDCap  study  database  and included  within  the final data 
analysis.  The treating  surgeon  will remain  blinded  to these  results.  Participants  may request  
the results  of their blood  analysis  at the end of the study.  
 
3.7.6  Analysis  of radiographs  
The radiographs  will be stored  in the STC Picture  Archiving  and Communication  System  
(PACS)  at the STC and then sent to the CEO  for the review  of radiographic  fracture  healing  
(RUST)  by an independent  practicing  orthopaedic  surgeon.   
 
3.8 Participant  Retention  
Once  a participant  is enrolled  in the trial, every  reasonable  effort  will be made  to follow  
the participant  for the entire  duration  of the study  period.   The expected  follow -up rate for 
this study  is greater  than 90% based  on similar  fracture  trials.7,38–40 To maximize  participant  
retention,  all possible  attempts  should  be made  to collect  as much  data as possible  and to 
reduce  loss to follow -up. We have  implemented  procedures  to improve  participant  
retention  (Figure  4).41   
 
We will only deem  participants  lost to follow -up after all exhaustive  measures  have been  
taken  to locate  the participant.  Participants  should  not be deemed  lost to follow -up until the 
12-month  visit is due and all attempts  to contact  the participant  have  been exhausted.  
Page  16 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  We will not remove  participants  from  the study  if the study  protocol  was not adhered  to 
(e.g. participant  received  wrong  treatment  arm, early  discontinuation  of supplement s, 
occurrence  of protocol  deviations,  missed  follow -up visits,  etc.).  We will document  the 
reasons  for participant  withdrawal  from  the trial (e.g. withdrawal  of consent  or lost to 
follow -up). 
 
4.0 STATISTICAL  PLAN   
 
4.1 Sample  Size Determination  
This trial will use a phase  II randomized  screening  design  to facilitate  non-definitive  
comparisons  of three  vitamin  D3 dosing  regimens.  Using  the principles  outlined  by 
Rubinstein  et al, the statistical  parameters  have been carefully  chosen  to ensure  a 
reasonable  sample  size and meaningful  results.42 Consistent  with previous  
recommendations,  an  and  of 0.20 was chosen  with a target  mean  difference  of 17-20%,  
depending  on the fracture  healing  measure.  There  will be no adjustments  for multiple  
testing  given  the exploratory  nature  of the study  design.  
 
Based  on the original  instrument  development  and validation  in tibia and femur  fracture  
patients,  it is expected  that the low dose and control  groups  will have  a mean  3-month  FIX-
IT score  of 8 (standard  deviation  (SD) 3).18 Assuming  the high dose groups  will achieve  a 
mean  2 point  increase  (17%  mean  difference),  21 patients  are required  in each group.  The 
same  sample  size requirements  will be applied  for comparisons  using  the RUST  instrument  
based  on similar  assumptions  and recent  literature  (2 point  mean  difference,  8 vs. 6, SD 
3).19–22 Clinically  important  changes  in the PINP  and CTX  markers  are unknown;  however,  
in a previous  study  of tibia fracture  healing,  Veitch  et al observed  concentrations  of both 
bone  turnover  markers  approximately  100%  greater  than baseline  values.43 Given the large  
changes  observed  in these  bone  turnover  markers , the same  criteria  will be applied  for 
identifying  a potentially  clinically  beneficial  regimen  and remain  powered  to detect  a mean  
difference  of 20% (SD 30%).  Finally,  the sample  size will be increased  to account  for a 
10% loss to follow -up, for a total enrolment  of 24 patients  per allocation  group  (96 total).  
 
4.2 Statistical  Methods  
All outcome  analyses  will be exploratory  and adhere  to the intention -to-treat principle.   As 
treated  sensitivity  analyses  will also be conducted.  
 
4.2.1  Specific  Aim  
Each  measure  of fracture  healing  will be described  with its mean  and SD. For our primary  
analysis , comparisons  for the 3 hypotheses  (Section  2.4) will be made  using  an independen t 
t-test and significance  set at =0.20 (Table  2). Hypothesis  1 compares  high dose 
supplementation  versus  low dose.  To test this hypothesis,  we will combine  the two high 
dose groups  (loading  and daily)  for a 2:1 comparison  against  the low daily  dose group.  All 
other  comparisons  will be 1:1 based  on the treatment  groups  outlined.  
 
4.2.2  Secondary  Aim 
To test the hypotheses  of the Secondary  Aim,  univariate  analyse s will be used to explore  
associations  between  3-month  fracture  healing  and 3 assessments  of serum  25(OH)D  
Page  17 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  levels : enrolment,  3 months,  and change  in levels  between  enrolment  and 3 months.  
Significance  will be set at =0.20 . Additional  descriptive  analyses  will be performed  for 
serum  25(OH)D  at each time point  (Table  3).  
 
4.2.3  Other  Secondary  Outcomes  
All other  secondary  outcomes  will be presented  using  point  estimates  and appropriate  
measures  of variance  to describe  supplementation  adherence,  participant  safety,  and key 
aspects  of participant  complianc e with the protocol  (Table  4). Supplement  adherence  will 
be summarize d using  means  and 95% confidence  intervals  for participant  self-reporting  
and the mean  cumulative  dose taken  at 3 months.  The incidence  of AEs and re-operations  
for fracture  healing  compl ications  in each group  will be described  with counts  and 
proportions.  Serum  levels  of calcium  and PTH  will be summarized  using  means  and 95% 
CIs. Participant  compliance  with the protocol  will be summarized  descriptively  with counts  
and proportions.  
 
4.2.4  As Treated  Sensitivity  Analyses  
The specific  aim and the relevant  other  secondary  outcome  analyses  will be repeated  
following  as-treated  analyses.  These  sensitivity  analyses  will be completed  after the above  
outcome  analyses  have been  completed  and once unblinding  has occurred.   As treated  will 
be defined  as participants  who received  both loading  doses  of vitamin  D and participants  
who did not miss 20 or more  daily  doses  of vitamin  D.  Therefore,  participants  who missed  
a loading  dose of vitamin  D and participants  who missed  20 or more  daily  doses  of vitamin  
D will not be included  in the as-treated  sensitivity  analyses.    
 
5.0 DATA  MANAGEMENT  
 
The CRFs  will be the primary  data collection  tool for the study.  All data requested  on the 
CRF  must  be recorded.   All data will be entered  into a REDCap  study  database  (McMaster  
University)  and double  verified.

fracture  healing  at 
3 months  
  High  doses  of supplementation  
(loading  or daily)  will increase  
healing  compared  to low daily  dose. 
Using  high doses will rapidly  
increase  the circulating  vitamin  D 
available  during  fracture  callus  
formation.  1. FIXIT

on fracture  healing  
at 3 months  
  Low daily  dose will increase  healing  
compared  to placebo . While  the low 
daily  dose is not expected  to 
increase  circulating  vitamin  D as 
rapidly  as the high dose strategies,  
this comparison  will determine  if 
rapid  serum  increases  are necessary  
to improve  fracture  healing.  1. FIXIT

1. In the event  of a medical  emergency  that directly  affects  the health  status  of the 
participant,  it may become  necessary  to unblind  allocation  status  to determine  the 
specific  treatment  the participant  has received  while  enrolled  in the study.  A 
medical  emergency  is defined  as an event  which  necessitates  immediate  attention  
regarding  the treatment  of a participant.  
2. The clinical  research  coordinator  should  contact  the principal  investigator  (or 
designee)  and provide  details  of the medical  emergency  as soon  as possible  after 
the event.  The principal  investigator  (or designee)  is responsible  for reviewing  and 
approving  all requests  for unblinding.   At no time will the participant’s  health  be 
compromised  or medical  treatment  delayed.   
3. Once  approved,  the clinical  research  coordinator  (or designee)  will contact  the 
unblinded  Project  Manager  and request  the participant’s  treatment  allocation.   The 
unblinded  Project  Manager  will provide  the clinical  research  coordinator  with the 
participant’s  treatment  allocation.   This information  is to be provided  by telephone.   
No information  regarding  treatment  allocation  is to be sent via email  or fax. 
4. The unblinded  personnel  are not to unblind  the principal  investigator  or any blinded  
members  of the study  team  unless  deemed  necessary  by the principal  investigator . 
5. Study  personnel  must  keep  all information  related to the individual  unblinding  
cases  confidential.  
6. All cases  of unblinding  must  be documented,  including:  study  ID, date of 
unblinding,  parties  unblinded,  and reason  for unblinding.

1) We will exclude  individuals  who are likely  to present  problems  with follow -up (see 
exclusion  criteria).   
 
2) At the time of randomization,  as well as their own address  and phone  number,  each 
participant  will provide  the name  and address  of their primary  care physician,  and the 
name,  address  and phone  number  of 3 people  at different  addresses  with whom  the 
participants  does not live who are likely  to be aware  of the participant’s  whereabouts.  The 
clinical  research  coordinator  will confirm  that these  numbers  are accurate  prior  to the 
participant’s  discharge  from  hospital.    
 
3) Participants  will receive  reminders  for upcoming  clinic  visits  from  local  study  
personnel.    
 
4) Follow -up schedules  will coincide  with normal  surgical  fracture  clinic  visits.    
 
5) Study  personnel  will contact  participants  no less frequently  than once every  3 months  
to maintain  contact  and obtain  information  about  any planned  change  in residence.

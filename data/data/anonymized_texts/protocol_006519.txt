A Phase 2 Study of Palliative Radiation and Combination Sequential Immunotherapy 
for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma  and Ocular  Melanoma  
Study 
Design:  This is a Phase 2  study designed  to evaluate the combination of checkpoint blockade and 
aldesleukin  (IL-2) therapy  after a course of standard of care palliative radiation in the 
management of unresectable metastatic melanoma . To be eligible, a patient must have 
a minimum of 3 (preferably >5) radiographically distinct, measurable (>1.5 cm) lesions 
based on RECI ST 1.1. Metastatic cutaneous melanoma must be refractory to standard 
immunotherapy drugs, molecular targeted agents and/or chemotherapy.  Patients with 
ocular melanoma  subtypes may enroll in this study without prior therapy, as there is no 
standard front -line therapy for this subset of patients.  
 
Two treatment cohorts will be used  based on disease origin :  
Cohort 1: Cutaneous melanoma  
Cohort 2: Ocular melanoma  
 
Each cohort enrolls 22 patients employing a separate Simon’s two stage design and  
separate monitoring for excessive toxicity.   
 
Standard of care p alliative radiation therapy is delivered to a maximum of 3 metastatic 
tumors over no more than 3 weeks. A minimum of 2 lesions must remain non-irradiated 
for disease response assessments . Patients who have received palliative radiation 
therapy prior to study enrollment  also may be considered for the study  provided the 1st 
dose of aldesleukin is given within 90 days after the last dose of RT .  
 
Direct participation consists of 3 cycles of study treatment  over 16 weeks and an End of 
Trial (EOT) visit.  
 
Disease re -assessment includes physical examination  and radiographic response 
assessment by irRECIST and RECIST v1.1 of non -irradiated target lesions using CT (or 
PET/CT) and/or at MRI during Week 6 of Cycle 1  and again  after Cycle 3  as part of the  
End of Trial (EOT) visit.   
 
Direct study participation ends  with the EOT; however, patients may continue receiving 
nivolumab every 2 weeks at 240 mg IV as maintenance therapy independent of this study 
at the d iscretion of the treating physician OR nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks per 
2018 FDA approval . 
 
Determinaton  of disease progression for the study requires confirmation of progression 
with scans obtained at least 4 -6 weeks later that qualify as progressive disease (PD) by 
irRECIST due to pseudoprogression and late responses seen with immunotherapy. 
Therapy after progression remain at the discretion of the treating physician and study 
participant.  
 
All patients are followed for progression -free and overall survival endpoints for two years 
from the start of aldesleukin . 
 
Primary 
Objective:  Determine the objective response rate (ORR) and confirm safety and tolerability of 
sequential combination immunotherapy  
 
Secondary  
Objectives:  ● Estimate 6 -month Progression -Free Survival (PFS)  
● Estimate 12 -month Overall Survival (OS)

Objectives:  ● Assessment of tumor microenvironment changes and systemic immune parameters, 
identification of biomarkers of response, identification of autoimmune toxicities 
associated with therapy, and characterization of resistance and response mechanisms.  
● Assess the effect of natural gen etic variation (SNPs) in selected genes including PD -1, 
PD-L1/L2, CTLA -4, TIM -3, LAG -3, OX40/OX40L as well as HLA, NKG2D and NKG2D 
Ligand genes.  
● Evaluate Health Related Quality of Life as assessed by the FACT -M 
 
Disease 
Status  Biopsy -proven unresectable, metastatic melanoma refractory to standard front -line 
therapy with a minimum of 3 radiographically distinct metastases (>1.5 cm)  
measurable by RECIST 1.1.  
o At least 2 lesions must remain non -irradiated for systemic response assessments  
o A maximum of 3 metastases will be treated by palliative radiation (max 2 metastases 
per treated organ may be targeted, but must be separated by more than 5 cm of 
normal tissue)  
Note : Appropriate candidates with lung metastases may be considered  for ablative hypofractionation . 
Appropriate liver metastases may be considered for ablative hypofractionation  or Y-90 radioembolization. 
Suitable brain metastases will be treated using Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKR) or whole brain radiation 
therapy (WBRT)  per the treating radiation oncologist. Total radiation dose and number of fractions will be 
determined by the treating radiation oncologist based on anatomic and dosing constraints.  
Archival tissue block and/or newly obtained  core, punch, or excisional bi opsy of tumor 
tissue.  
Prior recent palliative radiation: enrollment is permissible  if the last dose of palliative 
radiation therapy was given  within 90 days  of the 1st dose of aldesleukin  and at least 2  
radiographically distinct non-irradiated  metastases (>1.5 cm)  remain for systemic 
response assessment  
Ocular melanoma: patients with metastatic ocular melanoma may enroll in this study 
without prior therapy, given no standard front -line therapy available for this subset of 
patients.

2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Metastatic Melanoma  and Standard Treatments  
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer affecting people of all ages. In the 
United States, melanoma incidence rates have been increasing for the last 40 years 
and it is estimated in 2017 approximately 87,110 patients will be diagnosed with 
malignant melanoma, and 9,730 deaths are expected from the disease (1). 
Melanoma metastasis is associated with a poor prognosis, with historical 5-year 
survival rates of less than 10% (2). While the use molecularly targeted agents and 
routine use of checkpoint inhibition has improved the outlook for many patients, still 6 
in 10 patient  with metastatic cutaneous melanoma  fail to  respond to front -line 
immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibodies (3).  
Fortunately, f or approximatel y 50% of cutaneous melanoma cases harboring a BRAF 
mutation, targeted BRAF/MEK inhibition  demonstrate s high initial response rates . 
However, responses are short -lived due to rapidly acquired resistance.  Median 
duration of response to dabrafenib and tramet inib is 12 months (4), and nearly 25% of 
patients recur with a meta stasis to brain (5).  
Brain metastasis is a common finding in cutaneous melanoma patients, with nearly 
37% of patients eventually developing brain m etastasis and autopsies showing 75% 
of melanoma deaths associated with brain metastasis (6). Currently, asymptomatic 
patients may be initially managed with systemic therapy, but symptomatic brain 
metastasis is primarily treated with surgery and radiation as standard brain directed 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 12 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  therapy (7). Particularly for patients with heavily pre -treated CNS metastatic disease, 
there is no standard immunotherapy approach for subsequent management.  
The standard of care for r efractory  metastatic  melanoma is clinical trial participation. 
The two most widely used historical chemotherapy agents, temozolomide and 
dacarbazine, are associated with response rates of 13% after 2 cycles of therapy, and 
median overall survival times of 7.7 and 6 .4 months, for each respectively (8). The 
primary toxicit ies associated with dacarbazine and temozolomide are hematologic  
including Grade 3 to 4  neutropenia (16%), lymphopenia (9%), leukopenia (8%), and 
thrombocytopenia (6%).  Common non -hematologic toxicity includes Grade 3 to 4 
fatigue (5%), nausea (3%), and vo miting (2 %)(9). 
For ocular melanoma subtypes , the malignant cells initiate within the uveal tract of the 
eye. Patients with  localized uveal melanoma are typically managed with local therapy 
first, using radiation, laser therapy, or surgery (enucleation) , followed by observation 
or clinical trial participation. There are no approved adjuvant therapies, and following  
local therapy greater than  50% of patients develop metastatic disease . Tumor c ells 
spread hematogenously  to liver and  patients typically die from hepatic infiltration and 
liver failure.  
Despite the significant success of immune checkpoint blockade  in the management of 
metastatic  cutaneous melanoma, similar success has not been seen in treatment of  
ocular  melanoma. Ocular  melanoma is a unique subset with distinct biology and 
natural history compared with cutaneous melanoma. While c haracteristic BRAF 
mutation in cutaneous melanoma is targetable, mutations in the G -coupled receptor 
subunits GNA11 and GNAQ seen in >50% of uveal melanoma tumors , are not 
effective drug targets. A  randomized phase II study of the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, 
versus chemotherapy demonstrated no significant improvement in  overall survival (10).  
Similarly, less than 10% of uveal melanoma tumors express the biomarker PD-L1(11). 
Ocular melanoma treatment outcome  with standard anti -PD1 mono therapy is  poor, 
with ORR of 3.6% , median PFS of 2.6 months, and OS of 7.6 months (12).  Standard 
practice is to treat metastatic ocular melanoma patients with approved immunotherapy 
agents for cutaneous melanoma, with ipilimumab and nivolumab being the most 
common front-line regimen for fit patients with this disease. Efficacy is limited in this 
disease, though, and this is a population of patients with  high unmet need . New 
immunotherapy approaches are needed  and n ovel immunologic therapeutic strategies 
shoul d be further investigated in this population.  
The sequential administration of  immunostimulatory Interleukin -2 (IL-2) following 
radiation therapy  for palliation, brain directed therapy, or liver directed therapy (ocular 
melanoma)  offers a rational immunolo gic priming strategy to sustain and expand 
antigen priming of  T cells under growth promoting effects.  The sequential addition  of 
checkpoint inhibition strategies  after IL -2 also offers rational timing of anti-PD1 and 
anti-CTLA -4 blockade to inhibit activi ty of regulatory  and exhausted T cells following 
IL-2 based immunotherapy.  
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 13 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  2.2. Pre-clinical Results  of Radiation and Immunotherapy Combination s 
Radiation therapy is known to be an effective palliative treatment for melanoma (13), 
and it is  used routinely and safely in the multidisciplinary management of adva nced, 
metastatic disease (14, 15). It has long been observed that radiation can also  cause 
tumor regressions outside  of the field of radiation; a phenomenon termed the abscopal 
effect (16). Studies have sh own that ionizing radiation enhances immunogenicity of 
tumor associated antigens (17) by inducing  immunogenic cell death (ICD) and 
activating host innate immune signaling and  APC processing  and antigen presentation 
to stimulate  adaptive  T-cell mediated immunity (18, 19) creating strong  rationale fo r 
combination radiation and immunotherapy.  
Pre-clinical models  have  also demonstrated  abscopal effects require an intact immune 
system, and ionizing radiation to melanoma tumors generates  large quantities of 
antigen that induce APC maturation and migration into draining lymph nodes where 
they can activate naïve T cells  that subsequently traffic to distant sites as TILs (20). 
Further studies have also shown that  T-cell priming in draining lymph nodes leads to 
regression of distant non -irradiated metastases in a cytotoxic CD8+ T cell dependent 
fashion (21).  
Advances in the planning and delivery of radiation therapy now allow for highly 
conformal treatment  that spares normal adjacent tissue s and  structures . Technological 
improvements  have also made it possible to deliver higher dose s of radiation per 
fraction using image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) techniques.  For patients with melanoma brain metastasis , stereotactic 
techniques like Gamma Knife can spare patients the late effects of  whole brain  
radiation therapy . 
2.3. Clinical Experience with  Radiation and Combination Immunotherapy  
Strategies aimed at potentiating immunologic effects of local therap y in cancer 
management offers patients the potential to maintain quality of life and improve  
immunotherapy outcomes , even  in refractory metastatic disease.  
Metastatic melanoma to brain  affects 30 -50% of metastatic melanoma patients , and 
combination s of radiotherapy and IL -2 in that setting h ave demonstrated clinical 
efficacy and long -term disease control using both WBRT and stereotactic radiosurgical 
techniques (22). A single -institution retrospective study  from the University of 
Minnesota identified 15 patients  receiving high -dose IL -2 therapy, two of which had 
brain metastases treated with WBRT followed by IL -2, in both cases resulting  in 
durable complete responses (23). Gamma Knife radiosurgery combined with 
Ipilimumab  has also been associa ted with improvement in outcomes and survival rates 
equivalent  to melanoma  patients without brain metastases (24). 
Most  radiotherapy combinations reported in the literature have used  Ipilimumab , the 
first checkpoint inhibitor approved for treatment  of metastatic melanoma based  on 
improvement in  overall survival (25, 26). Early  evidence for immun e enhancement  
came  in case report format describing abscopal effects in a patient receiving  
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 14 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  Ipilimumab  during  radiotherapy  for melanoma (27). The addition of radiation to 
Ipilimumab  was followed by distant  tumor regression s and  changes in peripheral blood 
immune cell subsets  and led  to antibody production against  cancer -testis antigen NY -
ESO -1(27). 
However, newer evidence has shown that anti -PD1 therapy has synergy wi th 
radiation. In a recent retrospective review of patients treated with concurrent immune 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy and radiotherapy after initial progression on nivolumab, 
further nivolumab treatment was associated with an  overall response rate of 30%(28). 
Given the potential for synergy between radiation and immunotherapy there is a need 
for additional prospective clinical trials to optimize in situ  vaccination effects, improve 
responses , and reveal mechanistic details concerning the underlying immunobiology 
of radiation induced in situ  vaccination . 
Optimal  radiation dose and fractiona tion scheme s have not yet been  fully defined, but 
fractionated radiation as opposed to single dose radiot herapy  appears best able to 
induce abscopal responses (29). A recent retrospective s ystematic review of  
metastatic melanoma patients treated with Ipilimuma b and fractionated palliative 
radiation suggests a threshold effect  may be seen  at around  2 - 3 Gy per fraction . In 
that study median radiotherapy dose was 26 Gy (range: 8 -68 Gy) and me dian fraction 
size was  4 Gy (range 1.8 – 25 Gy) , and though the  benefit  of combin ed radiation and 
immuno therapy  was highest for fractions < 3 Gy benefits were seen regardless of the 
radiation dose used (30).  
2.4. Clinical Experience with  Aldesleukin  and Checkpoint Inhibition  
Interleukin -2 (IL-2) is a key human cytokine involved in the activation and proliferation 
of T cells (31). Aldesleukin  is a recombinant version of IL-2 approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of m etastatic melanoma. In the first -line 
setting, h igh-dose Aldesleukin  result s in durable complete response (CR) in 6% and 
partial response (PR) in  10% of patients, and durable responses seen out past 40 
months (32). 
Importantly, r adiation induced abscopal effects appear critically dependent on 
cytotoxic  T lymphocytes (21), and IL-2 is known to potently stimulate the expansion 
and act ivation of CD8+  cytotoxic T cells as well as  NK cells . Exogenous IL -2 reduce s 
minimal TCR signaling requirements on  CD8+ T cells  thereby allowing for proliferation 
under conditions of suboptimal TCR stimulation (33) and increase bystander killing 
activity via the release of granzyme -B and perforins . Therapeutic approaches using  
autologous  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and  high-dose intravenous 
interleu kin-2 (IL -2) are also associated with response rates in excess of 50% and 
durable complete responses  in 20% of patients (34). 
Current strategies using checkpoint inhibition  depend on a pre-existing  anti-tumor 
immune response  that subsequently becomes tolerogenic . Chronic antigenic 
exposure  generates  antigen -specific signal 1 and 2 required for activation of T cells , 
and the  eventual loss of co -stimulation and induction of CTLA -4, PD -1 and other 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 15 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  checkpoints  lead to  the state of  immune suppression  that characterizes the  
immunologic state of exhaustion . Use of checkpoint inhibitors reverses T cell 
exhaustion  in patients responding to these approaches.  
In MDX010 -20, the  phase 3 study of Ipilimumab  with or without glycoprotein 100 
(gp100) peptide vaccine, the Ipilimumab  monotherapy arm received 3 mg/kg 
Ipilimumab  every  3 weeks for four doses (35). In that trial median ov erall survival was 
10.0 months among patients receiving Ipilimumab  plus the gp100  vaccine . Similarly, 
in a randomized phase 2 clinical trial of Ipilimumab  (10 mg/kg) with or without 
Sargramostim (GM -CSF)  improvements in overall survival were seen, with 1year OS 
of 68.9% (95% CI, 60.6-85.5%) vs. 52.9 % (95% CI, 43.6-62.2%), respectively (36). 
In CheckMate -069, a randomized phase 2 study with n=142 patients with advanced 
melanoma and previously untreated BRAF -WT tumors, ORR was 61% Nivolumab (1 
mg/kg) and Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) versus 11% for Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and 
placebo (37). A recent phase IIIb/IV study evaluating nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in previously untreated stage III or IV melanoma (CheckMate - 511) 
demonstrated significantly lower incidence of treatment -related Grade 3 -5 adve rse 
events with no differences in efficacy (38). For this reason, either dosing scheme may 
be used in this study based on treating physician judgement. Similarly,  safety of  
Ipilimumab  and high -dose IL -2 has also been demonstrated in a phase I/II trial 
conducted at the NIH Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute (39). In that study , 
Ipilimumab  was given every 3 weeks for 3 doses, with the 2nd and 3rd doses followed 
within 24 hours by high -dose IL -2 administration (39). No radiation therapy was used 
in the trial and expected toxicity events were encountered with th e combination . 
2.5. Summary of Safety and Pharmacologic Considerations  
The s equencing strategy employed in this trial using  high dose IL-2 and anti-PD1 and 
anti-CTLA -4 checkpoint blockade aims to promote act ivation of anti -melanoma T cells 
after radiation therapy  induced tumor antigen release . Inhibition  of CTLA -4 mediated 
signaling can reduce  regulatory T cell f unction, which may contribute to increased  
potency of IL -2 mediated  T cell dependent anti-tumor immune response s. Anti-PD1 
checkpo int inhibition similarly works on effector T cells to decrease physiologic 
inhibition of the exhausted T cell.  
In the phase I/II trial conducted at the NIH Surgery Branch, in which  Ipilimumab  every 
3 weeks was  followed by high -dose IL -2, 14% of  patients de veloped grade III/IV 
toxicities including  4 cases of  enterocolitis and 1 case  or arthritis  and of uveitis.  In the 
3 mg/kg dose group, one of five (20%) responders experienced grade III/IV 
autoimmunity attributable to  anti-CTLA -4 therapy (39). Anti-CTLA -4 checkpoint 
blockade and its effects on regulatory T cell activ ation suggests toxicity  was most likely 
due to  the de-inhibition of T  reg activity by repetitive anti -CTLA -4 blockade and 
breaking of peripheral tolerance mechanisms.  
In the larger phase 3 study of Ipilimumab  with or without gp100 vaccine (MDX010 -20) 
drug related adverse events were seen in 79% of patients receiving Ipilimumab . In the 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 16 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  monotherapy arm  there were  Grade 3/4 events  in 21% and Grade 5  events  in 3/131 
(2%)  of patients (35). The most frequent AEs for all arms of the trial were  rash (30%), 
pruritis (33%), diarrhea (33%), colitis (8%), e ndocrine disorders (9%), AST/ALT 
elevation  (2%), and hepatitis (1%). Any grade immune related adverse event  rate was 
60%, and the  Grade 3/4 immune related adverse event rate was  13% with the most 
frequent  adverse events being diarrhea (5%), colitis (5%), rash (2%), and endocrine 
disorders (3%) (35). 
The pharmacokinetics of Ipilimumab  was studied in 785 patients with unresectable  or 
metastatic melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg once every  3 weeks 
for 4 doses (40). Peak concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Cmin), and area  
under the plasma concentrat ion versus time curve (AUC) of Ipilimumab  increased  
dose proportionally within the dose range examined. Upon repeated dosing every  3 
weeks, the clearance  (CL) of Ipilimumab  was found to be time -invariant, and systemic  
accumulation was 1.5 -fold or less. Steady -state concentrations of Ipilimumab  were  
reached by the third dose; the mean Cmin at steady -state was 19.4 mcg/mL following  
repeated doses of 3 mg/kg.  The mean value (% coefficient of variation) generated  
through population PK analysis for the terminal half -life (t1/2) was  15.4 days (34%) 
and for CL was 16.8 mL/h (38%).  Notably, no clin ically  important effect on the CL of 
Ipilimumab  was seen based on : age (range:  23–88 years), gender, performance 
status, renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment,  previous cancer therapy, and 
baseline lactate dehyd rogenase (LDH) levels (40).  
In this study, s teady-state concentrations of Ipilimumab will be reache d in cohort 2,  
and the terminal half -life (t1/2) of the drug is anticipated  to be approximately 15 days. 
The expected in vivo degradation  pattern of the anti -CTLA -4 and anti -PD1 monoclonal 
antibod ies is to small peptides and amino acids via biochemical pathways  independent 
of cytochrome P450 enzymes.   
Due to the potential for clinically meaningful AEs requiring early recognition and 
prompt intervention, management algorithms have been developed for s uspected 
pulmonary toxicity, GI and  hepatotoxicity, endocrinopa thy, skin toxicity, neurologi cal 
toxicity and nephrotoxicity related to the incorporation of Ipilimumab  (see Appendix 3). 
Additional guidelines are available and published separately by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and Society for Immun otherapy of Cancer 
(SITC).  
2.6. Correlative Studies  
The sequence of IL -2 administration and anti-PD1 and anti -CTLA -4 checkpoint 
blockade aims to promote sequential activation of anti -melanoma T cells after radiation  
therapy induced  antigenic stimulation. Correlative studies associated with this trial aim 
to characterize the cooperative interactions between radiation the rapy and 
combination immunotherapy.  
Central to the goal of th e study is assessment of the  temporal sequence of  
immunologic  activation and the counter -regulatory mechanisms  elicited by th is 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 17 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  approach. Correlative lab oratory  studies have been  designed to  help elucidate 
mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibitor strategies. We hypothesize that 
hypofractionated radiation  induces  immunogenic cell death and that sequential 
Interleukin -2 allows for priming of  anti-melanoma tumor immunity  in the refractory 
disease setting. We also hypothesize that checkpoint inhibition  in sequence with IL-2 
will decrease  suppressor  T cell activity and exhaustion and increase T effector cell 
subsets . We will also assess the degree to which Nivolumab monotherapy  and dual 
checkpoint inhibition with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab  affects  clinical  outcome  and 
therapy associated toxicities . 
Several planned studies will also attempt to answer the following questions:  
1. What immunologic checkpoints (i.e. PD1/Tim -3/Lag -3) are induced  in the primary T 
cell response to radiation  and IL-2 based t herapy? Can the approach sensitize 
patients  to anti-PD1 blockade, or  other agents  directed against T  and NK  cell 
targets ? 
2. Is baseline or  early intratumoral T -cell infiltrate  a ma rker of response to therapy ? 
Can radiation therapy  and IL -2 induce TIL mediated anti -tumor rejection?  What is 
clonality of TILs in responder patients ver sus nonresponders?  
3. Does anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 checkpoint blockade impact generation and 
functional activity of regulatory T cells? What immune evasion mechanisms are 
active in tumors failing to respond combination  therapy  approaches ? Can  gene 
expression profil ing of tumor s differentiate immunogenic versus  non-immunogenic 
tumor s? 
4. Does radiation therapy  lead to formation of neoantigens, and can whole -
exome/transcriptome sequencing analysis and MHC binding prediction techniques 
predict tumor regression or su bsequent response to checkpoint inhibition?  
5. Do cytokine profiles  and/or plasma soluble analytes (ctDNA, miRNA) predict 
primary or secondary responses to combination  sequential radioimmuno therapy?  
Can ctDNA profiling  identify  tumor neoantigens recognized by  T cell s? 
6. Does radiation  and IL -2 therapy induce a meaningful anti -melanoma CTL response  
in peripheral blood and /or in TIL subsets?  Can a nti-tumor humoral immunity be 
induced against tumor -associated antigens?  
7. Does combination sequential radioimmunotherapy  lead to  CMV  reactivation and 
generation of adaptive NK cells (CD57+NKG2C+)? Can anti-CMV T and NK cells 
or other anti -viral T cells in peripheral blood and the tumor microenviroment  predict 
treatmen t response or identify biomarkers  of response to T and NK cell therapeutics 
in refractory melanoma patients ?

February 1 8, 2020  Page 18 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  2.6.1.  Evaluation of Tumor Biopsies  
Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and other immune cells are as sociated with 
clinical outcome, and this study will collect tumor biopsy specimens to quantify TILs in 
all formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tumor specimens.  
We will use immunohistochemistry  (IHC) and proteomics techniques  to determine the 
extent and nature of immune  infiltrat es at baseline and after treatment. Only non -
irradiated lesions  will be biopsied to allow for characterization of  therapy -induced  
systemic immunologic  responses. We are particularly interested in the relationship of 
treatment with Nivolumab monotherapy vers us dual checkpoint inhibition  and function 
of T reg s, and other T cell subsets .  
Additional immune cells of interest includ e natural killer (NK) cells , monocytes , 
dendritic cells, myeloid d erived suppressor cells (MDSCs),  vascular and 
lymphovascular endothelial cells, and stromal cells . The following cellular markers will 
be analyzed using IHC and/or similar technique : CD3, CD8, PD -1, CTLA -4, MHC-I, 
CD4 (T cells), CD56 and CD16 (NK and NK T cells) CD45 (leukocytes), CD19 (B cells), 
CD68, glucocorticoid -induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family related gene 
(GITR), TIM -3, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and lymphocyte -activation gene 3 (LAG3).  
We hypothesize that combination sequential radioimmunotherapy  increase s the pool 
of effector and memory  T cells against melanoma tumo r-antigens and induces  
molecules  such as CTLA -4, PD-1, LAG -3, and TIM-3 on the surface of t umor infiltrating 
lymphocytes.  
Tumor tissue will be processed  for DNA/RNA analysis and RNA -seq will be used for 
deep characterization of tr eatment related response s and identification of signatures 
predicting primary and secondary immunologic responses (UMN Genomics Center).  
2.6.2.  Melanoma Specific Cellular Immune Response s 
Correlative studies will help answer several immunologic questions regarding the 
ability of radiation and IL -2 based therapy to prime anti -tumor immunity in refractory  
populations. Studies will assess induction of regulatory T cells and other suppressor 
cells, and the ability of checkpoint inhibition to inhibit  these process es.  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be collected and processed for flow 
cytometric analyses  and cryostorage for later batch studies . The effect of radiation 
therapy  and IL -2 on lymphocyte repertoire, numbers and phenotype will be assessed 
at baseline and at defined time points during the trial. The frequency and percentage 
of PBMC and T -cell subsets (CD4 and CD8 effector memory, central memory and 
Treg subsets), NK cells and myeloid -derived suppressor cells will be determined.  
We hypothesize that T cells primed by the combination sequential 
radioimmunotherapy approach undergo i nduction of normal homeostatic regulatory 
checkpoints that  sensitize a subset of patients to later checkpoint inhibitor based 
therapy with currently approved standard agents.  
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 19 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  Peripheral blood tumor -specific T cell subsets will be evaluated by flow cytomet ry in 
cooperation with the Translational Therapy Laboratory, Masonic Cancer Center . 
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CD8+ T cells ) and CD4+ helper T cells  will be isolated using 
fluorescence -activated cell sorting (FACS) from cryopreserved  cells followed by  
mRNA e xpression analysis to assess gene expression changes resulting from 
therapy. Testing will be performed  in collaboration with  the University of Minnesota 
Flow Cytometry and Genomics Core Laboratories.  
Peripheral blood mono nuclear cells (PBMC) may also be tested in functional assays 
(i.e. IFN-γ ELISpot ) for responses to known melanoma antigens , viral antigens,  and 
predicted neoantigen s from whole -exome /transcriptome  sequencing of melanoma 
tumors. All patients will also undergo HLA testing to enable epitope discovery using 
available MHC binding prediction algorithms.  
3. STUDY RATIONALE  
There is a growing body of pre -clinical and clinical evidence that points to a synergistic 
relationship between radiation therapy and immunotherapy.  Preclinical studies have 
shown  that irradiation of tumor cells leads to immunogenic cell death via upregulation of 
major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules, DC cross -presentation of tumor antigens, and 
T-cell priming in draining lymph nodes (20, 21). 
Preclinical studies combining Ipilimumab  with radiation demonstrate enhanced abscopal 
responses in several cancer types (29). Similar abscopal effects have been reported in 
multiple instances of patients  receiving radiation during concurrent checkpoint inhibition  
with anti -PD1 and anti -CTLA4 antibodies  for metastatic disease (17, 30, 41, 42).  
It is known that T cells require distinct sets of signals to proliferate and differentiate into 
effector T cells capable of mounting effective  adaptive immune response s(43). The 
classical two-signal model of T cell activation first involves stimulation of a rearranged T 
cell receptor (TCR)  with specificity  for antigenic peptide  within the groove of the MHC 
molecule . This is  followed by s ignal 2 , the co -stimulat ory interactions of CD28 on  the 
surface of naïve T cells  with CD80 and CD86  ligands on the surface of antigen presenting 
cells.   
Following the activation  of T cells , expression of  cytotoxic T -lymphocyte associated protein 
4 (CTLA -4) is induced on the surface of activated T cells  to restrain the CD28 activation 
pathway. The CTLA -4 checkpoint molecule is largely restricted to CD4 and CD8 T 
cells(44). However, CTLA -4 is also  constitutively expressed in Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg ) 
subsets (45), where CTLA -4 competes  for CD80 and CD86  ligand interactions to blunt  T-
cell activation . It follows that  administration of anti -CTLA -4 therapy leads to  an increased 
risk of immune related adverse events and  autoimmune toxicity. To minimize toxicity from 
anti-CTLA -4 therapy there is interest in reducing Ipilimumab  dosing and dosage of  
Ipilimumab . The overarching goal of these strategies is to maintain clinical activity while 
reducing immune related adverse events . 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 20 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  This clinical study aims to sequence  immunotherapy treatment s after radiation  therapy  to 
coincide with  antigen release and uptake and processing by APCs . After completion of 
radiation therapy patients  receive high dos e Aldesleukin  (IL-2) to support in vivo priming 
and expan sion of endogenous T cell populations against melanoma antigens . Importantly, 
primary T cell activation is tightly regulated and the sequential signals required to direct 
and amplify T cells must be delivered in -sequence to avoid  paralyzing effect s on T cell 
dependent immunity seen with  out-of sequence  delivery (46). 
This combination sequential radioimmunotherapy approach  builds o n phase 1 study data 
demonstrating safety and preliminary efficacy signal s of combination  stereotactic ablative 
radiotherapy  (SABR)  and IL -2 as first-line treatment for metastatic melanoma and renal 
cell carcinoma (47). The current trial adds  checkpoint inhibition following  aldesleukin to 
maximize induced anti -tumor responses in an immunotherapy  refractory patient 
population .  
4. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the combination of checkpoint blockade and 
aldesleukin (IL -2) therapy after a course of standard of care palliative radiation in the 
management of unresectable metastatic melanoma refractory to standard immunotherapy 
drugs, molecular targeted agents and/or chemotherapy. To be eligible, a patient mus t 
have a minimum of 3 (preferably >5) radiographically distinct, measurable (>1.5 cm) 
lesions based on RECIST 1.1. Ocular melanomas may enroll in this study without prior 
therapy as there is no standard front -line therapy for this subset of patients.  
 
Standard of care palliative radiation therapy is delivered to a maximum of 3 metastatic 
tumors over no more than 3 weeks. A minimum of 2 lesions must remain non -irradiated 
for disease response assessments. Patients who have completed  palliative radiation 
therapy within 90 days  prior to the 1st dose of aldesleukin  also may be considered for the 
study.  
 
Two treatment cohorts (treatment arms in OnCore) will be used based on disease origin:  
Cohort 1: cutaneous melanoma – aldesleukin  followed by nivolumab every 2  week s for 6 
doses.  
Cohort 2: ocular melanoma – aldesleukin followed by nivolumab/ ipilimumab given 3 weeks 
for 4 doses . 
 
Each cohort enrolls 22 patients employing a separate Simon’s two stage design and 
separate monitoring for excessive toxicity.  
 
Disease  re-assessment includes physical examination, as well as radiographic response 
assessment (RECIST v1.1) of non -irradiated target lesions using CT (or PET/CT) and/or 
MRI at the 6 week (end of Cycle 1) and the end of trial (EOT) visit.  
A final determination  of disease progression for the study requires confirmation of 
progression with scans obtained at least 4 -6 weeks after the EOT visit, in order to qualify 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 21 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  as progressive disease (PD) by RECIST 1.1 due to observed pseudoprogression and late 
responses seen w ith immunotherapy treatments. Therapy after progression is at the 
discretion of the patient and primary physician.  
Direct study participation ends  after the E nd of Trial (EOT) visit approximately 4 weeks 
after the last dose of study drug; however, n ivolumab maintenance therapy may continue 
at the treating physician’s discretion  independent of this study . 
 
After the EOT visit,  patients are monitored for progression and survival endpoints via 
medical record review or phone/electronic communications every 3 months for two years 
from the start of aldesleukin . 
5. PATIENT SELECTION  
The study is open to persons 18 years through  and including 80 years of age  regardless 
of gender, race or ethnic background. While there will be e very effort to seek out and 
include women and minority patients, the patient population is expected to be no different 
than that of other advanced melanoma studies at the University of Minnesota.  
5.1. Inclusion Criteria  
5.1.1  Biopsy -proven unresectable, metast atic melanoma refractory to standard 
immunotherapy drugs  or regimens , including prior treatment with Aldesleukin  
(IL-2), GM -CSF, Ipilimumab , Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and/or Imlygic (T -

February 1 8, 2020  Page 24 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  6.3. Patients Who Do Not Begin Study Treatment  
If a patient is registered to the study and is later found unable to begin study treatment 
(1st dose of IL -2) the patient will be removed from study and treated at the physician’s 
discretion. The study staff will update OnCore of the patient’s non -treatment status (off 
study). The reason for removal from study prior to starting study treatment will be 
clearly indicated in OnCore. The patient will be re placed to complete enrollment.  
7. TREATMENT PLAN  
7.1. Palliative Radiation Therap y 
When palliative radiation has been received off -study or delivered outside of the 
University of Minnesota, patients may go on to receive IL -2 and checkpoint inhibitor  
on study as described in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 provided the 1st dose of 
aldesleukin is given within 90 days  of the last dose of RT. If additional palliative 
radiation is clinically warranted, the patient would be treated as described below.  
A maximum  of 3 metastatic tumors will be targeted for palliative radiation; up  to 2 
metastases per treated organ may be targeted for hypofractionated palliative radiation  
but must be separated by more than 5 cm of normal tissue. Appropriate candidates 
with lung and  liver metastases may be considered for ablative hypofractionation. For 
liver directed therapy, patients will have  an MRI of the liver f or radiation treatment 
planning. Patient  must have  at least one non -irradiated hepatic metastasis amenable 
to percutaneo us biopsy. Treatment for hepatic metastasis must also spare a critical 
hepatic volume (volume receiving <21 Gy) of 700 ml.  Appropriate candidates with liver 
metastases may be considered for Y -90 radioembolization . 
Brain metastases may be treated with surge ry followed by Gamma Knife (GK) to the 
resection cavity or alternatively as part of definitive brain directed therapy.  Whole brain 
radiation therapy (WBRT) may also be used at the discretion of the treating radiation -
oncologist.   
For sites not amenable to  ablative radiotherapy, fractions will be delivered at a 
minimum of 3 Gy per fraction.  
 
At least 2 non -irradiated lesions >1.5 cm are required for systemic response 
assessments.  The total radiation dose and number of fractions will be determined by 
the tr eating radiation oncologist based on anatomic and dosing constraints; however 
when palliative radiation therapy is received on study it must not exceed 3 weeks and 
treatment must be administered in such a way that that patient can be admitted to the 
hospit al within 5 days  of the last radiation fraction to start high-dose IL -2.  
7.2. Aldesleukin  (IL-2) – All Participants  
After palliative radiation is complete, patients are admitted to the hospital to begin 
Aldesleukin (IL -2) therapy. Treatment is administered as an inpatient according to the 
University of Minnesota guidelines for Aldesleukin  administration.  
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 25 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  Aldesleukin  (IL-2) at 600,000 U/kg will be administered as an intravenous infusion via 
a central catheter (either PICC line or port) over 15 minutes approximately once every 
8 to 12 hours, per institutional guidelines and standard clinical practice. Patients may 
receive a maximum of 10 doses, no longer than 24 -hours apart, on Days 1 through 5 
and Days 15 through 19.  
The dosing calculations sho uld be based on the body weight. If the subject’s weight 
on the day of dosing differs by > 10% from the weight used to calculate the dose, the 
dose must be recalculated. All doses should be r ounded to the nearest milligram . 
As it recognized that most patie nts experience severe toxicity with IL -2 and often are 
not able to complete all planned doses , the number of doses an individual patient 
receives will be based on personal experience and the treating physician’s clinical 
judgement. Even if a patient is una ble to receive IL -2 as planned, the study calendar 
for disease reassessment and research sample collections should be followed.  
Patients will have routine vital signs and laboratory tests measured daily during 
aldesleukin  therapy. IL -2 is associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance 
and low blood pressure from development of capillary leak syndrome (CLS). Increased  
permeability of blood vessels results in extravasation of plasma proteins and fluid into 
extravascular comp artments and spaces, n ecessitating  maintenance IV fluid hydration 
and aggressive fluid boluses to support blood pressure and maintain normal organ 
perfusion.  
Standard institutional practices govern IL -2 administration. Briefly, bolus infusions 
continue until the development of CTCAE v 5 Grade 3 or 4 expected toxicities based 
on patient tolerance. The most common Grade 4 events are pulmonary and renal 
impairment, and mental status changes. The anticipated toxicities require supportive 
measures during treatment , but t oxicities are generally acute and reversible and the 
majority of patients have no long -term sequelae from intensiv e IL-2 treatment. 
Development of side effects from IL -2 is anticipated and therefore will not be 
considered  serious adverse event  for safety analyses. However, abnormal lab values 
must plateau and begin tre nding toward baseline prior to h ospital discharge following 
IL-2 treatments.  
Since IL -2 treatment can cause a transient decrease in neutrophil chemotaxis 
antibiotic prophylaxis i s given (i.e . penicillin or cephalosporin) to minimize the 
incidence and risk of serious bacterial infections.  
7.3. Nivolumab Monotherapy  (Cohort 1  - Cutaneous ) 
Nivolumab 240 mg IV is administered over 30 minutes every 2 weeks as maintenance 
therapy .  
For any individual dose a  ±3 day window is permitted without affecting (no adjustment 
to) future doses. This window is primarily for scheduling issues (i.e. holidays, inclement 
weather, etc).   
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 26 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  Longer delays are permitted, if in the opinion of the treating investig ator, a delay in 
therapy is in the best interest for the patient and their ability to complete the planned 
treatment. In the instance of longer delays (i.e. 1 week or longer), the reminder of the 
treatment schedule will be shifted to keep proper spacing be tween the remaining 
doses . Section 8.3 provides guidance on delays for significant immune related toxicity; 
however, delays may be for other reasons.  
The 1st dose is given Day 29  of Cycle 1 and continues in Cycle 2 on Days 1, 15, and 
29 of a 6 week cycle . 
Cycle 3 nivolumab is given on Day 1 and Day 15  of a standard  4 week cycle .  
Cycle 3 is the end of the planned study treatment; however p atients  may continue 
maintenance nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks OR nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 
weeks per 2018 FDA app roval at discretion of the treating physician and independent 
of this study . 
Nivolumab is administered in the outpatient setting; however, inpatient administration 
is permitted as medically appropriate if a patient is hospitalized. No premedication is 
required. Monitoring will be according to institutional guidelines with interruption or 
slowing of rate of infusion with Grade 1 to 2 infusional toxicities and discontinuation of 
nivolumab with Grade 3 to 4 infusional toxicities.  
 
The dose is calculated on a pre -treatment (baseline) weight within 7 days of treatment 
start. The dose must be re -calculated in a new treatment cycle  if a greater than 10% 
weight change occurs from baseline.  
 
No dose modifications are permitted for nivolum ab but dose may be withheld based 
on occurrence of significant immune -related AE Grade 2 or higher based on NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, as described in 
Section 8.3. 
7.4. Nivolumab and Ipilimumab  (Cohort 2 - Ocular ) 
Nivolumab and Ipilimumab is administered sequentially as an intravenous infusi on of 
nivolumab ( 3 mg/kg) over 3 0 minutes followed by an intravenous infusion of ipilimumab 
(1 mg/kg) over 90 minutes.  
Alternatively , at the discretion of the treating investigator, a hig h risk patient with an 
excellent performance status may receive nivolumab (1 mg/kg ) over 3 0 minutes 
followed by an intravenous infusion of ipilimumab ( 3 mg/kg) over 90 minutes.   
Nivolumab and ipilimumab  is given for 4 doses every 3 week s (on Day 29 of Cycle 1, 
Day 8 and 29 of Cycle 2 , and Day 8 of Cycle 3 ).  
For any individual dose a ±3 day window is permitted without affecting (no adjustment 
to) future doses. This window is primarily for scheduling issues (i.e. holidays, inclement 
weather, etc).  
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 27 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  Longer  delays are permitted, if in the opinion of the treating investigator, a delay in 
therapy is in the best interest for the patient and their ability to complete the planned 
treatment. In the instance of longer delays (i.e. 1 week or longer), the reminder of  the 
treatment schedule will be shifted to keep proper spacing between the remaining 
doses. Section 8.3 provides guidance on delays for significant immune related toxicity; 
however, delays may be for other reasons.  
On Day 1 of Cycle 4 the patient may begin  nivolumab maintenance a s a single agent 
per Section 7.3.  
Diphenhydramine and/or acetaminophen may be administered as prophylactic pre -
medications.  
Nivolumab and Ipilimumab is administered in the outpatient setting; however, inpatient 
administration is per mitted as medically appropriate if a patient is hospitalized. No 
premedication is required. Monitoring will be according to institutional guidelines with 
interruption or slowing of rate of infusion with grade 1 to 2 infusional toxicities and 
discontinuatio n of nivolumab and ipilimumab with grade 3 to 4 infusional toxicities.  
 
The dose is calculated on a pre -treatment (baseline) weight within 7 days of treatment 
start. The dose must be re -calculated in a new treatment cycle if a greater than 10% 
weight chan ge occurs from baseline.  
 
No dose modifications are permitted for nivolumab and ipilimumab but doses may be 
withheld based on occurrence of significant immune -related AE Grade 2 or higher 
based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, as 
described in Section 8.3.  
7.5. Supportive Care  
In order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical 
conditions, investigator discretion may be used in the prescribing of all supportive care 
drug therapy (i.e. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, etc.), and will not be considered 
a protocol deviation.  
7.6. Duration of Study Treatment  
Treatment is given over approximately 16 weeks. Treatment continues  in the absence 
of documented progression, unacceptable side effects or patient 
refusal/noncompliance. A final determination of disease progression for the study 
requires confirmation of progression with radiographic scans obtained at least 4 -6 
weeks after the EOT visit, in order to qualify as progressive disease (PD) by RECIST 
1.1 due to observed pseudoprogression and late responses seen with immunotherapy 
treatments.  
Palliative radiation is administered to most patients over a 3 week period just prior to 
starting aldesleukin infusions , although patient s may be considered  for the study if 
they have completed  palliative radiation within 90 days  of the 1st dose of aldesleukin . 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 28 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  Patients may continue maintenance nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks OR 
nivolumab 480  mg IV every 4 weeks per 2018 FDA approval at discretion of the 
treating physician and independent of this study . 
7.7. Duration of Study Participation  
Direct study participation ends after the  End of Trial (EOT) visit  approximately 4  weeks 
after last dose of study  directed  treatment . If in the opinion of the investigator there is 
ongoing toxicity at least possibly related to the study treatment, the patient will be 
followed as medically appropriate until resolution or stabilization of the toxicity.  
Follow -up for disease status and survival will continue for up to 2 years from study 
enrollment by electronic/phone  contact every 3 months (± 2 weeks) unless the patient 
withdraws consent . 
8. EXPECTED SIDE EFFECT S AND MANAGEMENT OF SELECTED 
TOXICITIE S 
8.1. Palliative Radiati on Therapy  
Adverse events related to radiation therapy for the treatment of metastases are 
dependent on the location of the metastases treated as well as from exposure of 
surrounding normal tissues. For all treated metastases, fatigue is likely to occur an d 
should be transient lasting < 8 weeks. Other adverse events are likely to be related to 
the specific metastatic location receiving radiation therapy.  All radiation therapy 
associated adverse events should be graded according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v. 5.  
8.1.1.  Lung (Central and Peripheral), Mediastinal/Cervical Lymph Node  
Metastases   
 Cardiac and Pericardial Injury: uncommon in conventionally fractionated 
course of radiation therapy, but with large doses per fraction of SBRT 
myocarditis, pericarditis and other side -effects can be seen.  
 Gastrointestinal/Esophageal Injury: The radiation effects on the esophagus 
can be acute: esophagitis (i.e. dysphagia) typically improves soon after RT 
course is completed, or chronic: esoph ageal stenosis, ulceration, or 
perforation (rar ely in extreme cases).  
 Central Airway/Bronchial Injury: Bronchial injury may cause subsequent 
focal collapse of lung impairing overall pulmonary status. 
Collapsed/atelectatic lung may make further assessment o f tumor 
response more difficult. Bronchial toxicity may lead to cough, dyspnea, 
hypoxia, impairment in pulmonary function test parameters, pleural 
effusion, or pleuritic pain.   
 Lung Injury: Radiation pneumonitis is a subacute (weeks to months from 
treatme nt) inflammation of the end bronchioles and alveoli. Radiation 
fibrosis is a late manifestation of radiation injury to the irradiated lung. 
Infiltrates on chest x -ray characteristically include the area treated to high 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 29 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  dose, but may extend outside of the r egion and appear “geometric” in 
appearance, corresponding to the radiation portal.  
o Mild radiation pneumonitis may be treated with nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory agents or steroid inhalers.  
o Moderate to severe radiation pneumonitis will be treated with 
systemic steroids, bronchodilators, and pulmonary hygiene . 
8.1.2.  Liver and Abdominal -Pelvic Metastases  
 Radiation -induced liver disease (RILD): Not likely (<5%), but serious. 
Classic RILD is a clinica l diagnosis of anicteric ascites, hepatomegaly and 
elevation of alkaline phosphatase relative to other transaminases that may 
occur 2 weeks to 3 months following radiation to the Liver; non -classic RILD 
includes elevation of liver enzymes and/or any declin e in liver function 
within 12 weeks from start of therapy. There is increased risk of liver toxicity 
in patients with large tumors and in patients with pre -existing liver disease.  
 Permanent thrombocytopenia (<1%), which may lead to bleeding  
 Kidney injury ( <1%), which may lead to changes on imaging studies.  
8.1.3.  Spinal Metastases  
 Radiation myelitis: Given proximity an d position of spinal cord in relation to 
the radiosurgery target, every effort should be made to minimize radiation 
dose to the spinal cord. Radiat ion myelitis is a subacute or chronic clinical 
syndrome after radiation. Symptoms may include paresthesia, sensory 
changes, and motor weakness including paralysis. There is no active 
treatment for radiation myelitis, therefore it is important to prevent an y injury 
to the spinal cord.  
 Radiation esophagitis: Thoracic spine treatment will likely lead to 
esophageal mucositis within the first 2 weeks. Symptoms generally subside 
with time. Hydration is important given th at dehydration may result due to 
consequenc es of esophageal toxicity i.e. dysphagia, cough, swallowing 
difficulty.  Dysphonia and fistula are rare.  
 Radiation Laryngitis or pharyngitis: Cervical spine treatment will likely lead 
to laryngopharyngeal mucositis within the first 2 weeks. Symptoms 
generally subside with time . Hydration is important given that dehydration 
may result due to consequences of radiation toxicity i.e. dysphagia, cough, 
swallowing difficulty. Dysphonia and fistula are rare.  
 Compression Fracture of treated Vertebra : Radiatio n doses in excess of 19 
Gy for a single fraction have been  associated with high er rates of vertebral 
body compression (Saghal 2013)  and will be avoided.  
8.1.4.  Osseous metastases  
 Erythema, desquamation and alopecia are common side effects from 
radiation therapy for osseous metastases; other effects based on location 
of metastasis and may include pain, edema, and neuralgia.

February 1 8, 2020  Page 30 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  8.2. Aldesleukin  (IL-2) 
The development of anticipated side effects from IL -2 is physiologic and therefore side 
effects are not considered serious adverse events for safety analyses. However, 
abnormal lab values must plateau and begin trending toward baseline prior to Hospital 
discharge following IL -2 treatments.

Treatment Guidelines for High -Dose  Aldesleukin (IL-2) Toxicity Management  
● Acetaminophen, naproxen (as needed), and H2 blocker therapy will be used to manage 
anticipated side effects of high-dose IL -2 therapy, and will generally be continued for 8 -
12 hours after last dose of IL -2 to avoid development of high fever.  
● Meperidine (25 -50 mg) may be given intravenously if severe chills develop.

February 1 8, 2020  Page 31 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  ● Additional antiemetic therapy will be administered  for breakthrough nausea and/or 
vomiting.  
● Supportive care measures are outlined in Appendix 2, as indicated for expected 
toxicities from high -dose IL -2. 
8.3. Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Related Toxicity Management  
Immune -related adverse events (irAEs) from ipilimumab and nivolumab will be managed 
depending on severity (NCI CTCAE V5.0 grading) as outlined below.  
 
Immune -Related (ir) Adverse Events Management – General Guidelines  
 
Grade 1 to 2:  Treat symptomatically or hold checkpoint inhibitors. Considerati on of 
moderate dose steroids  (0.5 mg/kg) , and more frequent monitoring.  
 
Grade 1 to 2 (persistent):   Manage similar to Grade 3 to 4 irAE  
 
Grade 3 to 4:  Treat with high dos e corticosteroids, typically 1 -2 mg/kg of prednisone or IV 
steroid equivalent and  
 
Grade 4 irAEs permanently discontinue treatment with  nivolumab or nivolumab and 
ipilimumab  
 
Grade 3 irAEs requires withholding nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab except 
for any of the following:  Transient (≤ 6 hours) Grade 3 flu -like symptoms or fever, which 
is controlled with medical management, transient (≤ 24 hours) Grade 3 fatigue, local 
reactions, headache, nausea, emesis that resolves to Grade ≤ 1 and single laboratory 
values out of normal range (excluding Grade ≥ 3 liver function test increase) th at are 
unlikely related to study treatment according to the Investigator, do not have any clinical 
correlate, and resolve to Grade ≤ 1 within 7 days with adequate medical management  
 
Any Grade 2 irAEs should be managed as follows:  
If a Grade 2 irAE resolve s to Grade ≤ 1 by the next planned cycle, treatment may continue.  
 
If a Grade 2 irAE does not resolve to Grade ≤ 1 by the next planned cycle, treatment 
should be withheld at next cycle. If at the end of the following cycle the event has not

February 1 8, 2020  Page 35 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  9. SCHEDULE OF PATIENT ACTIVITIES  
Scheduled evaluations /drug dosing  during treatment may be performed ±3 days from the 
targeted date. In addition, targeted days may be altered as clinically appropriate.  Follow -up is 
by record review , phone/electronic communication every 3 months (±2 weeks) . 
For any individual dose a ±3 day window is permitted without affecting (no adjustment to) 
future doses. This window is primarily for scheduling issues (i.e. holidays, inclement weather, 
etc).  
Longer delays are permitted, if in the opinion of the treating investigator, a delay in therapy is 
in the best interest for the patient and their ability to complete the planned treatment. In the 
instance of longer delays (i.e. 1 week or longer), the reminder of the treatment schedule be 
shifted to keep proper spacing  between the remaining doses . 
Section 8.3 provides guidance on delays for significant immune related toxicity; however, 
delays may be for other reasons.  
 
Note:  Although the treatment days for Cohort 1 and 2 differ, the clinic visit schedule is the 
same.

February 1 8, 2020  Page 37 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  9.2. Research Related Sample Collection  
If a patient discontinues aldesleukin early, the research calendar and disease 
reassessment should continue to follow the schedule below using the 1st dose of 
aldesleukin as the calendar anchor.  
1 – On RT treatment Day 7 (±3 days),  
2 – before the 1st dose of aldesleukin  and 8  to 12  hours after the last dose of aldesleukin  
administered  
3- a fresh tumor biopsy is requ ried at baseline ; however, it is done only once. I f the patient 
has archived tissue and does not require a biopsy for study eligibility per footnote # 2 in 
Section 9.1 , a tumor biopsy will be done and charged to research per Section 9.2.  
 
All research samples go to the Masonic Cancer Center’s Translational Therapy Lab 
(TTL) unless otherwise specified on the lab slip.  
Resea rch sample collection and questionnaire completion are  tied to the clinical care 
schedule of events and their associated window for performance. Therefore, if a 
clinical time point does not occur or is altered, the research related time point will be 
adjus ted (or eliminated) as appropriate.  
It is recognized that with novel therapies as used in this study, the timing of protocol 
directed research samples may miss important patient specific events. For this reason, 
up to 3 extra samples for a total of 180 ml  of blood may be drawn at additional time 
points that are not specified above.  
9.2.1.  Collection of Tumor Biospecimens  
As part of this protocol ’s eligibility, a patient m ust have sufficient archival tissue 
block material (1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm) and/or newly obtaine d core or excisional biopsy 
of tumor tissue; minimum of 2 cores . A biopsy is performed around Day 3 6 of cycle 
1 and again at the EOT visit soley for research purposes. In patients with confirmed 
radiologic progression, a biopsy sample of a tumor would  ideally be obtained near 
the time of progression if feasible and safe (core, punch or excisional biopsy).  
Biopsy confirmation at time of progression is a standard of care practice.  
Pre- and post -treatment levels of CD8+ T -cell tumor infiltrates will be as sessed by 
IHC, in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and with the 
assistance of BIONET . PD-1 and PD -L1, LAG -3, and TIM -3 expression will be

9.2.2.  Collection of Blood Specimens  
Research sample processing and specialized testing will be provided by the 
Transl ational Therapy Shared Resource, at the Masonic Cancer Center, University 
of Minnesota. When appropriate, samples from normal donors will be used in 
comparative analyses.  
We will collect whole blood for cytokine studies, DNA/RNA and Immune cell gene 
expres sion, and for PBMC isolation  at various time  points. For immune cell 
phenotype and functional studies we will collect 5 x 10 mL Green top  (Heparinized)  
tubes for detailed NK cell  and T -cell subset analysis and for plasma isolation and 
PBMC storage at -80°C.  
To determine if tetramer reagents would be applicable for a given patient, a low -
resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I typing assay will also be 
performed at study enrollment.  
For a  complete  listing of correlative objectives and tissue an d assays planned, see 
Appendix 5.  
9.2.3.  Quality of Life (QOL) Measurement, FACT -Melanoma  
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) subscale specific for 
melanoma, FACT -M, is a melanoma -specific quality of life (QOL) assessment 
instrument. The FACT –Melanoma subscale was developed to assess and identify 
the unique concerns of patients with melanoma.  
The FACT -Melanoma questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for patients 
with melanoma that can be used for the assessment of QOL in clinical trials (48). 
During the course of the study patients will fill out the FACT -Melanoma QOL 
assessment instrument to monitor patient wellbeing in multiple domains (Appendix 
4). 
9.3. Imaging Assessment s 
Tumor response will be defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1) according to the schedule outlined in Section 9.1.   
Based  on immune related RECIST (irRECIST 1.1), a modification of RECIST, the 
study  requires confirmation of progressive disease ( PD) with an additional scan 4 to 6 
weeks later that also meets criteria for progression per RECIST 1.1. (see Appendix 6)

February 1 8, 2020  Page 39 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events V 5.0 (CTCAE). A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded 
from the CTEP home page 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Q
uick_Reference_5x7.pdf  
10.1.  Definitions  
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 
312.32 (21CFR312.32(a)).  
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction:   Any adverse event f or which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, "reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspecte d adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adve rse reaction is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places 
the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that, had it oc curred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction:   An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in  any of the following outcomes:  
● Death  
● A life -threatening adverse event  
● Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
● A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
● A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
● Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition  
 
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction:  An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not  
listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
Radiation and Sequential Immunotherapy for Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma and Ocular Melanoma  
   
February 1 8, 2020  Page 40 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
antici pated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
 
Attribution of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE  is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
 
The following defin itions are from the Masonic Cancer Center’s Standard Operating 
Procedure (SOP) Deviation Reporting:  
 
Major Deviation:  A deviation or violation that impacts the risks and benefits of the 
research; may impact subject safety, affect the integrity of research data and/or affect 
a subject’s willingness to participate in the research. Deviations that place a subject at 
risk, but do not result in harm are considered to be major deviations.  
 
Minor Deviation:  A deviation or violation that does not impact subject saf ety, 
compromise the integrity of research data and/or affect a subject’s willingness to 
participate in the research.  
10.2.  Adverse Event Monitoring and Documentation  
The monitoring  period for adverse events  begins with the administration of the 1st dose 
of aldesleukin  (IL-2) through  the End of Trial visit .  
Patients who are withdrawn due to an AE should have an AE assessment completed 
28 days or more after their last trial treatment. All AEs will be captured on the AE CRF.  
For the purposes of this study, adverse event documentation requirements will be 
determined based on grade, expectedness and relationship to the study treatment:  
  Grade 1  Grade 2  Grade 3  Grade 4 and  5

February 1 8, 2020  Page 41 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  The following events count toward an early stopping rule event per Section  12: 
 Any Grade 2 or greater drug -related uveitis, eye pain, or blurred vision that 
does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity 
within 7 days of checkpoint inhibitor OR requires systemic treatment with 
corticosteroids  
 Any Grade 3 or greater non -skin, drug -related adverse event lasting > 7 days, 
including uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic 
toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, and infusion reactions with the following 
exceptions:  
o Grade 3  or greater drug -related laboratory abnormalities are not considered 
a stopping rule event  if they constitute an expected side effect that is 
reversible and corrects with usual supportive measures.  
In addition, the trial would be stopped and re -evaluated if t here is ≥ 1 treatment -related 
mortality event.

(e-CRF) developed within OnCore based on its library of standardized forms. The e -
CRF will be approved by the study’s Principal Investigator and the Biostatistician pri or 
to release for use. The Study  Coordinator or designee will be responsible for 
registering the patient into OnCore at time of study entry, completing e -CRF based on 
the patient specific calendar, and updating the patient record until patient death or end  
of required study participation.  
11.3.  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be in compliance with the University 
of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center's Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), which 
can be accessed  at http://z.umn.edu/dmsp . 
For the purposes of data and safety monitoring, this study is classified as moderate  
risk. 
Therefore the following requirements will be fulfilled:  
▪ The Masonic Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Council (DSMC) will 
review th e study’s progress at least  twice yearly  with the understanding the Cancer 
Protocol Review Committee (CPRC) may require more frequent reporting.  
▪ The PI will comply with at least twice yearly monitoring of the project by the Masonic 
Cancer Center monitoring  services.  
▪ The PI will oversee the submission of all reportable adverse events per the definition 
of reportable in Section 10.3 to the Masonic Cancer Center’s SAE Coordinator, the 
University of Minnesota IRB, and the FDA.  
11.4.  Monitoring  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the 
investigator and/or investigator designee, IRB, government regulatory bodies, and 
University of Minnesota compliance groups. The investigator will make available all 
study related documents (e .g. source documents, regulatory documents, data 
collection instruments, study data, etc.). The investigator will ensure the capability for 
inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.) will be available fo r trial related monitoring, audits, or regulatory inspections.

February 1 8, 2020  Page 43 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  11.5.  Record Retention  
The investigator will retain study records including source data, copies of case report 
forms, consent forms, HIPAA authorizations, and all study correspondence in a 
secured facility for at 6 years after the study file is closed with the IRB.  
In addition, the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) will keep a master log of all patients 
participating in the  study with sufficient information to allow retrieval of the medical 
records for that patient.  
Please contact the CTO before destroying any study related records.  
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
All analyses of demographics, safety, biological activity, and biomarkers will be 
descriptive. AEs, SAEs, deaths, and abnormal laboratory values will be summarized by 
the proportion of patients who experience them.  Descriptive statistics of safety will be  
presented using National  Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. All on -study AEs, Grade 3 -4 AEs, treatment -related 
AEs,  Grade 3 -4 treatment -related AEs, SAEs, treatment -related SAEs, and AEs leading 
to discontinuation will be  tabulated using the worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 5.0 criteria by 
system organ class . On-study lab  parameters including hematology, chemistry  panel , liver 
and renal function  tests, and thyroid function , and all Grade 3 -4 Lab abnormalities  will be 
summarized using worst grade NCI CTCAE v 5.0 criteria.  
Each cohort in this  phase 2 trial uses a Simon’s two -stage design ( 39). The null hypothesis 
that the true response rate is 13% will be tested against a one -sided alternative. In th e first 
stage, 16 patients will be accrued. If there are 3 or fewer responses in these 16 patients, 
the study will be stopped for futility. If there are 4 or more responses in 16 patients, the 
null hypothesis will be rejected  and 6 additional patients will  be accrued for a total of 22. 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if 6 or more responses are observed in 22 patients. 
This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 0.8 when the true response rate 
is 35%.  
The ORR will be presented as the pro portion of patients who achieved complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR). The disease control rate (DCR) will be presented as the 
proportion of patients with CR, PR, or stable disease. The best overall response (BOR) 
will be measured as the maximum  change from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter 
for each of the target lesions over the full 2 year follow -up period. The percentage of 
responders still in response at different time points (6 and 12 months) will be presented 
based on the Kaplan -Meier (KM) method.  
In general, categorical data measurements will be summarized as counts and percentages 
(or proportions) and continuous data will be summarized with descriptive statistics such 
as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  Summ ary statistics will be 
provided for changes in number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and in PD -L1/Tim -3/Lag -
3 and other expressed proteins in tumors from baseline to protocol -specified time points 
during treatment.

February 1 8, 2020  Page 44 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  Sequential boundaries will be used to monitor excessive  toxicity rate  as defined in Section 
10.3 by treatment cohort (arm) . The accrual will be halted and the study re -evaluated if 
excessive toxicity is  seen, that is, if the number of excessive toxicity  is equal to or exceeds  
8 out of  22 patients in phase 2 with full follow -up (i.e. stop if 2/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 4/8, 
5/9, 5/10, 5/11, 5/12, 6/13, 6/14, 6/15, 6/16, 6/17, 7/18, 7/19, 7/20, 7/21, or 8/22) . This is 
a Pocock -type (40) stopping boundary that yields the probability of cros sing the boundary 
at most [0.05] when the rate of excessive toxicity  is equal to the acceptable rate [0.13].  
In addition,  the trial would be stopped and re -evaluated if there is ≥ 1 treatment -related 
mortality event.  
13. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY  
13.1.  Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate regulatory 
requirement(s). Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate 
the validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected. Master files 
should be esta blished at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration 
of the study and retained according to the appropriate regulations.  
13.2.  Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in 
the Declaration of H elsinki. The IRB will review all appropriate study 
documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well -being of the 
patients. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB approval has 
been obtained. The protocol, consent, written informa tion given to the patients, 
safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents 
will be provided to the IRB by the investigator.  
13.3.  Informed Consent  
All potential study participants will be given a copy of the IRB -approved consent 
to review. The investigator or designee will explain all aspects of the study in 
lay language and answer all questions regarding the study. If the participant 
decides to participate in the study, he/she will be asked to sign and date the 
consent document. P atients who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the 
study will be treated without prejudice.

February 1 8, 2020  Page 48 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  APPENDIX 3 – MANAGEMENT ALGORITH MS FOR IPILIMUMAB  
AND  OTHER  IMMUNO -ONCOLOGY  DRUGS  
 
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented 
by discussions with the principal investigator and Inpatient Attending. The guidance applies 
to all immuno -oncology (I -O) agents and regimens.  
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and 
appropriately treated.  
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno -oncology drug -related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with 
low-grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticoster oids should be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended. The frequency and seve rity of the related adverse 
events covered by these algorithms will depend on the immuno -oncology agent or regimen 
being used.

February 1 8, 2020  Page 60 of 64 CPRC # 2018LS110  APPENDIX 6 – RECIST 1.1 RESPONSE DEFINITIONS  
 
Baseline selection of lesions  
All lesions are measured by long and short axis (perpendicular to long axis). At baseline, all tumor lesions are identified a s 
either target lesions or non -target lesio ns and will be evaluated at baseline and every post baseline imaging timepoint.  
 
Target lesions: This trial distinguishes between (A) XRT target lesions and (B) non -irradiated target lesions. The minimum 
size of target lesions is 1.5 cm by long axis. Lymph  nodes must measure at least 1.5 cm in short axis. The maximum number 
of lesions targeted for XRT will be 3, with a maximum of 2 lesions allowed per targeted organ. For response assessment, the 
maximum number of non -irradiated target lesions followed will be 5.  
 
Non-target lesions: These are radiographically detectable lesions in excess of the number of target lesions already being 
followed ( >8 total or >2 per organ) or that do not meet size criteria for target lesion status. In the event of innumerable 
metastases, non -target lesions are limited to an additional 8 lesions. Lymph nodes must measure at least 1.0 cm in short 
axis to qualify as non -target lesions (<1cm considered non -pathologic).  
 
Baseline measurement s 
The sum of the long diameters (SOD) of A)  XRT targeted lesions and B) non -irradiated target lesions is calculated and 
referred to as SOD -A and SOD -B for the baseline timepoint. All other lesions are considered non -target lesions and also 
recorded at baseline.  
 
Radiographic response assessment s 
At each imaging timepoint, the SOD of target lesions is measured and recorded. Response is determined by calculating the 
SOD -A and SOD -B at each imaging timepoint. Any new lesions (C) are measured and recorded, and the SOD -C calculated 
for that imaging timep oint. A previously involved lymph node must also measure > 1.0 cm by short axis diameter to continue 
to qualify as pathologic.  
 
Target lesion response  
Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target  or non -target) 
must have reduction in short axis to < 1 cm.  
 
Partial response (PR): Decrease of at least 30% in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline SOD.  
 
Progressive disease (PD): Increase of at least 20% in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest prior SOD in the trial (including the baseline sum if it is the smallest).  
 
Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify f or PD, taking as 
reference the smallest SOD achieved in the trial.  
 
Non-target lesion response  
Complete response (CR): disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 
mm short axis).  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persisten ce of 1 or more non –target lesion(s).  
 
Progressive disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. (Note: appearance of 1 or more new 
lesions is considered progression).  
 
New lesion assessment  
At each imaging timepoint, presence of ne w lesions is determined, and each new lesion is recorded as a new lesion (i.e. C1, 
C2, etc.) and they are not considered target or non -target lesions.  
 
Lymph nodes must be a new lesion and measure at least 10 cm by short diameter to qualify as a new lesion  overall 
response assessment.  
 
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new 
lesion.

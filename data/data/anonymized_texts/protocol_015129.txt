Page 3 of  11 (V.04/04/2017) 1.0 Objectives
1.1 Study  Objectives
Assess the efficacy of the vein visualization device AccuVein (AccuVein, Inc., Huntington, NY) 
in comparison to a standard technique for establishing intravenous (IV) access in the infant 
population (<2 years old)
1.2 Primary  Study Endpoints
Success Rate  of IV Insertion within three allowed attempts
1.3 Secondary  Study Endpoints
Total number  of attempts and time to successful insertion
2.0 Background  
2.1 Scientific Background  and Gaps
Children undergoing aesthesia procedures need intravenous access. This may be done after 
anesthesia induction in infants. This may be challenging in the infant population under anesthesia 
when establishing IV access rapidly is paramount, as emergency drugs may need to be 
administered if a complication were to occur at induction. The infant population is especially 
challenging in this regard due to increased body fat.
2.2 Previous Data
The success rate at first attempt IV induction in children varies from 32 – 92% depending on 
provider experience. Various techniques have been tried in the past that include application of 
warming devices and use of ultrasound. Recent literature suggests use of infrared illumination to 
aid vein visualization, with a device such as the AccuVein (AccuVein, Inc., Huntington, NY), 
has been successfully used.
2.3 Study  Rationale
There are few reports of use of the AccuVein device in the infant population. Our experience 
with this device in infant population has been positive. Additionally, we think that this will be a 
good learning tool for residents to help identify a target vein for IV access.

Page 6 of  11 (V.04/04/2017) 6.2 Waiver  or Alteration of Authorization for the Uses and Disclosures of PHI
6.2.1 Access,  use or disclosure of PHI representing no more than a minimal risk to the privacy of the 
individual
6.2.1.1 Plan  to protect PHI from improper use or disclosure
Information is  included in the “Confidentiality, Privacy and Data Management” 
section of this protocol.
6.2.1.2 Plan  to destroy identifiers or a justification for retaining identifiers 
Identifiers will  be destroyed at the completion of the study.
6.2.2 Explanation for  why the research could not practicably be conducted without access to and 
use of PHI
Information must  be obtained from the subject’s electronic medical record during recruitment 
to determine eligibility and, in some cases, to confirm information discussed with the subject’s 
parent/guardian in regards to their medical history.
6.2.3 Explanation for  why the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or 
alteration of authorization
The waiver  is requested only for recruitment to determine subject eligibility to ensure that no 
medical conditions that fall into the exclusion criteria are present and would thus preclude 
enrollment.  This waiver will minimize the enrollment of subjects’ who may ultimately fail to 
meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.
6.3 Waiver  or alteration of authorization statements of agreement
Protected health  information obtained as part of this research will not be reused or disclosed to any 
other person or entity, except as required by law, for authorized oversight of the research study, or for 
other permitted uses and disclosures according to federal regulations. 
The research team will  collect only information essential to the study and in accord with the ‘Minimum 
Necessary’ standard (information reasonably necessary to accomplish the objectives of the research) 
per federal regulations. 
Access to  the information will be limited, to the greatest extent possible, within the research team. All 
disclosures or releases of identifiable information granted under this waiver will be accounted for and 
documented.
7.0 Study  Design and Procedures
7.1 Study  Design
This will  be a randomized controlled study.
The objective of  the study is to assess the efficacy of the vein visualization device in comparison to a 
standard technique in the infant population (<2years).  Subjects will be randomized to the vein 
visualization or standard group using a computer generated randomization program.

Approval: 2/18/2021
Page 7 of  11 (V.04/04/2017) 7.2 Study  Procedures
7.2.1 Day of  Surgery
After obtaining informed  consent, the infant will be randomized to the vein visualization or 
standard group based on a computer generated number.
Standard anesthesia  induction procedures will be used. This includes application of standard 
ASA monitoring at induction and standard inhalation induction with sevoflurane.
Once the  subject is deemed ready for intravenous access attempt, a tourniquet will be applied 
on the corresponding limb where IV access is contemplated.
For those randomized to  the control group (standard technique group), the standard technique 
for establishing IV access will be used.  The standard technique involves directly identifying the 
vein after application of a tourniquet, cleaning with alcohol and then siting the intravenous 
catheter. 
For those randomized to  the vein visualization group, the AccuVein device will be used as an aid 
to identify the vein after application of a tourniquet. The technique of actual insertion of the 
intravenous catheter will be the same as the standard technique. The device will be used to 
better visualize and identify the vein.
If, after  3 needle sticks, IV access has not been established using the technique for the group to 
which the subject was assigned (standard or vein finder), the care provider will use the other 
technique (standard or vein finder) to attempt to insert the IV line. 
In order  to avoid operator variation, the intravenous catheter will be inserted by an experienced 
pediatric anesthesiologist who is a member of the research team. Currently all the pediatric 
anesthesia faculty members are familiar with, and have used, the vein finder in case of difficult 
intravenous access. If a complication develops while attempting to start an IV using the vein 
finder or standard technique, and a rapid IV access is needed, it will be at the attending 
anesthesiologist’s discretion to perform the IV rapidly with either technique, since our faculty 
anesthesiologists are proficient with both techniques. Multiple anesthesiologists may attempt 
the IV simultaneously. This is how we would normally manage this situation and is the standard 
of care. If this happens we will withdraw the child from the study.
Data to be  collected:
The time  to successful IV insertion will be from the first time that the canula touches the skin to 
until successful IV access; up to 3 attempts. After the 3rd attempt, if still unsuccessful, the 
alternative technique will be used as rescue. Again, time to successful insertion will be noted. 
Success at IV will be determined by flushability with 5 ml of sterile normal saline.  The site(s) of 
access will also be recorded.
Medical Record  Information:  This information will include, but is not limited to:  Age, gender, 
physical status, weight, height, skin color, surgical procedure, presenting underlying conditions 
and co-morbidities.
7.3 Duration  of Participation
Patient participation  will end at the end of surgery.

Page 8 of  11 (V.04/04/2017) 8.0 Subject  Numbers and Statistical Plan
8.1 Number  of Subjects
A sample  size of 160 patients to include a 15% margin above the number indicated by the sample size 
determination, to allow for subject withdrawal or situations of incomplete subject data.
8.2 Sample  size determination
Assuming 90% success rate  with the vein visualization device and 95% confidence level, a sample size of 
139 patients would be needed to be enrolled in the study.  
8.3 Statistical  methods
Sigmastat software  will be used for statistical analysis. A p-value<0.05 will be considered significant. For 
statistical analysis, a chi square test will be used for comparing data on attempts and ANOVA for 
comparing data on times.
9.0 Confidentiality,  Privacy and Data Management 
See the  Research Data Plan Review Form
10.0 Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan
11.0 Risks
Loss of  confidentially is a potential risk when conducting human subject search.
Increase in  the number of IV access attempts and/or time to successful IV placement.
12.0 Potential Benefits  to Subjects and Others
12.1 Potential  Benefits to Subjects
If you  are assigned to the vein visualization group, it is possible that the insertion of your IV access line 
may take less time or need fewer needle sticks, but this is not guaranteed.
12.2 Potential  Benefits to Others
This study should  provide evidence of whether the AccuVein vein visualization device can decrease the 
number of attempts or the time to successful IV insertion in the infant population.

A Phase  2 Trial of Durvalumab  [MEDI4736]  (anti-PD-L1 Antibody)  with or without  
Tremelimumab (anti-CTLA- 4 antibody)  in Patients  with Persistent  or Recurrent  Endometrial  
Carcinoma  and Endometrial  Carcinosarcoma.  
This is a prospective,  randomized,  phase  2 study  which  will assess the efficacy  and safety  of 
a single  agent  versus  combination  immune  checkpoint  inhibition  for patients  with persistent  
or recurrent  endometrial  carcinoma or endometrial  carcinosarcoma.   Eighty  women  with 
persistent  or recurrent  endometrial  carcinoma  or endometrial  carcinosarcoma , who have  
had at least one prior platinum  chemotherapy  regimen  and have progressed will be eligible  
for treatment  if they have measurable disease and adequate  organ function.  Approximately  
40 patients  will be randomized to treatment  on one of two arms:  Durvalumab  alone  or 
Durvalumab  in combination with Tremelimumab.  Patients  with clinically  significant  
autoimmune  disease will be excluded.  Durvalumab  would  be administered intravenously  (IV) 
every  4 weeks  until unacceptable  toxicity or progression of disease (whichever  occurs  first 
(and Tremelimumab would  be administered  intravenously  (IV) every  4 weeks  for up to 4 
cycles or until unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease (whichever  occurs  first).  
Treatment  cycles  will be 28 days.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
Introduction  
 
Immune  responses  directed against  tumors  are one of the body’s  natural  defense against  the 
growth and proliferation of cancer  cells.  However,  over time and under  pressure from immune 
attack,  cancers  develop strategies  to evade immune- mediated killing  allowing  them  to develop 
unchecked.  One such  mechanism  involves  upregulation  of surface  proteins  that deliver  
inhibitory  signals  to cytotoxic T cells.  Programmed  cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is one such 
protein,  and is upregulated in a broad range of cancers  with a high frequency,  with up to 88% 
expression  in some tumor  types.  In a number  of these  cancers,  including lung (Mu et al, 2011),  
renal  (Krambeck et al, 2007),  pancreatic  (Loos  et al, 2008),  ovarian cancer  (Hamanishi  et al, 
2007),  and hematologic  malignancies  (Andorsky  et al, 2011;  Brusa  et al, 2013)  tumor  cell 
expression  of PD-L1 is associated with reduced  survival  and an unfavorable prognosis.  
 
Programmed  cell death  ligand 1 is part of a complex system of receptors  and ligands  that are 
involved  in controlling T-cell activation.  PD-L1 acts at multiple  sites in the body to help regulate 
normal  immune  responses  and is utilized  by tumors  to help evade detection and elimination  
by the host immune  system  tumor  response.  In the lymph  nodes,  PD-L1 on antigen- presenting 
cells binds  to PD-1 or CD80  on activated T cells and delivers  an inhibitory  signal  to the T cell 
(Keir et al, 2008;  Park et al, 2010).  This results  in reduced T-cell activation  and fewer  activated  
T cells in circulation.  In the tumor  microenvironment,  PD-L1 expressed on tumor  cells binds  to 
PD-1 and CD80  on activated T cells reaching the tumor.  This delivers  an inhibitory  signal  to 
those T cells,  preventing  them  from killing  target  cancer  cells and protecting the tumor  from 
immune  elimination  (Zou and Chen,  2008).  
 
Immune  responses  directed  against  tumors  are one of the body’s  natural  defenses  against  
the growth  and proliferation of cancer  cells.  T cells play a critical  role  in  antitumor  
immunity  and their infiltration  and activity  have been  linked  to improved prognosis  in a number  
of cancers  (Nakano et al, 2001;  Burt et al, 2011).  Immune  evasion,  primarily  through  
suppression of T-cell activity,  is now recognized  as one of the hallmarks  of cancer.  Such  
evasion can occur  via a range of mechanisms  including production  of suppressive cytokines  
suchas  IL-10, secretion of chemokines  and growth factors  that recruit  and sustain suppressive  
regulatory  T cells (Tregs)  and inflammatory  macrophages,  and expression of inhibitory  surface 
molecules  such  as B7-H1. Tumor  types  characterized as being responsive  to immunotherapy - 
based  approaches  include melanoma (Weber  et al, 2012),  renal  cell carcinoma  (RCC;  
McDermott,  2009),  bladder  cancer  (Kresowik,  2009),  and malignant  mesothelioma (Bograd et 
al, 2011).  Inhibition of CTLA- 4 signaling is a validated approach to cancer  therapy,  as shown  
by the approval  in 2011  of ipilimumab  for the treatment  of metastatic  melanoma based  on 
statistically  significant  and clinically  meaningful  improvement  in OS (Hodi  et al, 2010).  
 
In general,  tumor  response rates  to anti-CTLA- 4 therapy  are low (~10%).  However,  in patients  
who respond,  the responses  are generally  durable,  lasting  several  months  even in patients  
with aggressive tumors  such  as refractory  metastatic  melanoma.  Because these agents  work

through activation of the immune  system  and not by directly  targeting the tumor,  responses  
can occur  late and some  patients  may have perceived progression of their disease in advance  
of developing disease stabilization  or a tumor  response.  In some cases,  early growth  of pre- 
existing  lesions  or the appearance of new lesions  may have been  due to immune-cellinfiltration 
into the tumor  and not due to proliferation and extension of neoplastic  cells,  per se (Wolchok  
et al, 2009).  Overall,  although the impact  on conventionally -defined  PFS can be small,  durable 
response or stable disease seen in a proportion of patients  can lead to significant  prolongation  
of OS. The melanoma data with ipilimumab  clearly  demonstrate  that a small proportion of 
patients  with an objective response had significant  prolongation of OS, supporting the 
development  of this class of agents  in other  tumors.  Although Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies  of 
tremelimumab in metastatic  melanoma did not meet  the primary  endpoints  of response rate 
and OS, respectively,  the data suggest  activity  of tremelimumab in melanoma (Kirkwood  et al, 
2010;  Ribas  et al, 2013).  In a large Phase 3 randomized study  comparing tremelimumab with 
dacarbazine  (DTIC)/temozolomide  in patients  with advanced melanoma,  the reported median  
OS in the final analysis  was 12.58 months  for tremelimumab versus  10.71  months  for 
DTIC/temozolomide (HR = 1.1416,  p = 0.1272;  Ribas  et al, 2013).  
 
Immunotherapies  
 
It is increasingly  understood that cancers are recognized by the immune  system,  and, under  
some circumstances,  the immune  system  may control  or even eliminate tumors.  Studies  in 
mousemodels of transplantable tumors  have demonstrated that manipulation of co-stimulatory  
or co-inhibitory  signals  can amplify  T-cell responses  against  tumors.  This amplification  may 
be accomplished by blocking co-inhibitory  molecules,  such  as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-  
associated antigen  4 (CTLA -4) or programmed  cell death  1 (PD-1), from binding  with their 
ligands,  B7 or B7-H1 (programmed cell death  ligand  1 [PD-L1]). 
Immunotherapy  with checkpoint  inhibition  is improving  long-term disease control  for patients  
with diverse  malignancies  (Topalian 2012;  Hamid  2013;  Wolchok  2013;  Powles  2014),  
including patients  with ovarian cancer  (OC) (Hodi  2008;  Brahmer  2012).  The primary  
mediators  of adaptive immune  blockade,  whose  targeting in clinical  trials have yielded  
results,  include  CTLA -4 (Hodi  2010;  Ribas  2013),  PD-1 (Topalian 2012;  Hamid  2013;  Robert  
2014),  and PD-L1 (Brahmer  2012).  Responses  in tumors  such  as melanoma,  non-small  cell 
lung cancer,  and renal  cell cancer  have been  impressive.  
Durvalumab  (MEDI4736):  anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal  Antibody.  
 
The non-clinical and clinical  experience is fully described in the current  version  of the 
durvalumab Investigator’s  Brochure (IB Version  9.0). 
Durvalumab  is a human monoclonal  antibody  (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)  1 kappa 
subclass  that inhibits  binding of PD-L1 and is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune  
for use in the treatment  of cancer  (MedImmune is a wholly  owned subsidiary  of AstraZeneca;  
AstraZeneca/MedImmune  will be referred to as AstraZeneca  throughout  this document).  As 
durvalumab is an engineered mAb,  it does not induce  antibody -dependent   cellular  cytotoxicity  
or complement -dependent  cytotoxicity.  The proposed mechanism  of action  for durvalumab is 
interference of the interaction  of PD-L1.

PD-L1 is expressed in a broad range of cancers  with a high frequency,  up to 88% in some  
types  of cancers.  In a number  of these cancers,  including lung, the expression  of PD -L1 is 
associated with reduced  survival  and an unfavorable prognosis.  In lung cancer,  only 12% of 
patients  with tumors  expressing  PD-L1 survived  for more  than 3 years,  compared  with 20% of 
patients  with tumors  lacking  PD-L1. Based  on these findings,  an anti-PD-L1 antibody  could  
be used therapeutically  to enhance anti-tumor  immune  responses  in patients  with cancer.  
Results  of several  non-clinical  studies  using mouse tumor  models  support  this hypothesis,  
where antibodies  directed against  PD-L1 or its receptor  PD-1 showed anti-tumor  activity.  
Durvalumab  has been given  to humans  as part of ongoing studies  as a single drug or in 
combination  with other  drugs.  As of the DCO  dates  (15Apr2015  to 18Sep2015 , durvalumab IB 
version  9.0), a total of 1,910 subjects  have been enrolled and treated in 30 ongoing  
durvalumab clinical studies,  including  20 sponsored and 10 collaborative studies.  Of the 1,910  
subjects,  1,279  received  durvalumab monotherapy,  454 received durvalumab in combination  
with tremelimumab or other  anticancer  agents,  14 received  other  agents  (1 gefitinib,  13 
MEDI6383),  and 163 have been treated with blinded investigational  product.  No studies  have 
been completed or terminated  prematurely  due to toxicity.  
 
As of 09Feb2015,  PK data were  available  for 378 subjects  in the dose- escalation and dose-  
expansion phases  of  Study  CD-ON-durvalumab- 1108  following  treatment   with durvalumab  
0.1 to 10 mg/kg every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  or 15 mg/kg  every  3 weeks  (Q3W).  The maximum  
observed concentration  (Cmax) increased in an approximately  dose- proportional  manner  over 
the dose range of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg.  The area under  the concentration- time curve  from 0 to 
14 days (AUC0 -14) increased in a greater  than dose- proportional  manner  over the dose range  
of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg and increased dose- proportionally  at ≥ 3 mg/kg.  These results  suggest  
durvalumab exhibits  nonlinear  PK likely due to saturable  target -mediated  CL at doses  < 3 
mg/kg and approaches  linearity  at doses  ≥ 3 mg/kg.  Near complete target  saturation (soluble  
programmed cell death  ligand 1 [sPD -L1] and membrane bound)  is expected with durvalumab  
≥ 3 mg/kg  Q2W.  Exposures  after multiple  doses  showed accumulation consistent  with PK 
parameters  estimated from the first dose.  In addition,  PK simulations  indicate  that following  
durvalumab 10 mg/kg  Q2W  dosing,  > 90% of subjects  are expected to maintain PK exposure  
≥ 40 µg/mL throughout  the dosing  interval.  
 
As of 09Feb2015,  a total of 388 subjects  provided samples  for ADA analysis.   Only 8 of 
388 subjects  (1 subject  each in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg  cohorts,  and 4 subjects  in 10 mg/kg  
cohort)  were ADA positive  with an impact  on PK/pharmacodynamics  in 1 subject  in the 3 mg/kg  
cohort.  
 
Tremelimumab: Anti-CTLA-4  Monoc lonal  antibody

Tremelimumab is an IgG 2 kappa isotype  mAb directed against  the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte - 
associated protein 4 (CTLA -4) also known as CD152 (cluster  of differentiation 152).  This is an 
immunomodulatory  therapy  (IMT)  that is being  developed by AstraZeneca  for use in the 
treatment  of cancer.  
Binding  of CTLA- 4 to its target  ligands  (B7-1 and B7-2) provides  a negative regulatory  signal,  
which  limits  T-cell activation.  Anti-CTLA- 4 inhibitors  antagonize the binding of CTLA -4 to B7 
ligands  and enhance  human T-cell activation  as demonstrated  by increased cytokine  
(interleukin  [IL]-2 and interferon [IFN] gamma)  production  in vitro in whole  blood or peripheral  
blood mononuclear  cell (PBMC)  cultures.  In addition,  blockade of CTLA -4 binding to B7 by 
anti-CTLA- 4 antibodies  results  in markedly  enhanced T-cell activation and anti-tumor  activity  
in animal  models,  including  killing  of established murine solid tumors  and induction of 
protective anti-tumor  immunity.  Refer  to the tremelimumab IB, Edition  5.0, for more  information.  
Therefore,  it is expected that treatment  with an anti-CTLA -4 antibody,  such as tremelimumab,  
will lead to increased activation  of the human immune  system,  increasing anti-tumor  activity  in 
patients  with solid tumors.  
An extensive program  of non-clinical  and clinical  studies   has   been conducted  for 
tremelimumab both as monotherapy  and combination therapy  with conventional  anticancer  
agents  to support  various  cancer  indications  using  different  dose schedules.  As of the data (1 
November  2015 for monotherapy  studies  and 15 April 2015 to 12 July 2015 for combination 
therapy  studies),  34 sponsored clinical studies  have been conducted as part of the 
tremelimumab clinical development  program.  Of these,  13 studies  have completed and 21 are 
ongoing.  Eight  tremelimumab monotherapy  studies  have been  completed and 3 are ongoing.  
As of the data cutoff  date of 1 November  2015,  973 patients  received  tremelimumab in 
completed monotherapy  studies  and the ongoing  Study  D4881C00024 and 569 patients  have 
been treated in the ongoing blinded Phase  IIb monotherapy  Study  D4880C00003  
[DETERMINE]).  In the 3rd ongoing  monotherapy  study  (D4884C00001),  no patients  have been  
treated as of the data cutoff.  In addition,  approximately  59 patients  have been treated with 
tremelimumab in monotherapy  arms  of combination  studies.  Five studies  of tremelimumab  in 
combination  with other  anticancer  agents  have been  completed and 18 are ongoing.  In total, 
250 patients  with a variety  of tumor  types  have received tremelimumab  in combination  with 
other  anticancer  agents.  Refer  to the current  tremelimumab IB for a complete summary  of 
non-clinical and clinical  information;  see Section 11.0 for guidance on management  of 
tremelimumab -related  toxicities.  Tremelimumab exhibited a biphasic  PK profile  with a long 
terminal  phase  half-life of 22 days.  Overall,  a low incidence of ADAs  (<6%)  was observed for 
treatment  with tremelimumab.  
 
Durvalumab  in combination with tremelimumab  
Targeting both PD-1 and CTLA- 4 pathways  may have additive  or synergistic activity  because 
the mechanisms  of action  of CTLA -4 and PD-1 are non-redundant;  therefore,  AstraZeneca  is 
also investigating the use of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy  for the 
treatment  of cancer.

with advanced NSCLC.  The dosing schedule utilized  is durvalumab every  2 weeks  (q2w)  or 
every  4 weeks  (q4w)  up to Week  50 and 48 (12 months),  combined with tremelimumab q4w 
up to Week  24 for 7 doses  then every  12 weeks  for 2 additional  doses  for up to 12 months.  
The study  is ongoing  and continues  to accrue.  
Study  D4190C00006:  As of 20Feb2015 102 patients  have been treated,  and durvalumab PK 
(n = 55) and tremelimumab PK (n = 26) data were  available from 10 cohorts  (1a, 2a, 3a, 3b, 
4, 4a, 5, 5a, 8, and 9) following  durvalumab every  4 weeks  (Q4W)  or Q2W  dosing in 
combination with tremelimumab Q4W  regimens.  An approximately  dose- proportional  increase  
in PK exposure (Cmax  and area under  the concentration- time curve  from 0 to 28 days 
[AUC0 -28]) of both durvalumab and tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 3 to 
15 mg/kg durvalumab Q4W  and 1 to 10 mg/kg  tremelimumab  Q4W.  Exposures  following  
multiple  doses  demonstrated  accumulation consistent  with PK parameters  estimated from the 
first dose.  It is to be noted that steady  state PK parameters  are based  on limited  numbers  of 
subjects.  The observed PK exposures  of durvalumab and tremelimumab following  combination  
were  consistent  with respective  monotherapy  data,  indicating no PK interaction between these 
2 agents.  
 
As of 20Feb2015,  ADA data were  available from 60 subjects for durvalumab and 53 subjects  
for tremelimumab in Study  D4190C00006.  Four of 60 subjects  were  ADA positive for anti-
durvalumab antibodies  post treatment.  One of 53 subjects  was ADA positive  for anti-
tremelimumab  antibodies  post treatment.  There  was no clear  relationship  between ADA and 
the dose  of either  durvalumab or tremelimumab,  and no obvious  associationbetween ADA and 
safety  or efficacy.  
 
Durvalumab has also been combined with other  anticancer  agents,  including  gefitinib,  
dabrafenib,  and trametinib.  To date,  no PK interaction  has been  observed between 
durvalumab and these agents.  
 
As an antibody  that blocks  the interaction  between PD-L1 and its receptors,  durvalumab may 
relieve  PD-L1-dependent  immunosuppressive effects  and, therefore,   enhance the cytotoxic 
activity of anti-tumor  T-cells.  This hypothesis  is supported  by emerging  clinical  data from other  
mAbs  targeting the PD-L1/PD -1 pathway,  which  provide early evidence of clinical activity  and 
a manageable safety  profile.  Responses  have been observed in patients  with PD-L1-positive  
tumors  and patients  with PD-L1-negative tumors.  In addition,  durvalumab  monotherapy  has 
shown  durable responses  in NSCLC in Study  1108  (see Section 1.4.1.1).  
The rationale for combining durvalumab and tremelimumab is that the mechanisms  of CTLA -4 
and PD-1 are non-redundant,  suggesting  that targeting both pathways  may have additive  or 
synergistic  activity.  In fact, combining  immunotherapy  agents  has been  shown  to result  in 
improved  response  rates  (RRs)  relative  to monotherapy.  For example,  the concurrent  
administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab  to patients  with advanced melanoma 
 
 
induced higher  objective response  rates  (ORRs)  than those obtained with single -agent  
therapy.   Importantly,  responses  appeared  to be deep and durable.   Similar  results  have been

observed in an ongoing study  of durvalumab + tremelimumab in NSCLC,  with further  updated  
details  presented  in this clinical study  protocol.  
Durvalumab   + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  dose  rationale 
The durvalumab + tremelimumab doses  and regimen selected for this study  are based on the 
goal of selecting an optimal  combination  dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab that would  
yield sustained target  suppression (sPD -L1), demonstrate promising  efficacy,  and have an 
acceptable  safety  profile.  
 
In order  to reduce  the dosing frequency  of durvalumab to align with the q4w dosing  of 
tremelimumab,  while  ensuring an acceptable PK/PDx,  safety,  and efficacy  profile,  cohorts  were  
narrowed  to 15 and 20 mg/kg  durvalumab q4w. PK simulations  from the durvalumab 
monotherapy  data indicated that a similar  area under  the plasma  drug concentration- time 
curve  at steady  state  (AUCss;  4 weeks)  was expected following  both 10 mg/kg q2w and 
20 mg/kg  q4w durvalumab.  The observed durvalumab PK data from the D4190C00006 study  
were well in line with the predicted monotherapy  PK data developed  preclinically.  This 
demonstrates  similar  exposure of durvalumab 20 mg/kg  q4w and 10 mg/kg  q2w, with no 
alterations  in PK when  durvalumab and tremelimumab (doses  ranging from 1 to 3 mg/kg)  are 
dosed  together.  While  the median  Cmax  at steady  state  (Cmax,ss)  is expected to be higher  
with 20 mg/kg  q4w (approximately  1.5 fold) and median  trough concentration  at steady  state  
(Ctrough,ss)  is expected to be higher  with 10 mg/kg  q2w (approximately  1.25 fold),  this is not 
expected to impact  the overall  safety  and efficacy  profile,  based on existing  preclinical  and 
clinical data.  
 
Monotonic  increases  in PDx activity  were observed with increasing doses  of tremelimumab  
relative  to the activity  observed in patients  treated with durvalumab monotherapy.  There was 
evidence of augmented  PDx activity  relative  to durvalumab monotherapy  with combination  
doses  containing  1 mg/kg tremelimumab,  inclusive  of both the 15 and 20 mg/kg durvalumab 
plus 1 mg/kg tremelimumab combinations.  
Patients  treated with doses  of tremelimumab above 1 mg/kg had a higher  rate of adverse 
events  (AEs),  including discontinuations  due to AEs, serious  AEs (SAEs),  and severe  AEs. 
Between the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab and 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 
3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohorts  treated at the q2w schedule,  the number of patients  reporting 
any AE, Grade  3 AEs, SAEs,  and treatment -related AEs was higher  in the 10 mg/kg  
durvalumab + 3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort  than the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg  
tremelimumab cohort.  A similar  pattern was noted in the q4w regimens,  suggesting  that, as 
the dose  of tremelimumab  increased above 1 mg/kg,  a higher  rate of treatment -related  events  
may be anticipated.  Further,  the SAEs  frequently  attributed to immunotherapy,  pneumonitis  
and colitis,  were  more  commonly  seen in cohorts  using either  3 or 10 mg/kg  of 
 
 
 
tremelimumab compared to the 1-mg/kg  dose cohorts.  Together,  these data suggest  that a 
combination  using a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg  appeared  to minimize  the rate of toxicity

when combined with durvalumab.  As a result,  all combination  doses  utilizing  either  the 3 or 
10 mg/kg  doses  of tremelimumab  were  eliminated  in the final dose selection.  
 
In contrast,  cohorts  assessing  higher  doses  of durvalumab with a constant  dose of 
tremelimumab did not show  an increase  in the rate of AEs. The data suggested  that increasing 
doses  of durvalumab may not impact  the safety  of the combination  as much as the 
tremelimumab dose.  Further,  safety  data between  the 10-mg/kg and 20-mg/kg  cohorts  were  
similar,  with no change  in safety  events  with increasing dose of durvalumab.  
 
In Study  D4190C00006,  of all treatment  cohorts,  the cohort  of 11 patients   treated in  the 
20 mg/kg  durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab group had the fewest  AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, 
SAEs,  and treatment  discontinuations  due to AEs, but still showed strong evidence of clinical 
activity.  This cohort  had a lower  number  of treatment  related Grade  ≥3 AEs or treatment  
related SAEs.   No dose- limiting  toxicities  were  reported.  
 
Preliminary  clinical activity of the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination did not appear  
to change  with increasing doses  of tremelimumab.  The 15- and 20-mg/kg  durvalumab q4w 
cohorts  demonstrated  objective responses  at all doses  of tremelimumab,  and increasing doses  
of tremelimumab did not provide deeper  or more  rapid responses.  
Efficacy  data suggested  that the 20 mg/kg  durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort  
may demonstrate  equivalent  clinical activity   to other   dose  combinations.   A  total  of  5 of 
11 patients  in the 20 mg/kg  durvalumab + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab cohort  were  evaluable for 
efficacy  with at least 8 weeks  of follow -up. Of these,  there were  2 patients  (40%)  with partial  
response (PR),  1 patient  (20%)  with stable  disease (SD),  and 1 patient  (20%)  with progressive  
disease (PD).  The fifth patient  had only a single  scan,  which  was conducted outside  the 
window  for these evaluations.  
 
Additionally,  of all cohorts,  the 20 mg/kg  durvalumab + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab dose cohort  
had the fewest  AEs, Grade  ≥3 AEs, SAEs,  and treatment  discontinuations  due to AEs, but still 
showed some evidence of clinical  activity.   All together,  the data suggested that a 20 mg/kg  
durvalumab + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab  dose combination  should  be selected for further  
development.  
 
Long term  data 
 
Long- term follow  up on melanoma patients  treated with ipilimumab,  an anti-CTLA -4 targeting  
antibody  (dosed every  3 weeks  [q3w]  for 4 doses  and then discontinued),  shows  that patients  
responding to ipilimumab  derive  long-term benefit,  with a 3-year OS rate of approximately  22%.  
Furthermore,  the survival  curve  in this population reached  a plateau at 3 years   and was 
maintained through 10 years  of follow up. 
 
Similar  data have been  presented  for other  anti-PD-1/PD -L1 targeting antibodies:  
 
o Nivolumab  (anti-PD-1) was dosed  q2w for up to 96 weeks  in a large Phase I dose -
escalation and expansion study,  and showed responses  were  maintained for a 
median of 22.94  months  for melanoma (doses  0.1 mg/kg  to 10 mg/kg),  17 months  for 
NSCLC (doses  1, 3, and 10 mg/kg),  and 12.9 months  for renal  cell carcinoma  patients

(doses  1 and 10 mg/kg)  at the time of data analysis.  Furthermore,  responses  were 
maintained beyond treatment  discontinuation in the majority  of patients  who stopped  
nivolumab treatment  (either  due to protocol  specified  end of treatment,  complete  
response [CR],  or toxicity)  for up to 56 weeks  at the time of data analysis.  
 
o MPDL3280a (anti-PD-L1) and the combination  of nivolumab with ipilimumab,  in which  
patients  were  dosed for a finite time period and responses  maintained beyond treatment  
discontinuation have been reported 
 
Similar  long term results   may  be expected with use of other  immune- mediated cancer  
therapeutics  including anti-CTLA- 4 antibodies  such  as tremelimumab,  anti PD-L1 antibodies  
such  as durvalumab,  or the combination  of the two. 
Immune  checkpoint  Inhibition  in endometrial  carcinomas  
 
Endometrial  carcinomas  encompass  several  different  histologies,  which  include  
endometrioid,  serous,  clear  cell, and carcinosarcoma.   Endometrial  cancer  is the second  
leading cause of death from gynecologic  cancer  with an estimated  8,590  women  dying  in the 
United  Stated  annually  (Seigel  et al, 2014)).  Carboplatin and paclitaxel  is the standard  first 
line treatment  regimen  (Miller  et al, 2012)  for advanced recurrent  or persistent  disease,  but 
unfortunately,  there  are no FDA approved treatments  for patients  who progress  on first line 
therapy with the exception of Megac e as a pallia tive treatment for advanced endom etrial 
carcinomas.  As a result,  there is tremendous  opportunity  for the development  of rationally  
therapeutic  agents  in the recurrent/persistent  endometrial  cancer  space.  Specifically,  
strategies  reversing tumor  promoting processes  involving  the interaction  between tumor - 
infiltrating  T-cells and the host microenvironment  would  be tremendously  worthwhile,  
especially  in genetically  unstable tumors.  
While  patients  with endometrial  cancer  have not been included in the initial studies  using 
immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  there  is a high rationale for such  studies.  Multiple  studies  have 
investigated the tumor  microenvironment  in different  subtypes  of endometrial  cancer.  
Similarly  to other  tumor  types,  tumor -infiltrating  CD8 T lymphocytes  have been demonstrated  
to carry  positive  prognostic  implications  for patients  with endometrial  cancer  (Kondratiev,  
2004),  while  hypermutated genotypes  are associated with increased numbers  of tumor - 
infiltrating  lymphocytes  and PD-L1 expression (Howitt,  2015),  as discussed  below.  
Early  work in endometrial  cancer  has shown  that the majority  of tumor  infiltrating   
lymphocytes  (TILs)  in endometrial  carcinomas  express  the CD8+  suppressor/cytotoxic  
phenotype,  and minor  subsets  express  B-lymphocyte and macrophage  markers.   The 
earliest  evidence demonstrating that increased numbers  of CD8+  T lymphocytes  (CTLs)  
were associated with survival  came from immunohistochemical  staining  CD8(+)  T cells in the 
following  four regions:  lymphocytes  infiltrating the tumor  epithelium  at the invasive  border,  
within  the underlying tumor  stroma,  within  the superficial  tumor  epithelium,  and in the 
perivascular  areas  of the myometrium  in endometrial  carcinoma  patients.  Results  showed 
that patients  with >10 CD8(+)  T lymphocytes/high -power  field within  the tumor  epithelium  at 
the invasive  border  displayed improved overall  survival  compared with patients  with fewer  
intraepithelial  CD8(+)  T lymphocytes  (87 and 50%,  respectively;  P = 0.027).  Multivariate 
analysis  revealed that stage,  vascular  invasion,  grade,  and the number  of intraepithelial

CD8(+)  T lymphocytes  at the invasive  border  were  the only independent  predictors  of  
survival  (P < 0.0001,  P = 0.001,  P = 0.011,  and P = 0.025,  respectively).  Granzyme B(+) 
cytoplasmatic  granules  were  detected in a high proportion of CTLs,  confirming their activated  
cytotoxic phenotype.  (Kondratiev,  2004)  
Immunohistochemistry  on tissue  microarrays  containing tumor  from 368 FIGO  stage  I-IV 
endometrial  cancer  patients  revealed  that high numbers  of intra-tumoral  CD8(+)  T- 
lymphocytes,  a high CD8(+)/FoxP3(+)  ratio and the presence of CD45R0(+)  T-lymphocytes  
were  strongly  associated with well-known favorable prognostic  factors  in endometrial  cancer.  
Furthermore,  high numbers  of CD8(+)  T-lymphocytes  and a high CD8(+)/FoxP3(+)  ratio were  
associated  with a better  disease free survival  (DFS).  In multivariate analysis,  high numbers   
of CD8(+)  T-lymphocytes  had an independent  prognostic  impact  for overall  survival  in the 
entire cohort  (HR 0.48,  95% C.I. 0.26- 0.89,  p=0.019)  and in type II endometrial  cancer  (HR 
0.17,  95% C.I. 0.08- 0.36,  p<0.001).  A high CD8(+)/FoxP3(+)  ratio was independently  
associated with improved  survival  in type I endometrial  cancer  (HR 0.44,  95% C.I. 0.23- 0.84,  
p=0.013).  CD45R0(+)  lymphocytes  were  an independent  factor  for improved OS (HR 0.42,  
95% C.I. 0.19- 0.93,  p=0.033).  (de Jong,  2009)  
The Cancer  Genome Atlas (TCGA)  recently  reported on the genomic,  transcriptomic,  and 
proteomic  analysis  of 373 endometrial  carcinomas  using massively  parallel  sequencing  and 
array -based  technologies,  in combination  with DNA methylation,  reverse- phase protein array,  
and microsatellite  instability  analyses.(Kandoth,  2013)  Based  on the integration of the  
somatic  gene  mutations,  microsatellite  instability,  and somatic  copy-number alterations  
results,  endometrial  carcinomas  were  categorized  into four genomic  groups:  (1) A group of 
‘ultramutated’  tumors  characterized by very high mutation  rates,  all harboring mutations  in 
the exonuclease domain  of the polymerase  epsilon  (POLE)  gene;  (2) A ‘hypermutated’  group 
of endometrial  carcinomas  characterized by microsatellite  instability  due to MLH1  promoter  
methylation,  with high mutation  rates  and few copy-number  alterations;  (3) A ‘copynumber  
low’ group comprised of most  of the microsatellite  stable  grade 1 and grade 2 endometrioid 
carcinomas  with low mutation  rates;  and (4) A group of ‘copy -number  high’ tumors  with 
extensive copy number  aberrations,  low mutation rates,  and recurrent  TP53  mutations  
comprised of serous  carcinomas  and 25% of FIGO (International  Federation of Gynecology  
and Obstetrics)  grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomas.  With regards  to clinical  outcome,  
ultramutated endometrial  carcinomas  with POLE exonuclease domain  mutations  had a 
favorable  progression free survival  as compared  with the other  three  TCGA  genomic  groups.  
(Kandoth,  2013)  It has been suggested  that hypermutated tumors  may harbor  more  tumor  
specific  neoantigens  and increased amounts  of TILs.  Therefore,  an assessment  of whether  
POLE  and MSI ECs harbor  more  neoantigens  and TILs than the comparatively  hypomutated 
microsatellite -stable (MSS) ECs was performed.  Prediction of neoantigen  load was 
performed  using sequencing data from the Cancer  Genome Atlas data set. Evaluation  of 
tumor -infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs)  and PD-1 and PD-L1 expression  was performed in 63 
patients  with EC referred to our institution.  The predicted  median  (range)  neoantigen load 
(predicted  neoepitopes  per sample)  was proportional  to the mutational  load: highest  in 
ultramutated polymerase  e (POLE)  tumors  (8342 [628-20 440]),  less in hypermutated MSI 
(541 [146-8063];  P < .001),  and lowest  in microsatellite -stable tumors  (70.5 [7-1877];  
P < .001).  The POLE and MSI ECs exhibited higher  numbers  of CD3+  (44.5  vs 21.8;  
P = .001)  and CD8+ (32.8 vs 13.5;  P < .001)  TILs compared  with microsatellite -stable tumors.

PD-1 was overexpressed in TILs (81%  vs 28%;  P < .001)  and peritumoral  lymphocytes  (90%  
vs 28%;  P < .001)  of POLE  and MSI tumors.  PD-L1 expression was infrequently  noted in 
tumor  cells but was common in intraepithelial  immune  cells and more  frequent  in POLE and 
MSI tumors  (39%  vs 13%;  P = .02).  (Howitt,  2015)  
Taken together,  we believe  that this data provides  abundant  rationale  to investigate  the 
efficacy  of the anti-PD-L1 agent  durvalumab with or without  the anti-CTLA4  agent  
tremelimumab in patients  with advanced/recurrent  endometrial  malignancies.   At this time,  
there is tremendous  interest  in evaluating immune check -point  inhibitors  in advanced  
endometrial  cancers.  
Rationale  for combining  Durvalumab  and Tremelimumab  in Endometrial  Carcinomas  
 
There is sound  rationale for evaluating the combination  of durvalumab and tremelimumab for 
the treatment  of advanced endometrial  carcinomas.  Firstly,  the mechanisms  of activation  of 
known sites for activity  of CTLA -4 and PD-1 are non-redundant,  suggesting  that targeting 
both pathways  may have additive or synergistic  activity.  Secondly,  preclinical  data in mouse  
models  of transplantable solid tumors,  and clinical data emerging  from studies  in melanoma 
supports  the superior  anti-tumor  activity  of combination  therapy  over monotherapy,  albeit  at 
increased toxicity  (Larkin,  2015 #9006).  Based  upon these observations,  combination 
therapy  may generate superior  anti-tumor  activity,  which  may translate into higher  rates  of 
response in tumors.  However,  as yet, it is not known whether  combination  therapy  will result  
in superior  activity  in comparison to single  agent  durvalumab in endometrial  cancer  and 
whether  the combination  will be safe in this patient  population.  
For this study,  we hypothesize  that durvalumab plus tremelimumab will be well tolerated and 
will be associated with higher  efficacy  than the durvalumab alone in patients  with advanced 
endometrial  cancer  and endometrial  carcinosarcoma.  
 
 
Efficacy  Data  
Durvalumab  
The majority  of the safety  and efficacy  data currently  available  for durvalumab are based  on 
the first time in-human,  single- agent  study  (Study  1108)  in patients  with advanced solid tumors.  
Data from Study  1108  were presented  at the European Society  for Medical  Oncology  2014  
Congress.  Overall,  456 of 694 subjects   treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W  were  
evaluable for response (defined as having ≥ 24 weeks  follow -up, measurable disease at 
baseline,  and ≥ 1 follow- up scan,  or discontinued  due to disease progression or death without  
any follow -up scan).  In PD-L1 unselected  patients,  the objective response rate (ORR),  based  
on investigator  assessment  per Response Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  v1.1, 
ranged from 0% in uveal  melanoma (n = 23) to 20.0%  in bladder  cancer  (n = 15), and disease 
control  rate at 24 weeks  (DCR -24w)  ranged from 4.2%  in triple-negative breast  cancer  (TNBC;  
n = 24) to 39.1%  in advanced cutaneous  melanoma (n = 23). PD-L1 status  was known for 383 
of the 456 response evaluable subjects.  Across  the PD-L1-positive  tumors,  ORR was highest  
for bladder  cancer,  advanced cutaneous  melanoma,  hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC;  n = 3 
each,  33.3%  each),  NSCLC (n = 86, 26.7%),  and squamous  cell carcinoma  of the head  and

neck (SCCHN;  n = 22, 18.2%).  In the PD-L1-positive  subset,  DCR -24w was highest  in 
advanced cutaneous  melanoma (n = 3, 66.7%),  NSCLC (n = 86, 36.0%),  HCC and bladder  
cancer  (n = 3 each,  33.3%  each),  and SCCHN (n = 22, 18.2%).  
 
Tremelimumab  
In a single -arm, Phase  II study  (Study  A3671008)  of tremelimumab administered  at 15 mg/kg  
every  90 days to patients  with refractory  melanoma,  an RR of  7% and  a median  OS of 
10 months  in the second- line setting (as compared to approximately  6 months  with best 
supportive care reported from a retrospective analysis).  In a randomized,  open- label,  first-line 
Phase  III study  of tremelimumab (administered at 15 mg/kg  every  90 days)  versus  
chemotherapy  (dacarbazine  or temozolomide)  in advanced melanoma  (Study  A3671009),  
results of the final analysis  showed an RR of 11% and a median OS of 12.6 months  in this first 
line setting as compared  to 10.71 months  with standard  chemotherapy;  however,  these results  
were not statistically  significant.  Additionally,   a Phase  II maintenance  study  (Study  A3671015)  
in patients  with Stage  IIIB or IV NSCLC who had responded or remained  stable  failed  to 
achieve statistical  significance.  The primary  endpoint  of PFS at 3 months  was 22.7%  in the 
tremelimumab arm (15 mg/kg)  compared with 11.9%  in the best  supportive  care  arm 
(Study  A3671015).  
Durvalumab  + tremelimumab  
The preclinical  and clinical justification  for this combination  as noted  in Section 1.1.4 also 
supports  the synergy  of this combination.  Available  data,  such  as those presented by 
Wolchok  et al, suggest  that the combination  of agents  targeting PD-1/PD -L1 and CTLA- 4 may 
have profound and durable benefits  in patients  with melanoma.  Of the 102 subjects  with 
advanced NSCLC treated with durvalumab in combination  with tremelimumab in Study  
 
D4190C00006,  63 subjects  with at least 16 weeks  of follow -up were evaluable for response  
(defined as measurable  disease at baseline and at least 1 follow- up scan;  this included  
discontinuations  due to disease progression or death without  follow -up scan).  Of the 63 
evaluable subjects,  17 (27%)  had a best overall  response of PR, 14 (22%)  had SD, 22 (35%)  
had PD, and 10 (16%)  were  not evaluable.  The ORR (confirmed and unconfirmed  CR or PR) 
was 27% and the DCR (CR, PR, or SD) was 49% as assessed  by RECIST  v1.1. 
 
Current  experience with single- agent  IMT studies  suggests  that clinical responses  may be 
restricted to a subset  of any given patient  population and that it might  be beneficial  to enrich 
the patient  population by selecting patients  likely to respond  to therapy.  To date,  no assayhas 
been established  or validated,  and no single  approach  has proven accurate,  for patient  
enrichment  for IMTs. However,  independent  data from multiple  sources  using  different  assays  
and scoring  methods  suggests  that PD-L1 expression  on tumor  cells and/or  tumor  infiltrating  
cells may be associated with greater  clinical benefit.  
Data from ongoing studies  with durvalumab and other  agents  targeting the PD-1/PD -L1 
pathway  suggest,  as shown  in a number  of tumor  types  (e.g.,  NSCLC,  renal  cell carcinoma,  
and melanoma),  that monotherapy  may be more  efficacious  (in terms  of ORR)  in patients  who 
are PD-L1-positive.

Given  these findings,  a number  of ongoing studies  are assessing  the activity  of agents  in 
patients  with PD-L1–positive  tumors.  There  is also an unmet  medical  need  in patients  with 
PD-L1–negative tumors  that needs   to be addressed.  Data,  as  of 27 January  2015  from 
Study  006 show  that with the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab,  the ORR can be 
increased to 25% in patients  with PD-L1 negative NSCLC.  As patients  with PD-L1 positive  
disease can also have an increase  in ORR,  from 25% with durvalumab monotherapy,  to 36% 
with the combination  of durvalumab and tremelimumab,  the study  will enroll  all patients  with 
NSCLC,  with an emphasis  on those  determined to be PD-L1 negative.  
Potential  risks 
Potential  risks,  based  on the mechanism  of action  of durvalumab and related molecules,  
include  immune -mediated  reactions,  such  as colitis,  pneumonitis,  hepatitis/hepatotoxicity,  
neuropathy/neuromuscular  toxicity,  endocrinopathy,  dermatitis,  pancreatitis  and nephritis.  
Additional  important  potential  risks include infusion related reactions,  hypersens itivity,  
anaphylaxis   or serious  allergic  reactions,  serious  infections,  and immune  complex disease.  
 
Study  CD-ON-durvalumab- 1108:  The safety   profile  of  durvalumab  monotherapy   in  the 
694 subjects  with advanced solid tumors  treated at 10 mg/kg Q2W  in Study  CD-ON-
durvalumab -1108  has been broadly  consistent  with that of the overall  1,279  subjects  who 
have received  durvalumab monotherapy  (not including subjects  treated with blinded 
investigational  product)  across the clinical development  program.  The majority  of treatment  
related AEs were  manageable with dose delays,  symptomatic  treatment,  and in the case of 
events  suspected to have an immune  basis,  the use of established  treatment  guidelines  for 
immune -mediated toxicity.  As of 07May2015,  among the 694 subjects  treated with durvalumab 
10 mg/kg  Q2W  in Study  CD-ON-durvalumab -1108,  a total of 378 subjects  (54.5%)  
experienced a treatment -related  AE, with the most  frequent  (occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects)  
being  fatigue (17.7%),  nausea  (8.6%),  diarrhea (7.3%),  decreased appetite  (6.8%),  pruritus  
(6.3%),  rash (6.1%),  and vomiting  (5.0%).  A majority  of the treatment  related AEs were  Grade 
1 or Grade 2 in severity  with ≥ Grade 3 events  occurring  in 65 subjects  (9.4%).  Treatment  
related ≥ Grade  3 events  reported in 3 or more  subjects  (≥ 0.4%)  were  fatigue (12 subjects,  
1.7%);  increased aspartate  aminotransferase (AST;  7 subjects,  1.0%);  increased gamma - 
glutamyltransferase (GGT;  6 subjects,  0.9%);  increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT;  5 
subjects,  0.7%);  and colitis,  vomiting,  decreased appetite,  and hyponatremia (3 subjects,  0.4%  
each).  Six subjects  had treatment  related Grade 4 AEs (upper  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage,  
increased AST,  dyspnea,  neutropenia,  colitis,  diarrhea,  and pneumonitis)  and 1 subject  had a 
treatment -related  Grade  5 event  (pneumonia).  Treatment  related serious  adverse  events  
(SAEs)  that occurred  in ≥ 2 subjects  were  colitis  and pneumonitis  (3 subjects  each).  A majority  
of the treatment -related SAEs  were  ≥ Grade  3 in severity  and resolved with or without  
sequelae.  AEs that resulted in permanent  discontinuation  of durvalumab were  considered as 
treatment  related in 18 subjects  (2.6%),  with colitis  being the most  frequent  treatment -related 
AE resulting  in discontinuation (3 subjects).  A majority  of the treatment  related AEs resulting  
in discontinuation of durvalumab were  ≥ Grade  3 in severity  and resolved with or without  
sequelae.

durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W.  As of 05May2015,  264 of 303 subjects  (87.1%)  reported any AE 
in Study  D4191C00003/ATLANTIC.  Overall,  events  reported in ≥ 10% of subjects  were 
dyspnea (18.8%),  fatigue  (17.8%),  decreased appetite  (17.5%),  cough (14.2%),  pyrexia  
(12.2%),  asthenia (11.9%),  and nausea (11.2%).  Nearly  two thirds  of the subjects  experienced 
AEs that were Grade 1 or 2 in severity  and manageable by general  treatment  guidelines  as 
described in the current  durvalumab study  protocols.  Grade 3 or higher  AEs were  reported in 
107 of 303 subjects  (35.3%).  A total of 128 subjects  (42.2%)  reported AEs that were  
considered by the investigator  as related to investigational  product.  Treatment  related AEs (all 
grades)  reported in ≥ 2% of subjects  were  decreased appetite  (6.6%);  fatigue (5.9%);  asthenia 
(5.0%);  nausea  (4.6%);  pruritus  (4.3%);  diarrhea,  hyperthyroidism,  hypothyroidism,  and 
pyrexia  (3.3%  each);  rash (2.6%);  weight  decreased (2.3%);  and vomiting  (2.0%).  Treatment  
related Grade  3 AEs reported in ≥ 2 subjects  were  pneumonitis  (3 subjects)  and increased  
GGT (2 subjects).  There was no  treatment   related  Grade   4  or  5  AEs.  Ninety -four  of 
303 subjects  (31.0%)  reported any SAE.  SAEs  that occurred  in ≥ 1.0%  of subjects  were  
dyspnea (6.6%);  pleural  effusion,  general  physical  health deterioration (2.3%  each);  
pneumonia (2.0%);  hemoptysis,  pulmonary  embolism  (1.3%  each);  and pneumonitis,  
respiratory  failure,  disease progression (1.0%  each).  Nine subjects  had an SAE considered by 
the investigator  as related to durvalumab.  Each  treatment  related SAE occurred  in 1 subject  
each with the exception of pneumonitis,  which  occurred  in 3 subjects.  Fifteen of 303 subjects 
(5.0%)  have died due to an AE (pneumonia [3 subjects];  general  physical  health  deterioration,  
disease progression,  hemoptysis,  dyspnea [2 subjects  each];  pulmonary  sepsis,  respiratory  
distress,  cardiopulmonary  arrest  [verbatim  term (VT)],  hepatic  failure,  and sepsis [1 subject  
each]).  None of these  events   was  considered  related  to  durvalumab.   Twenty -three   of 
303 subjects  (7.6%)  permanently  discontinued durvalumab treatment  due to AEs. Events  that 
led to discontinuation of durvalumab in ≥ 2 subjects  were  dyspnea,  general  physical  health  
deterioration,  and pneumonia.  Treatment -related  AEs that led to discontinuation  were  
increased ALT and increased hepatic  enzyme,  which  occurred  in 1 subject  each.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Date:  Tremelimumab  
Potential  risks,  based  on the mechanism  of action  of tremelimumab  and related molecules  
(ipilimumab)  include  potentially  immune- mediated gastrointestinal  (GI) events  including  
enterocolitis,  intestinal  perforation,  abdominal  pain, dehydration,  nausea  and vomiting,  and 
decreased appetite (anorexia);  dermatitis  including urticaria,  skin exfoliation,  and dry skin; 
endocrinopathies  including hypophysitis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  and hyperthyroidism  and 
hypothyroidism;  hepatitis  including autoimmune  hepatitis  and increased serum  ALT and AST;  
pancreatitis  including autoimmune pancreatitis  and lipase  and amylase elevation;  respiratory  
tract events  including  pneumonitis  and interstitial  lung disease (ILD);  nervous  system  events  
including encephalitis,  peripheral  motor  and sensory  neuropathies,  and Guillain -Barré  
syndrome;  cytopenias  including  thrombocytopenia,  anemia,  and neutropenia;  infusion -related  
reactions;  anaphylaxis;  and serious  allergic  reactions.  The profile  of AEs and the spectrum  of 
event  severity  have remained  stable  across  the tremelimumab  clinical program  and are 
consistent  with the pharmacology  of the target.  To date,  no tumor  type or stage appears  to be 
associated with unique AEs (except  for vitiligo  that appears  to be confined to patients  with 
melanoma).   Overall,  944 of the 973 patients  (97.0%)  treated with tremelimumab  monotherapy  
as of the data cutoff  date of 1 November 2015 (for all studies  except  D4190C00006 that has 
a cutoff  date  of 15Apr2015 and  not including 497  patients  who have  been treated  in the

ongoing  blinded Phase  IIb Study  D4880C00003)  experienced at least 1 AE. The events  that 
resulted in discontinuation of tremelimumab in 10.0%  of patients,  were  serious  in 36.5%,  were 
Grade  ≥3 in severity in 49.8%,  were  fatal in 67.7%,  and were  considered to be treatment  
related in 79.1%  of patients.  The frequency  of any AEs and Grade  ≥3 AEs was generally  
similar  across the tremelimumab dose groups.  However,  a higher  percentage of patients  in 
the 10 mg/kg every  28 days and 15 mg/kg every  90 days groups  compared with the All Doses  
<10 mg/kg  group experienced treatment -related  AEs, SAEs,  AEs resulting  in discontinuation  
of investigational  product  (IP), and deaths.  
No safety  studies  in animals  have been performed  combining  tremelimumab with durvalumab.  
As both CTLA- 4 and PD-L1 have mechanisms  of actions  that enhance activation of immune  
cells,  their potential  to induce  cytokine  release was tested in a whole -blood  assay  system.  
Durvalumab  and tremelimumab,  either  alone or in combination,  did not induce  cytokine  release  
in blood from any donor.  
Study  D4190C00006:  The safety  profile  of durvalumab and tremelimumab combination 
therapy  in the 102 subjects  with advanced NSCLC in Study  D4190C00006 is generally  
consistent  with that observed across  177 subjects  treated with durvalumab  and tremelimumab  
combination  therapy  (not including subjects  treated with blinded  investigational  product).  As of 
15Apr2015,  95 of 102 subjects  (93.1%)  reported at least 1 AE. All subjects  in the 
tremelimumab 3 and 10 mg/kg  dose cohorts  experienced AEs; subjects  in the durvalumab 
20 mg/kg  and tremelimumab 1 mg/kg  Q4W  cohort  experienced the lowest  AE rate (77.8%).  
Treatment -related  AEs were  reported in 74 of 102 subjects  (72.6%),  with events  occurring in 
> 10% of subjects  being  diarrhea (27.5%),  fatigue (22.5%),  increased  amylase and pruritus  
(14.7%  each),  rash (12.7%),  colitis  (11.8%),  and increased lipase  (10.8%).  Treatment -related 
≥ Grade  3 AEs reported in ≥ 5% of subjects  were  colitis  (8.8%),  diarrhea (7.8%),  and increased 
lipase  (5.9%).  Five subjects  reported treatment -related Grade 4 events  (sepsis,  increased ALT, 
and increased AST in 1 subject;  increased amylase  in 2 subjects;  myasthenia gravis  in 1 
subject;  and pericardial  effusion  in 1 subject)  and 2 subjects  had treatment -related Grade  5 
events  (polymyositis  and an uncoded event  of neuromuscular  disorder  [VT]);  the Grade  4 event  
of myasthenia gravis  and Grade  5 polymyositis  occurred  in 1 subject.  There were  2 subjects  
(both in the MEDI4736  20 mg/kg + tremelimumab  3 mg/kg  Q4W  cohort)  with dose- limiting  
toxicities  (DLTs):  1 subject  with Grade  3 increased AST,  and 1 subject  with Grade  3 increased  
amylase and Grade  4 increased lipase.  Fifty-six subjects  (54.9%)  reported SAEs,  with events  
occurring  in > 5% of subjects  being  colitis  (9.8%)  and diarrhea (7.8%).  Thirty -six subjects  
(35.3%)  experienced treatment -related  SAEs.  Twenty -seven  subjects  (26.5%)  permanently  
discontinued  treatment  due to AEs. Treatment -related AEs resulting  in discontinuation in ≥ 2 
subjects  were colitis  (7 subjects),  pneumonitis  (5 subjects),  diarrhea  (3 subjects),  and 
increased AST (2 subjects).  Additional  safety  results  from this study  are presented in the 
durvalumab and tremelimumab IBs. 
 
In the literature,  using the combination  of the same class of drugs  (e.g.,  anti-PD-1 and anti- 
CTLA4  antibodies),  specifically  nivolumab  + ipilimumab  in a study  involving  patients  with 
malignant  melanoma,  the safety  profile  of this combination  had shown  occurrences  of AEs 
assessed by the Investigator  as treatment -related  in 93% of treated patients,  with the most  
frequent  events  being rash (55%  of patients),  pruritus  (47%  of patients),  fatigue (38%  of 
patients),  and diarrhea (34%  of patients).    Grade  3 or 4 AEs, regardless  of causality,  were

noted  in 72% of patients,  with Grade  3 or 4 events  assessed by the Investigator  as treatment - 
related in 53%.  The most  frequent  of these Grade  3 or 4 events  assessed  by the Investigator  
as treatment -related  include increased lipase  (in 13% of patients),  AST (in 13%),  and ALT 
levels  (in 11%).  Frequent  Grade  3 or 4 selected AEs assessed  by the Investigator  as 
treatment -related  in the combination  therapy  included hepatic  events  (in 15% of patients),  GI 
events  (in 9%), and renal  events  (in 6%). Isolated  cases  of pneumonitis  and uveitis  were  also 
observed.  
Fixed Dosing  for durvalumab and tremelimumab  
A population PK model  was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy  data from a Phase 
1 study  (study  1108;  N=292;  doses=  0.1 to 10 mg/kg  Q2W  or 15 mg/kg  Q3W;  solid tumors).  
Population PK analysis  indicated only minor  impact  of body weight  (WT)  on PK of durvalumab 
(coefficient  of ≤ 0.5). The impact  of body WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W)  and fixed dosing  (750 
mg Q2W)  of durvalumab was evaluated  by comparing predicted  steady  state PK 
concentrations  (5th, median and 95th percentiles)  using the population  PK model.  A fixed dose  
of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A 
total of 1000  patients  were  simulated using body WT distribution of 40–120 kg. Simulation  
results  demonstrate that body WT-based and fixed dosing  regimens  yield similar  median  
steady  state  PK concentrations  with slightly  less overall  between- subject  variability  with fixed 
dosing  regimen.  
 
Similarly,  a population  PK model  was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase 1 
through Phase 3 (N=654;  doses=  0.01 to 15 mg/kg  Q4W  or Q90D;  metastatic  melanoma)  
[Wang et al. 2014].  Population  PK model  indicated minor  impact  of body WT on PK of 
tremelimumab(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The WT-based (1 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (75 mg/kg 
Q4W;  based  on median  body WT of ~75 kg) regimens  were  compared  using predicted  PK 
concentrations  (5th, median and 95th percentiles)  using population  PK model  in a simulated  
population of 1000 patients  with body weight  distribution  of 40 to 120 kg. Similar  to durvalumab,  
simulations  indicated that both body WT-based  and fixed dosing regimens  of tremelimumab  
yield similar  median  steady  state PK concentrations  with slightly  less between- subject  
variability  with fixed dosing  regimen.  
 
Similar  findings  have been reported by others  [Ng et al 2006,  Wang  et al. 2009,  Zhang et al, 
2012,Narwal  et al 2013].  Wang and colleagues  investigated 12 monoclonal  antibodies  and 
found  that fixed and body size-based dosing  perform similarly,  with fixed dosing being better  
for 7 of 12 antibodies.  In addition,  they investigated 18 therapeutic  proteins  and peptides  and 
showed that fixed dosing  performed better  for 12 of 18 in terms  of reducing  the between-  
subject  variability  in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  parameters  [Zhang et al 2012].  
 
A fixed dosing  approach  is preferred by the prescribing community  due to ease  of use and 
reduced dosing errors.  Given  expectation of similar  pharmacokinetic  exposure and variability,  
we considered it feasible  to switch  to fixed dosing  regimens.  Based  on average  body WT of 75 
kg, a fixed dose  of 1500  mg Q4W  durvalumab (equivalent  to 20 mg/kg  Q4W)  and 75 mg Q4W  
tremelimumab (equivalent  to 1 mg/kg Q4W)  is included in the current  study.

Fixed  dosing  of durvalumab and tremelimumab  is recommended only for subjects  with > 30kg 
body weight  due to endotoxin exposure.  Patients  with a body weight  less than or equal  to 30

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is an MSKCC investigator -initiated,   single -center,  randomized,  open- label,  phase  
2 study  to evaluate  the activity of durvalumab alone (Arm 1) or durvalumab in combination 
with tremelimumab (Arm 2) in patients  with recurrent  or persistent  endometrial  carcinoma or 
endometrial  carcinosarcoma.   The safety  and tolerability  of these agents  in this patient  
population  will also be evaluated.  
 
Patients  will be randomized to Arm 1: durvalumab alone or Arm 2: durvalumab with 
tremelimumab.  Randomization  will be accomplished  by the method  of random  permuted  
block,  and patients  will be stratified  by histology  (stratum  1: endometrial  carcinosarcoma 
patients  OR MSI-high endometrial  carcinoma patients  and stratum  2: other  histologies).  We 
will limit enrollment  of stratum  1 to 10 patients  per arm. 
 
MSI-high patients  will be identified based on immunohistochemistry  or MSI testing  of tumor  
by department  of pathology  or via known mutations  found  in mismatch  repair  genes  via the 
Integrated Mutation  Profiling  of Actionable Cancer  Targets  (IMPACT)  assay  through MSKCC 
IRB#  12-245. 
 
Each  cycle  will be 28 days in duration.  Patients  will receive study  treatment  until disease  
progression,  intolerable toxicity,  elective  withdrawal  from the study,  study  completion,  or 
study  termination.  
 
Radiologic  tumor  assessment  will be repeated every  8 weeks  +/- 7 days for the first 48 
weeks  and then every  12 weeks  +/- 7 days until PD. For patients  who remain  progression 
free 2 years  post completion  of protocol  directed  treatment,  every  6 months  +/- 1 month.  
Safety  will be evaluated through the monitoring  of all serious  and non-serious  AEs and 
irAE’s,  graded according to the current  version  of National  Cancer  Institute’s  Common 
Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE v. 4.03).  
 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Eligible  patients  will undergo  screening and baseline procedures  per the Study  Schedule.  
Study  inclusion  and exclusion criteria  will be applied per section  6.0. Enrolled patients  will 
receive  treatment  on one of two treatment  arms  based on randomization:  
Arm 1: Patients  will receive  intravenous  (IV) infusion  of durvalumab 1500mg Fixed  Dose  
every  4 weeks  until patient  develops  a loss of clinical  benefit  or experiences  unacceptable 
toxicities.

Arm 2:  Patients  will receive durvalumab + tremelimumab  combination therapy.  Patients  will 
receive 1500  mg Fixed  Dose  durvalumab via IV infusion  q4w for up to 4 cycles and 75 mg 
tremelimumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 cycles,  and then continue 1500 mg Fixed  Dose  
durvalumab every  4 weeks  until patient  develops  a loss of clinical  benefit  or experiences  
unacceptable toxicities . 
Dosing  outside  the window should  be discussedwiththe Principal  Investigator.  Tremelimumab  
will be administered  first. Durvalumab  infusion will start approximately  1 hour after the end of 
tremelimumab infusion.  The duration will be approximately  1 hour for each infusion  (±5 
minutes).  A 1 hour observation period is required after the first infusion  of single  agent  
durvalumab  and combination durvalumab and tremelimumab.  If no clinically  significant  infusion  
reactions  are observed during  or after the first cycle,  subsequent  infusion observation periods  
can be at the Investigator’s  discretion (suggested 30 minutes  after each durvalumab and 
tremelimumab infusion).  
Treatment  will continue until progression,  intolerance,  withdrawal,  study  completion,  or study  
termination.  
Radiologic  tumor  assessment  will be repeated every  8 weeks  +/- 7 days for the first 48 
weeks  and then every  12 weeks  +/- 7 days until PD. For patients  who remain  progression 
free 2 years  post completion  of protocol  directed treatment,  every  6 months  +/- 1 month.  
Patients  who discontinue  treatment  for reasons  other  than progression may continue efficacy  
assessments  until progression is demonstrated.  Patients  who demonstrate radiologic  
progression by RECIST  criteria  may be considered for continued therapy  (but not primary  
efficacy  analysis)  if they are deemed  to be clinically  benefiting,  according to predetermined

Calculate  the dose volume  of Durvalumab and number  of vials needed  for the subject  to 
achieve the accurate  dose according to Appendix  B. 
Preparation of infusion  bags  
 
The preparation of infusion bags should  be done  under  aseptic  conditions  by trained  
personnel;  it should not be prepared on the ward.  
 
An additional  volume  of 0.9%  (weight/volume)  saline equal  to the calculated volume of 
durvalumab to be added to the IV bag must  be removed  from the bag prior to addition of 
durvalumab.  
The calculated  volume  of durvalumab is then added to the IV bag, and the bag is mixed  by 
gentle inversion to ensure homogeneity  of the dose in the bag. 
Prior to the start of the infusion,  ensure that the bag contents  are at room  temperature to 
avoid an infusion  reaction due to the administration  of the solution  at low temperatures.  
Vials should  be used for specific  subjects  and should not be shared between subjects.  
 
Patient  weight  at baseline should be used for dosing calculations  in patients  ≤30 kg unless  
there is a ≥10%  change  in weight.  Dosing  day weight  can be used for dosing  calculations  
instead  of baseline weight  per institutional  standard.  
Dose administration  
 
Durvalumab  will be administered  at room  temperature (approximately  25°C  ) by controlled 
infusion  via an infusion  pump  into a peripheral  or central  vein. 
 
Following  preparation of Durvalumab,  the entire contents  of the IV bag should be administered  
as an IV infusion over approximately  60 minutes  (±5 minutes),  using a 0.2-μm in-line filter. 
Less than 55 minutes  is considered a deviation.  
The IV line will be flushed  with a volume of normal  saline  equal  to the priming  volume  of the 
infusion  set used after the contents  of the IV bag are fully administered,  or complete the 
infusion  according to institutional  policy  to ensure  the full dose is administered and document  
if the line was not flushed.  
The Durvalumab   solution  should  not be infused through an IV line in which  other  solutions  or 
medications  are being administered.  
Monitoring of dose administration  
 
Subjects  will be monitored  during and after the infusion  with assessment  of vital signs  at the 
times  specified in the Schedule  of Assessments  (Section 10.0).  
In the event  of a Grade  ≤ 2 infusion- related reaction,  the infusion rate of study  drug may be 
decreased by 50%,  or interrupted until resolution  of the event  (up to 4 hours)  and re-initiated  
at 50% of the initial rate until completion  of the infusion.  For subjects with a Grade  ≤ 2 
infusion -related reaction,  subsequent  infusions  may be administered  at 50% of the initial  
rate.  Acetaminophen and/or  an antihistamine (e.g.,  diphenhydramine)  or equivalent

medications  per institutional  standard  may be administered  at the discretion of the 
investigator.   If the infusion- related reaction  is Grade  ≥ 3 or higher  in severity,  study drug will 
be discontinued.  
As with any antibody,  allergic  reactions  to dose  administration  are possible.   Appropriate 
drugs  and medical  equipment  to treat acute  anaphylactic  reactions  must  be immediately  
available,  and study  personnel  must  be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.   The 
study  site must  have immediate access to emergency  resuscitation teams  and equipment  in 
addition to the ability  to admit  subjects  to an intensive care unit if necessary.  
Durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  
 
Patients  in the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy  group will receive 1500 mg 
durvalumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles  and 75 mg tremelimumab  via IV 
infusion  q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles,  and then continue 1500 mg durvalumab q4w starting on 
Week 16. Dosing outside the window  should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. 
Tremelimumab will be administered first. Durvalumab infusion  will start approximately  1 hour 
after the end of tremelimumab infusion.  The duration will be approximately  1 hour for each  
infusion  (±5 minutes).  A 1-hour observation period  is  required after the first infusion  of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab.  If no clinically  significant  infusion  reactions  are observed 
during or after the first cycle,  subsequent  infusion  observation periods  can be at the 
Investigator’s  discretion (suggested 30 minutes  after each durvalumab and tremelimumab  
infusion).  
Study drug preparation of durvalumab and tremelimumab  
Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 750 mg Q2W  durvalumab (equivalent  to 
10 mg/kg Q2W),  1500 mg Q4W  durvalumab (equivalent  to 20 mg/kg  Q4W)  and 75 mg Q4W  
tremelimumab (equivalent  to 1 mg/kg Q4W)  is included in the current  study.  
 
Preparation  of durvalumab doses  for administration with an IV bag 
The dose of durvalumab  for administration  must  be prepared by the Investigator’s  or site’s  
designated IP manager  using aseptic  technique.  Total  time from needle puncture of the 
durvalumab vial to the start of administration should  not exceed:  
• 24 hours  at 2°C to 8°C (36°F  to 46°F)  
• 4 hours  at room  temperature 
 
If in-use storage  time exceeds  these limits,  a new dose must  be prepared from new vials.  
Infusion solutions  must  be allowed  to equilibrate to room  temperature prior to commencement  
of administration.  
No incompatibilities  between durvalumab  and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have 
been observed.  Dose  of 1500mg  durvalumab for patients  >30 kg will be administered using an 
IV bag containing 0.9%  (w/v)  saline,  with a final durvalumab concentration  ranging from 1 to 
20 mg/mL,  and delivered through an IV administration  set with a 0.2- or 0.22-μm  in-line 
filter.  Remove 30.0 mL of IV solution  from the IV bag prior to addition  of durvalumab.   Next,  
30.1 mL of durvalumab (ie, 1500 mg of durvalumab)  is added to the IV bag such  that final 
concentration is within  1 to 20 mg/mL  (IV bag volumes  100 to 1000  mL). Mix the bag by gently  
inverting to ensure  homogeneity  of the dose in the bag.

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
All subjects  will be randomized to one of two treatment  arms in a 1:1 fashion.  
 
Arm 1: Patients  will receive  intravenous  (IV) infusion  of durvalumab 1500mg Fixed  Dose  
every  4 weeks  until patient  develops  a loss of clinical  benefit  or experiences  unacceptable 
toxicities.  
Arm 2:  Patients  will receive durvalumab + tremelimumab combination  therapy.  Patients  will 
receive 1500  mg Fixed  Dose  durvalumab via IV infusion  q4w for up to 4 cycles and 75 mg 
tremelimumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 cycles,  and then continue 1500 mg Fixed  Dose  
durvalumab every  4 weeks  until patient  develops  a loss of clinical  benefit  or experiences  
unacceptable toxicities.

Ver. Date:  12/16/20   
  
Dosing  outside the window should  be discussed  with the Principal  Investigator.  Tremelimumab  
will be administered  first. Durvalumab infusion will start approximately  1 hour after the end of 
tremelimumab infusion.  The duration will be approximately  1 hour for each  infusion.  A 1-hour 
observation period is required after the first infusion  of single  agent  durvalumab and 
combination  durvalumab  and tremelimumab.  If no clinically  significant  infusion  reactions  are 
observed during or after the first cycle,  subsequent  infusion  observation periods  can be at the 
Investigator’s  discretion (suggested 30 minutes  after each  durvalumab single  agent  infusion 30 
minutes   after the combination durvalumab and tremelimumab infusion).  
1. Patients  will receive study  treatment  until disease progression,  intolerable  toxicity,  
elective  withdrawal  from the study,  study  completion,  or study  termination.  
 
2. Radiologic  tumor  assessment  will be repeated every  8 weeks  +/- 7 days for the first 48 
weeks  and then every  12 weeks  +/- 7 days until PD. For patients  who remain progression free 
2 years  post completion of protocol  directed  treatment, every  6 months  +/- 1 month.  
 
3. Safety  will be evaluated in this study  through the monitoring  of all serious  and non- 
serious  AEs and irAEs,  graded according to the current  version  of the National  Cancer  Institute  
Common Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events.  Procedures  to be conducted during the 
treatment  phase of the study  are presented in the Schedule of Assessments  (Section 10.0).  
 
4. Pre- and post-treatment  blood and serum  samples,  as well as archival  tumor  tissue  
(when available)  will be collected for biomarker  analysis  (as per Appendix  E). 
 
5. Assessments for subjects  who have completed durvalumab and tremelimumab  
treatment  and achieved disease control,  or have discontinued durvalumab or tremelimumab  
due to toxicity in the absence of progressive disease are provided in Appendix  A. 
 
Assessments for subjects  who have discontinued  durvalumab or tremelimumab treatment  due 
to PD are presented  in Appendix  A. 
Duration of treatment and criteria  for retreatment with durvalumab and tremelimumab  
combination  
On both study  arms,  the patients  will continue to receive  the study  drugs  as long as they 
continue to experience clinical benefit  and have no unacceptable  toxicities.  For patients  in the 
durvalumab + tremelimumab arm, patients  who complete the 4 dosing cycles of the 
combination  of durvalumab and tremelimumab portion of the regimen  (with clinical benefit  per 
Investigator  judgment),  but subsequently  have evidence of PD during the durvalumab 
monotherapy  portion of the combination  regimen,  according to RECIST  1.1, may receive  re- 
treatment  with another  4 cycles of the combination regimen (only once).  
Before restarting their assigned re-treatment,  the Investigator  should  ensure that the patient:  
 
a. Does  not  have  any significant,   unacceptable,  or irreversible   toxicities   that indicate  
continuing treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient  
 
b. Still  fulfils   the  eligibility   criteria   for  this  study,   including   re-consenting  to  restart  
durvalumab and tremelimumab

c. Has not have received  an intervening systemic  anticancer  therapy  after their assigned 
treatment  discontinuation.  
 
d. Has had a baseline tumor  assessment  within  28 days of restarting  their assigned  
treatment;  all further  scans should  occur  with the same frequency  as during the initial  
treatment. 
 
During  the retreatment  period,  patients  receiving  durvalumab + tremelimumab may resume  
durvalumab dosing at 1500 mg q4w with 75 mg of tremelimumab q4w for 4 cycles  each.  
Patients  will then continue with durvalumab monotherapy  at 1500  mg q4w, beginning at Week  
16, 4 weeks  after the last dose of combination regimen  therapy.  
Treatment  through progression is at the Investigator’s  discretion,  and the Investigator  should  
ensure that patients  do not have any significant,  unacceptable,  or irreversible  toxicities  that 
indicate  that continuing treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient.  
Patients  who AstraZeneca and/or  the Investigator  determine may not continue treatment  will 
enter  follow- up. 
If a patient  withdraws  from participation in the study,  then his or her enrollment/randomization  
code cannot  be reused.   Withdrawn patients  will not be replaced.

• Day 57 (Cycle  3, Day 1) – may be drawn up to 3 days prior to day 57 
c ECGs  will be obtained in triplicate  (with 2-5 minute lag time between each).   All 12-lead ECGs  
should  be recorded while  the subject  is in the supine position.  Twelve -lead ECGs  will be obtained 
after the subject  has been resting in a supine position  for at least 5 minutes  in each case.  On Cycle  
1, Day 1:  ECGs should  be taken  within  an hour prior to the start of the infusion and at least one time 
point 0 to 3 hours  after the infusion.  
d      Pre-menopausal  female  subjects  of childbearing  potential  only 
e  Subjects  will have their blood pressure and pulse measured before,  during,  and after each infusion  
at the following times  (based on a 60-minute infusion):  
• At the beginning of the infusion (at -30 to 0 minutes)  
• At 30 minutes  during the infusion  (±5 minutes)  
• At the end of the infusion (at 60 minutes  ±5 minutes)  
• For the first infusion only, in the 1 hour observation period post-infusion:  30 and 60 minutes  
after the infusion  (i.e., 90 and 120 minutes  from the start of the infusion)  (±5 minutes)  
• If no clinically  significant  infusion reactions  are observed during or after the first cycle,  
subsequent  infusion  observation periods  can be at the Investigator’s  discretion (suggested 30 
minutes  after each durvalumab and tremelimumab  infusion).  
If the infusion  takes  longer  than 60 minutes,  then blood  pressure  and pulse measurements  
should  follow the principles  as described above or more  frequently  if clinically  indicated.  
f    Free T4 will only be measured if TSH is abnormal.  Free T4 should also be measured if there  is 
clinical suspicion  of an adverse event  related to the endocrine system.  
g If already  done at MSK prior to study  entry,  does not need to be repeated.  
h  irRECIST  assessments  will only be completed for patients  continuing treatment  beyond PD. 
 
Post -treatment  follow up. 
 
All patients  will need a study  completion/early  termination  visit 28 +/- 3 days after they receive  the 
last infusion  of the study  treatment.  If the 28 day follow up visit coincides  with the progression of 
disease (POD)  visit, then assessments  for both visits  can be combined.  The patients  will continue to 
be followed for toxicity  for 90 days after the last infusion  of the drug.  
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS 
 
The dose delay  and reduction  instructions  provided  in this section  are intended to serve  as 
guidelines  to allow ongoing treatment  for patients  experiencing  clinical  benefit  without  signs  
or symptoms  of progression while  ensuring patient  safety.  Patients  may temporarily  suspend 
dosing of study  drug for up to 14 days if they experience toxicity that is considered related to 
study  drug and requires  that a dose be held. Patients  who miss ≥ 28 consecutive days of 
scheduled  study  treatment  because of drug- related  AEs will be discontinued  from the study.  
Exceptions  may be made after discussion  with and approval  by the Principal  Investigator.  
Patients  may suspend dosing  of study  drug for radiation therapy  or surgery  that is considered 
by the treating physicians  to be of clinical  benefit  for the patient.  After completion  of the 
intervention,  patients  may restart  the study  drug as long as all criteria  for dosing  are met and 
there is no evidence of disease progression (unless  approved  by PI and sponsor  as noted  
previously).  
For adverse  events  (AEs)  that are considered at least partly  due to administration of 
durvalumab or tremelimumab the following  dose adjustment  guidance may be applied:

Ver. Date:  12/16/20   
  
• Treat  each of the toxicities  with maximum  supportive care (including holding the agent  
suspected  of causing the toxicity  where required).  
• If the symptoms  promptly  resolve  with supportive care,  consideration should  be given  to 
continuing the same dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab  along with appropriate continuing 
supportive care.  
• In addition,  there are certain circumstances  in which  durvalumab or tremelimumab should  be 
permanently  discontinued.  
 
Following  the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab,  subsequent  administration of 
durvalumab or tremelimumab  can be modified  based on toxicities  observed  (see Table 4). Dose  
reductions  are not permitted  
Based  on the mechanism  of action  of durvalumab or tremelimumab leading to T-cell activation 
and proliferation,  there is the possibility  of observing immune  related Adverse Events  (irAEs)  
during the conduct  of this study.   Potential  irAEs  include  immune- mediated colitis,  pneumonitis,  
hepatitis/hepatotoxicity,   neuropathy/neuromuscular  toxicity,  endocrinopathy,   dermatitis,  
pancreatitis  and nephritis  . Subjects  should be monitored for signs  and symptoms of irAEs.   In 
the absence of an alternate etiology  (e.g.,  infection  or PD) signs  or symptoms  of colitis,  
pneumonitis,  hepatitis/hepatotoxicity,   neuropathy/neuromuscular  toxicity,  endocrinopathy,  
dermatitis,  pancreatitis  and nephritis   should  be considered to be immune -related.  
Dose  modification  recommendations  and toxicity  management  guidelines  for immune- mediated  
reactions,  for infusion- related reactions,  and for non-immune -mediated  reactions  are detailed in 
Tables  5 and 6. 
 
In addition,  management  guidelines  for adverse events  of special  interest  (AESIs  ) are detailed  in 
Section 11.4.3.  All toxicities  will be graded according to NCI CTCAE  v4.03.  
 
For patients  who are being treated with both durvaluab and tremelimumab,  both agents  will be 
held/discontinued in the event  of a toxicity  as described in Tables  4-6.

In addition  to the criteria  for permanent  discontinuation  of study  
drug/study regimen  based  on CTC grade/severity (table below),  
permanently discontinue  study  drug/study regimen  for the 
following  conditions:  
• Inability  to reduce corticosteroid  to a dose of ≤10 mg 
of prednisone  per day (or equivalent)  within  12 weeks  
of the start of the immune0mediated  adverse  event  
(imAE)  
• Grade  3 recurrence of a previously experienced  
treatment -related  imAE  following  resumption  of dosing  
Grade 1 No dose modification  
Grade 2 Hold  study  drug/study regimen  dose until Grade  2 
resolution  to Grade ≤1. 
If toxicity  worsens,  then treat as Grade  3 or Grade  
4. 
Study drug/study regimen  can be resumed  once 
event  stabilizes  to Grade  ≤1 after completion  of 
steroid taper.  
Patients  with endocrinopathies  who may require  
prolonged or continued  steroid replacement  can be 
retreated  with study drug/study regimen  on the 
following  conditions:  
1. The event  stabilizes  and is controlled.  
2. The patient  is clinically  stable  as per 
Investigator  or treating  physician’s  clinical  
judgement.  
3. Doses of prednisone  are at ≤10 mg/day  or 
equivalent.  
Grade 3 Depending  on the individual  toxicity, study  
drug/study regimen  may be permanently  
discontinued.  Please refer to guidelines  below.  
Grade 4 Permanently  discontinue  study  drug/study  
regimen.  
Note:  For asymptomatic amylase or lipase  levels  of > 2.0xULN,  
hold study  drug/regimen and if complete work  up shows no 
evidence  of pancreatitis,  may continue  or resume  study 
drug/regimen  It is recommended  that management   of irAEs  follows  the 
guidelines  presented  in this table:  
− Patients  should  be thoroughly evaluated  to rule out 
any alternative  etiology  (eg, disease progression,  
concomitant  medications,  and infections).  
− In the absence of a clear alternative  etiology,  all 
events  should  be considered  potentially  immune  
related.  
− Symptomatic and topical therapy  should be 
considered  for low-grade  (Grade  1 or 2, unless  
otherwise  specified)  events.  
− For persistent  (>3 to 5 days)  low-grade  (Grade  2) or  
severe  (Grade  ≥3) events,  promptly start prednisone  1 
to 2 mg/kg/day  PO or IV  equivalent.  
− If symptoms  recur  or worsen during corticosteroid 
tapering  (28 days  of taper),  increase the 
corticosteroid  dose (prednisone  dose [eg, up to 2 to 4 
mg/kg/day PO or IV  equivalent])  until stabilization  
or improvement  of symptoms,  then resume  
corticosteroid  tapering  at a slower  rate (>28  days  of 
taper).  
− More  potent  immunosuppressives  such as TNF  
inhibitors  (eg, infliximab)  (also  refer to the individual  
sections  of the irAE  for specific  type  of 
immunosuppressive)  should  be considered  for events  
not responding  to systemic  steroids.  
− Discontinuation  of study  drug/study regimen  is not 
mandated  for Grade  3/Grade  4 inflammatory  
reactions  attributed  to local tumor  response  
(eg, inflammatory  reaction  at sites of metastatic 
disease and lymph nodes).  Continuation  of study  
drug/study regimen  in this situation should  be based  
upon a benefit/risk  analysis  for that patient.

Pneumonitis/ILD  Any Grade  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor  patients  for signs  and 
symptoms  of pneumonitis  or ILD 
(new  onset  or worsening shortness  of 
breath  or cough).  Patients  should  be 
evaluated  with imaging  and 
pulmonary  function  tests,  including  
other diagnostic  procedures  as 
described  below.  
− Suspected pneumonitis  should  be 
confirmed  with radiographic  imaging  
and other infectious  and disease-  
related  aetiologies  excluded,  and 
managed  as described  below.  
− Initial work -up may include  clinical  
evaluation,  monitoring of 
oxygenation  via pulse  oximetry  
(resting  and exertion),  laboratory  
work -up, and high-  resolution  CT 
scan.  
− Consider  Pulmonary and Infectious  
Disease  Consults.  
 Grade 1 
(asymptomatic,  
clinical  or 
diagnostic  
observations  only;  
intervention  not 
indicated)  No dose modifications  
required.  However,  consider  
holding study  drug/study  
regimen  dose as clinically  
appropriate  and during 
diagnostic  work -up for other  
etiologies.  For Grade 1 (radiographic  changes  only):  
− Monitor  and closely  follow  up in 2 to 
4 days  for clinical  symptoms,  pulse  
oximetry  (resting  and exertion),  and 
laboratory  work -up and then as 
clinically  indicated.  
− Consider  Pulmonary and Infectious  
Disease  consults.  
 Grade 2 
(symptomatic;  
medical  
intervention  
indicated;  limiting  
instrumental 
ADL)  Hold  study  drug/study  regimen  
dose until Grade  2 resolution  
to Grade  ≤1. 
• If toxicity  improves  to 
Grade  ≤1, then the 
decision  to reinitiate  study 
drug/study regimen  will 
be based  upon  treating  
physician’s  clinical  
judgment  and after 
completion  of steroid  
taper  (<10mg prednisone  
or equivalent).  For Grade 2 (mild  to moderate  new 
symptoms):  
− Monitor  symptoms  daily  and consider  
hospitalization.  
− Obtain Pulmonary and Infectious  
Diseases Consults;  consider  
discussing with Clinical  Study Lead,  
as needed.  
− Promptly start systemic  steroids  (eg, 
prednisone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or 
IV equivalent).  
− Reimage as clinically  indicated,  
Consider  Pulmonary and Infectious  
Disease  Consults.  
− If no improvement  within  2 to 3 days,  
additional  workup should be  
considered  and prompt  treatment  with 
IV methylprednisolone  2 to 
4 mg/kg/day started

new/worsening  hypoxia,  life-threatening):  
− Promptly initiate  empiric  IV 
methylprednisolone  1 to 4 mg/kg/day 
or equivalent.  
− Obtain Pulmonary and Infectious  
Disease  consults;  consider  discussing 
with Clinical  Study Lead,  as needed.  
− Hospitalize  the patient.  
− Supportive  care (eg, oxygen).  
− If no improvement  within  2 days,  
additional  workup should be 
considered  and prompt  treatment  with 
additional  immunosuppressive  
therapy  such as TNF  inhibitors  
(eg, infliximab  at 5 mg/kg IV, maybe 
repeated at 2 and 6 weeks  after initial

− Patients  should  be thoroughly 
evaluated  to rule out any alternative  
etiology  (e.g., disease  progression,  
infections,  recent  IV contrast,  
medications,  fluid status).  
− Consult  with nephrologist.  
− Monitor  for signs  and symptoms  that 
may be related  to changes  in renal  
function (eg, routine  urinalysis,  
elevated  serum  BUN and creatinine,  
decreased  creatinine clearance,  
electrolyte  imbalance,  decrease in 
urine  output,  or proteinuria).  
− Consider  using steroids  in the 
absence of clear alternative  etiology 
even for low-grade  events  (Grade  2), 
in order to prevent  potential  
progression  to higher  grade  event.  
 Grade 1 No dose modifications.  For Grade 1: 
− Monitor  serum  creatinine weekly  and 
any accompanying symptoms.  
• If creatinine returns  to 
baseline,  resume  its regular  
monitoring per study 
protocol.  
• If creatinine worsens,  
depending on the severity,  
treat as Grade 2, 3, or 4.  
− Consider  symptomatic  treatment,  
including  hydration,  electrolyte  
replacement,  and diuretics.  
 Grade 2 Hold  study  drug/study regimen  
until resolution  to Grade  ≤1 or 
baseline.  
• If toxicity  improves  to 
Grade  ≤1 or baseline,  then 
resume study drug/study 
regimen  after completion  
of steroid taper  (<10mg  
prednisone  or equivalent).  For Grade 2: 
− Consider  symptomatic  treatment,  
including  hydration,  electrolyte  
replacement,  and diuretics.  
− Carefully  monitor  serum  creatinine 
every  2 to 3 days  and as clinically  
warranted.  
− Consult  nephrologist  and consider  
renal  biopsy if clinically  indicated.  
− If event  is persistent  beyond 3 to 5 
days  or worsens,  promptly start 
prednisone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or 
IV equivalent.  
− If event  is not responsive  within  3 to 
5 days  or worsens  despite  prednisone  
at 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV  
equivalent,  consider  additional 
workup.

Endocrinopathy  
(eg, 
hyperthyroidism, 
thyroiditis,  
hypothyroidism,  
Type  1 diabetes  mellitus,

type  of 
endocrinopathy,  
refer to NCI 
CTCAE  
applicable  version  
in study  protocol  
for defining  the 
CTCAE  
grade/severity)  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Patients  should  be thoroughly 
evaluated  to rule out any alternative  
etiology  (e.g., disease  progression 
including  brain  metastases,  or 
infections).  
− Consider  consulting an 
endocrinologist  for endocrine  events.  
− Consider  discussing  with Clinical  
Study Lead,  as needed.  
− Monitor  patients  for signs  and 
symptoms  of endocrinopathies.  Non- 
specific  symptoms  include  headache,  
fatigue,  behavior  changes,  changed  
mental  status,  photophobia,  visual  
field cuts,  vertigo,  abdominal  pain,  
unusual  bowel  habits,  polydipsia,  
polyuria,  hypotension,  and weakness.  
− Depending  on the suspected  
endocrinopathy,  monitor  and evaluate 
thyroid  function tests:  TSH,  free T3 
and free T4 and other  relevant  
endocrine  labs (e.g., blood glucose  
and ketone  levels,  hemoglobin A1c 
(HgA1c).  If a patient  experiences  an 
AE that is thought  to be possibly of 
autoimmune  nature  (e.g., thyroiditis,  
pancreatitis,  hypophysitis,  or diabetes  
insipidus),  the investigator  should 
send a blood sample for appropriate  
autoimmune  antibody testing.  
− Investigators  should  ask subjects  with 
endocrinopathies  who may require  
prolonged or continued  hormonal  
replacement,  to consult  their primary  
care physicians  or endocrinologists  
about  further  monitoring and 
treatment  after completion  of the 
study.  
 Grade  1 No dose modifications.  For Grade 1: 
− Monitor  patient  with appropriate

   − For suspected  
hypophysitis/hypopituitarism,  
consider  consultation  of an 
endocrinologist  to guide  assessment  
of early -morning ACTH,  cortisol,  
TSH  and free T4; also consider  
gonadotropins, sex hormones,  and 
prolactin levels,  as well as 
cosyntropin stimulation  test (though  
it may not be useful  in diagnosing 
early  secondary  adrenal  
insufficiency).  
− If TSH  < 0.5 ×  LLN,  or TSH  >2 × 
ULN  or consistently  out of range  in 2 
subsequent  measurements,  include  
free T4 at subsequent  cycles  as 
clinically  indicated  and consider  
endocrinology  consult.  
 Grade 2, 3, or  4 For Grade  2 endocrinopathy 
other than hypothyroidism  and 
type  1 diabetes  mellitus  
(T1DM),  consider  holding 
study drug/study regimen  dose 
until patient  is clinically  stable.  
Study drug/study regimen  can 
be resumed  once event  
stabilizes  and after completion  
of steroid taper  (<10mg  
prednisone  or equivalent).  
Patients  with endocrinopathies  
who may require  prolonged or 
continued  steroid replacement  
(e.g., adrenal  insufficiency)  
can be retreated  with study 
drug/study regimen   if the 
patient  is clinically  stable  as 
per investigator  or treating  
physician’s  clinical  judgement.  For Grade 2, 3, or  4: 
− Consult  endocrinologist  to guide  
evaluation  of endocrine  function  and, 
as indicated  by suspected  
endocrinopathy  and as clinically  
indicated,  consider  pituitary  scan.  
− For all patients  with abnormal  
endocrine  work  up, except  those  with 
isolated  hypothyroidism  or Type  1 
DM,  and as guided by an 
endocrinologist,  consider  short  term 
corticosteroids  (e.g., 1 to 2 mg/kg/day 
methylprednisolone  or IV  equivalent)  
and prompt  initiation  of treatment  
with relevant  hormone  replacement.  
− Isolated  hypothyroidism  may be 
treated with replacement  therapy,  
without  study  drug/study regimen  
interruption,  and without  
corticosteroids.  
− Isolated  Type  1 diabetes  mellitus  
(DM)  may be treated with 
appropriate  diabetic  therapy,  without 
corticosteroids.  Only hold study  
drug/study regimen  in setting  of 
hyperglycemia  when  diagnostic  
workup is positive  for diabetic  
ketoacidosis.  
− For patients  with normal  endocrine  
workup (laboratory assessment  or 
MRI  scans),  repeat  laboratory  
assessments/MRI  as clinically  
indicated.

− Consider  discuss  with the Clinical  
Study Lead.  
− Obtain neurology  consult.  
− Sensory neuropathy/neuropathic  pain 
may be managed  by appropriate  
medications  (eg, gabapentin  or 
duloxetine).  
− Promptly start systemic  steroids  
prednisone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or 
IV equivalent.  
− If no improvement  within  2 to 3 days  
despite  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  prednisone  
PO or IV  equivalent,  consider  
additional  workup and promptly treat 
with additional  immunosuppressive  
therapy  (eg, IV IG or other  
immunosuppressive  depending on the 
specific  imAE).  
 Grade 3 or 4 For Grade 3 or 4: 
Permanently  discontinue  study  
drug/study regimen.  For Grade 3 or 4: 
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  
with Clinical  Study Lead.  
− Obtain neurology  consult.  
− Consider  hospitalization.  
− Promptly initiate  empiric  IV 
methylprednisolone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day 
or equivalent.  
− If no improvement  within  2 to 3 days  
despite  IV corticosteroids,  consider  
additional  workup and promptly treat 
with additional  immunosuppressants  
(eg, IV IG or other  
immunosuppressive  depending on the 
specific  imAE).  
Peripheral  neuromotor  
syndromes  
(such  as Guillain -Barre  
and myasthenia gravis)  Any Grade  General  Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− The prompt  diagnosis  of immune - 
mediated  peripheral  neuromotor  
syndromes  is important,  since certain  
patients  may unpredictably  
experience  acute decompensations  
that can result  in substantial 
morbidity or in the worst  case,  death.  
Special  care should  be taken  for 
certain  sentinel  symptoms  that may 
predict  a more  severe  outcome,  such 
as prominent  dysphagia, rapidly

   progressive  weakness,  and signs  of 
respiratory  insufficiency  or 
autonomic  instability.  
− Patients  should  be evaluated  to rule 
out any alternative  etiology  (eg, 
disease progression,  infections,  
metabolic syndromes  or 
medications).  It should be noted  that 
the diagnosis  of immune -mediated  
peripheral  neuromotor  syndromes  can 
be particularly  challenging in patients  
with underlying cancer,  due to the 
multiple  potential confounding 
effects  of cancer  (and its treatments)  
throughout  the neuraxis.  Given  the 
importance of prompt  and accurate 
diagnosis,  it is essential  to have a low 
threshold to obtain  a neurology 
consult.  
− Neurophysiologic  diagnostic  testing  
(eg, electromyogram  and nerve  
conduction  investigations,  and 
“repetitive  stimulation”  if myasthenia 
is suspected)  are routinely  indicated  
upon suspicion  of such conditions  
and may be best facilitated  by means  
of a neurology  consultation.  
− It is important  to consider  that the use 
of steroids  as the primary  treatment  
of Guillain -Barre  is not typically  
considered  effective.  Patients  
requiring treatment  should  be started  
with IV IG and followed  by 
plasmapheresis  if not responsive  to 
IV IG. 
 Grade 1 No dose modifications.  For Grade 1: 
− Consider  discussing  with the Clinical  
Study Lead,  as needed.  
− Care should  be taken  to monitor  
patients  for sentinel  symptoms  of a 
potential  decompensation  as 
described  above.  
− Consult  a neurologist.  
 Grade 2 Hold  study  drug/study regimen  
dose until resolution  to Grade 
≤1. 
Permanently  discontinue  study  
drug/study regimen  if it does 
not resolve  to Grade  ≤1 within  
30 days  or if there  are signs  of 
respiratory  insufficiency  or 
autonomic  instability.  For Grade 2: 
− Consult  a neurologist.  
− Consider  discussing with the Clinical  
Study Lead,  as needed.  
− Care should  be taken  to monitor  
patients  for sentinel  symptoms  of a 
potential  decompensation  as

   important  to consider  that 
steroid therapy  (especially  
with high doses)  may result  
in transient  worsening of 
myasthenia and should 
typically  be administered  in 
a monitored setting  under  
supervision  of a consulting  
neurologist.  
o Patients  unable  to tolerate 
steroids  may be candidates  
for treatment  with 
plasmapheresis  or IV  IG. 
Such  decisions  are best 
made  in consultation with a 
neurologist,  taking into 
account  the unique  needs  of 
each patient.  
o If myasthenia gravis -like 
neurotoxicity is present,  
consider  starting  AChE  
inhibitor  therapy  in 
addition  to steroids.  Such  
therapy,  if successful,  can 
also serve  to reinforce  the 
diagnosis.

− Patients  should  be thoroughly 
evaluated  to rule out any alternative  
etiology  (e.g. disease progression,  
viral infection,  concomitant  
medications,  substance  abuse).  
− For modest  asymptomatic elevations  
in serum  amylase and lipase,  
corticosteroid  treatment  is not 
indicated  as long as there  are no other  
signs  or symptoms  of pancreatic  
inflammation.  
− If isolated elevation of enzymes 
without  evidence  of pancreatitis,  
continue  immunotherapy.  
− Assess  for signs/symptoms  of 
pancreatitis 
− Consider  appropriate  diagnostic  
testing  (e.g, abdominal  CT with 
contrast,  MRCP  if clinical  suspicion 
of pancreatitis  and no radiologic  
evidence  on CT)

− IV hydration  
Myocarditis  Any Grade  General  Guidance  
Discontinue  drug permanently  
if biopsy-proven immune-  
mediated  myocarditis  − The prompt  diagnosis  of immune - 
mediated  myocarditis  is important,  
particularly in patients  with baseline  
cardiopulmonary disease and reduced  
cardiac function.  
− Consider  discussing with the Clinical  
Study Lead,  as needed.  
− Monitor  patients  for signs  and 
symptoms  of myocarditis  (new  onset  
or worsening chest  pain,  arrhythmia,  
shortness  of breath,  peripheral  
edema).  As some  symptoms  can 
overlap  with lung toxicities,  
simultaneously  evaluate for and rule 
out pulmonary  toxicity  as well as 
other causes  (e.g., pulmonary 
embolism,  congestive  heart  failure,  
malignant  pericardial  effusion).  
Consult  a cardiologist  early,  to 
promptly assess whether  and when  to 
complete a cardiac biopsy,  including  
any other diagnostic  procedures.  
− Initial work -up should include  
clinical  evaluation,  BNP,  cardiac 
enzymes,  ECG,  echocardiogram  
(ECHO), monitoring of oxygenation 
via pulse  oximetry  (resting  and 
exertion),  and additional  laboratory  
work -up as indicated.  Spiral  CT or 
cardiac MRI  can complement  ECHO  
to assess wall motion  abnormalities  
when  needed.  
− Patients  should  be thoroughly 
evaluated  to rule out any alternative  
etiology  (e.g., disease  progression,  
other medications,  or infections)  
 Grade 2, 3, or  4 If Grade 2-4 
Permanently  discontinue  study

   complete  diagnostic  procedures  
including  a cardiac  biopsy.  
− Supportive  care (e.g., oxygen)  
− If no improvement  within 2 to  3 days  
despite  IV methylprednisolone  at 2 to 
4 mg/kg/day,  promptly start 
immunosuppressive  therapy  such as 
TNF  inhibitors  (e.g., infliximab  at 5 
mg/kg IV, may be repeated at 2 and 6 
weeks  after initial dose at the 
discretion  of the treating  provider  or 
relevant  practice guidelines).  
Caution:  It is important  to rule out 
sepsis and refer  to infliximablabel  
for general  guidance  before using  
infliximab.  Infliximabis  
contraindicated  for patients  who 
have  heart  failure.  
Myositis/Polimyositis  Any Grade  General  Guidance  For Any Grade  
− Patients  should  be thoroughly 
evaluated  to rule out any alternative  
etiology  (e.g., disease  progression,  
other medications,  or infections).  
− Monitor  patients  for signs  and 
symptoms  of poly/myositis.  
Typically,  muscle  weakness/pain  
occurs  in proximal  muscles  including 
upper  arms,  thighs,  shoulders,  hips,  
neck and back,  but rarely  affects  the 
extremities  including  hands  and 
fingers;  also difficulty  breathing  
and/or  trouble  swallowing  can occur  
and progress  rapidly.  Increased  
general  feelings  of tiredness  and 
fatigue  may occur,  and there can be 
newonset  falling,  difficulty  getting  up 
from  a fall, and trouble  climbing  
stairs,  standing  up from  a seated  
position,  and/or  reaching  up. 
− If poly/myositis  is suspected,  a 
Neurology  consultation should  be 
obtained  early,  with prompt  guidance  
on diagnostic  procedures.  
Myocarditis  may co-occur  with 
poly/myositis;  refer to guidance  
under  Myocarditis.  Given  breathing  
complications,  refer to guidance  
under  Pneumonitis/ILD.  Given  
possibility  of an existent (but 
previously  unknown)  autoimmune  
disorder,  consider  Rheumatology  
consultation. 
− Consider,  as necessary, discussing  
with the Clinical  Study Lead.  
− Initial work -up should include  
clinical  evaluation,  creatine kinase,  
aldolase,  lactate  dehydrogenase  
(LDH), blood urea nitrogen  
(BUN)/creatinine,  erythrocyte  
sedimentation  rate or C-reactive  
protein  (CRP) level,  urine  myoglobin,

must  agree to continue using  such  precautions  for 180 days after the last dose  of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab regimen  therapy  or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy,  
whichever  is the longer  time period.  Male partners  of a female subject  must  use male  condom  plus 
spermicide  throughout  this period.  Cessation of birth control  after this point should  be discussed with 
a responsible physician.   Periodic  abstinence,  the rhythm  method,  and the withdrawal  method  are 
not acceptable  methods  of birth control.  
 
Females  of childbearing potential  are defined as those who are not surgically  sterile  (ie, bilateral  
tubal ligation,  bilateral  oophorectomy,  or complete  hysterectomy)  or post-menopausal  (defined 12 
months  with no menses  without  an alternative  medical  cause).  
Highly  effective  methods  of contraception are described in Table 7. A highly  effective  method of 
contraception is defined  as one that results  in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year)  when 
used consistently  and correctly.  Note that some contraception  methods  are not considered highly  
effective  (e.g. male  or female condom  with or without  spermicide;  female cap, diaphragm,  or sponge 
with or without  spermicide;  non-copper  containing intrauterine device;  progestogen- only oral 
hormonal  contraceptive pills where inhibition  of ovulation is not the primary  mode of action   
[excluding  Cerazette/desogestrel  which  is considered highly  effective]; and triphasic  combined oral 
contraceptive pills).

11.3 General  
 
It is expected that patients  with nausea,  emesis,  diarrhea,  or constipation  will receive 
appropriate medical  management  without  dose modification.  However,  patients  with 
persistent  (≥ 24 hours)  Grade ≥3 toxicity  in spite of optimal  medical  management  require 
reduction of one dose level and delay  in subsequent  therapy  for a maximum of 2 weeks  until 
recovered  to Grade  1. 
Other  non-hematologic  toxicities  with an impa ct on organ function  of Grade  ≥2 require delay  
in subsequent  therapy  for a maximum  of 28 days until recovered  to Grade 1, or pre-therapy  
baseline.  
Hematopoietic Growth  Factors and Blood Products 
 
Erythropoietin,  darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim  and/or  hematopoietic  colony -stimulating  factors  
for treatment  of cytopenias  should be administered  according to institutional guidelines.  
Transfusion thresholds  for blood product  support  will be in accordance with institutional 
guidelines.  
11.4 Assessment of Safety 
 
The Principal  Investigator  is responsible  for ensuring  that all staff involved  in the study  is 
familiar  with the content  of this section.  
Safety Parameters  
 
11.4.1  Definition  of adverse events 
 
The study  will be performed in accordance  with ethical  principles  that have their origin in the 
Declaration  of Helsinki and are consistent  with ICH/Good  Clinical Practice,  and applicable  
regulatory  requirements  Subject  data protection.  
The International   Conference on Harmonization (ICH)  Guideline  for Good Clinical Practice  
(GCP)  E6(R1)  defines  an AE as: 
Any untoward medical  occurrence in a patient  or clinical  investigation subject  administered  a 
pharmaceutical  product  and which  does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease temporally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal  product,  whether  or not considered related to the medicinal  product.  
An AE includes  but is not limited  to any clinically  significant  worsening of a subject’s  
pre-existing condition.  An abnormal  laboratory  finding (including ECG  finding)  that requires  
an action  or intervention  by the investigator,  or a finding judged by the investigator  to 
represent  a change  beyond the range of normal  physiologic  fluctuation,  should  be reported 
as an AE. 
Adverse  events  may be treatment  emergent  (ie, occurring  after initial receipt  of 
investigational  product)  or nontreatment  emergent.  A nontreatment -emergent  AE is any new

sign or symptom,  disease,  or other  untoward medical  event  that begins  after written  informed  
consent  has been  obtained but before the subject  has received  investigational  product.  
Elective  treatment  or surgery  or preplanned  treatment  or surgery  (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject  being enrolled  into the study)  for a documented pre-existing  condition,  that did  
not worsen from baseline,  is not considered an AE (serious  or nonserious).  An untoward 
medical  event  occurring during the prescheduled  elective  procedure or routinely  scheduled 
treatment  should be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
 
The term AE is used to include  both serious  and non-serious  AE’s. 
 
11.4.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE’s) 
 
A serious  adverse event  is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i.e., screening,  run-in, 
treatment,  wash -out, follow- up), at any dose of the study  drugs  that fulfils  one or more  of the 
following  criteria:  
• Results  in death  
• Is immediately  life-threatening  
• Requires  in-patient  hospitalization or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• Is a congenital  abnormality  or birth defect  in offspring  of the subject  
• Is an important  medical  event  that may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical  
intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above.  
Medical  or scientific  judgment  should be exercised  in deciding whether  expedited reporting is 
appropriate in this situation.  Examples  of medically  important  events  are intensive treatment  
in an emergency  room  or at home  for allergic  bronchospasm,  blood  dyscrasias,  or 
convulsions  that do not result  in hospitalizations;  or development  of drug dependency  or drug 
abuse.  
The causality  of SAE’ s (their  relationship to all study  treatment/procedures)  will be assessed  
by the investigator(s)  and communicated  to AstraZeneca.  
11.4.3  Durvalumab + Tremelimumab Adverse Events of Special Interest 
 
An adverse event  of special  interest  (AESI)  is one of scientific  and medical  interest  specific  to 
understanding of the Investigational  Product  and may require close  monitoring  and rapid 
communication by the investigator  to the sponsor.  An AESI  may be serious  or non-serious.  
 
The  rapid  reporting  of  AESIs   allows   ongoing  surveillance   of  these  events   in  order   to 
characterize and understand them  in association with the use of this investigational  product.  
 
AESIs  for durvalumab and tremelimumab include  but are not limited  to events  with a potential  
inflammatory  or immune -mediated mechanism  and which  may require more  frequent  
monitoring and/or  interventions  such  as steroids,  immunosuppressants  and/or  hormone  
replacement  therapy.  These AESIs  are being  closely  monitored in clinical studies  with 
durvalumab  monotherapy   and  combination   regimen   therapy.   An  immune -related   adverse

event  (irAE)  is defined as an adverse event  that is associated with drug exposure and is 
consistent  with an immune -mediated mechanism  of action  and where  there is no clear  
alternate etiology.  Serologic,  immunologic,  and histologic  (biopsy)  data,  as appropriate,  should  
be used to support  an irAE diagnosis.  Appropriate  efforts  should  be made to rule out 
neoplastic,  infectious,  metabolic,  toxin,  or other  etiologic  causes  of the irAE. 
If the Investigator  has any questions  in regards  to an adverse  event  (AE) being an irAE, the 
Investigator  should  promptly  contact  the Study  Physician.  
AESIs  observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab  include:  
• Colitis  
• Pneumonitis  
• ALT/AST  increases  / hepatitis  / hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy  / neuromuscular  toxicity  (i.e. events  of encephalitis,  peripheral  motor  and 
sensory  neuropathies,  Guillain -Barré,  and myasthenia gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy  (i.e. events  of hypophysitis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  and hyper - and 
hypothyroidism)  
• Dermatitis  
• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis  (or labs suggestive  of pancreatitis  - increased serum  lipase  , increased  
serum  amylase)  
 
Further  information  on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms)  can be found in the current  
version  of the durvalumab and tremelimumab  Investigator  Brochure.  For durvalumab and 
tremelimumab,  AESIs  will comprise  the following:  
Pneumonitis  
AEs of pneumonitis  are also of interest  for AstraZeneca,  as pneumonitis  has been observed 
with use of anti-PD-1 mAbs  (but not with anti-PD-L1 mAbs).  Initial work-up should  include  a 
high-resolution CT scan,  ruling out infection,  and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary  consultation is 
highly  recommended.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune- related AEs 
(irAEs)  including  pneumonitis  are provided  in Table 4. 
Infusion  reactions  
AEs of infusion  reactions  (also  termed infusion- related reactions)  are of special  interest  to 
AstraZeneca  and are defined,  for the purpose  of this protocol,  as all AEs occurring  from the 
start of IP infusion  up to 48 hours  after the infusion start time.  For all infusion reactions,  SAEs  
should  be reported to AstraZeneca  Patient  safety  as described in Section 17.2.  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity  reactions  as well as infusion -related reactions  have been  reported with anti-
PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy.  As with the administration  of any foreign protein and/or  other  
biologic  agents,  reactions  following  the infusion of mAbs  can be caused  by various  
mechanisms,  including   acute  anaphylactic    (IgE-mediated)    and  anaphylactoid   reactions

against  the mAbs  and serum  sickness.  Acute  allergic  reactions  may occur,  may be severe,  
and may result  in death.  Acute  allergic  reactions  may include  hypotension,  dyspnea,  cyanosis,  
respiratory  failure,  urticaria,  pruritus,  angioedema,  hypotonia,  arthralgia,  bronchospasm,  
wheeze,  cough,  dizziness,  fatigue,  headache,  hypertension,  myalgia,  vomiting,  and 
unresponsiveness.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with hypersensitivity  (including  
anaphylactic  reaction)  and infusion -related reactions  are provided in Table 4. 
Hepatic function abnormalities  (hepatotoxicity)  
Hepatic  function  abnormality  is defined  as any increase  in ALT or AST to greater  than 3 × ULN 
and concurrent  increase  in total bilirubin  to be greater  than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent  findings  are 
those that derive from a single  blood  draw  or from separate blood  draws  taken  within  8 days 
of each other.  Follow -up investigations  and inquiries  will be initiated  promptly  by the 
investigational  site to determine  whether  the findings  are reproducible and/or  whether  there  is 
objective evidence that clearly  supports  causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis  and bile duct 
obstruction with distended gallbladder)  or an agent  other  than the IP. 
Gastrointestinal  disorders 
Diarrhea/colitis  is the most  commonly  observed treatment  emergent  SAE when  tremelimumab 
is used as monotherapy.  In rare cases,  colon perforation may occur  that requires  surgery  
(colectomy)  or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly  managed.  Guidelines  on 
management  of diarrhea  and colitis  in patients  receiving  tremelimumab are provided in Table  
4. 
Endocrine disorders 
Immune- mediated endocrinopathies  include hypophysitis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  and hyper - 
and hypothyroidism.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune -mediated  
endocrine events  are provided  in Table 4. 
Pancreatic disorders  
Immune- mediated pancreatitis  includes  autoimmune pancreatitis,  and lipase and amylase  
elevation.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune- mediated pancreatic  
disorders  are provided in Table 4. 
Neurotoxicity 
Immune- mediated nervous  system  events  include  encephalitis,  peripheral  motor  and sensory  
neuropathies,  Guillain -Barré,  and myasthenia  gravis.  Guidelines  for the management  of 
patients  with immune- mediated neurotoxic  events  are provided in Table 4. 
Nephritis  
 
Consult  with Nephrologist.  Monitor  for signs  and symptoms that may be related to changes  in 
renal  function  (e.g. routine urinalysis,  elevated  serum  BUN and creatinine,  decreased  
creatinine  clearance,  electrolyte imbalance,  decrease in urine output,  proteinuria,  etc) 
Patients  should be thoroughly  evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology  (e.g.,  disease  
progression,  infections  etc.)

Steroids  should be considered in the absence of clear  alternative etiology  even for low grade 
events  (Grade 2) , in order  to prevent  potential  progression to higher  grade event.  Guidelines  
for the management  of patients  with immune- mediated neurotoxic  events  are provided in Table

11.4.6  Criteria  for Hy’s Law (FDA  Guidance  2009)  
 
• The drug causes hepatocellular  injury,  generally  shown by a higher  incidence of 3-fold or 
greater  elevations  above  the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non- hepatotoxic)  control  drug 
or placebo  
• Among  trial subjects  showing  such aminotransferase elevations,  often with 
aminotransferases  much greater  than 3 x ULN,  one or more  also show  elevation of 
serum  total bilirubin  to >2 x ULN,  without  initial findings  of cholestasis  (elevated  serum  
alkaline   phosphatase)  
• No other  reason can be found to explain  the combination of increased aminotransferases  
and total bilirubin,  such  as viral hepatitis  A, B, or C; pre-existing  or acute liver disease;  or 
another  drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
12.1 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Antitumor  Effect 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the new international  criteria  
proposed  by the revised Response Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  guideline  
(version  1.1) (Eisenhauer,  2009)  ]. Changes  in the largest  diameter  (unidimensional  
measurement)  of the tumor  lesions  and the shortest  diameter  in the case  of malignant  lymph  
nodes  are used in the RECIST  criteria.  
 
 
12.1 Definitions 
 
Evaluable for toxicity . All patients  will be evaluable  for toxicity  from the time of their first 
treatment  on study.  
Evaluable for objective response.  Only those  patients  who have measurable disease present  
at baseline,  have received at least one cycle  of therapy,  and have had their disease 
reevaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients  will have their 
response classified  according to the definitions  stated  below.  (Note:  Patients  who exhibit  
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle  1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non-Target  Disease  Response.  Patients  who have lesions  present  at baseline that 
are evaluable but do not meet  the definitions  of measurable disease,  have received  at least 
one cycle  of therapy,  and have had their disease reevaluated  will be considered evaluable  
for non-target  disease.  The response assessment  is based  on the presence,  absence,  or 
unequivocal  progression of the lesions.

Measurable  disease.  Measurable lesions  are defined as those that can be accurately  
measured in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be recorded)  as >20 mm by chest  x- 
ray, as >10 mm with CT scan,  or >10 mm with calipers  by clinical exam.  All tumor  
measurements  must  be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  
 
Note: Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in a previously  irradiated area will not be considered 
measurable unless  progression is documented or a biopsy  is obtained to confirm  
persistence  at least 90 days following  completion of radiation therapy.  
 
Malignant   lymph nodes . To be considered pathologically  enlarged and measurable,  a lymph  
node must  be ≥15 mm in short  axis when  assessed  by CT scan  (CT scan  slice thickness  
recommended to be no greater  than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only  the short  axis 
will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease . All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including small lesions  
(longest  diameter  <10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short  axis),  are 
considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  and 
abdominal  masses  (not followed  by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic  lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined simple  cysts  should 
not be considered as malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable nor non-measurable)  since  they 
are, by definition,  simple  cysts.  
 
‘Cystic  lesions’  thought  to represent  cystic  metastas es can be considered as measurable 
lesions,  if they meet  the definition of measurability  described above.  However,  if non-cystic  
lesions  are present  in the same patient,  these  are preferred for selection as target  lesions.  
 
Target  lesions . All measurable lesions  up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ and 5 lesions  
in total, representative of all involved  organs,  should be identified  as target  lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected on the basis  of their 
size (lesions  with the longest  diameter),  be representative of all involved  organs,  but in 
addition should  be those that lend themselves  to reproducible repeated measurements.   It 
may be the case  that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion  does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement  in which  circumstance  the next largest  lesion  which  can be measured 
reproducibly  should be selected.  A sum of the diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  
axis for nodal  lesions)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes  are to be included in the sum,  then only the short  axis is 
added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters  will be used as reference  to  further  
characterize  any objective tumor  regression in the measurable dimension  of the disease.  
 
Non-target  lesions . All other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  including any measurable lesions  
over and above the 5 target  lesions  should be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the 
presence,  absence,  or in rare cases unequivocal  progression of each  should be noted 
throughout  follow- up. 
 
12.3 Methods  for Evaluation of  Measurable  Disease 
 
All measurements  should  be taken and recorded in metric  notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible to the beginning  of 
treatment  and never  more  than 4 weeks  before the beginning of the treatment. The same 
method of assessment  and the same technique should be used to characterize  each

identified and reported lesion  at baseline and during followup.  Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical  examination unless  the lesion(s)  being  followed cannot  be 
imaged  but are assessable  by clinical  exam.  
 
Clinical lesions : Clinical  lesions  will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial  (e.g.,  skin nodules  and palpable lymph nodes)  and ≥10 mm diameter  as assessed 
using calipers  (e.g.,  skin nodules).  In the case  of skin lesions,  documentation  by color  
photography,  including  a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion,  is recommended.  
 
Chest  x-ray: Lesions  on chest  x-ray are acceptable  as measurable lesions  when  they are 
clearly  defined  and surrounded  by aerated lung. However,  CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional  CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability  of lesions  on CT scan  
based  on the assumption that CT slice thickness  is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice 
thickness  greater  than 5 mm, the minimum  size for a measurable lesion  should  be twice  the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable  in certain situations  (e.g. for body scans),  but NOT 
lung. 
 
CA125 : CA125  alone cannot  be used to assess response.  If CA125  is initially  above the 
upper  normal  limit, it must  normalize for a patient  to be considered  in complete clinical 
response.  
12.4 Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target  Lesions 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes  
(whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction  in short  axis to <10 mm. 
Partial  Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking as reference the smallest  sum on study  (this includes  the baseline sum if that 
is the smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also 
demonstrate an absolute increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  
new lesions  is also considered progressions).  
Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  to 
qualify  for PD, taking  as reference the smallest  sum diameters  while  on study.  
Evaluation of Non-Target  Lesions 
 
Complete Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization of 
tumor  marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size (<10 mm short  axis).  
Note:  If CA125  is initially  above the upper  normal  limit, it must  normalize for a patient  to be 
considered in complete clinical  response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance  of 
CA125  level above the normal  limits.

Ver. Date:  12/16/20   
  
Progressive Disease  (PD):  Appearance of one or more  new lesions  and/or  unequivocal  
progression of existing  non-target  lesions.  Unequivocal  progression should  not normally  
trump  target  lesion  status.  It must  be representative of overall  disease status  change,  not a 
single  lesion  increase.  
Although a clear  progression of “non-target”  lesions  only is exceptional,  the opinion of the 
treating physician should  prevail  in such  circumstances,  and the progression status  should 
be confirmed at a later time by the review  panel  (or Principal  Investigator).  
Evaluation of Best  Overall  Response  
 
The best overall  response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment   until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest  
measurements  recorded since  the treatment  started).  The patient's  best response 
assignment  will depend on the achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation  criteria.

Note :  Patients  with a global  deterioration  of health  status  requiring discontinuation of

progression  even after discontinuation  of treatment.

Duration of Response  
 
Duration  of overall  response:  The duration of overall  response is measured from the time 
measurement  criteria  are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded)  until the first date 
that recurrent  or progressive disease is objectively  documented  (taking as reference  for 
progressive disease the smallest  measurements  recorded since  the treatment  started).  The 
duration of overall  CR is measured from the time measurement  criteria  are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively  documented.  
Duration  of stable  disease:  Stable  disease is measured from the start of the treatment  until 
the criteria  for progression are met, taking  as reference the smallest  measurements  
recorded since  the treatment  started,  including the baseline measurements.  
Progression- Free  Survival  
 
Progression- Free Survival  (PFS)  is defined  as the duration of time from start of treatment  to 
time of recurrence,  progression,  or death,  whichever  occurs  first. 
Survival 
 
Survival is defined  as the duration of time from start of treatment  to time of death  or the date 
of last contact  whichever  occurs first. 
Permitted  Deviations from  RECIST  
 
The study's  efficacy  objectives  will be evaluated according to the standard,  unmodified 
RECIST  v1.1 criteria  described in section  12.3,  and that, within  the context  of this protocol,  
the only purpose  of the modifications  to the criteria  is to allow certain patients  to continue the 
study  treatment  despite meeting  RECIST  criteria  for progression of disease.  
 
The response to immunotherapy  may differ  from the typical  responses  observed with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy  including the following  (Wolchok  et al 2009,  Nishino  et al 2013):  
• Response to immunotherapy  may be delayed  
• Response to immunotherapy  may occur  after POD  by conventional  criteria  
• The appearance of new lesions  may not represent  POD  with immunotherapy  
• SD while  on immunotherapy  may be durable and represent  clinical benefit.

As long as they are receiving treatment  on protocol,  patients  will be permitted to continue 
study  treatment  after RECIST  v 1.1 criteria  for POD  are met if they meet  all of the following  
criteria : 
 
• Absence  of symptoms  and signs  indicating  unequivocal  progression of disease 
• No decline  in ECOG  performance status  
• Absence of tumor  growth  at critical  anatomical  sites (e.g.,  leptomeningeal  disease)  that 
cannot  be managed by protocol -allowed  medical  interventions  
• Patients  for whom  approved therapies  exist must  provide  verbal  consent  to acknowledge 
deferring these treatment  options  in favor  of continuing study  treatment  at the time of 
initial apparent  progression 
Patients  with radiographic  disease progression at the at subsequent  tumor  assessment  may 
be considered for continued study  treatment  at the discretion of the investigator  if they 
continue to meet  the criteria  above and have evidence of clinical benefit.  
Modification of RECIST  as described may discourage the early discontinuation of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab and provide a more  complete evaluation of its anti-tumor  
activity than would be seen  with conventional  response criteria.   Nonetheless,  the efficacy  
analysis  will be conducted by programmatically  deriving  each  efficacy  endpoint  based on 
RECIST  v 1.1 criteria.  
The primary  reason for study  treatment  discontinuation should be documented on the eCRF.  
 
Of note,  clinically  significant  deterioration is considered to be a rapid tumor  progression that 
necessitates  treatment  with anti-cancer  therapy  other  than durvalumab with or with 
tremelimumab or with symptomatic  progression that requires  urgent  medical  intervention 
(e.g.,  central  nervous  system  metastasis,  respiratory  failure  due to tumor,  spinal  cord 
compression).  
 
irRECIST  
 
Immune- related RECIST  (irRECIST)  guidelines  according to Bohnsack  et al. are presented  
below.  irRECIST  assessments  will only be completed for patients  continuing treatment  
beyond PD. 
I. Baseline Assessments in irRECIST 
 
In irRECIST,  baseline assessment  and measurement of measurable/non -measurable and 
target/non- target  lesions  and lymph  nodes  are in line with RECIST  1.1. 
II Follo w-up Assessments in irRECIST 
 
A. Follow -up recording  of target  and new measurable lesions  
A key difference  in irRECIST  is that the appearance  new lesions does  not 
automatically  indicate  progression.   Instead,  all measured lesions (baseline -selected 
target  lesions and new measurable lesions)  are combined into the total measured  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Ver. Date:  12/16/20   
  
tumor  burden (TMTB) at follow  up.  Baseline -selected target  lesions and new 
measurable lesions are NOT  assessed separately.  Measurements  of those  lesions are 
combined into the TMTB,  and one combined assessment  provided.  
In order  to be selected as new measurable lesions  (≤ 2 lesions  per organ,  ≤ 5 lesions  total, 
per time point),  new lesions  must  meet  criteria  as defined for baseline target  lesion  selection 
and meet  the same minimum  size requirements  of 10 mm in long diameter  and minimum  15 
mm in short  axis for new measurable lymph  nodes.  New measurable lesions  should  be 
prioritized  according to size, and the largest  lesions  elected  as new measured lesions.  
 
B. Follow -up non-target  assessment  
RECIST  1.1 definitions  for assessment  of non-target  lesions  apply.   The response of non- 
target  lesions  primarily  contributes  to the overall  response assessments  of irCR and irNon - 
CR/Non -PD (irNN).  Non-target  lesions  do not affect irPR and irSD assessments.  Only a 
massive  and unequivocal  worsening  of non-target  lesions  alone,  even without  progress  in the 
TMTB  is indicative  of irPD.  In alignment  with RECIST  1.1, baseline selected non-target  
lesions  can never  convert  to measurable lesions,  not even if they increase  in size at 
subsequent  time points  and become  measurable.  Only true new lesions  can be measured 
and contribute to the TMTB . 
C. Follow -up for New Non-Measurable Lesions  
All new lesions  not selected as new measurable lesions  are considered new non-measurable  
lesions  and are followed  qualitatively.  Only a massive  and unequivocal  progression of new 
non-measurable lesions  leads  to an overall  assessment  of irPD for the time point.  Persisting  
new non-measurable  lesions  prevent  irCR.  
III Overall Assessments for irRECIST 
 
The irRECIST  overall  tumor  assessment  is based on TMTB  of measured target  and 
new lesions,  non- target  lesion  assessment  and new non-measurable  lesions.  
At baseline,  the sum of the longest  diameters  (SumD)  of all target  lesions  (up to 2 lesions  per 
organ,  up to total 5 lesions)  is measured.   At each subsequent  tumor  assessment  (TA),  the 
SumD  of the target  lesions  and of new, measurable lesions  (up to 2 new lesions  per organ,  
total 5 new lesions)  are added together  to provide  the total measurable tumor  burden (TMTB).  
 
Overall  Assessments  by irRECIST  
Complete  
Response   (irCR)  Complete  disappearance  of all measurable and non-measurable  lesions.  Lymph 
nodes  must  decrease  to < 10 mm in short axis.  
Partial  Response  
(irPR)  Decrease  of ≥ 30% in TMTB   relative  to baseline, non-target  lesions  are irNN,  
and no unequivocal   progression  of new non-measurable   lesions  
• If new measurable  lesions  appear  in subjects  with no ta rge t le sions  a t 
ba se line, irPD will be assessed.  That irPD time point will be considered a 
new baseline, and all subsequent  time points  will be compared  to it for 
response assessment.  irPR is possible  if the TMTB   of new measurable 
lesions  decreases  by ≥ 30% compared  to the first irPD documentation

 • irRECIST  can be used  in the a djuva  nt se tting , in subjects  with no visible  
disease  on CT/MRI   scans.  The appearance  of new measurable lesion(s)  
automatically  leads  to an increase  in TMTB   by 100%  and leads  to irPD.  
These subjects  can achieve  a response  if the TMTB   decreases  at follow -up, 
as a sign of delayed response. 
• Based on the above,  sponsors  may consider  enrolling subjects  with no 
measurable disease and/or  no visible  disease in studies  with response  
related endpoints.  
Stable  Disease 
(irSD)  Failure  to meet criteria  for irCR or irPR in the absence  of irPD 
Progressive  
Disease  (irPD)  Minimum  20% increase  and minimum  5 mm absolute increase  in TMTB  
compared  to nadir, or irPD for non-target  or new non-measurable  lesions.  . 
• In irRECIST  a substantial  and unequivocal   increase  of non- ta rge t le sions  is 
indicative  of progression. 
• IrPD may be assigned  for a subject  with multiple  ne w non- me a sura ble 
le sions if they are considered to be a sign of unequi vocal  massive 
worsening

The study  will include analyses  of archival  tumor  tissue  and peripheral  blood to define the 
biomarkers  that could predict/correlate  with response.  Research  bloods  will be collected pre- 
treatment  at 4 pre-specified time points:  Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, Day 57, with a window of -3 Days  for 
each draw.  6 CPT tubes  will be collected at each time point.  
 
12.5.1  Tissue PD-L1 expression (MedImmune)  
The levels  of PD-L1 expression  in tumor  cells and tumor -infiltrating  immune  cells will be assessed  
using SP263  antibody  on archival  tissue  
 
12.5.2  Tissue gene expression  profiling and IHC (MSKCC,  Zamarin,  Wolchok  lab) 
By using Nanostring nCounter  PanCancer  Immune  Profiling  Panel,  and immunofluorescence 
microscopy,  archival  tumor  tissue  will be assessed  for tumor  infiltration  with various  immune  cell 
subsets,  including CD8 cells,  CD4+  effector  cells (FoxP3- ), CD4+  regulatory  T cells (FoxP3+),  and 
myeloid  cells (CD68+).  Tumors  will also be assessed  for the expression of the known activating co- 
stimulatory  receptors  such  as 4-1BB (CD137),  OX40,  GITR, CD40,  and ICOS,  as well as known  
immuneinhibitory component s suchas PD-L1, indoleamine dioxygenas e (IDO), B7-H3, B7-H4, LAG3, 
TIM-3, PD-1, CTLA- 4, VISTA,  and BTLA.  The expression  of each gene  will be treated as a continuous  
variable.  For exploratory  biomarker  analyses,  patients  will be dichotomized on the basis  of the primary  
efficacy  endpoint.  
 
12.5.3  PBMC immunophenotyping  (MSKCC:  IMF) 
 
By using multi- parameter  flow cytometry,  we will explore  whether  peripheral  blood biomarkers  could 
serve  as  early  predictors   of clinical benefit  and provide targets   for further  combinations,  with a 
particular  focus  on targetable markers  of T cell activation (ICOS, CD137,  OX40,  GITR),  and inhibition  
(LAG3,  TIM3,  PD-1, BTLA,  VISTA),  as well as percentages  of peripheral  inhibitory  immune  subsets  
such  as MDSCs  and Tregs.

12.5.4  PBMC gene expression analyses  (MSKCC,  Zamarin,  Wolchok  lab) 
RNA extracted  from PBMCs  collected at baseline and on-treatment  will be analyzed on the Nanostring  
platform  using Nanostring  nCounter  PanCancer  Immune  Profiling  Panel,  to define  gene  signatures  
associated with clinical benefit.  
 
12.5.5  PBMC T cell receptor  (TCR)  repertoire analyses  (MSKCC:  IMF, Zamarin,   Wolchok  lab) 
Maintenance and expansion of particular  T cell receptor  (TCR)  clones  in the peripheral  blood may 
be associated with clinical response.  PBMC¹s  collected during the study  will be banked for potential  
future  TCR repertoire analyses.  DNA isolated  from PBMC¹s  will be send  for deep  sequencing of 
TCR CDR regions  at Adaptive Biotechnologies  to determine  whether  maintenance or emergence of 
particular  oligoclonal  populations  of T cells in the periphery  is predictive of clinical benefit.  
12.5.6  Plasma  assays 
Plasma  collected with PBMCs  will be stored for additional  analyses.  Current  PBMC- based  assays  
are cumbersome  and suffer  from variability  due to differences  in PBMC collection.  Plasma -based  
analyses  will include  analyses  of circulating  tumor  DNA and RNA,  multiplex  cytokine  ELISAs,  and 
serologic  assays  for antibodies  to specific  tumor -associated antigens.  
 
12.5.7  Future research 
Leftover  blood  and tissue  samples  from the study  will in addition be stored for future  research  using 
the assays  currently  in development,  including new single -cell based technologies.  The future  
research  will continue to be directed  towards  evaluation of potential  novel  biomarkers  of 
response/resistance to durvalumab and durvalumab/tremelimumab combination.  
 
 
13.0 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
Patients  may withdraw  from the study  at any time.  Any patient  who withdraws  will be encouraged to 
return  to the study  center  for a treatment  completion  visit. Patients  who discontinue  early should  
return within  30 days following  the final dose of study  treatment. The primary  reason for 
discontinuation must  be recorded in the medical  record.  
Permanent  discontinuation  of treatment  with Durvalumab and  Tremelimumab  
 
An individual subject  will not receive  any further  investigational  product  if any of the following  occur  in 
the subject  in question:  
• Disease  progression,  per investigator  assessment  
• Intolerable toxicity of study  drugs  
• Withdrawal  of consent  or lost to follow- up 
 
• Adverse  event  that, in the opinion of the investigator  or the sponsor,  contraindicates  further  dosing  
 
• Subject  is determined to have met one or more  of the exclusion  criteria  for study  participation at 
study  entry  and continuing investigational  therapy  might  constitute a safety  risk 
• Pregnancy  or intent  to become  pregnant  
 
• Grade  ≥ 3 infusion  reaction

• Initiation  of alternative  anticancer  therapy  including  another  investigational   agent  
Other  reasons  for patient  discontinuation may include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
• Change in patient  eligibility  
• Non-compliance 
• Patient  decision  
• If treatment  is delayed for more  than 28 consecutive days 
• Withdrawal  of consent  
• If consent  is withdrawn,  the subject  will not receive any further  investigational  product  or further  
study  observation.  
• The investigator  has the right to discontinue  a patient  from the study  for any medical  condition 
that the investigator  determines  may jeopardize the patient’s  safety  if he or she continues  in the 
study;  for reasons  of noncompliance  (e.g.,  missed  doses,  visits);  or if the investigator  determines  
it is in the best interest  of the patient.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This Phase  2 study  aims  to assess the activity  of Durvalumab  alone  and in combination with 
Tremelimumab in patients  with recurrent  or persistent  endometrial  carcinomas  or endometrial  
carcinosarcomas.  Patients  will be randomized to Arm 1: Durvalumab  (anti-PD-L1 Antibody)  alone or 
Arm 2: Durvalumab with Tremelimumab (anti-CTLA -4 antibody).  This is a randomized study  
however  it is not powered to show  superiority  of one arm versus  another.  
 
In this study,  all analyses  will be performed by treatment  arm. 
To date,  there are no published studies  of immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  in this patient  population.  
 
Extrapolating  from prior monotherapy  studies  of immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  in ovarian  cancer  
have yielded  overall  response rates  in the range of 10-15%,  and may serve  as a basis  for historical  
comparison of the doublet  tested here.

ORR (defined as CR+PR)  will be the primary  endpoint.  A 10% ORR will be considered low and 25% 
or higher  will be considered promising for further  studies.  Forty  patients  provide  90% power  and 
Type  I error of 10% using a Simon  two stage minimax  design.  There will be an interim  analysis  after 
evaluable 27 patients  and if 3 or more  responders  (CR+PR)  are observed out of evaluable  27 
patients  then the study will continue to the second  stage.  At the end of the study we require 7 or 
more  responders  out of 40 patients  to  declare this study  positive  and the arm worthy  for further  
investigation.

If the test for ORR is significant,  then the PFS rate at 24 weeks  (+/- 1 week)  will also be tested 
against  the historical  control  estimate.  For PFS rate at 24 weeks  (+/- 1 week),  we consider  a 15% 
rate as low, and a rate of 35% or higher  as indicative  of promising  activity.  This stems  from 
Gynecologic  Oncology  Group studies  of the same patient  population  we are evaluating in this study  
which  have deemed PFS at 6 months  of 15% or less as indicative  of lack of activity  and PFS at 6 
months  of 35% or more  as indicative  of having activity.  
This test of PFS rate will be performed  only if the ORR analysis  is significant,  and thus PFS 
assessment  is supplementary  to ORR assessment.  At the end of the study,  if 10 or more  out of 40 
patients  are considered progression free at 24 weeks  (+/- 1 week),  then that arm  will be considered 
worthy  of further  study.  This study  will have 94% power  and 7% Type  I error to show  activity  in terms  
of 6 months  PFS rate. The overall  Type  I error of the study is bounded by the 10% error rate of the 
first hypothesis  of ORR.  The hierarchy  in the two hypotheses  for ORR and PFS ensures  the overall  
error rate to be smaller  than 10% (Bretz  2009)  
 
If both arms have >=7 responders  the winning  arm is the one with higher  ORR and if both arms  have 
exactly  7 responders  the winning  arm will be decided based on the review  of all efficacy  data (ORR 
and PFS)  and the total safety  profile  (number  and type of grade 3 AE) of each  arm. 
A treatment  arm will be considered promising if the ORR decision rule is met, but the 6 month  PFS 
decision rule is not met. After first stage accrual  is complete,  we will halt the study  for 16 weeks  after 
last patient  has been  accrued  to first stage in order  to assess the decision rules to move to stage 2. 
Based  on historical  accrual  rates  in similar  populations,  we anticipate successful  enrollment  of 4 
patients  per month yielding  a total accrual  time of 20 months.  Accrual  will continue until 40 patients  
on each arm(evaluable patients  are defined in section  12.1),  unless  the interim  analysis  after 27 
patients  does not support  continuation.  
  
 
 
 
Definitions of Statistics  to be Reported  
 
• Clinical  Benefit  Rate (CBR) ), defined  as the percentage of patients  with complete response (CR)  
+ partial  response (PR) + stable  disease (SD) by 24 weeks  from the start of treatment  will be 
reported and the 90% confidence  interval  will be estimated using exact  binomial  proportions  . 
This will be done  following  RECIST  criteria.  
• Progression free survival  (PFS),  defined as the duration of time from start of treatment  to time of 
recurrence,  progression,  or death  due to any cause,  whichever  occurs  first. Patients  will be 
censored at last follow up date.  The Kaplan Meier  estimate of median  PFS will be reported  as 
well as the PFS rate at 24 weeks(+/ - 1 week).  
• Duration  of response (DOR),  defined  as the time from which  measurement  criteria  are met for 
CR or PR (whichever  status  is recorded first using RECIST)  until the first date of documented

disease progression,  will be estimated using the Kaplan Meier  method.  Patients  without  
documented progression will be censored at last follow up. 
• The rate of response using immune  response criteria  (refer  to irRECIST  description in section  
12.3,  which  defines  responders  and non responders)  and the 90% confidence  interval  will be 
estimated using exact  binomial  proportions.  
• Adverse  events  by the current  version  of Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  
version  4 (CTCAE  v4.03)  will be tabulated  in order  to assess  the safety  profile and tolerability  
therapy  in treated patients.  
 
Safety  Analysis  
 
The frequency  and severity  of observed adverse effects  will be evaluated.  
The rates  of irAE, SAE,  therapy  completion  rate, and protocol  completion will also be reported.  
 
Safety  will be measured  by the frequency  of grade 3 or 4 treatment -related  clinically  significant  
toxicities  (NCI Common Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  version 3.0), aside from Grade  3 or 
4 hematologic  or laboratory  abnormalities,  unless  they are deemed unexpected or clinically  
significant.  
  
Frequencies  of toxicities  will be tabulated.  The grade 3 or 4 treatment -related non-hematologic/non-  
laboratory  toxicity  will be estimated at the end of the trial along with the 95% confidence  interval.  
With 40 patients  per arm, these rates  can be estimated within  ±16%.  
 
 
Methods of Efficacy  Analysis 
Efficacy  Variables  
The intent  of this protocol  is to assess checkpoint  inhibitors  for activity  in patients  with carcinomas  
advanced,  recurrent  endometrial  carcinomas  and carcinosarcomas.  
 
The principal  parameters  employed to evaluate the efficacy  of the two arms  are: 
• The rate of ORR and duration of overall  objective response (ORR  = CR + PR). 
 
• Progression- free survival  rate at 24 weeks  for all patients  evaluable for this endpoint.  
 
• Clinical Benefit  Rate (CBR)  will be defined as ORR  + Stable  Disease  (SD) rate by 24 
weeks.  
 
Patients  who have measurable disease present  at baseline,  have received at least one cycle  of 
therapy,  and have had their disease reevaluated  will be considered evaluable for response and PFS.  
The primary  efficacy  analysis  will include  only patients  who are evaluable for response.  Patients  
without  post baseline assessment  of response will be included in a sensitivity analysis  as non 
responders  for ORR,  and events  for PFS.  A 90% confidence interval  for PFS will also be provided.  
 
 
All patients  will be followed up for a minimum of 6 months.  We do not expect  any patient  to have a 
follow up of less than 6 months.  If a patient  meets all the criteria  for being evaluable but has not 
been followed  for 6 months  and has not progressed,  this patient  will be censored at the time of last 
follow up. This patient  will be included in the analysis.   For the determination of the decision rule for 
PFS (ie >=10  patients  event  free),  this patient  will be considered a failure.

For safety,  all patients  who received at least one cycle  of therapy  will be included.  
 
 
As per the standard  of reference set by the Gynecologic  Oncology  Group  for recurrent  endometrial  
cancers,  if a new agent  has a true response rate of 10% or less, it would be considered of little 
clinical significance.  Conversely,  if the true response rate is at least 25%,  further  investigation is 
clearly  indicated.  These are the reference ORR numbers  used to assess  novel  agents  in the GOG - 
129 and 229 queue,  through which  nearly  20 treatments  have been evaluated.  As a means  of 
comparison,  and to further  justify  this ORR goal, the clinical  data for several  relevant  cytotoxic and 
biologic  agents  are tabulated here.

Given  the inherent  difficulty  in detecting meaningful  overall  survival  (OS)  data in patients  who will 
likely frequently  receive multiple,  and divergent  downstream  agents  after end of study,  including  
possible  enrollment  in additional  clinical trials,  PFS at 24 weeks  (6 months)  is considered an 
appropriate endpoint  for meaningful  clinical efficacy.  (Sill 2008)  This approach  has been adopted for 
recurrent  and advanced endometrial  cancer.  
 
 
Exploratory objectives:  For exploratory  biomarker  analyses,  patients  will be dichotomized on the 
basis  of clinical benefit  (CBR)  rate (CR+PR+SD)  as the outcome measure.  Exploratory  endpoints   
will be analyzed by treatment  arm. All biomarkers  without  known cutoffs  will be treated as  
continuous  variables  For tissue  based  biomarkers,  CBR will be correlated to the level of tissue  
expression  of PD-L1 (binary:  positive  vs negative),  or specific  genes/gene signatures  identified  from 
transcriptional  profiling.  Non parametric  2 sample tests  will be used to assess differences  in the 
distribution of markers  between the 2 groups  (responders  vs non responders).  Archival  tumor  tissue  
IHC will be assessed  only at baseline while  other  markers  will be assessed  at baseline and during  
treatment  and their change from baseline will be analyzed.  For markers  such  as  number  of 
infiltrating  CD8+  cells and change  in ICOS  level expression on lymphocytes  from baseline levels, we 
do not have established cutoffs,  thus we will examine them  as continuous  variables.  In these 
biomarkers  we will look at changes  from baseline to treatment  (focused on early changes  or  
changes  within  8-12 weeks),  and we explore  these changes  graphically  in order  to assess  potential  
relationships  between responders  and non responders.

15.2 Research Participant  Registration 
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined in the section  entitled Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria.Obtain  
informed  consent,  by following procedures  defined  in section  entitled Informed Consent  
Procedures.During the registration  process  registering individuals  will be required to 
complete a protocol  specific  Eligibility  Checklist.The  individual   signing  the Eligibility  Checklist  
is confirming  whether  or not the participant  is eligible  to enroll  in the study.  Study  staff are 
responsible for ensuring that all institutional requirements  necessary  to enroll  a participant  to 
the study  have been completed.  See related Clinical Research Policy  and Procedure  #401  
(Protocol  Participant  Registration).  
15.3 Randomization  
 
Patients  will be randomized to Arm 1: Durvalumab (anti-PD-L1 Antibody)  alone or Arm 2: 
Durvalumab  with Tremelimumab (anti-CTLA- 4 antibody).  Randomization will be 
accomplished  by the method  of random  permuted block,  and patients  will be stratified  by 
histology(  stratum  1: endometrial  carcinosarcoma patients  or MSI-high  endometrial  
carcinoma patients  and stratum  2 :other  histologies  ). We will limit enrollment  of stratum  1 to 
10 patients  per arm. 
15.2 Randomization  
 
16.1 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A research study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  extraction  and data entry,  data reporting,  
coordination of the activities  of the protocol  study  team  and, and of the flow of regulatory  
paperwork.  
The data collected for the study  will be entered into a secure  database ( MediData RAVE).  
All routine blood test results  required per the protocol  will be captured in MediData RAVE in 
addition to  baseline medical  conditions  and disease information,  response assessments,  off- 
study  documentation,  and toxicity  grade and attribution.  Source documentation  will be 
available to support  the computerized patient  record.  
MSKCC will hold the IND and will be responsible for all safety monitoring.  All SAEs  will be 
reported to the MSKCC  IRB. The safety  of the study  will be monitored  by the MSKCC Data 
and Safety  Monitoring  Committee.  
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated by the RSA and reviewed  by the PI to monitor  
patient  accruals and completeness  of registration data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be 
generated  to assess missing  data and inconsistencies.  
Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study.  Recurrent  lapses  in data collection,  deviations  or violations  
will be discussed with the study  team  and a corrective plan will be generated.  Accrual  goals

and factors  impacting accrual  goals  will be discussed at the weekly  New Patient/Protocol  
meetings.  
If accrual  proceeds  more  quickly  than anticipated,  it may be slowed  or staggered at the 
discretion of the Principal  Investigator,  to account  for safety  concerns  or data management  
resources. 
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
The Principal Investigator   is responsible for ensuring  that all staff involved   in the study  is 
familiar  with the content  of this section.  
The data and safety  monitoring  plan at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering Cancer  Center  was 
approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plan addressed the new 
policies  set forth by the NCI and the document  entitled "Policy  of the National  Cancer   
Institute  for data and safety  monitoring  of clinical  trials"  which  can be found  at 
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/noticefiles/not98- 084.html.   The DSM  plans  at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical Research.  The MSKCC data and 
safety  monitoring  plan can be found on the MSKCC  Internet  at 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans.pdf.  There 
are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  safety  and 
quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place for quality  assurance (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance and data verification audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff  
education on clinical research QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus  
there are two institutional  committees  that are responsible for monitoring the activities  of our 
clinical trials programs.  Memorial  Sloan  Kettering Cancer  Center  has set up three  distinct  
monitoring  processes  for our clinical trials program.  There  are two sub-committees  that have 
the responsibility  of data and safety  monitoring.  These are joint sub-committees  with dual- 
reporting responsibilities.  The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  is the sub- 
committee  responsible  for monitoring  all Phase 1, 2, 1/2, pilot and non-phase  clinical trials.  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  is the sub-committee responsible  for 
monitoring  Phase  3 randomized clinical trials.  The Therapeutic  Response  Review Committee  
(TRRC)  is the sub-committee  of Research Council  responsible  for the independent  
therapeutic  response review  for participants  in IRB/PB approved  clinical trials where 
therapeutic  efficacy  is a stated primary  objective,  typically  phase 2 and 3 trials.  Formal  
monitoring  of such  studies  is designed to ensure that the interests  of the  participants  are 
being scrutinized  on a regular  basis,  and that the trial is progressing in a satisfactory  manner.  
The DSMC  convenes  once per quarter  and monitors  the risk participants  are exposed to, the 
progress  of the study,  the adequacy  of the data storage  and whether  sufficient  data are being 
entered into the  MediData RAVE.  The DSMC monitors  phase 1, 2, 1/2, pilot and non-phase 
trials that are not being monitored  by an industrial  sponsor,  and which  meet  the NCI 
definition of a Clinical Trial.  This trial will qualify  for monitoring by the DSMC.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring  required,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be 
established  at the time of protocol  activation.  A detailed description  of the data to be

17.1 PROTECTION OF HUM AN SUBJECTS 
 
17.2 Privacy 
 
MSK’s Privacy Office  may allow the use and disclosure  of protected health  information 
pursuant  to a completed and signed Research Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected health information  will be limited  to the individuals  described in the Research 
Authorization form.  A Research Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal 
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy Board  (IRB/PB).  
The consent  indicates  that individualized  de identified information collected for the purposes  
of this study  may be shared with other  qualified  researchers.  Only researchers  who have 
received  approval  from MSK will be allowed  to access  this information which  will not include 
protected  health  information,  such  as the participant’s  name,  except  for dates.  It is also 
stated in the Research  Authorization  that their research data may be shared with other  
qualified  researchers.  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious  when,  based upon medical  judgment,

they may jeopardize the patient  or subject  and may require medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition 
 
Note: Hospital admission  for a planned procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.  SAE reporting is 
required for 90-days after the participant’s  last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 90-day period and that are at least possibly  related to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  5 calendar  days of the event.   All other  SAEs  must  be submitted within  30 calendar  
days of the event.  
 
The report  should contain the following  information:  
 
• The date the adverse event  occurred The adverse  event  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade of the event  
• Relationship of the adverse  event  to the treatment(s)  
• If the AE was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o A explanation of how the AE was handled  
o A description of the subject’s  condition  
o Indication  if the subject  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form.  
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated Problem  
 
For IND/IDE protocols:  
If appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded  to the FDA by the SAE staff through the IND 
Office. 
Ethical  conduct  of the study  
 
The study  will be performed  in accordance  with ethical  principles  that have their origin in the 
Declaration  of Helsinki and are consistent  with ICH/Good   Clinical  Practice,  and applicable 
regulatory  requirements  Subject  data protection.  
17.3.1  Recording  of adverse  events  and serious adverse events  
 
Adverse  events  will be recorded via Electronic  MediData RAVE using a recognized medical  
term or diagnosis  that accurately  reflects  the event.  Adverse  events  will be assessed  by the 
investigator  for severity,  relationship  to the investigational  product,  possible etiologies,  and 
whether  the event  meets  criteria  of an SAE and therefore requires  immediate notification  to 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune   Patient  Safety.

CONFIDENTIAL  AND  PROPRIETARY  Page  85 of 98 
Ver. Date:  12/16/20   
  
The following  variables  will be collected for each AE: 
 
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date (and time when  clinically  relevant)  when  the AE started and stopped 
• Changes  in NCI CTCAE  grade and the maximum  CTC grade attained  
• Whether  the AE is serious  or not 
• Investigator  causality  rating against  durvalumab (yes or no) 
• Investigator  causality  rating against  tremelimumab (yes or no) 
• Action  taken  with regard to durvalumab  
• Action  taken with regard  to tremelimumab  
• Outcome  
 
In addition,  the following  variables  will be collected for SAEs  as applicable:  
 
• Date AE met criteria  for serious  AE 
• Date Investigator  became  aware of serious  AE 
• AE is serious  due to 
• Date of hospitalization  
• Date of discharge 
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy  performed 
• Description  of AE 
• Causality  assessment  in relation to Study  procedure(s)  
• Causality  assessment  in relation to durvalumab or tremelimumab 
 
Events,  which  are unequivocally  due to disease progression,  should  not be reported as an AE 
during the study.  
17.2.1.1  Study recording  period  and follow -up for adverse events and serious 
adverse events  
Adverse events  and serious  adverse events  will be recorded from time of signature of 
informed  consent,  throughout  the treatment  period  and including the follow- up period (90 
days after the last dose  of durvalumab + tremelimumab,  whichever  is later).  
During  the course of the study  all AEs and SAEs  should  be proactively  followed up for each  
subject.  Every  effort  should be made to obtain a resolution  for all events,  even if the events  
continue after discontinuation/study  completion.  
If a subject  discontinues  from treatment  for reasons  other  than disease progression,  and 
therefore continues  to have tumor  assessments,  drug or procedure -related  SAEs  must  be 
captured  until the patient  is considered to have PD and will have no further  tumor  
assessments.  
 
 
 
 
Date:  The investigator  is responsible for following  all SAEs  until resolution,  until the subject  returns  
to baseline status,  or until the condition has stabilized  with the expectation that it will remain 
chronic,  even if this extends  beyond study  participation.

17.2.1.2  Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s  last visit in the study are  followed  up by the 
investigator  for as long as medically  indicated,  but without  further  recording  in the eCRF.  
After 90 days,  only subjects  with ongoing investigational  product -related  SAEs  will continue 
to be followed for safety.  
AstraZeneca/MedImmune   retains  the right to request  additional  information for any subject  
with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s)  at the end of the study,  if judged necessary.  
17.2.1.3  Post  study  events 
 
After the subject  has been permanently  withdrawn  from the study,  there  is no obligation for 
the investigator  to actively report  information  on new AE or SAEs  occurring  in former  study  
subjects  after the 90-day safety  follow -up period for patients  treated with Durvalumab  or 
Tremelimumab.  However,  if an investigator  learns  of any SAEs,  including death,  at any time 
after the subject  has been permanently  withdrawn  from study,  and he/she  considers  there  is 
a reasonable possibility  that the event  is related to study  treatment, the investigator  should 
notify  the study  principal  investigator.  
17.2.1.4  Reporting  of serious adverse events  
 
All SAEs  will be reported,  whether  or not considered causally  related to the investigational  
product,  or to the study  procedure(s).  The reporting period for SAEs  is the period 
immediately  following  the time that written  informed  consent  is obtained through 90 days 
after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab or until the initiation  of alternative 
anticancer  therapy.   The investigator  is responsible for informing the Ethics  Committee  
and/or  the Regulatory  Authority  of the SAE as per local requirements.  
The investigator  and/or  sponsor  must  inform  the FDA,  via a MedWatch/AdEERs  form,  of any 
serious  or unexpected adverse  events  that occur  in accordance with the reporting obligations  
of 21 CFR 312.32,  and will concurrently  forward all such  reports  to AstraZeneca.   A copy of 
the MedWatch/AdEERs  report  must  be faxed to AstraZeneca  at the time the event  is 
reported to the FDA.   It is the responsibility  of the sponsor  to compile  all necessary  
information and ensure that the FDA receives  a report  according to the FDA reporting 
requirement  timelines  and to ensure that these reports  are also submitted to AstraZeneca  at 
the same time.

• A cover  page  should accompany  the MedWatch/AdEERs form indicating  the 
following:  
• “Notification  from an Investigator  Sponsored  Study”  
• The investigator  IND number  assigned by the FDA 
• The investigator’s  name and address  
o The trial name/title and AstraZeneca  ISS reference number  (ESR -15-10965)  
* Sponsor  must  also indicate,  either  in the SAE report  or the cover  page,  the causality of 
events  in relation  to all study medications  and if the SAE is related  to disease 
progression , as determined by the principal  investigator.  
* Send SAE report  and accompanying cover  page by way of email  to AstraZeneca’s  
designated  mailbox:  AEMailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com . If  a non-serious  AE 
becomes  serious,  this and other  relevant  follow- up information  must  also be provided  to 
AstraZeneca  and the FDA.  
Serious  adverse  events  that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA still need to be 
reported to AstraZeneca  preferably  using the MedDRA  coding language for serious  adverse  
events.   This information  should  be reported on a monthly  basis  and under  no circumstance  
less frequently  than quarterly.  
17.2.1.5  Other  events requiring  reporting 
Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a subject  receiving a dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab  in 
excess of that specified in the Investigator’s  Brochure,  unless  otherwise specified in this 
protocol.  
Any overdose  of a study  subject  with durvalumab + tremelimumab,  with or without  associated  
AEs/SAEs,  is required to be reported within  24 hours  of knowledge  of the event  to the 
sponsor  and AstraZeneca/MedImmune   Patient  Safety  or designee using the designated 
Safety  e-mailbox  (see Section  11.4 for contact  information).  If the overdose results  in an AE, 
the AE must  also be recorded as an AE (see Section 11.4).  Overdose does not automatically  
make an AE serious,  but if the consequences  of the overdose are serious,  for example death 
or hospitalization,  the event  is serious  and must  be recorded and reported as an SAE (see 
Section 11.4).  There  is currently  no specific  treatment  in the event  of an overdose of 
durvalumab or tremelimumab.  
 
The investigator  will use clinical judgment  to treat any overdose.  
 
 
 
Hepatic function  abnormality  
 
Hepatic  function  abnormality  (as defined in Section 11.4)  in a study  subject,  with or without  
associated clinical manifestations,  is required to be reported as “hepatic  function abnormal”  
within  24 hours of knowledge  of the event  to the sponsor  and AstraZeneca/MedImmune  
Patient  Safety  using the designated Safety  e-mailbox  (see Section 11.4 for contact

information),  unless  a definitive  underlying diagnosis  for the abnormality  (e.g.,  cholelithiasis  
or bile duct obstruction)  that is unrelated  to investigational  product  has been confirmed.  
• If the definitive  underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  has been  established and is 
unrelated  to investigational  product,  the decision to continue dosing  of the study  subject  will 
be based  on the clinical  judgment  of the investigator.  
• If no definitive  underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  is established,  dosing of the study  
subject  must  be interrupted immediately.  Follow -up investigations  and inquiries  must  be 
initiated  by the investigational  site without  delay.  
Each  reported event  of hepatic  function  abnormality  will be followed  by the investigator  and 
evaluated by the sponsor  and AstraZeneca/MedImmune.  
Pregnancy  
 
Maternal  exposure 
If a patient  becomes  pregnant  during the course  of the study,  the IPs should be discontinued 
immediately.  
Pregnancy  itself is not regarded as an AE unless  there is a suspicion  that the IP under  study  
may have interfered with the effectiveness  of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital  
abnormalities  or birth defects  and spontaneous  miscarriages  should be reported and handled 
as SAEs.  Elective  abortions   without  complications  should  not be handled as AEs. The 
outcomeof all pregnancies  (spontaneous  miscarriage,  elective  termination,  ectopic  pregnancy,  
normal  birth,  or congenital  abnormality)  should  be followed  up and documented even if the 
patient  was discontinued  from the study.  
If any pregnancy  occurs  in the course  of the study,  then the Investigator  or other  site personnel  
should inform  the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives  within  1 day, ie, immediately,  but 
no later  than 24 hours of when  he or she becomes  aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work  with the Investigator  to ensure that all 
relevant  information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient  Safety  data entry  site within  1 to 
5 calendar  days for SAEs  and within  30 days for all other  pregnancies.  
The same timelines  apply  when  outcome  information is available.  
 
Pregnancy  in a subject  who has received  investigational  product  is required to be reported 
within  24 hours  of knowledge  of the event  to the sponsor  and AstraZeneca/MedImmune  
 
 
 
Patient  Safety  or designee using the designated Safety  e-mailbox  (see Section 17.2.1.4  for 
contact  information).  
Subjects  who become  pregnant  during the study  period must  not receive  additional  doses  of 
investigational  product  but will not be withdrawn  from the study.  The pregnancy  will be 
followed for outcome  of the mother  and child (including any premature terminations)  and 
should  be reported to AstraZeneca/MedImmune  Patient  Safety.

Tumour assessment  (CT or MRI) For subjects  who achieve disease  control  following  12 months  of treatment , tumour  
assessments  should  be performed  every  12 weeks  relative to the date of first infusion  
thereafter  until PD. For subjects  who discontinue  Durvalumab  due to toxicity  (or 
symptomatic  deterioration) , tumour  assessments  should  be performed  relative  to the 
relative  to the date of first infusion as follows:  every  8 weeks  for the first 48 weeks,  then 
every  12 weeks  until PD. For patients  who remain  progression  free 2 years  post completion  
of protocol  directed  treatment,  every  6 months  +/- 1 month.  Upon  PD, scans  should  be 
conducted  according  to local standard  clinical  practice and submitted  for central  review  until 
a new treatment  is started  (these  scans  are optional).  
 
a T4 will only be measured  if TSH is abnormal.  They  should also be measured if there  is clinical  suspicion  of an 
adverse event  related to the endocrine  system.

Appendix   B. Durvalumab   DOSE VOLUME  CALCULATIONS  
For durvalumab  fixed  dosing:  
 
1. Cohort  dose:  X g 
 
2. Dose to be added into infusion bag: 
Dose  (mL) = X g × 1000 /  50 (mg/mL)  
where 50 m g/mL  is durvalumab  nominal  concentration. 
 
The corresponding volume   of durvalumab  should be rounded to the nearest  tenth mL (0.1 mL).  
 
3. The theoretical  number  of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest  whole number  of 
vials from the following  formula:  
Number  of vials = Dose  (mL) / 10.0 (mL/vial)  
 
Example:  
 
1. Cohort  dose:  1.5 g  
 
2. Dose to be added into infusion bag: 
 
Dose  (mL) = 1.5 g ×1000 /  50 (mg/mL)   = 30.0 mL  
 
3. The theoretical  number  of vials required  for dose preparation:  
Number  of vials = 30.0 (mL)  / 10.0 (mL/vial)   = 3 vials 
Appendix   C. Tremelimumab   DOSE  VOLUME   CALCULATIONS  
For tremelimumab   fixed dosing:  
 
1. Cohort  dose:  X mg 
 
2. Dose to be added into infusion bag: 
Dose  (mL) = X mg / 20 (mg/mL)  
where 20 m g/mL  is tremelimumab  nominal  concentration 
 
The corresponding volume   of tremelimumab   should be rounded  to the nearest  tenth mL (0.1 mL).  
 
3. The theoretical  number  of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest  whole number  of

Number  of vials = Dose  (mL) / 20 (mL/vial)  
 
Example:  
 
1. Cohort  dose:  75 mg  
 
2. Dose to be added into infusion bag: 
 
Dose  (mL) = 75 mg  / 20 (mg/mL)   = 3.8 mL  
 
3. The theoretical  number  of vials required  for dose preparation:  
Number  of vials = 3.8 (mL)  / 20 (mL/vial)   = 1 vial  
 
APPENDI X D  Biomarkers 
 
Archival tissue will be obtained for analysis of primary tumor. 10-20 unstained PPFE slides 
will be sought  from  each  patient: Half will go to the sponsor,  and the remaining ones will 
remain  at MSK.  A patient  will be required to have a minimum  of 10 unstained PPFE  slides to 
be eligible.  No biopsy  will be performed  for procurement  of tissue  for purposes of meeting 
eligibility. 
 
• AZ/MEDI   will perform  assays  of PD-L1 expression.  
• MSKCC/Zamarin  will perform  assays  for Immunologic  markers.  
 
Research bloods  will be collected  on Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, and Day 57 with a window  of -3 Days 
for each  draw.  6 CPT tubes will be collected  at each time point  (all 6 tubes will remain  at MSK).  
 
Research Blood Sample  Collection Instructions:  6 CPT tubes  will be collected on Day 1, Day 8, 
Day 29, and Day 57. 
 
1. Invert  all tubes  several  times  immediately  after collection  to ensure  mixing  with anticoagulant  
(or clotting  activators  for serum  collection  tubes).   For serum  tubes,  allow blood in tube to clot 
for 30 min at room  temperature  in a vertical  position in a tube rack.  
2. Include  patient  initials,  MRN,  date,  and time of collection  on adhesive stickers attached to 
each tube.  
3. Fill in date and time of collection  in requisition form.  
4. Place  all collected tubes  in a biohazard ziplock  bag at room  temperature.  
5. Send  all specimens  via Stat Messengers  to Immune  Monitoring Core  located at the MSKCC  
Zuckerman Research  Center  (417 E. 68th St, New York,  NY), Room  1513 . Place  into blood 
bin on benchtop.  
6. Notify  IMF staff of sample  delivery

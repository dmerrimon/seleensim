*In case of dose change (reduction or re-escalation) additional visits have to be included (refer to Section 6.2.4 )
1 Visit 1 should occur at least one day after trial completion of SENSCIS®(Follow up Visit) or 1199-0340 (End of Treatment/end of Study Visit). Visit 2 of this extension trial is to be scheduled:
∀ within a maximum of 12 weeks after last drug intake in SENSCIS®(please see also Section 6.2.1 )
∀ within a maximum of 1 week after last drug intake in 1199.340 
2 Combining of Visit 1 and Visit 2: 
∀ For patients who completed SENSCIS®, Visit 1 and Visit 2 may occur on the same day if th e period between the last available laboratory test within SENSCIS®and Visit 2 of the 
extension trial (1199.225) is ≤ 6 weeks.
∀ For patients who completed 1199-0340, Visit 1 and Visit 2 are always scheduled on the same day. 
If medical condition is not stable and new Adverse Events occurred, a new laboratory test has to be performed. For patients performi ng Visit 1 and Visit 2 on the same day, eligibility assessment 
will be based on laboratory data from last laboratory test available within SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340. In case Visit 1 and Visit 2 takes place on the same day, laboratory tests, physical examination 
and vital signs are performed only once on that day and are recorded under Visit 2 in the eCRF
3The patient is required to sign informed consent prior to any trial related activities
4Only medical conditions that are occurring concomitantly at the time of screening will be recorded as baseline conditions in the  eCRF, including any ongoing AEs from SENSCIS® or 1199-
0340 respectively. 
5Cautionary note: dependent on concomitant treatment additional safety monitoring should be considered at discretion of the inve stigator. Intermediate lab tests (a-Visits) do not necessarily 
need to be a site visit.
6 ß-HCG will be performed at central lab at Visit 2 only. Urine dipstick pregnancy tests will be provided centrally and should be  performed in all women of childbearing potential every 4-6 
weeks: at least every visit and if necessary, additionally at home or at a local doctor / laboratory. If urine test is not acce ptable to local authorities, a blood test can be done at a local laboratory. 
Woman of childbearing potential will be instructed accordingly
7 Only after the dedicated biobanki ng Informed Consent has been received
8Self-reported outcome questionnaires must always be done by patients in a quiet place prior to any other visit procedure

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 20161. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology. The pathogenesis of 
SSc is characterized by systemic (multi-organ) immunological, vascular and fibrotic abnormalities. It is a rare disorder, an orphan disease, with prevalence rate of approximately 
50 to 300 in US, 20 to 50 in Asia and 100 to 200 per million in Europe ( R14-4918 , R14-
4927 ).
Patients suffer from multiple organ fibrosis, leading to chronic disability and premature 
death. Aside from skin, the lung is most often involved, but the disease may also manifest as 
proliferative and obliterative vascular abnormalities, kidney disease, oesophageal and 
gastrointestinal involvement (hypomotility), cardiac disorders and muscle disease. SSc-related mortality is mainly driven by interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Median survival is 5–8 years in SSc associated Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) (P14-07919 ).
At time of writing the Protocol, no approved SSc treatment was available, for chronic 
treatment of SSc-ILD. To date, nintedanib is the only drug approved in several countries for 
the treatment of patients with scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).Immunosuppressive therapy has been proposed as a treatment of SSc with limited controlled 
data.
According to the EULAR treatment guidelines ( P15-00879 ) there are no therapies mandated 
for SSc-ILD. Cyclophosphamide, a lymphocyte-modulating agent,  may have some effect on 
forced vital capacity (FVC) ( R14-5407 ). EULAR recommends considering 
cyclophosphamide for the treatment of SSc-ILD, but its use is limited in regard of treatment 
duration due to its toxicity. Methotrexate may be considered for treatment of skin manifestations of early diffuse SSc ( P15-00879 ). Small controlled, uncontrolled and 
retrospectively controlled studies suggest some immunosuppressive regimens (such as 
mycophenolate, azathioprine, tocilizumab, ciclosporine A) may have effect in selected 
manifestations of SSc. However, larger placebo-controlled studies are lacking ( P15-00879 ). 
Endothelin receptor antagonists failed to show significant effects on pulmonary fibrosis 
outcomes in several large studies.
The rationale for development of nintedanib in SSc-ILD is based on the pre-clinical evidence 
of potential effects in SSc and clinical evidence of antifibrotic activity of nintedanib in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) along with an acceptable safety profile. Investigation in a patient population with active SSc-ILD accompanied by varying degrees of skin and other organ fibrosis is medically rational. Nintedanib may offer a long term antifibrotic 
maintenance treatment option for SSc, a medical indication with high unmet medical need.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016The herein described clinical trial is planned as an open label extension trial following
SENSCIS® (1199.214) and 1199-0340 respectively.
The phase III trial SENSCIS®(1199.214) was investigating and has proven the safety and 
efficacy of nintedanib in Systemic Sclerosis interstitial lung disease ( P19-04387 ).
The phase I trial 1199-0340 was investigating the drug-drug interaction of nintedanib and 
oral contraceptives in female patients with SSc-ILD ( c26582112 ).
In the following, the acronym SENSCIS®will be used for trial 1199.214, standing for Safety 
and Efficacy of Nintedanib in Sy stemic Sclerosis (EudraCT no. 2015-000392-28).
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Nintedanib is a small molecule that inhibits a distinct spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) including VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor), and Src family kinases (Src, Lck and Lyn belonging to a family of 
proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinases).
All of these growth factor pathways and their down-stream signal cascades have been 
demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling.
In experiments with dermal fibroblasts from patients with SSc, nintedanib inhibited migration 
and proliferation, reduced the expression of extracellular matrix markers, and attenuated 
transformation to myofibroblast. In four animal models of SSc with different features, nintedanib effectively attenuated skin and lung fibrosis, reduced extracellular matrix deposition in skin and lung, attenuated myofibroblast accumulation in skin and lung and reduced dermal thickening. Nintedanib also reduced dermal microvascular endothelial cell 
apoptosis and effectively attenuated pulmonary vascular remodelling by reducing the number 
of vascular smooth muscle cells and occluded pulmonary vessels.
A soft gelatin capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in humans. Maximum plasma 
concentrations occur between 2 - 4 hours after oral administration. Steady state is reached at 
latest within one week of dosing. After food intake, a trend towards an increased systemic 
exposure (around 20%) and a delayed absorption was observed compared to administration under fasted conditions. Nintedanib is preferentially distributed in plasma with a blood to plasma ratio of 0.87 and the terminal half-life is in the range of 7 to 19 h. The absolute 
bioavailability of nintedanib is slightly below 5%.
Nintedanib is mainly eliminated via faeces.Coadministration of nintedanib with the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor ketoconazole 
increased exposure to nintedanib by 60-70% based on area under the curve (AUC) and by 
80% based on a maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma (Cmax) in a 
dedicated drug-drug interaction (DDI) trial.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016In a DDI trial with the P-gp inducer rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% 
based on AUC and to 60. 3% based on Cmax upon coadministration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone. 
The clinical efficacy of nintedanib has been studied in over 1400 patients with IPF in one 
phase II dose finding trial (TOMORROW) including four different doses of nintedanib, and 
two replicate phase III (INPULSIS
®1 and 2) trials. These were randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials comparing treatment with nintedanib twice daily to placebo for 52 weeks. A statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of decline of FVC (in mL) 
was demonstrated in patients receiving nintedanib 150 mg bid compared to patients receiving 
placebo. The treatment effect of nintedanib 150 mg bid compared to placebo on FVC was consistent in all 3 studies, i.e. a relative reduction of decline of approximately 50%. Supporting the effect of nintedanib on slowing disease progression ( P14-07514 ,P11-11216 ), 
nintedanib 150 mg bid significantly reduced the risk of first acute exacerbation compared 
with placebo in INPULSIS®2 and in the TOMORROW trial and reduced the risk of acute 
exacerbations (adjudicated) by 68% in a pre-specified sensitivity analysis of pooled data from the INPULSIS
®trials.
In the Phase III trial 1199.214 (SENSCIS®) in patients with SSc-ILD, nintedanib, at a dose of 
150 mg bid, significantly reduced the annual rate of decline in  after 52 weeks of treatment. The relative treatment effect, of a ~44% reduction in the annual rate of FVC decline compared with placebo, was in the same range as that previously observed in IPF. No effect of nintedanib on skin fibrosis or health-related quality of life was observed. No effect 
of nintedanib was seen on skin thickness and in patient-reported outcomes. There was no 
difference in mortality between the groups; however, the trial was not powered to detect such difference.
The safety profile of nintedanib has been investigated comprehensively in clinical Phase II to 
IV trials in patients with IPF, as well as postmarketing. The safety profile in phase III clinical 
trials in patients with SSc-ILD and patients with progressive fibrosing ILDs was generally consistent with that observed in the population of patients with IPF.
The risks of treatment with nintedanib in adult patients are primarily related to the 
gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, pancreatitis) and to drug 
induced liver injury/increases in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALK], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT] and bilirubin). 
Based on data from clinical trials and post-marketing with nintedanib in IPF patients and 
supported by population pharmacokinetic models, patients with low body weight (<65 kg), Asian and female patients have a higher risk of liver enzyme elevations with nintedanib treatment.
The most frequently reported adverse event in the clinical trials was diarrhoea, which was 
mild to moderate in intensity for the majority of patients and led to treatment discontinuation

decrease and decreased appetite have also been associated with nintedanib treatment. 
Risks of nintedanib treatment also include hypertension, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, 
gastrointestinal perforations, and thromboembolism. Thus, patients treated with full-dose 
anticoagulation or at known risk for bleeding were excluded from the INPULSIS®trials. 
Although cardiac disorder adverse events were balanced between the nintedanib and placebo groups, a higher proportion of patients (1.6%) in the nintedanib groups had myocardialinfarctions compared to the placebo groups (0.5%). Conversely, a lower proportion of 
patients in the nintedanib groups had other ischemic heart disease, which includes terms such 
as coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery stenosis, myocardial ischemia, coronary artery stent insertion, electrocardiogram (ECG) ST segment depression. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown, and further observation is 
needed. No imbalances were found in SENSCIS
®.
No evidence of QT prolongation was observed for nintedanib in the clinical trial program. As 
some tyrosine kinase inhibitors are known to exert an effect on QT, caution should be exercised when administered nintedanib in patients who may develop QT prolongation.
For patients finalizing the 52 week trial treatment in the TOMORROW and INPULSIS
®
trials, participation, open label extension trials (1199.35 and 1199.33) were offered. Long 
term treatment in these open label extension trials have confirmed the safety profile observed in the phase II and III trials.
Nintedanib was developed in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and approved by Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2014 and 
January 2015 respectively.
Nintedanib was developed in Systemic Sclerosis associated ILD and approved by Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2019 and 
April 2020 respectively.

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
The aim of this extension trial is to provide nintedanib treatment for all patients who have 
completed (did not prematurely discontinue trial medication) the phase III parent trial 
SENSCIS®or the phase I trial 1199-0340 and who may have experienced benefit from the
trial medication and wish to receive treatment.
This extension trial is designed to evaluate long term tolerability and safety of Nintedanib and 
the survival in SSc-ILD patients treated for a longer period of time. In addition, lung function

reported outcome measures will be performed. 
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Initiating and amplifying events in SSc-ILD and IPF are described to be different, but 
culminate in fibroblast activation and myofibroblast accumulation that represent the final 
common pathways of lung fibrosis in both SSc-associated ILD and IPF ( P14-07919 ). 
Nintedanib inhibits migration, proliferation and transformation of fibroblasts and thereby 
addresses this common pathway.
As shown for IPF patients, patients with SSc-ILD may also benefit from lesser decline in 
lung function and hence slower disease progression as a result of treatment with nintedanib.
The safety profile and the tolerability of nintedanib are expected to be similar in patients with 
IPF and SSc-ILD. 
Based on the efficacy and safety shown in IPF patients, and considering the similarity of the 
pharmacological rationale between IPF and SSc, the same dose regimen of 150 mg 
nintedanib bid is considered appropriate.
The risks of treatment with nintedanib have been well delineated in patients with the fibrotic 
lung disease IPF. These risks are primarily related to the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain), and are usually managed with supportive therapy and 
with temporary or permanent dose reduction to 100 mg bid. In some cases, temporary interruption or permanent drug discontinuation is necessary. A reduction in appetite and weight decrease has also been reported in patients treated with nintedanib. Patients with SSc may already suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and will be monitored for such events. 
Parenteral fed patients will be excluded from the trial.
Drug induced liver injury, increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin have been reported with 
the use of nintedanib and liver enzymes must be followed closely during treatment (see also Section 4.2.1.2 ). Nintedanib must be dose-reduced, or interrupted in the event of hepatic 
toxicity and further treatment withheld until recovery of the abnormal laboratory parameters.
Concomitant therapies with a known overlap in side effects with nintedanib (e.g. 
gastrointestinal [GI] adverse events, increase of AST, ALT, bilirubin) or concomitant use of therapies that interact with metabolism of nintedanib (through UGT1A1 and P-gp) should be 
used with caution and patients should be closely monitored (see Section 4.2.2.2 ).
Potential risks of nintedanib treatment also include gastrointestinal perforations, 
thromboembolism and bleeding. Therefore, patients who have planned major elective surgery, suffer from severe peripheral vascular disease, requiring full dose therapeutic 
anticoagulation, fibrinolysis or high-dose antiplatelet therapy will be excluded from this trial. 
Patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, Child Pugh A/B/C and Scleroderma renal crisis will not be included in this trial. Those patients will either not have been included in the

conditions occurring as adverse events.
The mode of action of nintedanib indicates a high potential for teratogenicity and 
embryotoxicity, including fetotoxicity and lethality. In women of childbearing potential 
receiving nintedanib, contraceptive measures must be employed 28 days before treatment 
initiation, during the treatment and for a period of 3 months after last drug intake.
To address the organ-specific manifestations, immunosuppressive agents (e.g. 
mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, prednisone) are commonly 
used and need to be considered although appropriate randomised-controlled data for these 
therapies are lacking.
The concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents as well as of non-immunosuppressive 
therapies for other SSc manifestations as for digital ulcers (e.g. bosentan), GI symptoms (e.g. 
proton pump inhibitors, prokinetic drugs), renal crisis (e.g. angiotensin-converting-enzyme 
inhibitor [ACE inhibitors]), pulmonary hypertension / pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH / PAH) (e.g. bosentan, sildenafil, epoprostenol) are not restricted. Cautionary notes are included in the protocol ( Section 4.2.2.2 ) with regard to such therapies whose safety profile 
could interfere with that of nintedanib.
Safety of the patients will be monitored at site visits, including physical examinations, safety 
laboratory and specific monitoring procedure to follow-up potential hepatic enzyme elevation, to exclude pregnancy, to follow-up electrocardiographic assessments, and to monitor blood pressure, renal function, hypertension, and digital ulcers. Treatment with 
nintedanib must be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic measures taken in patients who 
develop severe symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity not amenable to symptomatic treatment with standard measures or severe liver enzyme elevations or other severe adverse events as specified in Section 3.3.4 .
Even if the balance of safety and efficacy from SENSCIS®is still unknown at the time point 
the patients are rolled over into the open label extension trial, long-term treatment is considered justifiable as there is currently no pharmacotherapy for long-term use approved to modify or prevent systemic progression of SSc/SSc-ILD.
To address current practice (although randomised-controlled data for these therapies are 
scarce), patients on a stable background therapy of mycophenolate, methotrexate or low dose prednisone were eligible in SENSCIS
®.
In trial 1199-0340 patients on certain background therapy including mycophenolate and other 
treatments were excluded due to their potential effect on the PK assessment. 
Continuation or initiation of immunosuppressives or other treatments or changes in their dose 
is allowed in the open label extension taking into consideration cautionary notes.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016All patients will receive active treatment in this trial. Patients who were randomized to 
placebo in SENSCIS®will be receiving the active drug for the first time. Therefore the same 
close monitoring will be conducted as in SENSCIS®for the first 3 months of the trial.
Based on the pharmacological mechanism, existing non-clinical, clinical and post-marketing 
data there is no indication that treatment with nintedanib may increase the risk for infection 
with SARS-CoV-2 or for worsening the disease course of COVID-19.
It is currently unknown if SSc or SSc-LD conveys a higher risk for adverse outcomes in case 
of COVID-19.
The trial related risk to the COVID-19 pandemic situation is the general risk of travelling to 
site and being at site for assessments with increased infection risk for lung function testing. Risk mitigation and possible modifications are described in Section 6.1 and in Appendix 10.3
The extrapolated benefit risk ratio of chronic treatment with nintedanib 150 mg bid, with the 
possibility to be interrupted or reduced to nintedanib 100 mg bid during periods of 
intolerability, is judged positive for patients with SSc-ILD.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 20163. DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND TRIAL POPULATION
3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a multi-centre, multi-national, prospective, open label extension clinical trial. It is 
anticipated that approximately 400 patients with SSc-ILD will complete the parent trialSENSCIS
®and approximately 14 patients will complete 1199-0340 as planned. These
patients will be eligible for enrolment in this extension trial. Patients who withdrew treatment 
prematurely in SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340 will not be eligible for this open label extension trial.
After signing Informed Consent and if all eligibility criteria are met, patients will initiate 
treatment with nintedanib (Visit 2). Patients will be assigned to a dose of 150 mg bid if the 
patients last dose in SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340 was 150 mg bid and to a dose of either 100 mg 
bid or 150 mg bid at the discretion of the investigator, if patients were on 100 mg bid of blinded trial medication in SENSCIS
®/ 1199-0340 (please refer to Section 4.1.2 ).
Once assessment of the pivotal trial SENSCIS®and resulting risk-benefit of Nintedanib has 
been concluded upon, patients that are on a reduced dose of trial medication may increase 
dose to 150 mg bid Nintedanib at the discretion of the investigator.
The trial will continue for long term data collection, as long as a reasonable number of 
patients enabling analyses remain in the trial. Treatment duration for each patient will be variable. Patients will continue to receive treatment until they meet a reason for 
discontinuation (refer to section 3.3.4.4 ) or until access to nintedanib is obtained outside the 
clinical trial. The trial is estimated to last a total of approximately 5 ½ years. 
Treatment will be stopped if a reason for withdrawal is met (refer to Section 3.3.4 ).

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 20163.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
The trial will be conducted as a prospective, open-label design. This design is appropriate for 
this rollover trial assessing the long-term safety on nintedanib in patients with SSc-ILD. 
The purpose of this trial is to offer to all patients who completed SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340 as 
planned, the option to receive nintedanib treatment if they perceive an individual benefit. The 
decision to continue treatment will be made by the patient following a discussion with the 
investigator. The aim of the trial is to allow treatment continuation to individual patients; therefore, randomization, blinding and use of placebo would not be appropriate.
The planned assessments are a subset of the assessments done in SENSCIS
®/ 1199-0340 and 
an additional patient related outcome score to assess gastrointestinal symptoms and their 
impact on the patient.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is anticipated that approximately 400 patients will complete the SENSCIS®trial on 
treatment with nintedanib or placebo and that approximately 14 patients will complete the 
1199-0340 trial. These patients will be allowed to participate in this open label extension 
trial. At the time point of the start of the open label extension trial it is not known what treatment the patients had received in SENSCIS
®. Patients previously on active treatment will 
continue, patients who received placebo will initiate treatment with nintedanib for the first time at Visit 2 of the extension trial. Patients who completed 1199-0340 had open-label 
treatment with nintedanib and will continue with nintedanib treatment in 1199.225.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
Patients with SSc-ILD will be included in this trial if they fulfil all the inclusion and do not 
present any of the exclusion criteria.
Only patients who have completed the SENSCIS
®/ 1199-0340 on treatment (i.e. did not early 
permanently discontinue blinded treatment) are eligible. Patients should enrol into the 
extension trial as soon as possible after conclusion of SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340.
Please refer to Section 8.3.1 (Source Documents) for the documentation requirements 
pertaining to the in- and exclusion criteria.

4.1 INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENTS 
4.1.1 Identity of the Investigational Medicinal Products
All patients will be treated with nintedanib in this trial; there is no active comparator or 
placebo.
Substance: Nintedanib
Pharmaceutical formulation: Soft gelatine capsule
Source: BI Pharma GmbH #Co. KG
Unit strength: 150 mg, 100 mg
Posology: bidRoute of administration: Oral (swallowed)
4.1.2 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups and selection of dose
The objective of the SENSCIS
®was to assess the efficacy and safety of a dose of 150 mg bid 
compared to placebo. Patients have been randomized either to blinded Nintedanib or to blinded placebo 150 mg bid. Dose reductions from 150 mg bid Nintedanib/placebo to 100mg 
bid Nintedanib/placebo were allowed to manage adverse events.
The objective of the trial 1199-0340 was to assess the potential influence of continuous intake 
of nintedanib on the systemic exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel when administered in combination. The patients have all been treated with open label nintedanib. 
Also in trial 1199-0340 dose reductions from 150 mg bid nintedanib to 100mg bid nintedanib 
were allowed to manage adverse events.
Patients having taken 150 mg bid trial medication (active drug or placebo, blinded in 
SENSCIS
®) at the end of SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340 will start treatment with nintedanib 150 mg 
bid in the current extension trial.
Patients who receive 100 mg bid active drug or placebo within SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340 will 
be allowed to start treatment with 100 mg or increase their nintedanib dose to 150 mg bid at the discretion of the investigator.
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) will be used to assign medication numbers to eligible 
patients. Distribution of nintedanib to sites will be triggered by IRT. Details on the IRTsystem are provided in the ISF.
After subsequent conclusions on benefit/risk upon unblinded data from SENSCIS
®, patients 
who permanently reduced to 100 mg bid will be allowed to increase their nintedanib dose to 
150 mg bid at the discretion of the investigator. Dose increase will need to be assigned through IRT during an additional visit (refer to Section 6.2.4 ).

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 20164.1.3 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
The treatment for an individual patient will be assigned by means of an IRT contact during 
Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and following Visits. Patient will receive active drug at a dosage of 150 mg bid or 100 mg bid.
Trial medication will consist of 1 capsule twice daily throughout the trial. Wallets covering 4 
weeks + 5 days reserve treatment (1 wallet = 6 blisters with 10 capsules each, plus 1 blister 
reserve) will be dispensed to the patient:
∀1 wallet at day 1 (Visit 2) (30 days plus 5 days reserve).
∀2 wallets at Visit 3 (60 days plus 10 days reserve).
∀3 wallets at Visits 4 and 5 (90 days plus 15 days reserve).
∀4 wallets at Visit 6, 7 and following (120 days plus 20 days reserve).
Nintedanib will be administered orally on a twice daily basis (bid). The patients should 
swallow the trial medication unchewed together with a glass of water (~250 mL), and should observe a dose interval of 12 hours. Nintedanib needs to be taken at the same time every day 
(between 06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, and between 18:00 and 23:00 in the evening). 
Because nintedanib may cause stomach discomfort, it is recommended to take the trial medication with food.
A forgotten dose should be skipped if the time window to the next dose is less than 8 hours. 
The next dose should be taken as scheduled. 
Nintedanib should only be dispensed to participating patients according to the protocol by 
authorised personnel as documented in the form “Investigator’s Trial Staff”.
The dose can be interrupted or reduced without prior interruption, i.e., immediately stepping 
down from 150 mg bid to 100 mg bid at the discretion of the investigator if necessary due to 
adverse events. Dose adjustions require a special trial visit according to procedures described 
in Section 4.2.1 . Restart and re-escalation is possible as described in Section 4.2.1 .
4.1.4 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
4.1.4.1 Blinding
In this open-label trial, treatment allocation will not be concealed throughout the trial. The 
eCRF will contain information on actual treatment.
The previous treatment received in SENSCIS®(active drug or placebo) will remain unknown 
until the database lock of SENSCIS®and until subsequent conclusions on benefit/risk. No 
individual unblinding regarding treatment received in SENSCIS®should occur prior to this 
point in time.This is not applicable for patients who participated in trial 1199-0340, since they received open-label nintedanib treatment.

4.1.5 Packaging, labelling, and re-supply
The investigational products will be provided by BI or a designated clinical research 
organisation (CRO). They will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Initial supply and re-supply to the sites will be 
managed via an IRT system. The IRT will assign an appropriate kit to each patient and will 
also monitor expiry dates of supplies available at the sites.
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.Primary trial material will be capsules containing 150 mg of nintedanib (or 100 mg of 
nintedanib if dose is reduced). All trial medication will be packaged in blister cards. Each 
blister card will contain 10 capsules. Seven blisters cards will be packaged into one child-
resistant tamper-evident wallet (i.e. 70 capsules/wallet). Each wallet will be labelled with a multi-language booklet according to the requirements of the participating countries.
One wallet covers for one month of treatment.
Details of packaging and the description of the label will be provided in the ISF.
Re-supplies of trial medication are planned due to the short expiry date and the long duration 
of the trial. The medication for re-supply will be packaged in an identical manner as the medication for initial supply.
4.1.6 Storage conditions
Drug supplies will be kept in their original packaging and in a secure limited access storage 
area according to the recommended storage conditions on the medication label. A
temperature log must be maintained for documentation.
If the storage conditions are found to be outside the specified range, the local clinical monitor 
(as provided in the list of contacts) must be contacted immediately.
All unused trial medication must be returned to the sponsor or appointed CRO. Receipt, 
usage and return must be documented on the respective forms. Account must be given for any discrepancies.

4.2.1.1 Management of diarrhoea
Other causes for diarrhoea should always be considered and treated accordingly (e.g. viral 
infections, SSc related diarrhoea, bacterial overgrowth, antibiotic treatment).
Diarrhoea should be managed as early as possible after onset of first symptoms with standard 
antidiarrheal symptomatic treatment, e.g. loperamide.
If diarrhoea persists despite optimal symptomatic treatment, treatment interruption and dose 
reduction of nintedanib should be considered based on the recommendations described in table 4.2.1.1:1.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016Initial assessment and blood sampling for liver enzyme elevation follow up should be 
performed at the investigational site. Blood samples for additional monitoring may be collected at the investigational site, primary care physician or external laboratory with specific trial lab kits and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.
4.2.2 Restrictions
4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Other investigational therapy is not allowed during the entire trial period and must not have 
been introduced in the interval between the parent trial SENSCIS
®/ 1199-0340 and 
enrolment into this open label extension trial.
4.2.2.2 Cautionary Notes
As nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp and, to a minor extent, CYP3A4, concomitant use of 
P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin) with nintedanib may increase exposure to nintedanib. Patients taking potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, erythromycin or 
ciclosporine) should be monitored closely for tolerability of nintedanib.
Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. 
John’s wort) with nintedanib may decrease exposure to nintedanib. For patients taking potent P-gp inducers, selection of alternative treatment with no or minimal P-gp induction should be 
considered.
As the most common side effects known for nintedanib are GI effects, the concomitant use of 
medication with an overlapping safety profile (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil/ sodium) should be carefully considered.
Nintedanib is also associated with increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. If in addition to 
the trial medication, a treatment is introduced that is known to induce AST/ALT elevations 
(e.g. methotrexate, bosentan), adequate measures should be taken to ensure patients safety: perform additional measurement of liver enzymes (ALT and AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and eosinophils) every 2 weeks for approximately 6 weeks, by using intermediated 
(a-visit) trial lab kit.
4.2.2.3 Restrictions on diet and life style
No restrictions on diet or life style.
4.2.2.4 Restrictions regarding women of childbearing potential 
The anti-angiogenic properties of nintedanib indicate a high potential for teratogenicity and
embryotoxicity, including fetotoxicity and lethality. In women of childbearing potential receiving nintedanib, contraceptive measures described in the patient information must be

after last drug intake.
4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Patients are requested to bring all remaining trial medication including empty package 
material with them when attending visits.
Based on capsule counts, treatment compliance will be calculated as the number of capsules 
taken, divided by the number of capsules which should have been taken according to the scheduled period, multiplied by 100. Compliance will be verified by the on-site monitor authorised by the sponsor.
Treatment compliance (%) =Number of capsules actually taken ∃100
Number of capsules which should have been taken
If the number of doses taken is not between 80-120%, site personnel will explain the patient 
the importance of treatment compliance.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 20165.2.11 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.11.1 Definitions of AEs 
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from 
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off-
label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
∀results in death,
∀is life-threatening, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if more severe.
∀requires inpatient hospitalisation or 
∀prolongation of existing hospitalisation,
∀results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or
∀is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, 
or
∀is to be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may jeopardise the patient and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the above definitions.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse. 
For Japan only: the following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other 
reason”. AEs which possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAEs.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
Every new occurrence of cancer of new histology must be classified as a serious event 
regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the trial medication and must be 
reported as described in section 5.2.11 , subsections “AE Collection” and AE reporting to 
sponsor and timelines”.
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in section 5.2.11 , subsections “AE Collection” and AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by their nature, can always be 
considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest 
list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request.  These events should always be 
reported as SAEs as described above.
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESI need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, please see above.
Adverse events relating to gastrointestinal perforation and hepatic injury will be considered 
AESIs.
Hepatic injury
In this trial protocol, signs of hepatic injury are defined as:
∀ALT and/or AST ≥8 fold ULN
∀ALT and/or AST ≥3 fold ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2 fold ULN*

∀ALT and/or AST ≥3 fold ULN and unexplained eosinophilia (>5%)*
∀ALT and/or AST ≥3 fold ULN and appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper abdominal quadrant pain or tenderness, fever and/or rash
* in the same blood draw sample.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to immediately stop the trial medication and need to be followed up 
according to the “drug-induced liver injury (DILI) checklist” provided in the ISF.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST and total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters 
are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.
Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily toleratedModerate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activitySevere: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities
In addition the intensity of diarrhoea adverse events should be classified and recorded in the 
eCRF according to the Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4 (R10-4848 , Table 5.2.11.1:1 ).

history. 
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
•The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug 
•The event is known to be caused by or attributed to the drug class.
•A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
•Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced
•No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
•The event is typically drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
•An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
•No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
•Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despite removing the original trigger.
•Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely 
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
•Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
For Japan only: the reason for the decision on causal relationship for unlisted AEs needs to be 
provided in the CRF.

AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the 
investigator:
• From signing the informed consent onwards through the Residual Effect Period (REP), of 
at least 28 days until individual patient’s end of trial: -all AEs (serious and non-serious) and all AESIs.
• After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for AEs but should only 
report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should however, not be reported in the CRF.
Figure 5.2.11.2: 1 AE collection
The REP is defined as 28 days after the last trial medication application and will apply only 
to patients that discontinue the trial early. All AEs which occurred through the treatment 
phase and throughout the REP will be considered as on treatment, please see Section 7.3.4 .
Events which occurred after the REP will be considered as post treatment events.
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours ) to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016For Japan only: all SAEs and AESIs must be reported immediately to the head of the trial 
site.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
CRF pages and the BI SAE form. The Investigator should determine the causal relationship 
to the trial medication and any possible interactions between the investigational drug(s) and a 
Non-Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) / Auxiliary Medicinal Product (AMP)
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF and SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by the investigator.
If such abnormalities already pre-exist prior trial inclusion they will be considered as 
baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they have resolved, have been sufficiently characterised, or no further information can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in 
the clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of 
Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flowchart . Some flexibility 
is allowed in scheduling the visits according to visit time windows as specified in the 
Flowchart . If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit 
date schedule (calculated from Visit 2). The trial medication kits contain sufficient 
medication to allow for these time windows. All deviations from the planned visit schedule will be documented.
The trial will run until all patients have discontinued treatment or a stopping criterion is met 
according to Section 3.3.4 .
In exceptional circumstances (as e.g. in pandemic situations), when it is impossible to 
conduct study visits at the study site, study visits may be performed at patient’s home or remotely (via telephone and/or internet based means of communication), and local lab liver enzyme testing. The visit may also be performed as a hybrid of home and remote visit. All 
home/remote visits need to be discussed with and authorised by the sponsor’s trial team. The 
trial team’s decision will be based on a thorough benefit-risk evaluation.
The procedures performed during a home/remote visit may be adjusted as compared to a 
regular visit, as detailed in Appendix 10.3 .
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
6.2.1 Screening
The trial will be explained to all patients who completed SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340 and are 
willing to continue or start treatment with nintedanib. No trial related procedure or data collection should be performed until the patient has signed the Informed Consent for the extension trial.
The earliest timepoint for Visit 2 of the rollover trial is one day after the last visit, namely:
∀the Follow-Up (FU) visit in SENSCIS
®or
∀the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit in trial 1199-0340
The last timepoint for Visit 2 is:
∀12 weeks after the last trial drug intake occurred within SENSCIS®
∀7 days after the last trial drug intake occurred within 1199-0340
Enrolment of patient into SENSCIS®-ON should be done as soon as possible to ensure 
gapless monitoring of a patient.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016In order to assess eligibility for the extension trial, patients are required to perform a 
screening visit (Visit 1) which includes collection of samples for laboratory tests.
Visit 1 and Visit 2 may occur on the same day if the period between the last available 
laboratory test within SENSCIS®and Visit 2 of the extension trial (1199.225) is ≤ 6 weeks. If 
the medical condition is not stable and new Adverse Events occurred, a new laboratory test 
has to be performed. For patients performing Visit 1 and Visit 2 on the same day, eligibility assessment will be based on laboratory data from last laboratory test available within SENSCIS
®. In case Visit 1 and Visit 2 takes place on the same day, laboratory tests, physical 
examination and vital signs are performed only once on that day and are recorded under Visit
2 in the eCRF. In case a new AE has occurred after the last visit of SENSCIS® new safety 
laboratory testing is required.
Patients who have a laboratory test value that is outside the range specified by the exclusion 
criteria may have the test repeated once to determine eligibility; however, the result must be 
available prior to Visit 2.
Details of any patient who has given informed consent for the trial but is found to be in-
eligible must be entered in the enrolment log and documented in the eCRF.
Ongoing AEs from SENSCIS®/ 1199-0340 are to be documented as Baseline Condition.
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
If the patient has been determined eligible by the investigator to enter the trial (refer to 
Section 3.3 ), the investigator will assign a medication number to the patient through IRT at 
Visit 2 (refer to Section 4.1.2 ). First dose of nintedanib within 1199.225 will be administered 
at Visit 2 in the clinic (day 1).
Additional clinic visits will be scheduled after 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks of treatment (Visits 
3-7). Liver function monitoring visits (a-visits) will be performed at 2, 8, 18, 30 and 44 weeks 
of treatment (Visits 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a). After the first year of treatment (Visit 7), complete clinic visits will be scheduled every 16 weeks with intermediate liver function monitoring visits (a-visits) every 16 weeks.
The self-reported outcome questionnaires must always be done by patients in a quiet place 
prior to any other visit procedure.
For detailed description of the trial procedures at each visit and dispensing schedule, please 
refer to the Flowchart .
End of Treatment (EOT)
If a reason for drug discontinuation is met or the trials terminated due to one of the reasons 
mentioned in Section 3.3.4 an End of treatment Visit (EOT) should be scheduled as soon as 
possible after last drug intake. Reason for discontinuation must be documented in the eCRF.
For detailed description of the trial procedures at the EOT visit, please refer to the Flowchart .

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 20166.2.3 Trial Completion and Follow Up Period
The End of Treatment Visit will be the trial completion visit. A Follow-up (FU) Visit is only 
to be planned for 7 days after last trial drug intake in case trial medication had to be discontinued permanently due to adverse events.
For detailed description of the trial procedures at the FU Visit, please refer to the Flowchart . 
If the reason for removal of a patient from the treatment is an adverse event or an abnormal 
laboratory test result, the patient must be followed until complete resolution or stabilization of the event for at least 7 days after onset of the event or until follow-up is considered adequate by the investigator and the clinical monitor.
A patient will be considered lost to follow-up if the investigator is not able to contact him/her 
despite multiple attempts. Every effort must be made; at least 2 telephone contacts plus 1 mailing should be documented. The site must notify the clinical monitor prior to designating a patient as lost to follow-up.
6.2.4 Dose modification visit
Every time a dose should be reduced or increased (refer to Section 4.1.3 and Section 4.2.1 ) 
patients will need to come to the site for a dose modification visit where the following will be 
performed:
∀Physical examination including measuring weight;
∀Vital signs;
∀Safety laboratory;
∀Assessment of adverse events and concomitant therapy since last visit;
∀Assignment of new dose in IRT;
∀Dispensing of trial drug;
∀Drug accountability.

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a multicentre, multi-national, open-label clinical trial to investigate the long term 
safety of nintedanib in patients with SSc-ILD previously treated in (SENSCIS®) or 1199-
0340.
As the main objective of this extension trial is to study long-term safety, only descriptive 
statistics will be used. Some limitations due to the nature of extension trial should be considered when interpreting the data (bias in the selection of the population, no comparative arm). Further endpoints are considered as exploratory only. 
This statistical paragraph deals with the analyses to be performed on the extension trial only. 
Although data of parent trial will not be described in the scope of these analyses, they will be taken into account for adverse events analyses, as described in Section 7.3.4 .
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
All analyses are descriptive and exploratory in nature. No formal statistical inference is
planned.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
The treated set (TS) will consist of all patients who received at least one dose of open-label 
trial medication.
The definition of important protocol violations (IPV) will be specified in the trial statistical 
analysis plan (TSAP). These IPV definitions will include consideration of importantviolations of entry criteria, treatment non-compliance, restricted medications and inadequate 
follow-up of hepatic events.
Patients will be analysed according to their randomized treatment group in the previous trial
SENSCIS
® / 1199-0340.
The last available value between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (before first trial drug intake) will be 
considered as the baseline, for this extension trial.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
The primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety of nintedanib, so please refer to 
Section 7.3.4 . The list of main safety endpoints is included in Section 5.2 .
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
Not applicable.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 October 20167.3.4 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) coding dictionary. Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment in this extension trial and end of the 
residual effect period (REP), a period of 7 days after the last dose of trial medication in this 
extension trial, will be assigned to the treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safety analysis. In general, safety analyses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events in this extension trial, i. e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment in this extension trial until 7 days after last trial drug intake will be considered ‘treatment-emergent’. The residual effect period is defined as 7 days.
Adverse events that start before first drug intake in this extension trial and deteriorate under 
treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment-emergent’. Other adverse events will be 
assigned to the previous trial, between-trials, screening, post-treatment, or post-trial period, as appropriate.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).
Laboratory data will be analysed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinically relevant abnormal values.

clinical trial participants as well as the laboratories' activities for clinical trials sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim are regularly audited. The analytical groups and 
the banking facility are therefore assessed to be qualified for the storage and use of 
biological samples and data collected in clinical trials.

8.6 TRIAL MILESTONES
The start of the trial is defined as the date when the first patient in the whole trial signs 
informed consent.
The end of the trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the whole trial 
(“Last Patient Out”).
The “ Last Patient Drug Discontinuation” (LPDD) date is defined as the date on which the 
last patient at an individual trial site ends trial medication (as scheduled per protocol or 
prematurely). Indi vidual Investigators will be notified of SUSARs occurring with the trial 
medication until 30 days after LPDD at their site. Early termination of the trial is defined 
as the premature termination of the trial due to any reason before the end of the trial as specified in this protocol.
Temporary halt of the trial is defined as any unplanned interruption of the trial by the 
sponsor with the intention to resume it.
Suspension of the trial is defined as an interruption of the trial based on a Health Authority 
request.
The IEC / competent authority in each participating EU member state will be notified about 
the trial milestones according to the respective laws.
A final report of the clinical trial data will be written only after all patients have completed 
the trial in all countries (EU or non-EU) to incorporate and consider all data in the report.
The sponsor will submit to the EU database a summary of the final trial results within one 
year from the end of a clinical trial as a whole, regardless of the country of the last patient 
(EU or non-EU).
For Japan only: when the trial is completed, the Investigator should inform the head of the 
trial site of the completion in writing, and the head of the trial site should promptly inform the 
IRB and sponsor of the completion in writing.
8.7 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE TRIAL
The trial is sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI).
The Coordinating Investigator is responsible to coordinate Investigators at the different 
centres participating in this multicentre trial. Tasks and responsibilities are defined in a 
contract.

Creatinine clearance calculation is done according to Cockroft and Gault ( R96-0690 ).
∀Creatinine clearance = (140 - age) x (Weight in kg) x (0.85 if female) / (72 x serum 
creatinine in mg/dL)
10.3 VISIT MODIFICATION IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
INITIAL MODIFIED or ADDED 
Face-to-face patient visit performed 
by a physician/under the 
responsibility of a physician on site.Remote or home visit performed by the investigational site 
physician/under the responsibility of the investigational site 
physician to ensure the wellbeing of a patient and to collect 
at least: Adverse Events / Concomitant Treatments and 
Drug Interruption 
Regular on site safety lab test using 
central lab kits:
∀Haematology, Biochemistry, 
Electrolytes, Coagulation, Urinalysis every 16 weeks using 
central lab; Liver enzyme 
monitoring every 8 weeks, using 
central lab
∀Pregnancy test every 4-6 weeks 
(possible at home)∀Under treatment with nintedanib, regular liver enzyme 
monitoring is required and needs to be ensured by the 
investigational site, but can be done at a local lab / local 
doctor. The investigator has to ensure medical review 
and proper documentation in the eCRF. Minimum required safety lab paramenters are AST, ALT, GGT, 
ALK and total bilirubin.
∀Urine pregnancy tests (for women of childbearing 
potential only) are regularly required and may be done at local lab / local doctor, or at home. 
∀Decision whether to continue nintedanib treatment 
should be made based on an individual risk assessment 
for that individual patient and weigh up the benefits of 
an extended lab interval to maximum 16 weeks versus 
an interruption of treatment.
∀Medical decision has to be documented in patient’s 
source notes.
If remote patient visits and/or local liver enzyme 
monitoring cannot be performed, nintedanib treatment 
needs to be interrupted.
If liver function tests are out of the 
range, the per protocol rules apply => 
dose reductionIf the patient cannot come to site for receiving new dose 
treatment and/ or patient safety and follow up safety lab 
testing cannot be guaranteed, treatment needs to be interrupted.
Dispensation of study treatment on 
site∀Site / Depot to patient IMP shipments
∀Patients must consent to providing contact details for 
shipping purposes 
∀Patients should retain all unused IMP and packaging, 
and return it when they are able to return to the site.

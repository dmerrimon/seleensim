SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol IM140103
Protocol Title: Open Label, Adaptive Design, Ascending, Multiple- Dose Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of 
BMS -986004 in Adult Subjects with Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):   Total of 40 subjects will be enrolled for the study, treated in dose panels of 10 subjects each. Four (4) 
dose panels are planned to be enrolled sequentially in an ascending manner , with dose intensity selected to provide 
increased levels of immunosuppression at steady state. Dose levels that are planned to be evaluated in this trial are 
expected to elicit a range of clinical response. Based on current preclinical projections, the doses range from 75 mg 
to 1500 mg every tw o weeks. 
BMS -986004 w ill be adm inistered once every 2 weeks as an IV infusion for a total of 7 doses. Subjects will receive 
investigational product on Day 1/Week 0, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12, for a total of 7 
doses. 
During the long term extension (LTE) period, BMS -986004 will be administered once every 2 weeks as an IV 
infusion for 24 w eeks and during 2 Taper visits.
Study Phase: Phase 1b/2
Research Hypothesis: Because current study is an open label trial without placebo control, there is no formal 
research hypothesis to be statistically validated. The purpose of this study is to test if BMS -986004 w ill be effective 
in normalizing platelet counts in subjects with ITP, as well as to assess the safety, PK and immunogenicity of 
multiple doses of BMS -986004 in ITP subjects.
Prim ary Objectives:
To assess the overall safety and tolerability of multiple doses of BMS -986004, when administered in subjects 
with chronic ITP.
Secondary objectives: 
To evaluate efficacy of BMS-986004 in the treatment of throm bocy topenia in subjects with chronic ITP, as 
measured by platelet response/complete response (R/CR) and other clinical parameters. 
To establish BMS -986004 dose response, as measured by platelet count and other clinical parameters.
To measure the target engagement of BMS -986004 follow ing multiple IV doses
To assess the effect of BMS-986004 on markers associated with the risk of throm boembolism (TE) in the 
multiple dose setting
To assess pharmacokin etics and immunogenicity of multiple doses of BMS -986004 in subjects with chronic 
ITP

Clinical Protocol IM140103
BMS-986004 anti-cd40l dab
Long T erm Extension Period Objective :
To assess the long term clinical safety, tolerability and efficacy of BMS -986004 . 
Study Design:   This is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, dose response, 
and pharmacology (PK, target engagement and PD) of BMS -986004 in subjects w ith ITP. 
The study will comprise a short -term period and a long -term extension (LTE) period. 
The short -term period, is divided into three phases: Response Phase (6 weeks), Remission Phase (6 weeks) and 
Follow  Up phase (8 weeks).
Screening evaluations to determine subject eligibility will be performed 21 days prior to study drug admi nistration. 
The screening period may exceed 21 days but not more than 42 days total only after a discussion with and approval 
by the Study Director. If an extension in screening time is granted, the patient must still follow  the platelet count 
rules for en rollment . The baseline platelet count determining enrollment eligibility will be based on the mean of two 
determinations taken within a week before the first dose. To be eligible for enrollment, platelet count needs to be 
less than 30,000/ mm3and show  stable or declining trend. If the mean platelet count is betw een 30,000 -35,000/ 
mm3the subject may be considered for enrollm ent on a case by case basis after discussion with and approval by  the 
Study Director .
Follow ing screening, a total of 40 evaluable subjects are planned for the study. Subjects are considered evaluable if 
they receive the first 4 doses of study drug and complete the required safety and efficacy evaluations at Day 50. 
Non-evaluable subjects will be replaced to maintain a count of 10 subjects in each dose panels, except subjects will 
not be replaced if they are discontinued from the study secondary to an adverse event unless the adverse event can 
be determined to be unrelated to treatment .
Subjects are treated in dose panels of 10 subjects each. Four (4) dose panels are planned to be enrolled sequentially 
in an ascending manner, with dose intensity selected to provide increased levels of immunosuppression at steady 
state. Dose levels (range from 75 mg to 1500 mg administered every two weeks) that are planned to be evaluated in 
this trial are expected to elicit a range of clinical response. 
BMS -986004 w ill be administered once every 2 weeks as an IV infusion for a total of 7 doses. Four (4) doses will be 
administered during the Response Phase over a 6 week treatment period. The remaining 3 doses will be 
administered during the Remission Phase of the study over a 6 week treatment period. Subjects will receive 
investigational product on Day 1/Week 0 , Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12, for a total of 7 
doses. 
Each dose cohort will enroll 10 new subjects, starting with the respective dose level at Day1/Week 0, regardless of 
the number of subjects joining a dose cohort because of intr a-subject dose escalation. 
A new cohort may be opened to treat subjects at a dose lower than 75 mg if at least 6 subjects treated at the 75 mg 
cohort achieve platelet Response (R) (platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm3and at least 2-fold increase from the baseline
count and absence of bleeding) , at the end of response phase (Week 6). The new cohort would follow the same 
schedule as the other cohorts including intra -subject dose escalation.
The Long- term  extension (LTE) period is optional and will include eligible subjects (defined as subjects from 
either cohort 3 or cohort 4 who complete 12 w eeks (85 -days) of treatment and who achieve a response as defined by 
at least a doubling of platelets from Short Term  Day 1 baseline and a platelet count of ≥ 35,000/mm3. If a subject 
has platelet counts close to a doubling of platelets and/or betw een 30,000 -35,000 platelets/ mm3, the subject may be 
considered for the long term extension on a case by case basis, which will involve a review of data from the short 
term period and w hich will require approval by the Study Director.
Intra -subject dose escalation
Intra -subject dose escalation could occur after the subject has completed the Response Phase of the study. Subject 
will receive the next higher dose of BMS -986004 if clinically significant response has not been achieved based on 
measurement of platelet count on the last two consecutive counts performed at Day 43 and Day 50, and a favorable

safety profile is observed. Clinically significant response is defined as achieving platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3with 
an increase of at least 20,000/mm3from baseline and absence of bleeding. Subject will then be dosed at the higher 
dose level for the remainder of the study (Remission Phase).
Dose frequency adjustment for responders exceeding 450,000/mm3(for non-splenectom ized subjects) and 
600,000/mm3(for splenectomized subjects) platelet count
For both the short -term period and the long -term extension, i n the event that platelet count exceeds 450,000/mm3for 
non-splenectomized subjects and 600,000/mm3for subjects who underwent splenectomy, in the absence of recent 
(administered within two weeks) rescue medication, as indicated by the two consecutive platelet count 
measurements, dosing of the BMS -986004 should be stopped. Subject will remain in the study and platelet counts 
will be then assessed based on the norm al study visit schedule. Dosing of BMS -986004 could be reinitiated only 
after discussion between Study Director and Investigator if clinically appropriate and dictated by the medical 
judgment and subject’s safety.
Dose escalation for dose panel and stopping rules
Decisions regarding dose escalation will be made based on the review of all cumulative safety inform ation which 
includes, in general, the safety data through study Day 15 from the 10 subjects in the preceding low er dose cohort. If 
neither of the below stopping rules is present in dose panel, then dose escalation may proceed w ithin the next higher 
dose level. However, escalation to the next higher cohort may occur when none of the stopping rules have been met 
and no less than 5 subjects in a cohort have been followed for at least 2 weeks under certain conditions as illustrated 
in the section of early decision of dose escalation for dose panel.
The stopping rules listed below will be used to determine whether it is safe to escalate to the next higher cohort. 
Dose escalation to the next planned dose will not proceed if any of the following criteria are met (Adverse event 
grading as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adver se Events [CTCAE, Version 4.0]):
Five or more subjects in a cohort have platelet counts >450,000/mm3for non-splenectomized subjects and 
>600,000/mm3for subjects who underwent splenectomy, and platelet count raise is not attributable to a rescue 
or concom itant therapy.
Two or more subjects have serious adverse events in the same organ system (Grade 3 and above), that are 
determined to be related to study medication
It is determined that the limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached. This decision will be made 
following discussions betw een the Study Team and the Investigator
If any of the above criteria are met within a dose level, the progression to a higher dose level will be put on hold and 
all safety data available across the study will be evaluated to estimate the risk of proceeding to the higher dose level. 
The review will include all of the subject(s) that experienced SAEs listed above. In addition, data set may include 
subjects from a dose panel, the entire dose panel, or if appropr iate, all randomized subjects treated to date. 
In addition, decision may be made following discussions betw een the Study Team  and the Investigator to halt dose 
escalation for reasons not defined above, including but not limited to, observing a single serious adverse event in 
individual subjects, observ ing trends in a given dose panel and across dose panels, and/or it is determined that the 
limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached. 
If dose escalation is stopped due to any  of these findings, additional cohorts may receive the same or low er do ses of 
the investigational compound.
At the time of dose escalation, dose levels of new cohorts may be adjusted to lower doses if the accumulated safety 
data so dictates.
Adaptive dose selection may be performed to adjust some pre-selected doses, e.g., thethird or/and fourth cohort 
doses, using accumulated efficacy and dose or exposure data. Models based on response rate, such as but not limited 
to (Bayesian) logistic regression, (Bayesian) EMax model, may be utilized to predict a dose satisfying certain

efficacy criteria, which might be different from the standard. If there are enough responding subjects with multiple 
platelet measurements, changes of platelet count may be directly modeled by dose and study day to facilitate dose 
prediction. The selected d ose for a cohort should not exceed the originally planned dose for that cohort, i.e., selected 
dose for cohort C should not be larger than 675mg and it should be at most 1500mg for cohort D.

Early Decision of Dose escalation for dose panel
When a cohort is filled and a new subject is available to be treated, an early decision can be made on whether to 
open the next higher cohort if not all the subjects have completed the evaluation period. The early decision rule is 
based on controlling the probability of making a wrong early decision, called decision risk, to be at most 15%. 
Detailed information on deriving the decision risk is included in Appendix 1. 
The early decision rule is based on the largest number of subjects who developed AE of interest which is drug-
related SAE within the same organ system at grade 3 or higher. The early decision does not directly take into 
consideration other criteria as covered by the stopping rule. As such, its decision can be modified upon agreement 
from both i nvestigators and sponsor. In case subjects are allocated to the higher cohort and at least one stopping rule 
as stated above is triggered toward the lower dose cohort when more events are observed at the lower cohort, 
decision will be made upon agreement f rom both investigators and sponsor after considering all safety data.
Three count numbers are used by the decision rule and are defined as follows.
Titration -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nH): the number of subjects who are titrated and comp lete the evaluation 
period (2 w eeks) starting from the first titration dose (on day 43).
Start -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nL): the num ber of subjects who develop drug related SAE at grade 3 or higher 
or complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) from the first dose (on day 1) buthaven’t completed the 2 weeks 
evaluation period follow ing the first titration dose (on day 43) if being titrated to a higher dose.

Subjects with AE of Interest (k): the largest number of subjects who developed drug related SAE within the 
same organ system at grade 3 or higher, which could happen any time after the first dose of BMS -986004 till 
the decision making day. The value of k is allowed to be either 0 or 1. Note that it doesn’t distinguish at which 
stage of treatment, prior to or post titration, tha t such AE happened.
Minim um Requirement for Cohort Escalation
A set of minimum safety requirement, as listed below , must be met in order to make an early decision.
There must be at least 5 (nL+nH>=5) safety evaluable subjects (with safety data through stu dy Day 15)
A higher dose than the new cohort’s start dose must be shown tolerated in the IM140 -002 study.
Early Decision Rule:
If there is not AE of interest observed, the early decision rule is the same as the minimum requirements.
If there is one AE of interest observed, the early decision rule is shown in Table 3.1.4 -1, where W represent wait, 
i.e., not enough evidence to enable dose panel escalation, and E represents escalate.
If there are least tw o subjects with AE of interest, stopping rule is trigger ed, and subject cannot be treated at the next 
higher cohort.
Study Population:  
Male and Female subjects ≥18 years old with persistent or chronic ITP according to American Society of 
Hem atology (ASH), with or without prior splenectomy guidelines will be eligible to participate in the study. 
Wom en of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not be nursing or pregnant and must be using an acceptable 
method of contraception for at least 4weeks before dosing. WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 
hours prior to dosing with study medication

Study Assessments:  
Safety Outcome Measures:  Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and 
the results of vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. The 
incidence of observed adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical 
importance.
Efficacy Assessments: Response (R) -platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm3and at least 2-fold incre ase from the 
baseline count and absence of bleeding, or Complete response (CR) -platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3and absence 
of bleeding, or Overall response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or R.
Pharm acokinetic Measures: Pharmacokinetic param eters (Cmax, Ctrough), will be derived from serum 
concentration versus time
Biomarker Measures:  CD40L receptor occupancy and free soluble CD40L will be measured to determine target 
engagement. Total soluble CD40L will be measured as a potential PD biomarker. Platelet -associated anti-

platelet antibody titers will be measured to explore possible effects on the prim ary pathogenic disease 
mechanism in ITP. Whole genome RNA profiling in the peripheral blood will be undertaken to explore CD40 
pathway activation and to enum erate plasm ablasts by gene expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) will be purified from whole blood and analyzed by  flow cytom etry to determine if baseline leukocyte 
phenotypes inform on patient response to therapy and/or if leukocyte phenotypes are affected by drug therapy. 
Plasma molecules that may be associated with the disease or drug target pathway, including cytokines and 
chemokines, will be measured. The prim ary safety biomarkers, d-Dimer and Throm bin anti-Throm bin(TAT), 
will be monitored to evaluate risk of throm boem bolism. Exploratory safety biomarkers to monitor possible 
effects on protective immunity will include immune cell enum eration by T, B, NK TruCount and phenotyping 
by flow cytometry. 
Statis tical Considerations:
Sample Size:
The number of subjects is not based on statistical power considerations. If 4 responders are observed out of 10 
subjects at a dose level, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate is (0.15, 0.70).
Endpoints:
Primary endpoints of safety will be measured by AE, SAE, ECG, and laboratory abnorm alities including safety 
biomarkers of d -Dimer and TAT. 
Secondary endpoint of efficacy is measured by response rate. Secondary endpoints of PK include Cmax, CLT, 
AUC(TAU), Ctrough, AI_AUC, and AI_Cmax.
Exploratory endpoints include time to response, duration of response, and time to peak response.
Endpoints for the Long Term Extension Period
Primary endpoints of safety for the long-term extension period will be measured by AE, SAE, ECG, and laboratory 
abnormalities including safety biomarkers of d -Dimer and TAT.
The endpoint of efficacy is measured by response rate.
Analyses:
Dem ographics and Baseline Characteristics
Frequency distributions of gender and race will be tabulate d. Summary statistics for age, body weight, height, and 
Body  Mass Index (BMI) w ill be tabulated. Prior therapies will be listed and summarized for each dose.
Safety Analyses
All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated by system organ class, preferred term and treatment. Vital 
signs and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized by treatment. Any significant physical 
examination findings, and clinical laboratory results will be listed. ECG readings will be evaluated by the 
investigator and abnormalities, if present, will be listed.
Efficacy Analyses
Platelet count and change from baseline will be listed for all treated subjects. Response status will be reported 
together with time to respond, time to peak response, and duration of response. Response rate will be provided by 
cohort and treatment phase (response phase or remission phase).
Bleeding score will be listed for each subject. Bleeding events and the number of subjects experiencing any bleeding 
episode w ill be summarized by panel.

1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit A ssessment
BMS -986004 is currently  being evaluated in humans in a FIH SAD study  which is being 
performed in healthy  subjects to investigate the safety , tolerability , PK and PD of BMS -986004. 
To-date, BMS -986004 has not been studied in the ITP patient population and hence no efficacy 
or benefit data is established for this population. Howeve r, no clinicall y significant risks have 
been identified in the FIH study  to-date and the safet y margins in non-clinical studies are 
favorable which justifies careful evaluation of BMS -986004 in the ITP patient population.
BMS -986004 could potentially  prov ide clinical benefit by  normalizing platelet counts in patients 
with ITP.   This study will be initiating at a dose that has demonstrated relatively  low 
immunosuppressive effect and has demonstrated no clinically  significant risks in the FIH study .
Dose panels will be enrolled sequentially  in an ascending manner upon careful review of all 
cumulative safet y information. Cumulative safety  data will include all additional data that is 
available in the FIH study  as well as data collected during the ITP study .To manage the safety 
risks, careful clinical and laboratory  monitoring and criteria relative to dose escalation and 
stopping rules have been established for this protocol and include thresholds for serious 
infections, liver function tests, platelet count s above established thresholds, and other adverse 
events. 
It is expected that ITP subjects will derive clinical benefit from BMS -986004 and help guide 
dose selection and design of future studies in the clinical development of BMS -986004. Primary 
efficacy assessments will include the proportion of patients achieving platelet count at least 
≥30,000/mm3and at least 2 -fold increase from the baseline count and absence of bleeding.
The subjects planned to be enrolled in this study  have limited therapeutic options since they  have 
failed conventional therapies including immunosuppresive therapies, splenectom y and TPO 
mimetics. It is anticipated that efficacious doses of BMS -986004 will provide long lasting

therapeutic benefit for ITP patients. Ultimately , targeting CD40L may provide opportunit y to 
inhibit autoimmune processes leading to thrombocy topenia and induce durable disease 
remission. I t may  thus offer novel therapeutic modality , currentl y not available to patients.
Given the lack of therapeutic options for ITP subjects who have failed all conventional therapies, 
BMS -986004 with its distinct mechanism of action and known safet y profile appears to have a 
favorable Risk/ Benefit profile.
Detailed information regarding the preclinical toxicology  findings based on nonclinical studies 
inmonkey s with BMS -986004 can be found in Section 1.5.2 and the Investigator Brochure .
1.5.1 Potential risks associated with BMS -986004
BMS -986004 is a dimeric anti- human CD40L  VH dAb formatted with the Fc -tail from abatacept 
(modified IgG1) that is entirely inert in Fc effector function, especiall y in context of FcγRIIa. All 
data from nonclinical and NHP studies demonstrate that BMS -986004 exhibited no activity  in 
various platelet activation assay s, as well as in direct biacor e binding analy sis with FcγRIIa. 
Based on previous clinical experience with antibodies targeting costimulatory  molecules and in 
particular with anti-CD40L  antibodies, potential risks include: (1) increased probability  of TE; 
(2) an increase in susceptibili ty to infection and (3) immunogenic potential including infusion 
reactions and formation of ADA. In addition to conventional safet y assessments, general risk 
mitigation plan includes the following:
To initiate dosing at 75 mg dose that has demonstrated favorable safet y profile in health y 
subjects in clinical evaluation. This dose is expected to elicit a sub-optimal response while 
ensuring very  good safety  profile.
To utilize safety  criteria for intra-subject dose escalation and safet y criteria for dose-pane l 
escalation and stopping rules.
1.5.2 Potential Thromboembolic Effect
To continue to mitigate the potential risk of thromboembolism, the following safety  measures are 
included in ITP study :
Close monitoring of an y potential TE activities after BMS -986004 admini stration. In addition 
to observing clinical manifestations of both venous and arterial TE, the primary  safety 
biomarkers, d-Dimer and Thrombin anti -Thrombin (TAT), will be monitored to evaluate risk 
of thromboembolism. 
TE related exclusion criteria have been added to the protocol; patients with history 
thromboembolic disease (including TIA, stroke, pulmonary  embolism, deep vein thrombosis 
and thrombotic complications) or significant cardiovascular disease (including congestive 
heart failure, arrh ythmias a nd other conditions known to increase risk of TE) are excluded.
1.5.3 Potential Immunosuppressive effect
As with any novel immunomodulating agent, there is a possibility  of reducing normal immune 
function as a consequence of targeted CD40L blockade and therefore the following safet y 
measures are included in the ITP study :

BMS -986004 anti-cd40l dab
Exclusion criteria relative to positive tests for hepatitis B and C, TB and HIV have been 
included in the protocol.
Concurrent or recent use of systemic immune -modulating agents is prohibited or restricted to 
reduce potential risks associated with combinations of immune suppressors.
Patients will be very closely  followed and evaluated for any signs or symptoms of infection 
and complete blood count (CBC) differential counts, lymphocy te immunopheno typing, and
measurement of serum Ig -levels (IgG, IgA and IgM) and CRP will be monitored frequently .
1.5.4 Risk of Infusion Reactions
As with any biological product, infusion reactions are a risk, even following a single dose. To 
reduce the risk of infusion reactions, patients will be closely  monitored by trained personnel 
experienced with treatment of anaph ylaxis and lesser infusion reactions. In addition, IV 
administration of study drug will not exceed infusion rate of 12.5 mg/min (Table 4-1). 
Furthermore, patients with history  of any significant drug allergy  or serious adverse reaction or 
hypersensitivity  to an y IV administered biologic will be excluded from the study .
1.5.5 Other
Risks from the PK, PD, and clinical safet y phlebotomy  procedures are standard and include 
discomfort at the injection site, bleeding, bruising, and rarely  blood clot formation, infection, and 
fainting. Furthermore, rescue medications are permitted in the study  for severe bleeding or wet 
purpura or if the investigator thinks the patient sis at immediate risk. These medications are to 
be given with the intended purpose of raising platelet counts.

3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, open- label study to evaluate the safet y, efficacy , dose response, 
and pharmacology  (PK, target engagement and PD) of BMS -986004 in subjects with I TP. 
The study  will comprise a short -term period and a long term extension (LTE) period. 
The short -term period, is divided into three phases: Response Phase (6 weeks), Remission Phase 
(6 weeks) and Follow Up phase (8 weeks).
Screening evaluations to determine subject eligibility  will be performed 21 days prior to study 
drug administration. The screening period may exceed 21 days but not more than 42 days total, 
and only after a discussion with and approval by the Study  Director. If an extension in screening 
time is granted, the patient must still follow the platelet count rules for enrollment. The baseline 
platelet count determining enrollment eligibility  will be based on the mean of two determinations 
taken within a week ofthe first dose . To be eligible for enrollment, platelet count needs to be less 
than 30,000/ mm3and show stable or declining trend. If the mean platelet count is between 
30,000 - 35,000/ mm3the subject may be considered for enrol lment on a case by case basis after 
discussion with and approval bythe Study  Director.
Following screening, a total of 40 evaluable subjects are planned for the study . Subjects are 
considered evaluable if they receive the first 4doses of study  drug and complete the required

safet y and efficacy  evaluations at Day 50.Non-evaluable subjects will be replaced to maintain a 
count of 10 subjects in each dose panels, except subjects will not be replaced if they are 
discontinued from the study  secondary  to anadverse event unless the adverse event can be 
determined to be unrelated to treatment .
Subjects are treated in dose panels of 10 subjects each. Four (4) dose panels are planned to be 
enrolled sequentiall y in an ascending manner, with dose intensity  selected to provide increased 
levels of immunosuppression at stead y state. Dose levels (range from 75 mg to 1500 mg 
administered every  two weeks) that are planned to be evaluated in this trial are expected to elicit 
a range of clinical response. 
BMS -986004 will be administered once every  2 weeks as an IV infusion for a total of 7 doses.
Four (4) doses will be administered during the Response Phase over a 6week treatment period. 
The remaining 3doses will be administered during the Remi ssion Phase of the study  over a
6week treatment period. Subjects will receive investigational product on Day 1/Week 0, Week 
2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 1 2, for a total of 7 doses. 
Each dose cohort will enroll 10 new subjects, starting with the respective dose level at 
Day1/Week 0, regardless of the number of subjects joining a dose cohort because of intra-subject 
dose escalation. 
A new cohort may be opened to treat subjects at a dose lower than 75 mg if at least 6 subjects 
treated at the 75 mg cohort achieve platelet Response (R) (platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm3and at 
least 2-fold increase from the baseline count and absence of bleeding ), at the end of response 
phase (Week 6). The new cohort would follow the same schedule as the other cohorts including 
intra-subject dose escalation.
The long term extension (LTE) period is optional and will include eligible subjects from either 
cohort 3 or cohort 4 who complete 12 week s(85-days) of treatment and who achieve aresponse
as defined by  at least a doubling of platelets from Short Term Day  1 baseline and a platelet count 
of ≥ 35,000/mm3, and absence of bl eeding and any significant AEs as assessed on D71 or if more 
recent platelet count is available , based on the most recent platelet count or on the average of the 
two consecutive most recent platelet counts, whichever is higher .If a subject has platelet counts 
close to a doubling of platelets and/orbetween 30,000-35,000 platelets/ mm3and absence of 
bleeding and any significant AEs as assessed on D71, the subject may  be considered for the long 
term extension on a case by case basis, which will involve a review of data from the short term 
period and which will require approval by  the Study  Director.
3.1.1 Intra -subject dose escalation
Intra -subject dose escalation could occur after the subject has completed the Response Phase of 
the study. The intra-subject dose escalation decision will be based on review of the safet y 
information and platelet count after 4 weeks of treatment. The decision to escalate dose for the 
subject will be made after evaluating platelet count at Day 50, 7 days after the 4th dose of 
BMS -986004 has been administered. Subject will receive the next higher dose of BMS- 986004 if 
clinically  significant response has not been achieved based on measurement of platelet count on

the last two consecutive counts performed at Da y 43 and Day  50, and a favorable safet y profile is 
observed (see Table 3.1.1 -1). Clinically  significant response is defined asachieving platelet 
count ≥ 50,000/mm3with an increase of at least 20,000/mm3from baseline and absence of 
bleeding . Subject will then be dosed at the higher dose level for the remainder of the study 
(Remission Phase), receiving investigational product at that dose on Week 8, Week 10 and Week 
12.Active treatment period with BMS -986004, regardless of the dose, may not exceed 12 week s 
for an y individual subject.

For both the Short Term Study  and the Long Term Extension plan, in the event that platelet
count exceeds 450,000/mm3for non-splenectomized subjects and 60 0,000/mm3for subjects who 
underwent splenectom y, in the absence of recent (administered within two weeks) rescue 
medication, as indicated by the two consecutive platelet count measurements, dosing of the 
BMS -986004 should be stopped. Subject will remain in the study  and platelet counts will be then 
assessed based on the normal study  visit schedule. Dosing of BMS -986004 could bereinitiated 
only after discussion between Study  Director and Investigator if clinically  appropriate and 
dictated b y the medical judgment and subject’s safety.
3.1.3 Dose escalation for dose panel and stopping rules
Decisions regarding dose escalation will be made based on the review of all cumulative safety  
information which includes, in general, the safet y data through study  Day 15 from the 
10subjects in the preceding lower dose cohort. If neither of the below stopping rules is present in 
dose panel, then dose escalation may proceed within the next higher dose level. However, 
escalation to the next higher cohort may occur when none of the stopping rules have been met 
and no less than 5 subjects in a cohort have been followed for at least 2 weeks under certain
conditions as illustrated in section 3.1.4.
The stopping rules listed below will be used to determine whether it is safe to escalate to the next 
higher cohort. Dose escalation to the next planned dose will not proceed if any of the following 
criteria are met (Adverse event grading as defined by the Common Terminology  Criteria for

Five or more subjects in a cohort have platelet counts > 450,000/mm3for non-splenectomized 
subjects and >600,000/mm3for subjects who underwe nt splenectomy , and platelet count 
raise is not attributable to a rescue or concomitant therap y.
Two or more subjects have serious adverse events in the same organ system (Grade 3 and 
above) , that are determined to be related to study medication,
It is determined that the limit of safety  and/or tolerability  has been reached. This decision 
will be made following discussions between the Study  Team and the Investigator,
If any of the above criteria are met within a dose level, the progression to a higher dose level will 
be put on hold and all safety  data available across the study  will be evaluated to estimate the risk 
of proceeding to the higher dose level. The review will include all of the subject(s) that 
experienced SAEs listed above. In addition, data set may include subjects from a dose panel, the 
entire dose panel, or if appropriate, all randomized subjects treated to date. 
In addition, decision may be made followi ng discussions between the Study  Team and the 
Investigator to halt dose escalation for reasons not defined above, including but not limited to, 
observing a single serious adverse event in individual subjects, observing trends in a given dose 
panel and across dose panels, and/or it is determined that the limit of safet y and/or tolerabilit y 
has been reached. 
If dose escalation is stopped due to any of these findings, additional cohorts may receive the 
same or lower doses of the investigational compound.
At the time of dose escalation, dose levels of new cohorts may be adjusted to lower doses if the 
accumulated safet y data so dictates.
Adaptive dose selection may be performed to adjust some pre-selected doses, e.g., the third 
or/and fourth cohort doses, using accumulated efficacy  and dose or exposure data. Models based 
on response rate, such as but not limited to (Bay esian) logistic regression, (Bay esian) EMax, may 
be utilized to predict a dose satisfy ing certain efficacy  criteria, which might be different from the 
standard. If there are enough responding subjects with multiple platelet measurements, changes 
of platelet count may be directly  modeled by dose and study  day to facilitate dose prediction.
The selected dose for a cohort should not exceed the original ly planned dose for that cohort, i.e., 
selected dose for cohort C should not be larger than 675mg and it should be at most 1500 mg for 
cohort D.

3.1.4 Early decision of d ose escalation for dose panel
When a cohort is filled and a new subject is available to be treated, an early decision can be 
made on whether to open the next higher cohort if not all the subjects have completed the 
evaluation period. The early  decision rule is based on controlling the probability  of making a 
wrong early  decision, called decision risk, to be at most 15%. Detailed information on deriving  
the decision risk is included in Appendix 1.
The early decision rule is based on the largest number of subjects who developed AE of interest 
which is drug -related SAE within the same organ sy stem at grade 3 or higher. The early  decision 
does not directl y take into consideration other criteria as covered by the stopping rule. As such, 
its decision can be modified upon agreement from both investigators and sponsor. In case 
subjects are allocated to the higher cohort and at least one stopping rule as stated above is 
triggered toward the lower dose cohort when more events are observed at the lower cohort, 
decision will be made upon agreement from both investigators and sponsor after considering all 
safet y data. 
Three count numbers are used by the decision rule and are defined as follows.
Titration -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nH): the number of subjects who are titrated and 
complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) starting from the first titration dose (on day  43).
Start -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nL): the number of subjects who develop drug related SAE at 
grade 3 or higher or complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) from the first dose (on day 1) 
but haven’t complete d the 2 weeks evaluation period following the first titration dose (on day  
43) if being titrated to a higher dose.
Subjects with AE of Interest (k): the largest number of subjects who developed drug-related 
SAE within the same organ system at grade 3 or higher, which could happen any time after 
the first dose of BMS -986004 till the decision making day. The value of k is allowed to be 
either 0 or 1. Note that it doesn’t distinguish at which stage of treatment, prior to or post 
titration, that such AE happened.
Minimum Requirement for Cohort Escalation
A set of minimum safety requirement, as listed below, must be met in order to make an early 
decision.

There must be at least 5 (nL+nH>=5) safet y evaluable subjects (with safet y data through 
study  Day  15)
A higher dose than the new cohort ’s start dose must be shown tolerated in the IM140-002 
study .
Early Decision Rule:
If there is not AE of interest observed, the early  decision rule is the same the minimum 
requirements.
If there is one AE of interest observed, the early decision rule is shown below in Table 3.1.4-1, 
where W represent wait, i.e., not enough evidence to enable dose panel escalation, and E 
represents escalate.
If there are least two subjects with AE of interest, stopping rule is triggered, and subject cannot 
be treated at the next higher cohort.

analysis. Approximately  910 mL of blood will be drawn from each subject during theshort -term 
period (~162days including Screening and follow up period) .Less than 500mL  of blood will be 
drawn during the LTE period.
The approximate duration of the short -term period is 23weeks (approximately  162Days).  This 
includes a 21 day screening period, a 12 week treatment period and a 2month follow up period.
An extended screening period (up to 42 day s) is possible but only  with the approval of the Study 
Director, and all other eligibility  rules and screening rules must still be met. If subject is eligible 
and opts to continue into LTE, the 2 month follow -up period will not be performed after the 
short -term period is completed and the subject will enter the LTE directl y. If the subject opts not 
to enter theLTE, then a 2 month follow -up visit will be completed. 
The approximate duration of the long term extension isapproximately 55weeks. This includes 
24 weeks of every  other week dosing of 1500 mg, two-t aper visits (7 weeks total) , and a 24 week 
follow -up period (no treatment) .
3.1.5 Long Term Extension
The long term extension (LTE) period is optio nal and will include eligible subjects who have 
completed Day 85 (12-week sof treatment) and who have consent edto participate. Eligible 
subjects [platelet count ≥ 35,000/mm3with at least a doubling of platelets from short -term 
baseline ,or patients approved by the Study  Director on a case by case basis who are close to a 
two-fold increase from short term baseline and/orhave 30,000- 35,000 /mm3platelets and 
absence of bleeding and any significant AEs as assessed on D71 or if more recent platelet coun t 
is available , based on the most recent platelet count or on the average of the two consecutive 
most recent platelet counts, whichever is higher ], will receive a 1500 mg dose every  other week 
for 24 weeks . Subjects who complete 24 weeks LTE will receive a taper regimen consisting of 
1500mg dose on Day 190 and a final dose on Day 218 before entering the 24 week follow -up 
period (no treatment). 
A separate informed consent must be signed b y the patients to enter the LTE period .
3.2 Post Study  Access to Therapy
At the end of the 12 week treatment study  period, all eligible subjects in Cohort 3 and 4 will have 
the option to continue into the LTE period. The investigator should ensure that the subject 
receives appropriate standard of care to treat the c ondition under study .
3.3 Study Population
For entry  into the short -term period of the study, the following criteria MUST be met prior to 
dosing on Day  1 of the Short Term Period . No exceptions will be granted. 
For entry  into the long term extension, subjects must remai n on study  medication, complete the 
short -term period (up to 12 weeks of treatment), qualify  per guidance for an increase in platelet 
count and safety , and sign a new informed consent.

a woman over age 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, 
Females under the age of 55 years must have a document ed serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause .
Females treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely  to have artificiall y 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiolo gic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used: The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH levelis >40 mlU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can considered postmenopausal
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products, (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may  require washout periods as long as 6 months.

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects follow ing any Treatment with Study Drug
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigat ional product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for an y of the following reasons:
Subject’s request to stop study  treatment and/or participation in the study
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study  is not in the 
best interest of the subject
Termination of the study  by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of abilit y to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psy chiatric or ph ysical (eg, infectious disease) illness
Unblinding a subject for any  reason (emergency  or non -emergency )
An opportunistic or sy stem ic fungal, viral or bacterial infection of a serious n ature, that in the 
opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, contraindicates further dosing of 
investigational product after resolution .
Malignancy , except basal cell carcinoma.
Severe h ypersensitivity  reaction (anaph ylaxis) to the study  drug, Grade 3 or higher
In the case of pregnancy ,the investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study  drug will be permanently  discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. If the investigator determines a possib le favorable benefit/risk ratio that

warrants continuation of study  drug, a discussion between the investigator and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee must occur.
All subjects who discontinue investigational product should compl y with protocol specified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only exception to this requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treatment study  follow -up or 
loses the ability  to consent freel y (ie,is imprisoned or involuntari ly incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a ps ychiatric or phy sical illness ).
Subjects refusing to return to the site or to continue participation in the study  should be 
documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow -up.” Investigators should 
document attempts to re-establish contact with missing subjects throughout the study  period. If 
contact with a missing subject is re-established, the subject should not be considered 
lost-to-follow -up and an y evaluations should resume according to the protocol .
If study  drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Study  Drug Follow  up
In this study , increase in platelet count is a key endpoint of the study . Post treatment study 
follow -up is of critical importance and is essential to preserving subject safet y and the integrit y 
of the study . Subjects who discontinue study  treatm ent must continue to be followed for 
collection of outcome and/or survival follow -up data as required and in line with Section 5until 
death or the conclusion of the study .
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study  drug will remain inthe study  and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically  withdraws consent for any  further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this informati on. Subjects should notify  the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the i nvestigator, as 
to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study  
procedures and/or post treatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In 
the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  
available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the subjec t as noted above. Lost to 
follow -up is defined by the inability  to reach the subject after a minimum of three documented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subjec t to one registered mail letter.

All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third- party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study  
has been included in the subjec t’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a Sponsor -
retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contac t information 
or other public vital status data necessary  to complete the follow -up portion of the study .The site 
staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health registries 
and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If after all attempts, the subject 
remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive date as determined by  the investigator should

Clinical Protocol IM140103
BMS -986004 anti-cd40l dab
The study  drug should be dispensed by the pharmacist or qualified designee and administered as 
an infusion using an infusion pump. Do not ever administer study  drug by intravenous push 
(IVP) or bolus injection. A physician must be present at the infusion site during all 
administrations of study  drug.
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory  rate, and temperature) will be monitored 
before infusion (at any time the day  of dosing, prior to infusion), approx imately every  15 minutes 
during infusion, at the end of the infusion (within 10 minutes after the infusion has stopped), and 
approximately  every 30 minutes after completion of the infusion until stable, as judged by the 
investigator. If an anaphy lactoid -like infusion reaction or anaphy lactic reaction occurs, vital 
signs will be taken more frequentl y, as warranted by the severit y of the reaction. Blood pressure 
and heart rate will also be taken prior to discharge from the site on visits in which study  drug is 
administered.
Subjects should not be premedicated unless they have had a prior infusion reaction, since the 
primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the expected frequency  of safet y events and 
tolerability  of the study  drug. However, after a reaction determ ined to be an infusion reaction has 
been documented, the investigator may elect to administer prophylactically  an anti-histamine or 
Tylenol for the comfort and safet y of the subjec t prior to subsequent infusions.

4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study , including products alread y with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently  than the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this protocol, investig ational product is: BMS -986004 Injection. BMS -986004 is a clear to 
slightly  opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution; may contain particulate matter upon visual 
inspection. The drug product is a preservative free, ready  to use solution contained in a 10 cc vial 
with 20 mm opening, Type I flint glass, 1- panel, open label. 
Each vial of drug product contains the labeled amount of BMS -986004, 190 mg/vial (50 mg/mL) 
in 10 mM Sodium Phosphate, pH 6.5, 25 mM Arginine HCl, 250 mM Sucrose. A 13% overfill is 
included in each vial to account for vial, needle syringe (VNS) holdup. This drug product can be 
used for intravenous administration only
4.2 Non- investigational Product
Not Applicable . 
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity ) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study  drug arise, the study drug should not be 
dispensed and contact BMS imm ediately .
Study  drug not supplied by  BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained 
that includes all processes required to ensure drug is accuratel y administered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes ( eg,required diluents, administration sets).
Preparation for Intravenous Use
Dilution of BMS -986004 Injection for IV use must be performed using sterile disposable 
syringes. Prior to IV administration, BMS -986004 Injection is diluted with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection (NS) to prepare dosing solutions with BMS -986004 concentrations ranging 
from 1.5 to 15mg/mL . The product is to be infused over 2 hours for each panel, using a 
volumetric pump at the protocol specific dose(s) and rate(s) through the IV infusi on set as 
indicated in Table 4-1. Care must be taken to ensure the sterility  of the prepared solution, as the 
drug product does not contain anti- microbial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents.

Clinical Protocol IM140103
BMS -986004 anti-cd40l dab
BMS -986004 Injection should be stored refrigerated at 2° -8°C (36° -46°) with protection from 
light. After withdrawal into an appropriate sized syringe and dilution with NS (in the 
concentration range of 1.5 to 15mg/mL ), the product must be administered intravenously  within 
two hours. The diluted BMS- 986004 solutions  may be stored in PVC, IV bags for up to 24 hours 
at refrigerated and protected from light, (2° -8°C) or up to 4 hours (which includes the infusion 
time of two hours) at room temperature (15° -25°C) and ambient lighting conditions. Regardless 
of the stora ge condition, the BMS -986004 infusion must be completed within 24 hours after 
transfer of the reconstituted BMS -986004 solution to an infusion container and dilution in 
normal saline. 
Recommended safet y measures for preparation and handling include protec tive clothing, gloves, 
and safety  cabinets. Partially  used or empty  vials of BMS -986004 Injection should be discarded 
as per the site procedures
4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
During the Screening visit, the investigative site will call into the enrollment option of the 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) designated by BMS for assignment of a 5-digit 
subject number that will be unique across all sites. Enrolled subjects, including those not dosed, 
will be assigned sequential subject numbers starting with 00001, eg, 00001, 00002, 00003.... 
00010. The patient identification number (PID) will ultimately  be comprised of the site number 
and subject number. For example, the first subject screened (ie,enrolled) at site number 1, will 
have a PID of 0001 00001. 
Enrolled subjects meeting all eligibility  criteria will be assigned to a dose cohort. Specific
instructions regarding enrollment and dose cohort assignment will be provided to the
investigational sites in their training materials .
Specific instructions for using IVRS will be provided to the investigational sites in a separate
document.
Subjects will not be replaced if they are discontinued from the study  secondary  to anadverse 
event unless the adverse event can be determined to be unrelated to treatment. The replacement 
subject will receive the same treatment as the subject being replaced.
4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Dose escalation and modifications will be guided by  the approach described in Section 3.1.
4.6 Blinding/Unblind ing
Not applicable.
4.7 Treatment Compliance
Investigational product is administered by study site personnel, who will monitor compliance.
After administration of BMS -986004, an examination of the injection site is required .

In the event of multiple procedures are required at a single timepoint, the following is a list of 
procedures from highest priority  to low:
1) Pharmacokinetic Sampling
2) Safet y (ECG)
3) Safet y (clinical labs)
5.1.1 Retesting During Screening or Lead- in Period
Retesting of laboratory  parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening or 
Lead -in period will be permitted (in addition to any parameters that require a confirmatory 
value).
Any new result will override the previous result (i.e., the most current result prior to 
Randomization) and is the value by which study inclusion will be assessed, as it represents the 
subject’s most current, clinical state.
5.2 Study Materials
The site will provide all required materials for the tests performed locally  (ie, relevant clinical 
laboratory  tests and urine drug screens). The site will have available a well- calibrated scale for 
recor ding body  weight, a 12-lead ECG machine, and a calibrated sphy gmomanometer and 
thermometer for vital signs assessments. A current and fully stocked advanced cardiac life 
support (ACL S) cart will be immediately  available on the premises. The site will have a 
refrigerated centrifuge, a monitored and alarmed refrigerator, and freezer (-20°C or below), as 
well as containers and dry ice for shipment and storage of blood samples. The site will provide 
all materials required for accurate source documentation of study activities and for housing the 
subjects during the study. BMS will provide a BMS approved protocol and any amendments or 
administrative letters (if required), The Bleeding Assessment Tool (ITP-BAT), BMS -986004
Investigator Brochure , Pregnancy  surveilla nce forms, NCI CTCAE version 4.0and a Pharmacy 
Manual. Case report forms (electronic or hard copy ) will be provided by BMS. The Central 
Laboratory  will provide a lab manual, labels and tubes for the collection and handling of blood 
(including PKs, biomark er and immunogenicit y) specimens .
5.3 Safety  Assessments
Safety  assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of 
vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory  tests and clinical 
tolerability  of the drug. 
The safet y of BMS -986004 will be assessed primarily  by summarizing treatment emergent 
AEs/SAEs and by  evaluating laboratory  and biomarker safety  assessment, including hematology , 
clinical chemistry  and coagulation.

collection and processing will be provided to the site in the procedure manual.
5.6.1 Primary Safety (TE) Biomarker Assessments
Previous molecules in clinical development targeting CD40L have demonstrated the potential to 
induce thromboembolism (TE). All data from nonclinical, NHP and single ascending dose 
clinical study  of BMS -986004 are consistent with the conclusion that BMS -986004 does not
possess platelet activating orother activity  associated with the induction of TE. To further 
mitigate the risk of TE in subjects dosed with BMS -986004, a set of primary , accepted markers 
of platelet activation and TE potential will be monitored at frequent intervals and analy zed in 
real-time. Plasma and serum will be collected to monitor the risk and minimize impact of a 
potential TE event. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated Partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will 
be assessed at screening as measures of a hypercoagulable state. D-dimer and thrombin anti-
thrombin (TAT) in plasma will be quantified as measures of TE risk. Serum troponin I will be 
monitored as an indicator of potentially  TE-related subclinical myocardial infarction. Data from 
these primary  safety biomarker measurements will be collected and carefully  evaluated in the 
context of a thorough review of all available clinical data and used to formulate go/no -go 
decisions prior to dose escalation.

Where individual subjects have provided separate consent for Medical Research collection, 
residual samples of serum, plasma, RNA and PBMCs will be retained by the BMS Biobank for 
medical research purposes. No additional sampling is required for residual collections. Medical
research collections and retention should be presented to all subjects, except where prohibited by  
local laws or regulations. However, enrol lment into the main study  is not contingent upon 
consent to participate in future medical research sample banking. 
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study  drug and that 
does notnecessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The ca usal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relati onship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see 
NOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity

Clinical Protocol IM140103
BMS -986004 anti-cd40l dab
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasi as or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by regulatory  definition, these events must be handled asSAE s. (See 
Section 6.1.1 for rep orting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations arenot considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , caregiver respite, family  circumstances, administrative reason ).
Admission for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology  proto cols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting.
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 3 months of discontinuation of dosing. If applicable, SAEs must be collected 
that 
relate to an y later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ).

The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure.
An SAE report should be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not relate d to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred method for SAE data 
reporting colle ction is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy  surveillance forms are only  
intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.  In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission t o:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number :Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper form s should be used and submitted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting) : Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drugor if new inform ation 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using th e same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non serious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Non serious 
AEinformation should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug andfor those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic).

6.3 Laboratory  Test Result A bnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject toreceive specific corrective 
therap y.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently  discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study  exposure, including during at 
least 5 half lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form to BMS Designee within 24 hours and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures 
described in Section 6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently  discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, 
dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study  drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study  drug after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the subject.
Protocol -required procedures for study  discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.

6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional admini stration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically  important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
2.Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND 
3.No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
The key responsibilities for investigators during p-DILI assessment include: (i) Early  detection, 
medical evaluation (including the exclusion of other potential causes) and rapid laboratory  
confirmation of liver-related abnormalities, and (ii) Sponsor notification of p- DILI cases via 
SAE forms. Following the gathering and assessment of relevant clinical information the sponsor 
is responsible for: (iii) Timely  evaluation and triaging of p-DILI cases, (iv) Expedited reporting 
of p-DILI cases and (v) Expanded review of p-DILI cases including a detailed assessment of all 
available clinical information, investigations and biochemical data.
Investigators are expected to monitor ongoing routine and ad hoc hepatic laboratory  test results 
to rapidly  determine whether a subject meets p-DILI criteria. They  are expected to promptl y 
notify  BMS of all p-DILI cases. p-DILI cases may be identified by abnormal liver biochemistry 
values, whether or not they are accompanied by liver-related signs and/or symptoms. In both 
cases, expedited confirmation with repeat laboratory  testing should occur within 3 business days 
using a Hepatic Laboratory  Panel (ALT, AST, TB, AP). Any subject with an abnormal Hepatic 
Laboratory  Panel that meets p-DILI criteria is a candidate for study  drug discontinua tion. Any 
confirmed p-DILI events must be reported (along with a description of the clinical findings) to 
BMS as an SAE within 24hrs of confirmation. 
An extensive clinical history , examination and appropriate investigations should be obtained to 
exclude c holestatic and other apparent causes that may explain the observed abnormalities in 
liver function and/or hepatic signs and symptoms. Other apparent causes include,

non-exhaustively  and by way of example only: infectious diseases (such as active hepatitis -A, 
-B and -C), congenital diseases (such as Gilbert’s syndrome), neoplastic diseases (such as 
hepatocellular carcinoma), automimmune diseases (such as primary  biliary  cirrhosis) and the use 
of concomitant hepatotoxic medications (such as antibiotics, the oral contraceptive pill and 
herbal medicines). All investigations to exclude potential causes of liver function abnormalities 
or hepatic signs and/or symptoms should be guided by relevant factors such as the subject’s age, 
gender, clinical history , and signs and symptoms. If necessary , after discussion with Sponsor’s 
safet y team, Investigator may perform additional diagnostic tests/procedures to further diagnose 
pDILI (e.g. ultrasound, MRI /MRS, liver biopsy ).
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required 
by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingl y. 
7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE A ND OTHER EXTE RNA L 
COMMITTEES
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will perform safet y and efficacy  assessments at regularl y 
scheduled times as well as on an ad hoc basis if needed. The DMC will review relevant safet y 
data from preceding Cohorts before the study  progresses to the next Cohort. In addition, formal 
DMC monitoring meetings will occur when a maximum of 20 subjects have had at least 6 weeks 
of exposure during the Response Period or 6 months after the first subject is randomized to the 
study  (whichever comes first).
Thereafter, DMC monitoring will be performed at approximately  4 month intervals or after each 
additional 10 subjects have had at least 11 weeks of exposure (whichever comes first) until all 
subjects are enrolled into the study . At that time, the DMC will meet every 6 months. With the 
agreement of DMC and BMS this schedule may be modified depending on the rate of subject 
accrual.
The DMC will review safety  data including serious adverse events and events of special interest, 
focusing on early  signal detection. The DMC will also evaluate the rates of clinical response 
compared to the background rates expected in this study  population based on a review of the 
relevant literature. Further details on the content and methods of data reports to the DMC will be 
outlined in the charter of that committee along with the processes and procedures the committee 
will follow .These reviews will be conducted by an internal data monitoring committee made up 
of representatives of the sponsor who are not involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study .

Term Definition
Complete Abstinence If one form of contraception is required, Complete 
Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all 
study  drugs. Female subjects must continue to have 
pregnancy  tests.  Acceptable alternate methods of highl y 
effective contraception must be discussed in the event that 
the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
If two forms of contraception is required, Complete 
abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all 
study  drugs. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highl y effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.
Expanded definition Complete abstinence as defined as 
complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs. This 
also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifesty le 
of the patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, profession of abstinence 
for entry  into a clinical trial, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highl y effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.
Medical Research Those scientific activities which cannot be reasonably  
anticipated at the time of trial design, for which we would 
like to collect and/or retain samples from study participants.  
Examples of Medical Research include, but are not limited 
to, new assay  development and validation, companion 
diagnostic development, new h ypotheses in the interaction of 
drug and the human bod y, and exploration of emerging 
science in the understanding of disease.

APPENDIX 1 ADAP TIVE EA RLY DECIS ON FOR DOSE PA NEL ES CALATION
Introduction
A model -based cohort escalation rule is established to help decide on opening the next cohort for 
newly  enrolled subjects when current cohort is filled but not all of its subjects are monitored for 
2whole weeks regarding drug toxicity  and tolerability . The decision rule would allow treating 
subject, once available, at the next cohort without waiting for the completion of every  subject’s 
AE evaluation period at the current cohort and at the same time keeping decision risk acceptably 
low.
Please note that AE would be closely  monitored throughout the trial for each subject, and the 2 
weeks’ AE evaluation period mentioned here is for the purpose of cohort escalation only . During 
the evaluation period, the numbers of subjects who developed drug-related SAE within the same 
organ system at grade 3 or higher, called AE of interest are counted and the largest number will 
be used.
Decision R isk
The decision risk is mathematically  defined as the probability  of observing enough number of 
event(s) in the still non -evaluable subjects given data collected from evaluable subjects such that 
cohort escalation is not allowed. Evaluable subjects are th ose who are observed an AE of interest 
or complete the AE evaluation period. To enroll subject into the next cohort, the non-adaptive 
cohort escalation rule requires, among others, no more than one subject being reported drug-
related serious adverse event or serious infection and infestation within the evaluation period. 
Therefore, if one subject is observed with an AE of interest, the decision risk would be the 
probability  of observing at least one more AE of interest in the non-evaluable subjects; if no AE 
of interest is reported, the decision risk is thus the probability  of observing at least two AEs of 
interest from the non -evaluable subjects.
Decision Data
To take advantage of the titration design, in which subjects could possibly  take a higher dose that 
is to be used initially  in the next cohort, the adaptive decision rule makes use of the following 
three statistics: 
Titration -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nH): the number of subjects who are titrated and 
complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) starting fro m the titration’s first dose (on day  43).
Start -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nL): the number of subjects who develop drug related SAE at 
grade 3 or higher or complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) from the first dose (on day 1) 
but haven’t completed the 2 weeks evaluation period following the first titration dose (on day  
43) if being titrated to a higher dose .
Count of AE of Interest (k): number of subjects with AE of interests, which could happen 
any time after the first dose of BMS- 986004 till the decision making day. Apparentl y, k=0 or 
1. Please note that it doesn’t distinguish at which stage, prior to or post titration, that such AE 
happened.
With sample size of 10 for each cohort, the number if non -evaluable subjects is 10 -nH- nL.

Decision Risk Estimation
Calculation of decision risk is based on the method of Bayesian constrained rate estimate with 
ascending beta prior. It assumes that the rate of AE of interest increases with doses, however, no 
specific mathematical form is given governing the relationship between dose and rate. In this 
way, robustness is achieved by avoiding possible model misspecification. It also assumes that 
rate depends on the maximum dose subject takes, i.e., titrated subjects are equally  likely in 
developing AE of interest as subject s who take the titrated dose right in the beginning. The prior 
information is solicited from a phase III study  of Abatacept IM101174, in which 12 out 721 
subjects (1.7%) were reported to experience drug related SAEs within short term period (half 
year treatment). The prior used is Beta(0.01, 0.49) , which indicates 2% rate and is equivalent of 
contributing 0.5 subject at each dose.
Decision risk for k=1 is listed below (values are provided only for when the number evaluable 
subjects, nH+nL, is at least 5, and at most 9). Bayesian MCMC simulation is performed to 
compute the posterior predictive probabilit y under R version 3.1.0 with a random seed of 
20140625.

Decision Rule
Decision rule is derived by comparing decision risk to a pre-selected threshold value when the 
current cohort is filled and a newl y enrolled subject is available to be allocated to the next cohort. 
If decision risk is less than the threshold value, the subject will be treated at the next cohort 
(denoted as Ein the following table), otherwise, the subject need to wait for more evidence 
coming up (denoted as W). 
An example of dec ision rule for k=1 is shown below with decision risk being 15%.

APPENDIX 2 ADAP TIVE DOSE SELECT ION
Introduction
Bayesian logistic regression model is used to predict an adaptive dose fora given response rate. 
Simulations of both logistic regression and Bayesian logistic regression are provided to show 
their performance in predicting dose for pre-selected response rate. New method of analyzing 
data obtained from the study  with titration design is also included. More detailed discussion will 
be available in the stu dy’s statistical analy sis plan (SAP).  
Adaptive dose selection is not limited to the Baye sian logistic regression model described in this 
appendix. Alternative modeling includes, for example, nonlinear or linear mixed effect 
regression of longitudinal platelet count. Specifically , when PK exposure data are available, 
model based on PK exposure may  be a better choice than that on dose only since there are only  a 
few distinct values of doses. 
Adaptive dose selection can be performed as early  as when the third cohort is about to enroll 
subjects. However, it is advised that the predicted dose would be more reliable when more data 
are available, e.g., when the fourth cohort is about to enroll. For safety  reasons, the selected dose 
to be administered at a higher cohort cannot be larger than what is planned for that cohort.
Bayesian Logistic Model Description
The model is described below:
where , at each dose level i, diis dose in mg, piis the expected response rate, niis the number of 
subjects treated atdose di, and yiis the number of responders. Model parameters βare assumed a 
normal distribution with mean μ and variance ψ. Explaining variable, dose, is in log scale, and is 
subtrac ted by an offset of log(75), where 75 is the minimum dose administered at cohort 1. By 
subtracting such an offset value, intercept parameter μ alone can be interpreted as the log odd 
value of the expected response rate for cohort 1, and as such it is easy to set prior distribution 
parameters (shown below).
Prior of the model parameters is set under the following guidelines:
Model -predicted response rate at each dose level matches the expected rate.
A 97.5% quantile of the response rate at the lowest dose is around 0.4.
A 2.5% quantile of the response rate at the highest dose is around 0.35.
Extremely  small probability  for β2being negative 

It is assumed that the response rate at dose of 75mg, 225mg, 675mg, and 1500mg to be 0.2, 0.4, 
0.55 and 0.7 respectivel y. A linear regression using the above data will give prior mean μ to be ( 
-1.33, 0.72) with rounding error. The second and third bullets of the guidelines would make the 
stand deviation of β1to be 0.45, and β2to be 0.2. Prior distributions of β1and β2are assumed to 
be independent. A 95% credible interval of response rates under prior and without observation 
data is shown in Figure 1, where the top curve is the upper 97.5% quantile, the center is the 
mean, and the bottom is the lower 2.5% quantile. The circles represent the expected response 
rates at the selected doses. I t can be seen that the chosen prior would lead to a mean response rate 
estimate being very close to the expected or assumed, and at the same time the wide region of 
95% credible interval indicates that the prior’s weak impact on the posterior estimation of 
response rate when data are observed.

Special consideration for titration
Non-responders at each cohort other than themaximum 1500mg cohort would be administered 
higher dose with the hope of becoming responders. Therefore, two response status data may be 
observed for those non-responders. Due to relative small sample size of each cohort, making use 
of status data after the titration dose is believed to increase the accuracy  of model- based 
prediction under some reasonable assumptions. Listed in the below are two assumptions used in 
the adaptive dose selection:
If a subject responses to a dose, the subject would respond to higher dose with probability  1.200 400 600 800 1000 1200 14000.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

If a subject does not respond to a dose after 3 administrations, additional dosing at the same 
dose would not make a subject change from non -responder to responder.
Based on the above assumptions, a new approach is proposed to combine the subjects at two 
adjacent cohorts to estimate the response rate at the higher dose which is shared by the two 
cohorts.
Simulation
Trial simulation is done to show the performance of logistic regression and Bayesian logistic 
regression with starting dose data only or with titration data included. The Settings of simulation 
parameters are listed below for convenience:
Doses: 75, 225, 675, 1500
Rate: 0.2, 0.4, 0.55, 0.7
Conditional response rate for non -responder after titration:0.25, 0.25, 0.33
Response rate used to predict dose: 0.7 (equivalently  the fourth cohort)
Number of simulated trials: 1000
Prediction results from four different methods are compared with each other.
SLogit: L ogistic regression with response status from starting dose only
SBayLogit: Bay esian logistic regression with response status from starting dose only
DLogit: Logistic regression with response status from both starting dose and titration dose
DBayLogit: Bayesian logistic regression with response status from both starting dose and 
titration dose
Simulation results are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that Bayesian modeling provides less 
variant and seemingl y closer -to-true-value predictions compared to the usual logistic regression. 
In addition, variation of the predicted dose is smaller by including titration data when same 
modeling is used.

APPENDIX 3 INTERPRETA TION OF HE PATITIS B SEROLOGICA L TEST
RESULTS
As our study  drug is expected to demonstrate immunosuppressive effects, we find it necessary  to 
carefully  evaluate and exclude subjects with potentially  active Hepatitis B infection. For this 
reason, in order to fully  evaluate subject’s eligibility  for enrollment, Exclusion Criterion 3f  
requires interpretation of data from three standard test sfor hepatitis B i.e. measurement of 
hepatit is B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibod y (anti -HBs) and Hepatitis B 
core antibod y (anti -HBc).
Subject’s eligibility  for enrollment should be assessed as described below: 
Subjects that are negative for all three markers are allowed into the study
Subjects that are HBsAg (neg), anti- HBc (neg) and anti -HBs (pos) are allowed into the 
study  (immunized subjects)
Subjects that are HBsAg (neg), anti- HBc (pos) and anti -HBs (pos) are allowed into the 
study  (Hep B immune most likely  due to natural exposure) 
Subjects that are HBsAg (pos) are excluded from the study
Subjects that are HBsAg (neg), anti- HBc (pos) and anti -HBs (neg) may  be included after 
additional discussion with Medical Monitor in order to evaluate subject’s full clinical 
status and medical history .

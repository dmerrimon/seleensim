The Effect of Pneumatic Tourniquet Use on Upper Extremity Edema Following Axillary Lymph Node Dissection  
Protocol Version #  8 3 September 15 , 2020 1.0  SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of tourniquet use and subsequent 
resolution of swelling in patients with prior  axillary lymph node dissection. We 
hypothesize that a tourniquet placed for a short period of time at low pressure will cause  
edema without complication in both arms ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of 
axillary lymph node dissection in p atients status post prior axillary lymph node dissection 
for cancer.  
 
2.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
The safety of elective hand surgery in breast cancer patients following ipsilateral axillary 
lymph node dissection (ALND) is controversial due to concerns of developing upper 
extremity lymphedema. Prior authors have discussed concern for invasive and non -
invasive manipulation of the extremity, including blood pressure measurements , 
injections,  and intravenous access1-2, although the evidence for these factors in the onset 
or progression of lymphedema is limited. How ever, this is controversial in the oncology 
literature despite bei ng w idely accepted in the hand surgery literature3-5. Patients are 
commonly dissuaded from routine elective hand surgery for coexistent  pathology6. Prior 
studies have demonstrated no to minimal risk of developing lymphedema acutely or late 
following hand surge ry after prior ALND6-9. Furthermore, no evidence is available to 
demonstrate a relationship between tourniquet use and lymphedema6-9, and existing 
literature supports the use of an upper arm tourniquet in patients with prior breast cancer 
treatment of ALND . The acute effect of swelling in the setting of a tourniquet and the 
time required f or swelling reduction for this population , however,  remains unknown.  
 
A pilot study has been completed to evaluate tourniquet use in healthy volunteers and the 
chosen pressure of 40 mmHg was identified as leading to repeatable swelling without 
acute or chronic abnormalities. Higher pressures (250, 120, 100 and  80 mmHg) lead to a 
similar 30 -40 mL increase in volume in a healthy volunteer, although transient nerve 
palsy, pain and petechiae were identified at the higher p ressure. No complications were 
identified in 8 healthy volunteers at 40 mmHg ov er 25 minutes. The increase in hand 
volume was less than 30 mL at 30 mmHg or less.  Therefore, 40 mmHg most reliably 
recreates temporary edema formation, while limiting unnecessary or prolonged tourniquet 
use. Pilot  study  results  further found that both the on head and brace limb postures 
markedly and significantly decreased swelling greater than the sling posture (p < .001 ). 
 
The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the acute impact of swelling caused by 
low-pressure to urniquet use in the setting of ipsilateral ALND  and th e change in swelling 
reduction following tourniquet use in two limb postures, comparing the arms ipsilateral 
and contralateral to the side of ALND . We hypothesized that tourniquets may be safely 
applied to patients  with prior ALND  in either their ipsilateral or contralateral arm.  We 
further hypothesized that patients who have had prior ipsilatera l ALND would have an 
equivalent proportion of upper extremity edema and see improved resolution with 
increased elevation . Understanding the effect of tourniquet use and its safe practice will 
aid in the surgical management of pati ents with prior axillary l ymph node dissection.

Protocol Version #  8 4 September 15 , 2020 3.0  STUDY ENROLLMENT AND PARTICIPANT ELIGIBLITY  
All patients over the age of 18 who have previously  undergone axillary lymph node 
dissection will be invited to participate in the study. Participants will be identified via 
chart revi ew of patients with prior ALND.  
 
3.1 Study Enrollment  
Recruitment will occur via telephone or in -person encounters based on retrospective 
review for patients meeting the above inclusion criteria. Advertising for this study is not 
planned. Participants will be screened based on the above criteria and the exclu sion 
criteria in part 3.2 below. Participants who fail inclusion on screening will be excluded.  
 
The study coordinator or the above study members will consent the patient prior to 
involvement. In a closed and quiet room, the potential research subject will be able to a sk 
any questions regarding the study and its procedures. No recruitment materials will be 
provided at the time of consent. Participants may withdraw consent at any time.  
 
3.2 Participant  Criteria  
All patients over the age of 18 wh o have previously  undergone axillary lymph node 
dissection will be invited to participate in the study. Patients will serve as their own 
internal control , using both arms which are ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of 
ALND . Patients will be exclude d who have new -onset  lymphedema of the involved limb, 
infection including cellulitis, or trauma or planned axillary surgery within 6 months of 
participation .  
 
3.3   Enrollment  
Given the variability in our pilot study, we determined by power analysis that we would 
need to recruit 45 participants (for a total of 90 arms) for the current study for evaluation 
of relative edema and its reduction following tourniquet use.  We expect the study to 
begin upon approval, 4/2017 and conclude after recruitment in approximately 6 -12 
months.  
 
4.0  MATERIAL AND METHODS  
Study participants will be seated and patients’ arms  ipsilateral to prior axillary lymph 
node dissection will be el evated with the hand  above the level of the ipsilateral shoulder 
for 15 minutes. This is to ensure an accurate baseline in all participants. Hand volume 
will be measured by aqueous volumete r to the level of the proximal wrist crease for a 
baseline. A tourn iquet wil l then be placed on each study participant’s upper arm, again 
ipsilateral to prior axi llary lymph node dissection . This will be inflated to 40 mmHg for 
25 minutes, after which hand vo lume will be again measured as described above. The 
limb will th en be placed  in an elevated position at  shoulder height  or in a sling at the 
waist, and hand edema will again be measured . The pro cess will be repeated for each 
limb position  after a 15-minute  break time . The two limb positions are “sling,” with the 
hand at the level of the waist, and “elevated” with the hand at the level of the shoulder . 
This will be repeated for the contralateral, healthy arm which will serve as an internal 
control.

Protocol Version #  8 5 September 15 , 2020 5.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION S 
 
We will evaluate the data per recommendations of our statistician by categorical and 
continuous statistical testing, as applicable.  For the primary outcome s of percentage 
change  in hand volume  from baseline  after tourniquet application , and secondary 
outcome of residual volume as a percentage of baseline  following limb positioning , we 
will compare the healthy  contralateral arm versus the arm  status  post ALND.  Paired  t-
tests will be used to compare measures  averaged to produce a single pre -tourniquet hand 
volume and a single post -tourniquet hand volume. The difference s will again be 
compared  between patients’ arms i psilateral and contralateral to the side of ALND . 
Linear mixed effects model will also be fitted  to account for the correlations between 
measurements on the same subject  and history of ALND, arm position after tourniquet 
use, and patient -specific risk factors.  This specific issue power analysis is further 
discussed below (5.3).  
 
5.1 Outcome Measurements  
Study participants will be evaluated prior to and following the above process.  
Data collection:  
A. Demographic will be recorded: Age, sex, height, w eight, BMI, comorbidities, number 
of lymph nodes excised in ALND, and presence of lymphedema  
B. Procedural measures: hand volume and percent change  
Primary outcome : percentage change  in hand volume  from baseline  after 
tourniquet application  
Secondary outcome:  residual volume as a percentage of baseline  following limb 
positioning  after tourniquet use  
C. Tourniquet complications: unresolved edema  (i.e. persistent swelling lasting greater 
than the 30 minute  evaluation period) , petechiae  (i.e. pinpoint skin redness or purple 
color caused by a minor bleed from broken capillary blood vessels ), pain, paresthesias  
(tingling sensation) , palsy  (neurologic change related to peripheral nerve compression), 
by direct visualation and neurologic evaluation by a medical provider at the time of 
tourniquet use  
 
Acute or delayed symp toms related to tourniquet use will be assessed and managed with 
routine care. Participants may contact the study staff at any time regarding delayed 
complication.  
 
5.2 Analysis plan  
Data will be analyzed as above.  To reiterate the methods (Section 4.0), a  baseline volume 
will be measured in all participants prior to tourniquet use. The absolute change in hand 
volume, percentage change from baseline, and residual volume as a percentage of 
baseline  immediately following tourniquet use will then be measured i n all patients. The 
mean will be compared between the  arms ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of 
ALND  by paired t-tests. The parameters listed above are the  primary outcome s. Each 
participant will then be monitored in two limb positions ( elevated and s ling as described 
above) , with measurements taken  on both arms ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of 
The Effect of Pneumatic Tourniquet Use on Upper Extremity Edema Following Axillary Lymph Node Dissection  
Protocol Version #  8 6 September 15 , 2020 ALND . Volume is measured after each position . The change in limb edem a as a factor of 
time will be analyzed by a linear mixed effects model. This is the secondary outcome.  
 
5.3 Sample size  
We analyzed preliminary data on percent change in hand volume in normal controls as a 
response to the application of a tourniquet.  Similar data is not available in the literature 
for patients following ALND.  In the pilot, t he median change was 9.1%, with a standard 
deviation of 1.6% assuming each subject contributed one baseline hand volume and one 
volume following the app lication of the tourniquet.  
 
Our scientific hypothesis is that the difference in change of mean hand volume among 
women who have had lymph node dissection , between the arms ipsilateral and 
contralateral to the side of ALND  is zero or negligible. We therefo re seek a sample size 
that expresses non -inferiority  between ipsilateral and contralateral arms . In the absence of 
clinical norms for the margin of non -inferiority, we made the sample size calculation on 
the basis of margin of non -inferiority of 1% (in uni ts of percent change in hand volume).  
 
We plan to accrue 45 extremities in each group , with two arms per patient . We have 90% 
power that the upper 95% confidence interval of the difference will be at or below the 
stipulated margin of 1%. A confidence bound  above the stipulated margin will be taken 
as evidence of some difference between ipsilateral and contralateral arms , indicating an 
effect of the prior axillary lymph node dissection over and above the effect of the 
tourniquet.   
 
The above calculation assu med a standard deviation of 1.6 percentage point,  and 45 
patients with two arms each (ipsilateral and contralateral to ALND)  to provide 90% 
power for a margin of equivalence of one percentage point  using a two -sided significance 
level of 5%, with a primary  endpoint of percentage change from  baseline  following 
tourniquet use . If 10% of patients are uninformative (N=40 for ipsilateral and 
contralateral arms ), we expect have 87% power for the same margin of equivalence. If 
20% are uninformative (N =35 for ipsilateral and contralateral arms ), we would have 82% 
power.  The secondary outcome  of residual limb volume following elevation in  the two  
limb positions (elevated and sling) are not included in this power analysis and are not 
primary outcomes.  
 
We expect the stud y to begin upon approval,  and conclude after recruitment in 
approximately 6 -12 months.

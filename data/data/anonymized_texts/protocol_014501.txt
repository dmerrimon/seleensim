MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 of 132 Template 18.03 Follow-up period: Safety, sustained efficacy, and the need for rescue therapy will be assessed in the 
follow-up period. Subjects will be required to apply moisturizers twice daily through to the end of the 
follow-up period at Visit 12 (Week 24), and will not be permitted to use TCSs and TCIs, except if 
medically necessary.
The primary analysis will occur once all subjects have either completed the Visit 10 (Week 16) assessments or 
have withdrawn from the study. The final analysis will occur when all subjects have completed the follow up period at Visit 12 (Week 24) or have withdrawn from the study.
TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION
Subjects aged 18 to 65 years inclusive with chronic, moderate-to-severe AD; with documented recent history of 
inadequate response to topical medications for AD, intolerance to treatment with topical medications for AD, or 
for whom topical medications are otherwise medically inadvisable.
TREATMENT GROUPS AND REGIMENS
At Visit 3 (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized to receive SC investigational product  
 as follows:
• MEDI3506 58 subjects),
• MEDI3506  (18 subjects),
• MEDI3506  (18 subjects),
• Placebo  (6 subjects), or
• Placebo  (52 subjects).
STATISTICAL METHODS
General Considerations:
The placebo  groups will be pooled for planned analyses, except where stated otherwise. 
Categorical data will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects in each category. Continuous 
variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.The study populations that will be used in the reporting of the study include the intent-to-treat (ITT), As-treated,
and PK populations. The ITT population will be used to summarize demographic and baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and efficacy endpoints. The As-treated population will be used to summarize safety 
endpoints (adverse events [AEs], laboratory tests, electrocardiograms [ECGs], left ventricular ejection fraction, 
and vital signs), and will be used for other endpoints unless otherwise stated. The PK population will be used to summarize PK endpoints.
Sample Size:
A sample size of 144 subjects in an over all 3:1:1:3 ratio of MEDI3506 :MEDI3506 :MEDI3506 
: pooled placebo, will provide at least 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference in the 
percent change from baseline to Week 16 in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score between the highest 
dose of MEDI3506 and pooled placebo in a responder subgroup, assuming a 35% point difference between 
placebo and MEDI3506 at the highest dose, based on a SD of 40% points, a two-sided 10% alpha level, and 
50% of subjects in the responder subgroup. Based on identical assumptions, the sample size provides > 99% power to detect a statistically significant dose response in percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI 
score in all-comers.
The calculations for dose response assume that percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score will 
increase monotonically with the administration of higher MEDI3506 doses. The power was calculated using a 
multiple comparison procedure with modelling techniques (MCP-Mod) with 4 candidate models for the dose 
response (linear, maximum effect attributable to the drug [E
max], and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). Randomization will 
be stratified by total immunoglobulin E (IgE) (< 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) at screening.
To allow for the possibility that ≤5% of the subjects per treatment group may be ineligible for the ITT 
population, the total sample size will comprise  approximately 152 subjects (58 for MEDI3506 , 18 for 
MEDI3506 , 18 for MEDI3506 , and 58 for pooled placebo) randomized approximately to 
3:1:1:3 ratio overall to the treatment groups.CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 8 of 132 Template 18.0Statistical Analyses:
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score. To assess the 
dose response at Week 16, percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score will be analyzed using the mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) including data from visits up to Week 16. The model will include treatment group, randomization stratum (total IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), visit, and treatment 
group by visit interaction as categorical factors, with baseline EASI as a covariate and the baseline*visit interaction term. Visit will be a repeated factor within a subject and unstructured variance-covariance matrix 
will be used to describe the correlations between observations on a subject between visits. The coefficient of the 
treatment effects at Week 16 obtained from the MMRM will then be incorporated into an MCP-Mod, with 
4 candidate models (linear, E
maxand 2 Hill-E maxmodels) to determine the dose response profile. The estimand of 
primary interest is the difference in mean percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score between 
MEDI3506 and placebo in the ITT population. Data that ar e collected after withdrawal from the study or the 
use of rescue therapy will be treated as missing and excluded from the analysis.Secondary Efficacy Analyses:
A key secondary efficacy endpoint is the percentag e of subjects achieving an IGA response of 0 (clear) or 
1 (almost clear) and at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 16. IGA response at Week 16 will be 
analyzed for the ITT population using logistic regression including treatment group, randomization stratum 
(total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), and baseline IGA as categorical factors. The coefficient of 
the treatment effects at Week 16 obtained from the logistic regression will then be used in an MCP-Mod 
analysis with 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear, E max, and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). As part of the 
MCP-Mod model, the testing of the 4 candidate dose response models will be adjusted for multiplicity using a 
family-wise error rate of 0.10. If more than 1 candidate model shows a statistically significant dose response, 
the final model will be selected based on the Akaike Information Criteria obtained from each model.A subject is defined as achieving a 50% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 50), a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 75), or 90% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 90) response if they have at least a 50%, 75%, or 90% reduction from baseline in EASI score, respectively. EASI 50, EASI 75, and EASI 90 response at Week 16 will be analyzed using a logistic regression model including treatment group and randomization stratum (total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) as categorical factors, and baseline 
EASI score as a covariate for each endpoint. In add ition, the percentage of sub jects ach ieving an EASI 75 
response at Week 16 will be analyzed for the ITT population using logistic regression followed by a dose 
response model similar to that described above for IGA response at Week 16.Change from baseline to Week 16 in % body surface area affected by AD as assessed by EASI, 5-D itch, 
Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Dermatology Life Quality Index; and percent change from baseline to 
Week 16 in SCORing Atopic Der matitis; will be summarized descriptively and analyzed for the ITT population 
using a MMRM, including data from visits up to Week 16. Details of the model for each endpoint are similar to those described above for the primary efficacy endpoint.
Daily peak pruritus N umerical Rating Scale (NRS) assessments will be summarized as weekly means. The 
weekly mean score will be set to missing if > 3 assessments are missed in that 7-day period. The percentage of subjects achieving a ≥3 point reduction from baseline to Week 16 in weekly mean of daily peak pruritus NRS 
will be analyzed using a logistic regression model including treatment group and randomization stratum (total serum IgE < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), and baseline weekly mean of daily peak pruritus score as a covariate.
Furthermore, change from baseline to Week 16 in the weekly mean of daily peak pruritus NRS will be analyzed using a MMRM, using a model similar to those described above for the primary efficacy endpoint.
Daily peak skin pain NRS assessments will be summarized as weekly means. The weekly mean score will be 
set to missing if > 3 assessments are missed in that 7- day period. Change from baseline to Week 16 in weekly 
mean peak skin pain NRS will be analyzed using a MMRM in a similar way as described above for the primary 
efficacy endpoint.
Patient Global Impression of Severity will be summarized with descriptive statistics including number of 
subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum at each visit. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be summarized by visit.

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 9 of 132 Template 18.0AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities by system organ class and preferred 
term. Specific AEs will be counted once for each subject for calculating rates, but will be presented in total in 
subject listings. In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times within a particular subject, the highest 
severity and level of causality will be reported. If any associations of interest between AEs and baseline 
characteristics are observed, additional stratified results may be presented.Frequencies of abnormal laboratory measurements will be presented for each laboratory parameter. Also, laboratory parameters will be assessed by presenting tables containing information related to laboratory shifts 
from baseline relative to the normal range, as well as descriptively over time.
Vital signs, ECG parameters and left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by echocardiogram will be 
summarized descriptively.
Analysis of Immunogenicity and PK:
The incidence rate of positive antibodies to MEDI3506 and anti-drug antibody (ADA) titer will be reported by 
treatment group. Depending on the incidence of ADA, further analysis of ADAs effects may include assessment of the relationships between ADA titer and:
• MEDI3506 exposure.
• Biomarker endpoints.
• Occurrence of AEs.
MEDI3506 serum concentrations will be tabulated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Additional PK 
analyses may be conducted as appropriate. If the data allow, population PK analysis will be performed but will not be reported in the Clinical Study Report.
Primary and Final Analyses:
No formal interim analyses are planned for this study. The primary analysis will occur once all subjects have 
either completed the Visit 10 (Week 16) assessments or have withdrawn from the study and will include all 
available data. The final analysis will occur when all s ubjects have completed the follow-up period at Visit 12 
(Week 24) or have  withdrawn from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 20 of 132 Template 18.01 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Disease Background
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease commonly referred to as 
eczema. In severe AD, there is widespread skin involvement. Affected skin may be red, itchy, swollen, cracked, weeping with crusting, and/or scaling. Pruritus is frequently intractable and 
with breakdown of barrier function there is an increased risk of bacterial, viral, and/or fungal 
skin infections. There may also be scarring in the form of lichenification, excoriation, papulation, or induration, due to chronic disease, the effects of treatment, or infective complications.
Up to 25% of children (DaVeiga, 2012) and 5% of adults (Barbarot et al, 2018) are affected 
by AD. Of the adults, 20% to 37% have moderate disease with 10% to 34% reported with severe disease (Kim et al, 2016; Pawankar, 2013) . Patients with moderate-to-severe AD have 
a poor quality of life through a combination of symptoms, emotional stress from poor self-image, the burden of applying topical treatments regularly, sleep disturbance, and 
reductions in work productivity ( Kiebert et al, 2002) . Treatment recommendations for AD 
include liberal use of emollients, dry skin care protocols, topical corticosteroids (TCSs), and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs).
For many patients with moderate-to-severe AD, TCS therapy has inadequate efficacy. In 
addition, long-term TCS use is associated with si de effects such as thinning and discoloration 
of the skin, increased risk of skin infection, contact dermatitis, decreased bone density, and 
slowing of growth in children ( Ring et al, 2012) . A high proportion of patients have a partial 
or no clinical response to TCI therapy. Moreover, long-term safety of TCIs has not been 
established, and continuous, long-term use should be avoided (Elidel, 2017; Protopic, 2012) . 
Off-label use of systemic immunomodulatory agents including cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is reserved for patients with poor AD control despite optimized use of first line topical therapies and phototherapy ( Sidbury et al, 2014) . Dupilumab 
(Dupixent®), an anti-interleukin (IL) 4R α monoclonal antibody (mAb), is approved as an 
add-on therapy for adults and adolescents with  moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not 
adequately controlled with topical therapies . However, dupilumab also has limited efficacy in 
many patients. Consequently, there is an unmet need for new therapeutic agents for AD that improve outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe disease.
1.2 MEDI3506 Background
MEDI3506 is briefly described below. Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for details.
MEDI3506 is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 mAb that binds to human IL-33. MEDI3506 
neutralizes the pro-inflammatory actions of IL- 33 by preventing binding of IL-33 to its 
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 21 of 132 Template 18.0receptor ST2, which is expressed by a var iety of inflammatory cells linked to AD 
pathophysiology. Nonclin ical data support a role for anti-IL- 33 therapy in AD. Blocking of 
IL-33 signaling through ST2 has a therapeutic effect in murine models of AD ( Imai et al, 
2013; Peng et al, 2018) . Clinical data also support a role for anti-IL-33 therapy in AD. An 
uncontrolled (ie, no placebo group), Phase 2a clinical study of a single intravenous (IV) dose 
of etokimab (ANB020; anti-IL-33 neutralizing antibody) showed efficacy of etokimab in 
adults with moderate-to-severe AD, indicating the potential of anti-IL-33 therapy for treating AD ( Ogg, 2018) . As both MEDI3506 and etokimab have a similar mechanism of action, the 
Phase 2a etokimab clinical study data provide  support for investigating the therapeutic 
potential of MEDI3506 in AD. However, a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study of multiple doses of etokimab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD has, according to a preliminary report, not met its primary endpoint of statist ically si gnificant improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) compared 
with placebo at Week 16 (AnaptysBio, 2019) .
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience
 
 
Nonclinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that MEDI3506 binds  
specifically and with high affinity. In addition, studies performed in vitro and in vivo have 
demonstrated the mechanism of action of MEDI3506.  
 
 
 
 
The potential toxicity of MEDI3506 was evaluated in 2 repeat-dose studies.

1.4 Summary of Clinical Experience
One Phase 1 clinical study of MEDI3506 (S tudy D9180C00001) has been completed to date.
Study D9180C00001 was a Phase 1, first time in human, randomized, blinded (investigator 
and subject blinded; sponsor unblinded), pla cebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of single and repeated doses of MEDI3506. The 
study had 3 parts. Part I involved single ascending dose administration of MEDI3506 either 
SC or IV to healthy adult subjects with a hi story of mild atopy, Part II involved multiple 
ascending dose administration of MEDI3506 SC to adult subjects with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) I to II chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Part III involved single dose administration of MEDI3506 IV to healthy adult Japanese subjects.
In healthy subjects with a history of mild atopy in Part I of the study, a similar proportion of 
subjects experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; ie, adverse events 
[AEs] occurring after the first dose of investigational product [MEDI3506 or placebo]) in the 
MEDI3506 and placebo groups. All reported TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 (mild or moderate) in severity. There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product, treatment- emergent serious a dverse events (TESAEs), or deaths.
In subjects with GOLD I to II COPD in Part II of the study, a similar proportion of subjects 
experienced at least 1 TEAE in the MEDI3506 and placebo groups. A maj ority of reported CCI

AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 23 of 132 Template 18.0TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. One subject experienced a TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of investigational product, and 2 subjects experienced 2 TESAEs (1 TESAE in each subject). There was 1 death due to non-small cell lung cancer. The TEAE leading to discontinuation of investigational product, TESAEs, and death were considered not related to investigational product by the investigator.
In healthy Japanese subjects in Part III of the study, a similar proportion of subjects 
experienced at least 1 TEAE in the 300 mg IV MEDI3506 and placebo groups. All reported TEAEs were Grade 1 in severity. There we re no TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
investigational product, TESAEs, or deaths.
The MEDI3506 serum concentration versus time profiles from healthy subjects with a history 
of mild atopy showed linear and time-invariance first order absorption and first order elimination for single doses of 1 to 300 mg SC. There was no evidence of an antigen sink. For multiple every 2 weeks (Q2W) SC doses in subjects with GOLD I to II COPD, slight 
accumulation was observed, based on the trough concentration, following the first and third 
dose. The multiple and single dose half-lives were consistent.
Nine out of 88 subjects were anti-drug antibody (ADA)-positive at any time point. 
Treatment-emergent ADA were detected in 4 out of 66 subjects in the MEDI3506 groups. No subjects in the placebo groups (N = 22) had treatment-emergent ADA. TEAEs were similar in frequency and severity for ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects. No impact of ADA on MEDI3506 PK was observed, except in 1 subject where the onset of treatment-emergent ADA coincided with a decrease in MEDI3506 serum concentration.
Please refer to the IB for further details.
1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
IL-33 is a cytokine constitutively expressed at endothelial and epithelial barrier surfaces and is 
released following injury. On release, IL-33 induces Type 2 (T2) inflammation, stimulating production of IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines and promoting eosinophil recruitment.
T2 inflammation is a char acteristic feature of AD. Studies have found increased 
concentrations of IL-33 mRNA, and ST2 mRNA and protein, in the skin lesions of patients with AD and in the skin of mice induced to develop AD (Dickel et al, 2010; Savinko et al, 
2012) . In addition, IL-33 impacts skin barrier in tegrity by downregulating the expression of 
filaggrin, a structural protein that plays a key role in AD skin barrier function ( Salimi et al, 
2013; Seltmann et al, 2015) . Genetic studies also support a role for IL-33 in the pathogenesis 
of AD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-33 gene that result in loss of protein function have been linked to protection from allergic disorders (Smith et al, 2017) . Genetic 
polymorphisms within the ST2 gene region are associated with AD ( Shimizu et al, 2005) .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 26 of 132 Template 18.0The study population is not considered to  be particularly vulnerable to COVID- 19, as study 
subjects are generally younger and without significant cardiac comorbidity. The incidence of asthma in the study population is exp ected to be higher than in the general population but mild 
in most cases.
Investigators should consider whether potential subjects who are considered to have particular 
significant risk factors for COVID-19 should be  included during the pandemic, per Exclusion 
Criterion  10. Subjects older than 65 years are additionally excluded as they are at greater risk, 
per Inclusion Criterion  2.
Subjects who are suspected (or known) to have COVID-19 should not be included, per 
Exclusion Criterion  10. Subjects who, during the course of the study, are suspected of having 
contracted COVID-19 should not be brought into contact with other subjects. If it is not possible for a subject to attend a study visit, th en the patient should be contacted by telephone 
for the assessment of AEs, changes in concomitant medications, and other assessments that 
may be performed entirely verbally. Polymer ase chain reaction testing for severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the virus causing COVID- 19) is not 
mandated for this study, as a subject with a negative result may become infected at any time 
after the sample was taken. Testing for COVID- 19 may and should be performed, if required, 
by local / national guidelines.
It is recognized that depending on the location and facilities of a clinical site, study visit 
attendance may place subjects at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it is recognized that more general p opulation level measures to reduce infection r ates (eg, travel 
restrictions) may inhibit the ability of subjects  to attend study visits. Necessary healthcare 
responses to the pandemic at sites (eg, additional infection control measures) may also inhibit the ability of a clinical site to  effectively and properly conduct the study. Study visit 
attendance for dosing and for clinical assessments of treatment response are crit ical for the 
scientific value of the study.
Therefore, investigators should not enrol subjects unless they have reasonable confidence that 
throughout the duration of the study:
∀Subjects will be able to attend study visits, whilst avoiding contact with concentrations of 
COVID-19 patients (eg, hospital entr ances used by such patients) and
∀The site will be able to effectively and sa fely conduct the study, considering relevant 
national and local factors.
The sponsor will conduct risk-based enrolment asse ssments on a country and site level, on a 
regular basis during the pandemic phase, and decisions will be documented.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27 of 132 Template 18.0All site staff should wear personal protective equipment in accordance with local or national 
guidelines.
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) which, in the event of missing data, uses all data that are available. The sponsor will monitor the number of discontinuations, withdrawals, missed visits, and other missing data.
Given the limited additional risks to the study population re lated to COVID- 19, from study 
participation, beyond those they would experience in everyday life, the mitigations described 
above are considered sufficient to ensure a favorable benefit-risk balance.
1.6.1.1 Vaccination Against COVID-19
There are no clinical data available to assess the interaction (if any) of MEDI3506 with any 
COVID-19 vaccine.
The sponsor accepts that vaccination against COVID-19, when and where it is available and 
subjects are eligible according to applicable guidelines, is in the subject’s best interest. Consequently, vaccination during the study is, in general, permitted and any delays in 
vaccination due to study participation should be minimized.
To help ensure the interpretability of safety d ata, receipt of COVID-19 vaccine (either first or 
subsequent dose) is prohibited within 30 days before randomization or within 7 days before or 
after any dose of investigational product (Section  4.7.3) . Receipt of, at least, the first dose of 
COVID-19 vaccine more than 30 days before randomization, without significantly delaying enrollment, should be preferred but may not be possible, eg, not locally available at the time, subject not eligible at the time, express subject decision not to be vaccinated. Otherwise, vaccination may be performed at any time outside the prohibited 7-day window before or after 
any dose of investigational product. If the (approximate) date of a subsequent dose of 
COVID-19 vaccination is known, then enrollment of the subject should be timed so that the dose is not within 30 days prior to scheduled  randomization. If this date is not known then 
enrollment into study should not be dela yed. If an enrolled subject does (unexpectedly) 
receive COVID-19 vaccine within 30 days pri or to scheduled rand omization, the site s hould 
contact the AstraZeneca Study Physician for advice on how the situation should be managed.

3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of the Study
3.1.1 Overview
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double- blinded, placebo-cont rolled, pa rallel-group, 
proof-of-concept study to evaluate the efficacy, safety , PK, and immunogenicity of 
MEDI3506 in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD (Figure 1) . Approximately 
152 subjects will receive  MEDI3506 SC; or placebo  SC, or placebo  SC; in a 3:1:1:1:2 ratio overall  
The randomization ratio will change during the study CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 33 of 132 Template 18.0(Section 4.6.1) . The randomization w ill be stratified based on total IgE (< 150 kU/L or 
≥150 kU/L) at screening. The study will be  conducted at approximately 40 to 50 study sites in 
Australia, Europe, and North America.
Subjects will be enrolled in this study for approximately 7 months (28 weeks), comprising a 
screening and TCS/TCI wash out period of up to 4 weeks, a 16-week treatment period, and an 
8-week follow-up period (Figure 1) :
1 Screening and TCS/TCI wash out period: Following the signing of informed consent, 
subjects will be assessed for study eligibility (Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 ) at screening 
Visit 1 and, if eligible, invited to attend scr eening Visit 2, which must occur 7 or more 
days prior to randomization. Subjects who meet the eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) 
criteria will discontinue use of TCSs and TCIs  at Visit 2. Subjects will be required to 
apply moisturizers twice daily for at least 7 days before randomization at Visit 3 (Day 1) with a minimum of 85% compliance.
2 Treatment period: To be randomized at Visit 3 (Day 1), subjects must meet all the 
eligibility criteria (Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3) before receiving investigational product by 
SC injection . Subjects will be required to apply moisturizers twice daily throughout 
the treatment period, and will not be permitted to use TCSs and TCIs, except if medically 
necessary (Section 4.7.4) .  
and the primary endpoint assessment will occur at Visit 10 
(Week 16).
The first 72 subjects randomized will attend Visit 4a, whereas the remaining subjects will 
attend Visit 4b instead (Table 7) .
Following provision of informed consent, skin punch biopsies at Visit 3 (Day 1) and 
Visit 10 (Week 16) will be collected from a subset of subjects (ie, approximately 45 subjects in total). Subjects with comorbid chronic inflammatory conditions of the nasal mucosa and/or paranasal sinuses (eg, chronic rhinitis/rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, allergic 
rhinitis) will complete the Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22 questionnaire. Similarly, 
subjects with comorbid asthma will complete the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-6 questionnaire.
3 Follow-up period: Safety, sustained efficacy, and the need for rescue therapy will be 
assessed in the follow-up period. Subjects will be required to apply moisturizers twice 
daily through to the end of the follow-up period at Visit 12 (Week 24), and will not be permitted to use TCSs and TCIs, except if medically necessary (Section 4.7.4) .

concentration at steady state; SC = subcutaneous; .
The nature and severity of disease in the study population are not exp ected to significantly 
impact the overall exposure nor clearance. The published PK data for a monoclonal antibody licensed for use in AD indicate that the disease status (ie, healthy subjects vs subjects with AD) had no significant impact on exposure or clearance (Kovalenko et al, 2016) . Hence, we 
anticipate that MEDI3506 exhibits similar PK prof iles for both h ealthy subjects and subjects 
with AD.
Exposures (ie, mean C
max,ss of 1,276 μg/mL, and area under the concentration-time curve for 0 
to 4 weeks at steady-state of 28,012 μg • day/mL) achieved at the 26-week NOAEL of

exploratory endpoints to investigate if these comorbidities might be improved by treatment with MEDI3506 (Silverberg and Simpson, 2013; Spergel, 2010) .
3.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
3.2.3.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in EASI score. The EASI is a valid and 
reliable quantitative tool for assessing AD severity over time ( Schmitt et al, 2013)
(Section 4.3.1.1) .
3.2.3.2 Secondary Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints will provide information to support the interpretation of the 
primary endpoint.
Clinical scientific experts advise that an EASI score ≥16 at randomization and an 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 reliably identify subjects with 
moderate-to-severe AD, so cut-off values for EASI and IGA were included as inclusion 
criteria (Section 4.1.2) .
Standard safety, PK, and immunogenicity endpoints will be evaluated.
3.2.3.3 Exploratory Endpoints
Blood samples will be collected from subjects for the assessment of biomarkers that are 
relevant to disease pathology and/or the mechanism of action of MEDI3506.
Skin punch biopsies and skin tape strips will allow biomarker analyses directly from the target 
tissue.
Skin swabs will be collected  from subjects to evaluate Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) 
colonization. Levels of S aureus have been correlated with disease severity (Simpson et al, 
2018) .
Many patients with AD have comorbid c hronic rhinosinusitis. SNOT-22, a measure of nasal 
symptoms, will be performed and evaluated in subjects with comorbid chronic rhinos inusitis. 
Changes in SNOT-22 will be used to assess the impact of MEDI3506 on chronic rhinosinusitis.
Many patients with AD have comorbid asthma. The ACQ-6, a measure of asthma control, will 
be performed and evaluated in subjects with comorbid asthma to assess the impact of MEDI3506 on asthma symptoms.

effects or safety risks that outweigh the potential treatment benefits), as assessed by the investigator or by the physician who treats the subject’s AD.
Note, acceptable evidence of documented history includes:
(i) Contemporaneous clinical notes that record ≥1 topical medication prescription 
and treatment outcome, from which an IGA score of ≥3 can be inferred.
(ii) Contemporaneous clinical notes that record ≥1 systemic medication 
prescription.
(iii) Investigator documentation based on communication with the physician who 
treats the subject’s AD.
Note, meeting (a) and/or (b) is considered to indicate a history of inadequate response to 
topical medications for AD.

both at screening Visit 1 (se rum pregnancy test) and pre-dos e of investigational product at 
Visit 3 (Day 1; urine pregnancy test).
11 Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a male partner 
must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from screening until the end 
of the follow-up period at Visit 12 (Week 24) of the study. See  Appendix A for 
definitions of childbearing potential and highly effective methods of contraception.
∀In countries where spermicide is available, it is strongly recommended for the male 
partner of a female subject of childbeari ng potential to also use male condom plus 
spermicide throughout this period.
∀In countries where spermicide is not available, it is strongly recommended for the 
male partner of a female subject of childbearing potential to also use male condom throughout this period.
Note there are no contraception requirements for female subjects who are not of 
childbearing potential. However, all female subjects should refrain from egg cell donation 
and breastfeeding throughout the study.

4.1.4 Subject Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identif ication (SID) number w ill be 
assigned by a central system (ie, an interactive voice/web response system [IXRS]) and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study  eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The 
SID number will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study participation. At Visit 3 (Day 1), once a subject has been fully assessed as meeting the 
eligibility criteria, the central IXRS system will be used to randomize the subject (Section 4.6.1) .
A log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all screening 
failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria and/or are not 
randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure. Rescreening of subjects who fail to 
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 45 of 132 Template 18.0meet the eligibility criteria is generally only permitted once, when there is a reasonable 
expectation that the subject will become eligible for the study. Permission to rescreen > 1 time may be granted by the medical monitor in the presence of extenuating circumstances. Prior to rescreening, subjects must be reconsented and receive a new SID number.
If acceptable documentation of previous inadequate response cannot be obtained, a subject 
may, at the investigator’s discretion, be pre scribed a course of medium or high potency TCSs 
(Appendix G) , in the presence or absence of TCIs, and be rescreened if the subject’s response 
is documented as inadequate.
4.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects are free to withdraw their consent to participate in the study (investigational product and assessments) at any time, without prejudice to further treatment. Subjects who withdraw consent will be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If the subject is 
willing, the subject will be seen and assessed by the investigator. AEs will be followed up; the 
eDiary should be r eturned by the subject. If a subject withdraws from further participation in 
the study, then no further study vi sits or data collection should take place.
4.1.6 Discontinuation of Investigational Product
An individual subject will not receive any further investigational product if any of the 
following occur in the subject in question:
1 Withdrawal of consent to further treatment with investigational product.
2 Lost to follow-up.3 Any anaphylactic reaction to investigation al product requiring epinephrine administration.
4 Any TESAE that is considered related to investigational product by the investigator.5 Any TESAE that is in the Cardiac Disorders system organ class, regardless of whether or 
not the event is considered related to investigational product by the investigator.
6 Confirmed diagnosis of new onset of heart failure during the study, regardless of severity 
or whether or not the event is considered related to investigational product by the 
investigator. For a subject with suspected new onset of heart failure, the subject should 
not be administered investigational product unless and until the diagnosis is refuted.
7 Any other AE that, in the opinion of th e investigator or the sponsor, warrants 
discontinuation of further dosing of investigational product.
8 Pregnancy.
9 Following rando mization, the subject meets ≥ 1 of the exclusion criteria (Section 4.1.3)  or 
fails to meet all of the inclusion criteria (Section 4.1.2)  for study participation.
10 Receipt of prohibited medications (as defined in Section  4.7.3)  except for:
(a) TCS and TCI as rescue therapy (as defined in Section  4.7.4) .
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 46 of 132 Template 18.0(b) Where the principal investigator and the medical monitor agree that nature, duration, 
etc of the receipt of prohibited medication does not justify discontinuation and the subject may continue receiving investigational product. 
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving investigational product will be 
followed for protocol-specified assessments including follow-up of any AEs unless consent is 
withdrawn from further study participation, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the subject is 
enrolled in another clinical study.
4.1.7 Replacement of Subjects
Randomized subjects will not be replaced.
4.1.8 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Biological Sample Retention and 
Analyses
AstraZeneca ensures that biological samples will  be destroyed at the end of a specified period 
as described in the informed consent.
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donate d biological samples, the samples will be 
disposed of/destroyed, and the action docu mented. If samples are already analyzed, 
AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research.
Collection of the non-optional biological samples is  an integral part of the study; therefore, if 
a subject withdraws consent to the use of the samples the subject is withdrawn from further 
study participation.
The principal investigator:
∀Ensures subjects’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will ensure the organization(s) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples 
are disposed of/destroyed, the action documented, and the signed document returned to 
the study site.
∀Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of/destroyed, and the action is documented and that the 
subject and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.
4.2 Schedule of Study Procedures
Disease severity assessments including EASI, IGA, and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis 
(SCORAD) should be performed by the same investigator for each subject, whenever possible.

4.3.1 Eff icacy
4.3.1.1 EASI Including Percentage BSA Affected by AD
The EASI was designed by modifying the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, which has been 
widely used in clinical studies and has been established as a well-accepted and standardized instrument for assessing therapeutic response in patients with psoriasis ( Schmitt et al, 2013) . 
The EASI is a one-dimensional scoring system, measuring only the clinical signs of AD not CCI
CCI
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56 of 132 Template 18.0including the symptoms. The EASI evaluates 4 anatomic regions for severity and extent of 
key disease signs and focuses on the acute and chronic signs of  inflammation (ie, erythema, 
edema, papulation, excoriation, and lichenificatio n). The maximum score is 72, with higher 
values indicating more severe disease.
The EASI including percentage BSA affected by AD will be assessed according to the 
schedule of study procedures (Table 6, Table 7,  and Table 8) . The EASI will be completed by 
the investigator on an electronic device supplied to the site, which will calculate the domain and total scores for the subject. Additional instru ctions for the investigator are described in 
Section 4.2. The percentage of subjects achieving a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema 
Area and Severity Index score (EASI 75), 50% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 50), and 90% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and 
Severity Index score (EASI 90) will be calculated from the EASI scores. The percentage BSA 
affected by AD is a component of EASI and will be analyzed separately from the composite 
EASI score.
4.3.1.2 IGA
The IGA allows investigators to assess overall AD disease severity at 1 given time point and 
consists of a 5-point severity scale from cl ear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost 
clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, and 4 = severe disease;  Appendix H) . The IGA 
uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment.
The IGA will be assessed according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 6, Table 7,  and 
Table 8) , and will be completed by the investigator on an electronic device supplied to the 
site. Additional instructions for the investigator are described in Section 4.2.
4.3.1.3 SCORAD
SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the seve rity of AD that evaluates the extent and 
intensity of AD lesions, in addition to subjective symptoms ( Kunz et al, 1997) . The maximum 
total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease.
A suitable area of non-lesional skin will be designated at screening for SCORAD assessments 
of skin dryness at Visit 1. To allow for the assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied to the designated area for ≥8 hours before visits when SCORAD will be assessed. 
This should be explained to subjects at Visit 1.
SCORAD will be assessed according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 7 and 
Table 8) . SCORAD will be completed on an electronic device supplied to the site, which will 
calculate the domain and total scores for the subject. Additional instructions for the investigator are described in Section 4.2.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 57 of 132 Template 18.04.3.1.4 Peak Pruritus NRS
Peak pruritus (ie, worst itch experienced in the previous 24 hours) will be assessed using an 
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; 0 to 10) with 0 = no itch and 10 = worst imaginable itch (Yosipovitch et al, 2019) . Subjects will complete the pruritus NRS using an eDiary each 
morning according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 6, Table 7,  and Table 8) .
4.3.1.5 Skin Pain NRS
Skin pain (ie, worst skin pain experienced in the previous 24 hours) will be assessed using an 
NRS (0 to 10) with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain ( Humphrey et al, 2017;  
Vakharia et al, 2017) . Subjects will complete the pain NRS using an eDiary each morning 
according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 6, Table 7,  and Table 8) .
4.3.1.6 Moisturizer Use
Subjects will record their moisturizer use using an eDiary each morning according to the 
schedule of study procedures (Table 6, Table 7,  and Table 8) . The records of the subjects will 
be used to monitor compliance with daily moisturizer use.
4.3.1.7 5-D Itch
5-D itch is a questionnaire typically completed in < 5 minutes designed to assess itch or 
pruritus, with a recall period of 2 weeks. 5-D it ch takes into account the multidimensional 
nature of pruritus and its impact on quality of life, and is capable of detecting changes over 
time (Elman et al, 2010) . Subjects will complete the 5-D itch on an electronic device supplied 
to the site according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 6, Table 7,  and Table 8) .
4.3.1.8 Dermatology Life Quality Index
The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-item, patient-completed, health-related 
quality of life  assessment of dermatology c onditions with a recall period of 1 week (Finlay

Whole blood will be collected to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 7) . This exploratory biomarker may help 
identify a responder population based on the investigation of immune cell subset ratios at baseline and/or after MEDI3506 intervention. 
4.3.7.7 Adhesive skin tape patches
Adhesive skin tape patches will be used to collect skin samples from all subjects for gene 
expression analysis according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 7) . The worst target 
lesion and a non-lesional site ( ≤5 cm from the worst target lesional site) will be selected at 
baseline, both of which must not overlap with the selected sites for skin punch biopsies. Those two sites will then be used at both timepoints. This exploratory analysis may help identify a responder population based on transcript biomarkers, as well as to potentially identify additional pharmacodynamic biomarkers related to responders and non-responders to the investigational product.
Information regarding the handling/shipping of specimens will be provided in a separate 
manual.
4.3.8 Storage, Re-use, and Destruction of Biological Samples

4.6 Treatment Assignment and Blinding
4.6.1 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups
An IXRS will be used for randomization to a treatment group and assignment of blinded investigational product kit numbers. A subject is considered randomized into the study when the investigator notifies the IXRS that the s ubject meets eligibility criteria and the IXRS 
provides th e assignment of blinded investigational product kit numbers for the subject.
The first 72 subjects in the study will be randomized using a 3:3:3:1:2 ratio to receive  
MEDI3506 SC; or placebo  SC, or placebo  SC. The remaining 
subjects will be randomized using a 1:1 ratio to receive 600 mg MEDI3506 SC or placebo 4 mL SC. Randomization may be paused briefly to enable this change. The version of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) used will be dependent on the randomization ratio in operation at the time (Section 7.3).
The rando mization will be str atified based on total IgE (< 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) at 
screening. 
The procedure for using the IXRS is, as follows:
∀The investigator or designee contacts the IXRS and provides the SID number and the 
subject’s baseline characteristic(s) used to verify that it is the same subject.CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 71 of 132 Template 18.0∀The correct amount of kits of MEDI3506 and/or placebo will be assigned to the subject.
∀Confirmation of this information is sent to the unblinded investigational product manager 
who prepares the investigational product to be dispensed to the subject per the response system and records the appropriate information in the investigational product 
accountability log.
∀Blinded study personnel will receive a notification containing a dose tracking number, 
that will not disclose how many kits are assigned to the subject.
Investigational product (MEDI3506 or placebo) must be administered the same day the 
investigational product is assigned. If there is a delay in the administration of investigational 
product such that it will not be administered within the specified timeframe, the site monitor 
must be notified immediately.
4.6.2 Methods to Ensure Blinding
This is a double-blinded study in which MEDI3506 and placebo are not ident ical in 
appearance or viscosity. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or sponsor staff who 
are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (ICH E9; see Section 4.6.3.3 for unblinding related to planned analyses). 
Since MEDI3506 and placebo are not identical, i nvestigational product will be handled by an 
unblinded investigational product manager at the site and will be administered by an 
unblinded study team member who will not be involved in the management of study subjects. An independent investigational product monitor will also be unblinded to perform investigational product accountability. In the ev ent that the treatment allocation for a subject 
becomes known to the investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, AstraZeneca must be notified immediately . If the treatment allocation for a subject 
needs to be known to treat an individual subject for an AE (Section 4.6.3.1) , the investigator 
must notify AstraZeneca immediately . The site will maintain a written plan detailing which 
staff members are blinded/unblinded and the process of investigational product preparation 
and administration used to maintain the blind.
MEDI3506 could reduce eosinophil counts in blood over time. As a precaution, eosinophil, 
basophil, and monocyte data from the hematology laboratory tests (Section 4.3.3)  will not be 
communicated to blinded sponsor or site personnel during the treatment and follow-up periods.
To facilitate the in-stream analysis of PK and ADA samples, the randomization schedule may 
be provided to limited personnel who have responsibility for analysing the samples. These unblinded sample analysts will not have any other involvement with the conduct of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72 of 132 Template 18.04.6.3 Methods for Unblinding
4.6.3.1 Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency
In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation are contained in the IXRS manual. In general, unblinding 
should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different based on the subject having received MEDI3506. In the majority of cases, the management of a medical emergency would be the same whether or not investigational product was received by the subject. If this were the case, the investigational product allocation should not be unblinded. In the event there is unblinding, the investigator should promptly document and explain to AstraZeneca the reason for any premature unblinding.
AstraZeneca retains the right to unblind the treatment allocation for serious adverse events 
(SAEs) that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an investigational 
product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.
4.6.3.2 Unblinding for DSMB Purposes
If unblinding is required by the DSMB (Section 3.1.3) , details of the methods for unblinding 
(sponsor will remain blinded) will be provided in a separate DSMB charter.
4.6.3.3 Unblinding for Primary Analysis Purposes
The primary analysis (Section 4.8.7)  will be performed after all subjects have completed 
Visit 10 (Week 16) or have withdrawn from the study. The sponsor staff will be unblinded 
following database lock for the primary analysis. Investigators and site staff will not be made 
aware of unblinded treatment assignments for individual subjects who are in the follow-up period until these subjects have completed the study.
4.7 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s)
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the time of screening until the final study visit. Any concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF.
4.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide ade quate supportive care except for prohibited medications and therapies 
(Section 4.7.3) . Specifically, subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, 
including treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheals, and analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their institutional guidelines.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73 of 132 Template 18.04.7.2 Moisturizer Use
Subjects will be required to apply stable doses of moisturizers twice daily for at least 7 days 
before rando mization at Visit 3 (Day 1) with a minimum of 85% compliance, through to the 
end of the follow-up period at Visit 12 (Week 24;  Table 6, Table 7,  and Table 8) . Moisturizers 
should not be applied to the area of non-lesional skin designated for SCORAD assessments for ≥8 hours before visits when SC ORAD will be assessed (Section 4.3.1.3) . Use of certain 
moisturizers is not permitted (Section 4.7.3)
4.7.3 Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Therapies
Subjects are not permitted to receive any of the following (for the time periods stated):
∀Systemic (oral or injectable) corticosteroids within 4 weeks of Visit 1 until the end of the 
follow-up period.
∀TCSs and TCIs, and any other topical an ti-inflammatory treatment for AD (eg, 
crisaborole) throughout  the treatment and follow-up periods, except if medically 
necessary (Section 4.7.4) .
∀Any other immunosuppressive therapy within 3 months of rando mization until the end of 
the follow-up period.
∀Any immunotherapy within 3 months of randomization, except for stable maintenance 
dose allergen-specific immunotherapy started 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 until the end of 
follow-up period.
∀Interferon gamma within 3 months of randomization until the end of the follow-up period.
∀Investigational products other than MEDI3506 within 4 months or 5 half-lives, whichever 
is longer, of randomization until the end of the follow-up period.
∀Marketed biologics including dupilumab within 4 months or 5 half-lives, whichever is 
longer, prior to randomization until the end of the follow-up period.
∀Ig or blood products within 4 weeks of Visit 1 until the end of the follow-up period.
∀Live or attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of Visit 1 until the end of the follow-up 
period. (Note: Vaccines with adenoviral vectors that are unable to replicate, eg, 
ChAdOx1, are not considered live attenuated).
∀Vaccination against COVID-19 (either first or subsequent dose) within 30 days before 
randomization or within 7 days be fore or after any dose of investigational product.
∀Use of tanning beds or phototherapy including NBUVB, UVB, UVA1, or PUVA within 
4 weeks prior to randomization until the end of the follow-up period.
∀> 2 bleach baths per week within 4 weeks prior to rando mization until the end of the 
follow-up period.
∀Moisturizers containing additives including ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, or filaggrin 
degradation products from Visit 1 until the end of the follow-up period. Subjects may continue using stable doses of such moisturizers throughout the study if initiated at least 
4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74 of 132 Template 18.0Other than the permitted medications described in Section  4.7.1,  use of concomitant 
medications or therapies from screening through to the early discontinuati on visit/end of study
is discouraged. Medications or therapies that are not prohibited and neither compromise subject safety nor affect study data, as j udged by the investigator, will be permitted.
The activity of cytoc hrome P 450 (CYP450) enzymes can be altered by increased levels of 
certain cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, tu mor necrosis factor alpha, interferon) during 
chronic inflammation (Huang et al, 2010) . Thus, MEDI3506, through its downstream 
mechanism of action, has the potential to norm alize the formation of CYP450 enzymes 
indirectly, through the alteration of local and systemic cytokine levels. However, a role for IL-33 in the regulation of CYP450 enzymes has not been reported. As a precaution, upon initiation or discontinuation of MEDI3506, in patients who are receiving concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index and are CYP450 substrates (eg, warfarin), the investigator should consider whether (increased) monitoring is indicated.
4.7.4 Prohibited Concomitant Medications as Rescue Therapy
As this is a study of the effects of MEDI 3506 in patients with AD not using TCS or TCI, 
inappropriate use of TCS, TCI or other prohibited concomitant medications as rescue therapy could undermine the validity/integrity of the tri al. For example, use of rescue medication by a 
patient, before sufficient time has passed since first dose, to allow the opportunity for the investigational product to demonstrate beneficial effects on AD severity, may lead to those beneficial effects being undetected. Therefore, the following restrictions on the use of rescue 
therapy must be observed to ensure appropriate use.
If medically necessary for intolerable AD symptoms that occur throughout the study, rescue 
therapy with otherwise prohibited concomitant medications or therapies (Section 4.7.3)  may 
be prescribed to subjects . In all other circumstances, rescue therapy should be restricted to 
subjects at or after Visit 7 (Day 29), who have:
∀A worsening of EASI by ≥50% from baseline, or
∀A clinically significant, dis proportionate w orsening of pruritus sustained for at least 
7 days, that remains intolerable for the subject despite use of permitted medications 
(Section 4.7.1)  and therapies for managing symptoms.
Rescue therapy should only be prescribed after assessment of the subject in the clinic, either at 
a scheduled or unscheduled visit. A justification for each subject who commences rescue therapy must be documented by th e investigator in the clinical notes.
Rescue therapy should initially be restricted to topical therapies (ie, TCSs or TCIs, or any 
other topical anti-inflammatory treatment [eg, crisaborole]). TCSs should be prescribed at the lowest potency appropriate for the situati on. TCIs should be reserved for problem areas only 
(eg, face, neck, or intertriginous and genital areas). Systemic rescue therapy should be 
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 75 of 132 Template 18.0reserved for subjects who do not adequately respond to topical rescue therapy after ≥7 days of 
treatment.
Subjects who receive topical rescue therapy only may continue to receive investigational 
product provided no discontinuation criteria (Section 4.1.6)  are met. Investigational product 
will be immediately discontinued in subjects who receive systemic rescue therapy, which is a 
prohibited medication (Section 4.7.3) . All subjects should complete the schedule of study 
visits and assessments whether or not they continue treatment with investigational product, and whether or not they receive systemic rescue  therapy. Investigators should make every 
attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments immediately before administration of any systemic rescue therapy. If it is not possib le for the subject to complete the remaining visits, 
then the subject should complete the early discontinuation visit as outlined in the schedule of study procedures (Table 8) .
4.7.5 COVID-19 Vaccination
If a subject receives a COVID-19 vaccination it should be recorded as a concomitant 
medication. Data regarding the date, dose, brand name, site of administration and lot number (if known) of each vaccine dose (eg, 10Feb2021; first dose; Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; left deltoid; Lot xxx) should be recorded in the patient’s case notes.
Any AEs suspected to be due to the vaccination should be captured in the AE form including 
the causality assessment r elated to COVID-19 vaccine.
4.8 Statistical Evaluation
4.8.1 General Considerations
Unless specified otherwise, baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 
(Visit 3). The placebo  groups will be pooled for planned analyses, except where stated otherwise. Tabular summaries will be presented by treatment group. Categorical data 
will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects in each category. Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.
The study populations that will be used in the reporting of the study include the intent-to-treat 
(ITT), As-treated, and PK populations (Table 11) . The ITT population will be used to 
summarize demographic and baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and efficacy endpoints. The As-tr eated population will be used to summarize safety endpoints (AEs, 
laboratory tests, ECGs, left ventricular ejection fraction, and vital signs), and will be used for other endpoints unless otherwise stated. The PK population will be used to summarize PK endpoints.CCI

PKSubjects who receive at least 1 dose of MEDI3506 and have at least 1 detectable serum 
concentration measurement post first dose of treatment. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to the treatment they actually receive.
ITT = intent-to-treat; PK = pharmacokinetic(s).
Additional details of s tatistical analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).
4.8.2 Sample Size
A sample size of 144 subjects in an overall 3:1:1:3 ratio of MEDI3506 :MEDI3506 
:MEDI3506 :pooled placebo, will provide at least 90% power to detect a 
statist ically si gnificant difference in the percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI 
score between the highest dose of MEDI3506 and pooled placebo in a responder subgroup, assuming a 35% point difference between placebo and MEDI3506 at the highest dose, based on a SD of 40% points, a two-sided 10% alpha level, and 50% of subjects in the responder subgroup. Based on identical assumptions, the sample size provides > 99% power to detect a statist ically si gnificant dose response in percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI 
score in all-comers.
The calculations for dose response assume that percent change from baseline to Week 16 in 
EASI score will increase monotonically with the administration of higher MEDI3506 doses. 
The power was calculated using a multiple comparison procedure with modelling techniques (MCP-Mod) (Bretz et al, 2005) with 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear, 
maximum effect attributable to the drug [E
max], and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). Randomization will 
be stratified by total IgE (< 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) at screening.
To allow for the possibility that ≤5% of the subjects per treatment group may be ineligible for 
the ITT population, the total sample size will comprise approximately 152 subjects (58 for 
MEDI3506 , 18 for MEDI3506 , 18 for MEDI3506 , and 58 for pooled 
placebo) randomized approximately to 3:1:1:3 ratio overall to the treatment groups.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77 of 132 Template 18.0To assess dose response at Week 16, percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score 
will be analyzed using an MMRM including data from visits up to Week 16. The model will include treatment group, randomization stratum (total serum IgE < 150 kU/L or ≥ 150 kU/L), 
visit, and treatment group by visit interaction as categorical factors, with baseline EASI score as a covariate and the baseline*visit interaction term. Visit will be a repeated factor within a 
subject and an unstructured variance-covariance matrix will be used to describe the 
correlations between observa tions on a subject between visits. If the unstructured 
variance-covariance matrix will not fit, then suitable alternatives will be considered, with details provided in the SAP. The coefficient of the treatment effects at Week 16 obtained from the MMRM will then be incorporated into an MCP-Mod (Pinheiro et al, 2014) , with 
4 candidate models (linear, E
max, and 2 Hill-E maxmodels) to determine the dose response 
profile. As part of the MCP-Mod model, the testing of the 4 candidate dose response models will be adjusted for multip licity using a family-wise error rate of 0.10. If more than 1 
candidate model shows a statistically significant dose response, the final model will be 
selected based on the Akaike Information Criteria obtained from each model.
The estimand of primary interest is the difference in mean percent change from baseline to 
Week 16 in EASI score between MEDI3506 and placebo in the ITT population. Data that are collected after withdrawal from the study, or the use of rescue therapy will be treated as missing and excluded from the analysis. From the final model obtained from the MCP-Mod 
dose response analysis, the adjusted difference in mean percent change from baseline in EASI score between the placebo group and each MEDI3506 group at Week 16 will be estimated 
along with the 90% confidence inte rval (CI) and two-sided p-value. In addition, an estimate of
the adjusted difference in mean percent change from baseline in EASI at each visit for each treatment group will be summarized together with a two-sided 90% CI, and p-value.
4.8.3.2 Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
Percent Change in EASI Score
A supplementary analysis using the ITT population will be done using all available data from 
subjects irrespective of whether or not they completed treatment, including data collected after 
subjects received rescue therapy. A MMRM followed by a MCP-Mod dose response model 
will be used for the analysis as described above for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (Section 4.8.3.1) .
A second supplementary analysis will be performed using the ITT population. Data from 
assessments performed after prohibited medications (eg, rescue therapies) are received will be excluded and a last observation carried forward approach will be applied for the missing data. An ANCOVA followed by a MCP-Mod dose response model including treatment group and randomization stratum (total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) as categorical factors 
and baseline EASI score as covariate, with 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear, 
E
max, and 2 Hill-E maxmodels) will be used for the analysis. The results will be presented in a

A third supplementary analysis for percent change in EASI score will be performed using a 
MMRM as described above (Section 4.8.3.1) , including data from visits up to Week 24. The 
ITT population will be used for the analysis and data from visits after subjects receive rescue 
therapy will be excluded from the analysis. Fr om the final model obtained from the fitted 
MMRM, the adjusted difference in mean percent change from baseline in EASI score between the placebo and each MEDI3506 group at Week 16 will be estimated along with the 90% CIand two-sided p-value.
4.8.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Analyses
IGA Response at Week 16
A key secondary efficacy endpoint is the per centage of subjects achieving an IGA response of 
0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 16.
IGA response at Week 16 will be analyzed for the ITT population using logistic regression
including treatment group, randomization stratum (total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), and baseline IGA as categorical factors. The coefficient of the treatment effects 
at Week 16 obtained from the logistic regression will then be used in an MCP-Mod analysiswith 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear, E
max, and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). As part 
of the MCP-Mod model, the testing of the 4 candidate dose response models will be adjusted 
for multiplicity using a family-wise error rate of 0.10. If more than 1 candidate model shows a 
statist ically si gnificant dose response, the final model w ill be selected based on the Akaike 
Information Criteria obtained from each model.
The composite estimand of primary interest is the difference in IGA response rate at Week 16 
between MEDI3506 and placebo in the ITT population. Subjects who withdraw from the study or require rescue therapy will be considered as non-responders. From the final model obtained from the MCP-Mod dose response analysis, the difference in IGA response rate between the placebo and each MEDI3506 group will be estimated along with the 90% CI. For each MEDI3506 group versus placebo, the results will be presented as the difference in 
response rates, the 90% CI for the difference in response rates, and two-sided p-value.
Additional Analyses of the IGA Response at Week 16
A supplementary analysis using the ITT population will be done using all available data from 
subjects irrespective of whether or not they completed treatment, including data from subjects who received rescue therapy. Subjects who discontinue investigational product or withdraw 
from the study before Week 16 will be considered as non-responders.

presentation of results will be similar as described above for the secondary efficacy analysis 
for IGA.
A third supplementary analysis will be performed using a generalized est imating e quation 
model for repeated measures including treatment group, randomization stratum (total serum IgE < 150 kU/L or ≥ 150 kU/L), baseline IGA value, visit, and visit by treatment group 
interaction as covariates. The analysis will be conducted including data from visits up toWeek 24. The model will use a logistic link function and an independence working correlation matrix. If th e assumed working correlation matrix will not fit, then suitable alternatives will be 
considered, with details provided in the SAP. From the model obtained, estimates of the 
treatment effect at Week 16 together with the associated standard errors, 90% CIs, and 
p-values will be provided.
Percentage of Subjects Achieving EASI 50, EASI 75, and EASI 90 at Week 16
A subject is defined as achieving an EASI 50, EASI 75, or EASI 90 response if they have at 
least a 50%, 75%, or 90% reduction from baseline in EASI score, respectively.
EASI 50, EASI 75 and EASI 90 response at Week 16 will be analyzed using a logistic 
regression model including treatment group and rando mization stratum (total serum IgE level 
< 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) as categorical factors, and baseline EASI score as a covariate for 
each endpoint. The composite estimand will be the difference between MEDI3506 and placebo in EASI 50, EASI 75, or EASI 90 response rate at Week 16 in the ITT population. Subjects who discontinue investigational product, withdraw from the study, or require rescue therapy will be considered as non-responde rs. For each MEDI3506 group compared with 
placebo, differences in response rates, 90% CIs for the differences in response rates (Ge et al, 
2011) , and two-sided p-values will be reported for each endpoint. If the number of responders 
is < 5 in any MEDI3506 group, the logistic regression model will not be used. Instead, the 
90% CI and p-value for the difference in response rates will be calculated using an unconditional exact method (Chan and Zhang, 1999) .
Additional Analyses of the EASI 75 response at Week 16
The percentage of subjects achieving an EASI 75 response at Week 16 will be analyzed for

5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurren ce. An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or non-serious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any AE that fulfils 1 or more of the following criteria:
∀Results in death.
∀Is immediately life-threatening.
∀Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization.
∀Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
∀Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject.
∀Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 85 of 132 Template 18.0Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalizations, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
AEs for malignant tumours reported during a st udy should ge nerally be assessed as SAEs . If 
no other seriousness criteria apply, the “important medical event” criterion (Appendix B)  
should be used. However, in certain situations medical judgment on an individual event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should be assessed and reported as a non-serious AE. For example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression 
occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumor, the AE may not fulfill the attributes for being assessed as serious, although reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospitalization, may be assessed as non-serious; examples include Stage 1 
basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy.
5.3 Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the investigational product and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to AstraZeneca. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this investigational product.
The following AESIs will be particularly monit ored in this study (s ee the Safety Handling 
Plan for instructions and timing on completing any additional information required for 
specific types of events related to the categories noted below):
∀Hepatic function abnormality meeting the definition of Hy’s Law (HL) as described in 
Section 5.4.12.
∀Serious hypersensitivity (including Type 1 to 4 hypersensitivity reactions), for example 
anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions, and immune complex disease.
∀Injection site reactions.
∀Cardiac events (including angina or myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, cor pulmonale, or arrhythmia).
∀Serious infections (including opportunistic infections and viral reactivations), for example 
VZ/HSV, EBV/CMV, and TB.
∀Gastrointestinal adverse events.
∀Malignancy.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 86 of 132 Template 18.05.4 Recording of Adverse Events
AEs will be recorded on the eCRF using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. AEs will be assessed by the investigator for severity, relationship to the investigational product, possible etiologies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to AstraZeneca (see Section  5.5). See 
Section 5.2for the definition of SAEs and  Appendix B for guidelines for assessment of 
severity and relationship.
If an AE evolves into a condition that meets the regulatory definition of “serious” it will be 
reported on the SAE Report Form.
5.4.1 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events
AEs and SAEs will be collected from time of signature of informed consent at Visit 1, throughout the treatment period and including the follow-up period through Visit 12 
(Week 24) or d ate of last contact.
5.4.2 Follow-up of Unresolved Adverse Events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as 
appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
5.4.3 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the study, including the protocol-defined follow-up period must be reported as follows:
•The AE causing the death must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours. The report should 
assign main and contributory causes of death.
•Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. A post-mortem (autopsy) may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy 
of the post-mortem results s hould be forwarded to AstraZen eca representative(s) within 
the usual timeframes (refer to Section 5.5for additional information).
5.4.4 Recording of Serious Hypersensitivity (Including Type 1 to 4 
Hypersensitivity Reactions)
For AESIs of serious hypersensitivity, narrativ e information will be recorded including the 
rationale for considering the event to be, or not to be, anaphylaxis (Appendix C) .

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87 of 132 Template 18.05.4.5 Recording of Injection Site Reactions
For AESIs of injection site reactions, the sign or symptom, and diameter of area will be 
recorded.
5.4.6 Recording of Cardiac Events (Including Angina or Myocardial 
Infarction, Congestive Heart Failure, Symptomatic Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease, or Pulmonale or Arrhythmia)
For subjects with AESIs of cardiac events suggestive of new onset and/or progression of heart 
failure, left ventricular ejection fraction measured by echocardiogram and NT-proBNP will be 
recorded.
5.4.7 Recording of Serious Infections (Including Opportunistic Infections 
and Viral Reactivations
No additional information will be recorded beyond standard.
5.4.8 Recording of Gastrointestinal Adverse Events
No additional information will be recorded beyond standard.
5.4.9 Recording of Malignancy
No additional information will be recorded beyond standard.
5.4.10 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question 
from the study site staff: “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were 
last asked?” , or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When 
collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
5.4.11 Adverse Events Based on Examination and Tests
The results from the protocol-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the CSR. An abnormal laboratory finding (including echocardiogram or ECG finding) that requires medical intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator as medically significant, should be reported as an AE. If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnosis or med ical condition should be reported (eg, renal 
failure, hematuria) not the la boratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood cell 
increased).
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88 of 132 Template 18.0If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
5.4.12 Hy’s Law
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN may need to be
reported as SAEs. Please refer to  Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of HL.
5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the inves tigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify bot h the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country-specific regul atory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators.
For all studies except those utilizing medical devices investigator safety reports must be 
prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB or and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system, an automated email aler t is sent to inform the designated sponsor 
representative(s).
If the EDC system is not available, then the i nvestigator or other study site personnel reports 
an SAE to the appropriate sponsor representative by telephone. The sponsor representative will advise the investigator/study site personnel how to proceed.

Safety Information for Assessment of Expectedness of Serious Adverse Reactions in the IB.
5.6 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting
5.6.1 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of investigational product in excess of that specified in the IB, unless otherwise specified in this protocol.
∀An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
∀An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca investigational product occurs during the course of the 
study, then the investigator or other site personnel should inform appropriate sponsor 
representatives immediately, but no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The designated sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor’s Patient Safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply; see Section 5.5. 
For other overdoses (ie, those not associated with an AE or SAE), reporting must occur within 30 days.
5.6.2 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to the sponsor except if the pregnancy is discovered before the subject has received any investigational product.
5.6.2.1 Maternal Exposure
If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, investigational product should be 
discontinued immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital anomalies/birth defects and spontan eous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital anomaly) should be followed  up and documented even if the 
subject was discontinued from the study.
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 90 of 132 Template 18.0If any pregnancy occurs during the course of the study, then the investigator or other site 
personnel will inform the appropriate sponsor representatives within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The designated study representative works with  the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor’s patient safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar 
days for SAEs (see Section 5.5) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.The pregnancy reporting module in the eCRF is used to report the pregnancy and the 
pregnancy outcome module is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
5.6.2.2 Paternal Exposure
Pregnancy of the subject’s partners is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital anomaly), occurring from the date of the first dose until the end of the follow-up period (Visit 12 [Week 24]) or date of last contact should, if possible, be followed 
up and documented.
5.6.3 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an AstraZeneca investigational product that either causes harm to the subject or has the potential to cause harm to the subject.
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the investigational product, but rather a human-
or process-related failure while the investigational product is in control of the study site staff 
or subject.
Medication error includes situations where an error:
∀Occurred.
∀Was identified and intercepted before the subject received the investigational product.
∀Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error.
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
∀Drug name confusion (ie, instead of receiving the investigational product, the subject 
received a medication that has a similar-sounding name).
∀Dispensing error, eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the subject.
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 91 of 132 Template 18.0∀Investigational product not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong 
site of administration.
∀Investigational product not taken as indicated, eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should 
be taken as a solid tablet.
∀Investigational product not stored as instructed, eg, kept in the refrigerator when it should 
be at room temperature.
∀Wrong subject received the investigational product (excluding IXRS errors).
∀Wrong investigational product administered to subject (excluding IXRS errors).
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies:
∀Errors related to or resulting from IXRS- including those which lead to 1 of the above 
listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error.
∀Subject accidentally missed investigational product dose(s), eg, forgot to take medication.
∀Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose).
∀Subject failed to return unused inve stigational product or empty packaging.
∀Errors related to background and rescue therapy, or standard of care medication in open 
label studies, even if an AstraZeneca product.
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.
If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is completed within 1 or 5 calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 5.5) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. 
Medication errors should be reported using a Medication Error Report Form.

During the study, an AstraZeneca representative will have regular contacts with the study site, including visits to:
∀Provide information and support  to the investigator(s).
∀Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.
∀Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological samples are handled in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and that study drug accountability checks are 
being performed.
∀Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the subject’s 
medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study) including verification of informed consent of participating subjects. This will require 
direct access to all original records for each subject (eg, clinic charts).
∀Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the subject’s biological samples is 
reported and biological samples are identified  and disposed of/destroyed accordingly, and 
the action is documented, and reported to the subject.
The AstraZeneca representative will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other 
staff at the center needs information and advice about the study conduct.
Investigational product accountability (Section 4.6.2)  and any other unblinded monitoring 
activities will be conducted by an additional unblinded monitor.
6.2.1 Source Data
Refer to the Clinical Study Agreement for location of source data.
6.2.2 Study Agreements
The principal investigator at each/the center should comply with all the terms, conditions, and 
obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement, or equivalent, for this study. In the event of any inconsistency between this protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, the terms of protocol shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of subjects and in all

6.3 Study Timetable and End of Study
An individual subject will be considered to have completed the study if the subject was 
followed through their last protocol-specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact) 
regardless of the number of doses of investigational product that was received.
Subjects will be considered not to have completed the study if consent was withdrawn or the 
subject was lost to follow-up (see Sections 4.1.5 and4.1.6) .
The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol-specified 
visit (including telephone contact) for the last subject in the study (ie, LSLV).
6.4 Data Management 
Data management will be performed by AstraZeneca Data Management staff or other party
according to the Data Management Plan.
An EDC system will be used for data collectio n and query handling. The investigator w ill 
ensure that data are recorded in the eCRFs as specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the eCRF instructions provided.
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. The 
investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site.
6.5 Medical Monitor Coverage
Each subject will be provided with contact information for the principal investigator. In addition, each subject will receive a toll-free number intended to provide the subject’s physician access to a medical monitor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the event of an emergent situation where the subject’s health is deemed to be at risk. In this situation, when a subject presents to a medical facility where the treating physician or health care provider requires access to a physician who has knowle dge of the investigational product and the 
clinical study protocol and the principal investigator is not available, the treating physician or health care provider can contact a medical monitor through this system, which is managed by 
a third-party vendor.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94 of 132 Template 18.07 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
7.1 Subject Data Protection
Each subject will be assigned a SID to ensure that personally identifiable information is kept 
separate from the study data. Subject data that are relevant to the trial, eg, demographic information, physical or mental health condition, diagnosis, comorbidities, laboratory test 
results, etc. will only be collected with th e subject’s informed consent. The ICF will 
incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document incorporating) wording that describes how subject data will be collected, used, and distributed in compliance with relevant data protection and privacy legislation.
Extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being 
linked to the identity of the subject. AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, any employe r, their family members, general physician or 
any other third party, unless required to do so by law .
7.2 Ethics and Regulatory Review
The IRB/IEC responsible for each site must review and approve the final study protocol, 
including the final version of the ICF and any ot her written information a nd/or materials to be 
provided to the subjects. The IRB/IEC must also approve all advertising used to recruit 
subjects for the study. The investigator is responsible for submitting these documents to the applicable IRB/IEC, and distributing them to the study site staff.
The opinion of the IRB/IEC must be given in writing. The investigator must provide a copy of 
the written approval to AstraZeneca before enrollment of any subject into the study.
AstraZeneca should approve any substantive modifications to the ICF that are needed to meet 
local requirements.
If required by local regulations, the protocol must be re-approved by the IRB/IEC annually.Before the study is initiated, AstraZeneca will ensure that the national regulatory authority in 
each country has been notified and their approval has been obtained, as required. AstraZeneca will provide safety updates/reports according to local requirements, including SUSARs where relevant, to regulatory authorities, IRB/IEC, and principal investigators.
Each principal investigator is responsible for providing reports of any serious and unexpected 
adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational product to the IRB/IEC. AstraZeneca will provide this information to the principal investigator so that he/she 
can meet these reporting requirements.

∀Ensure a copy of the signed ICF is given to the subject.
∀Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any 
provisions for subjects harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in the ICF that is approved by an IRB/IEC.
∀Ensure that the ICF version used is appropriate for the randomization ratio in operation at 
the time. Subjects who have provided informed consent but are still in screening (ie, have 
not been randomized) when the randomization ratios change (Section 4.6.1 ) should be 
reconsented to the appropriate ICF version.
7.4 Changes to the Protocol and ICF
Study procedures will not be changed without  the mutual agreeme nt of the coordin ating 
investigator and AstraZeneca. Any changes must be documented in a study protocol 
amendment. 
For a substantial change to the protocol, AstraZeneca will distribute amended versions of the 
protocol to the principal investigator(s). Before implementation, amended protocols must be approved by relevant IRB/IEC (see Section 7.2) and reviewed as per local regulatory authority 
requirements. The IRB/IEC must also approve revisions to the ICF, advertising, and any other written information and/ or materials resulting from the change to the protocol.
Any non-substantial changes will be communicated to or approved by each IRB/IEC.
7.5 Audits and Inspections
Authorized representatives of AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, or an IRB/IEC may 
perform audits or inspections at the center, including source data verification. The purpose of

are summarized below.
Table 14 Summary of Substantial Revisions in Protocol Amendment 7
Section of the Protocol Affected Reason for Amendment
Synopsis, Table 7 (Schedule of Treatment Period 
Study Procedures) and Section 3.1.1 (Overview)An additional PK sampling timepoint has been added 
for the 73rd and subsequent randomized subjects. 
This is to better characterize the pharmacokinetics 
(absorption phase) of MEDI3506 with the current 
formulation. The additional timepoint requires an 
additional visit to site early after the first dose, this 
(in addition to the clinical experience gained by that point) leaves the telephone call with the subject on Day 2 unnecessary and so it has been removed for applicable subjects.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 of 132 Template 18.0Appendix A Contraception Guidance
Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they meet either of the criteria, 
as follows:
∀Surgically sterilized (including bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy), or
∀Post-menopausal.
For women aged < 50 years, post-menopausal is defined as having both:
∀A history of ≥12 months amenorrhea, without an alternative cause, following cessation of 
exogenous sex-hormonal treatment and,
∀A follicle-stimulating hormone level in the post-menopausal range.
For women aged ≥50 years, post-menopausal is defined as having a history of ≥12 months 
amenorrhea, without an alternative cause, following cessation of exogenous sex-hormonal treatment.
A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate 
(ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The acceptable methods of 
contraception are described in  Table A1.
Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of 
contraception.
Table A1 Highly Effective Methods of Contraception

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 of 132 Template 18.0Appendix B Additional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from an adverse event 
(AE) as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hep atitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalization
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not  considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity bu t may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
∀Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous (IV) 
hydrocortisone treatment.
∀Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine.
∀Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm.
∀Blood dyscrasias (eg, neut ropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion) or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.
∀Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Assessment of Severity
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. The determination of severity should be made by the investigator based upon 
medical judgment and the severi ty categories of Grade 1 to 5 as defined below.
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116 of 132 Template 18.0Grade 1 An event of mild intensity that is usually transient and may 
require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.
Grade 2 An event of moderate intensi ty that is usually alleviated with 
additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes 
with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Grade 3 A severe event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. 
The event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.
Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with
an imminent risk of death.
Grade 5       Death as a result of an event.
It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 5.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Grade 3 headache that persists for several hours may not meet the regulatory defi nition of an SAE and would be considered a 
non-serious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure  resulting in a hospital admission would be 
considered an SAE.
Assessment of Relationship
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
The investigator is required to provide an asse ssment of relationship of AEs and SAEs to the 
investigational product. The followi ng factors should be considered when deciding if there is a 
“reasonable possibility” that an AE may have been caused by the investigational product.
∀Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigational product. Has the subject actually 
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
∀Consistency with known investigational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect investigational product (pharmacology and toxicology) or products of the same pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its 
pharmacologi cal properties?
∀De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect investigational product?
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117 of 132 Template 18.0∀No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
∀Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected investigational product was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or 
support a re -challenge.
∀Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
∀Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the investigational product?
∀Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of “related” is made if following a rev iew of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a “reasonable possibility” of a causal relations hip for the individual case. The expression 
“reasonable possibility” of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as “not related.”
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of investigational product) as well as treatment-emergent SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required 
during the study (eg, blood collection, washout of an existing medication). The following 
guidelines should be used by investigators to assess the relationship of SAEs to the protocol:
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to  an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).

Second symposium on the definition and ma nagement of anaphylaxis: Summary report --
Second National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006;117:391-7.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAID) and Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria 
designated to capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for 
all 3 categories). 
1 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)
AND AT LEAST 1 OF THE FOLLOWING:
(a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia).
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence).
2 Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e g, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula).
(b) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia).
(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)
(d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting).
3 Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
(a) Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline.
For the purpose of AE reporting, the above criter ia should be used to  guide retrospective 
judgment as to whether an event was true anaphylaxis. Guidance on the recognition of possible anaphylaxis at the time of the event is provided (Appendix D) .

Appropriate
1 Consider epinephrine infusion.
2 Consider H1 and H2 antihistamines.
3 Consider nebulized beta-2 agonist [eg, albute rol (salbutamol)] for bronchospasm resistant 
to epinephrine.
4 Consider systemic corticosteroids.
5 Consider vasopressor (e.g. dopamine).
6 Consider glucagon for patient taking b-blocker.7 Consider atropine for symptomatic bradycardia.
8 Consider transportation to an emergency department or an intensive care facility.
9 For cardiopulmonary arrest during anaphylaxis, high-dose epinephrine and prolonged 
resuscitation efforts are encouraged, if necessary.
If a suspected anaphylactic reaction occurs during or within a 24-hour period after 
administration of investigational product, blood samples for serum tryptase should be collected as soon as possible after the event, at 60 ± 30 minutes after the event, at discharge, 
and between 2 and 4 weeks post-discharge. Immediate care of the subject and treatment of the 
reaction must take priority over collecting blood samples.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 121 of 132 Template 18.0Appendix E Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report potential Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance 
on managing liver abnormalities can be found in Section 5.4.12 of the protocol.
During the course of the study, the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets PHL 
criteria at any point during the study.
All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study vi sits and other visits including central and all 
local laboratory evaluations even if collected outsi de of the study visits; for example, PHL 
criteria could be met by an elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) from a central laboratory and/or elevated total bilirubin (TBL) from a local laboratory.
The investigator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations 
in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events.
The investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternative exp lanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry 
other than drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by the investigational product. 
The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
E2 Definitions
E 2.1 Potential Hy’s Law
Aspartate transaminase (AST) or ALT ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) together with TBL 
≥2 × ULN at any point during the study following the start of investigational product
irrespective of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
E 2.2 Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than 
the investigational product, can be found to explain the combination of increases; eg, elevated 
ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, or another drug.
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 122 of 132 Template 18.0For PHL and HL, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to identify cases of PHL, it is impor tant to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any subject who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
∀ALT ≥ 3 × ULN.
∀AST ≥ 3 × ULN.
∀TBL ≥ 2 × ULN.
When a subject meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the investigator (also sent to sponsor study 
representative).
The investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the 
identification criteria are met, where th is is the case the investigator will:
∀Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory without delay.
∀Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory case report form (CRF) module(s) with 
the original local laboratory test result.
When the identification criteria are met from cen tral or local laboratory results the investigator 
will wit hout delay:
∀Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Section  E2 )  by reviewing 
laboratory reports from all previous visits (including both central and local laboratory 
results).
E4 Follow-up
E 4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
∀Inform the study representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.
∀Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory re sults according to the guidance provided in 
the study protocol.

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123 of 132 Template 18.0E 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
∀Notify the sponsor study representative who will then inform the study team.
∀Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the investigator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causality assessment ‘yes/related’ 
according to clinical study protocol process for SAE reporting.
The medical monitor contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree on an 
approach for the study subjects’ follow-up (inc luding any further laboratory testing) and the 
continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact the investigator will:
∀Monitor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. Complete follow-up SAE Form as required.
∀Investigate the etiology of the event and perfo rm diagnostic investigations as discussed 
with the medical monitor. This includes deciding which the tests available in the HL lab 
kit should be used.
∀Complete the relevant CRF Modules  as information becomes available.
E5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially  detected, th e medical 
monitor will contact the investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the investigational product, to ensure timely analysi s and reporting to health authorities per local 
requirements from the date PHL criteria were met. The medical monitor and global safety physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the 
instructions below.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:
∀If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF.
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124 of 132 Template 18.0∀If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, update the previously submitted PHL SAE 
and AE CRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality 
and seriousness criteria) following the sponsor’s standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the investigational product:
∀Send the updated SAE (report term “Hy’s Law”) according to the sponsor’s standard 
processes.
#The “Medically Important” serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply.
#As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
“related” should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information 
necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
∀Provide any further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL (report term now 
“Hy’s Law case”), ensuring causality assessment is related to the investigational product 
and seriousness criteria are medically important,  according to the clinical study protocol 
process for SAE reporting.
∀Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following clinical study protocol process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of 
the review and amend the reported term if an alternative explanation for the liver 
biochemistry elevations is determined.
E6 Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential Hy’s Law
This section is applicable when a subject meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:
∀Was the alternative cause for the previous o ccurrence of PHL criteria being met found to 
be the disease under study eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe infection, 
or liver disease.
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125 of 132 Template 18.0If No: follow the process described in Section  E 4.2,  for reporting PHL as an SAE.
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant change in the subject’s condition compared 
with when PHL criteria were previously met:
∀If there is no significant change no action is required.
∀If there is a significant change follow the process described in Section  E 4.2,  for reporting 
PHL as an SAE.
A “significant” change in the subject’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator; this may be in consultation with the medical  monitor if there is any uncertainty.
E7 Laboratory Tests
The list below represents the standard, comprehensive list of follow-up tests which are 
recommended but not mandatory when using a central laboratory. For studies using a local laboratory, the list may be modified based on clinical judgment. If required, for additional assistance on which tests could be used to evaluate other potential causes of liver dysfunction, consult with the Hepatic Safety Knowledge Group. Any test results need to be recorded.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 127 of 132 Template 18.0Appendix F Genetic Research
F1 Rationale and Objectives
AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genetic research to explore how genetic 
variations may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of diseases, and the response to medications. Genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in health care and to the discovery of new diagnostics, treatments, or medications.
In addition, collection of DNA samples from populations with well described clinical 
characteristics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly, to genetically guided treatment strategies.
F2 Genetic Research Plan and Procedures
F 2.1 Selection of Genetic Research Population
Study Selection Record
All subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participation is voluntary and 
if a subject declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit. The subject will 
not be excluded from any aspect of the main study.
Inclusion Criteria
For inclusion in this genetic research, subjects mu st fulfil all of the inclusion criteria described 
in the main body of the protocol and:
∀Provide informed consent for the genetic sampling and analyses.
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the 
main study or any of the following:
∀Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant.
∀Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample collection.
F 2.2 Discontinuation of Subjects from this Genetic Research
Specific reasons for discontinuing a subject from this genetic research are:
∀Withdrawal of consent for genetic research: Subjects may withdraw from this genetic 
research at any time, independent of any d ecision concerning participation in other 
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 128 of 132 Template 18.0aspects of the main study. Voluntary discontinuation will not prejudice further treatment. 
Procedures for discontinuation are outlined in Section  4.1.8 of the protocol.
F 2.3 Collection of Samples for Genetic Research
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the subjects at Visit 3 in the 
treatment period. Although DNA is stable, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding subjects who may withdraw due to an AE, such subjects would be important to include in any genetic analysis. If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Visit 3, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit. Only 1 sample should be collected per subject for genetics during the study. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.
F 2.4
Coding and Storage of DNA Samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are 
important to maintain subject confidentiality. S amples will be stored for a maximum of 
15 years, from the date of last subject last visit, after which they will be destroyed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further 
analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached.
An additional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA 
extraction replacing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be identifiable by the second, unique number only. This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated organization. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organizations working with the DNA).
The link between the subject enrollment/randomization code and the second number will be 
maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or 
designated organizations. The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for 
analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit 
and to trace samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent.
F 2.5
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory requiremen ts for the study, including this genetics 
research component, are outlined in Section 7of the protocol.
F 2.6 Informed Consent
The genetic component of this study is optional and the subject may participate in other 
components of the main study without particip ating in the genetic component. To participate 
in the genetic component of the study the subject must sign and date both the consent form for 
AstraZeneca Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 129 of 132 Template 18.0the main study and the genetic component of the study. Copies of both signed and dated 
consent forms must be given to the subject and the original filed at the study center. The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the subject understands that they ma y freely disc ontinue from the genetic aspect of the st udy at 
any time.
F 2.7
Subject Data Protection
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, 
any employer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law.
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the subject. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal identifi ers of a subject. For example, in the case of a 
medical emergency, a global safety physician or an investigator might know a subject’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also, regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
F 2.8
Data Management
Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca 
and/or designated organizations to analyze the samples.
The results from this genetic research may be reported in a separate report from the Clinical 
Study Report or published in scientific journals.
AstraZeneca and its designated organizations may share summary results (such as genetic 
differences from groups of i ndividuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other 
researchers, such as Hospitals, Academic Organization, or Health Insurance Companies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease. The researchers can only use this information for health-related research purposes. Researchers may see summary 
results but they will not be able to see i ndividual subject data or any personal identifiers.
Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data 
in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.
F 2.9
Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size
The number of subjects that will agree to participate in the genetic research is unknown. It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal statist ical evaluation or whether only descriptive s tatistics will be ge nerated. A Statist ical 
Analysis Plan for genetic research will be prepared where appropriate.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 130 of 132 Template 18.0Appendix G Classification of Topical Corticosteroids
Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are grouped into 7 classes based on vasoconstriction assays, 
with Class I TCSs the most potent and Class VII TCSs the least potent (Table G1) . If a TCS 
not included in the table below is desired, the investigator should contact the medical monitor to confirm classification. These groups may vary depending on the formulation and concentration and should be considered approximate. In general, ointments are more potent than creams or lotions. Potency is also increased when TCSs are used under occlusive dressings or in intertriginous areas.

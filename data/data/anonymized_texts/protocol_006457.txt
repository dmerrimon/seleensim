Protocol version 6.0 (23-Mar -2023 ) 
This amendment is considered to be non -substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union,1 because 
it neither significantly impacts the safety nor physical/mental integrity of participants nor the 
scien tific value of the study.  
Overall rationale for preparing protocol, version 6.0: 
The protocol has been updated  to correct the below errors detected , in addition to further changes 
shown below : 
Section # and name  Description of change  Brief rationale  
Section 1.3 – Flowchart – Phone 
contacts  Addition of a Flowchart for phone 
contacts  To clarify the procedures to be 
performed during phone contacts  
Section 2 Introduction  Sentence added to describe that i nsulin 
icodec is a recombinant protein produced  
using yeast.  
Detailed information about the insulin 
icodec molecule has been deleted.  PMDA requirement  
For alignment with phase 3b protocol . 
The information is not relevant for trial 
conduct  
Section 2.3 Benefit -rsik 
assessment  Text crossed  out was deleted as follows:  
The risks of IcoSema presented in this 
section are a combination of important 
and non -important risks for IcoSema and 
for the mono -components insulin icodec 
and semaglutide.  All risks for 
mono -components that have not been 
identif ied for IcoSema directly, are 
classified as potential risks for IcoSema, 
although these may be classified as 
identified risks for the mono -components. New risks from the mono -components 
are now evaluated using clinical data 
for IcoSema  
Section 2.3.1 Risk  assessment  The IcoSema IB is added  as reference for  
benefits and risks of insulin icodec and 
semaglutide instead of the IBs of the 
mono -components.    Alignment with updated IBs

Section # and name  Description of change  Brief rationale  
Section 4.1. Continuous Glucose 
Monitoring  Text crossed  out was deleted as follows:  
To evaluate the initial glycaemic control 
of participants switching from pre -trial 
insulin dose of 20 -80 units to randomized 
treatment, and to evaluate  the overall 
glycaemic control as specified by  The deleted text had been include d by 
mistake. This s tudy only has CGM 
period (at the end of study ) 
Section 4.3 Justification for dose  Text in italics  was added, and text crossed  
out was deleted as follows:  
The maximum dose and the ratio of 
IcoSema is based on the clinical findings 
[reference to IcoSema IB]  from the mono -
components insulin icodec4 and 
semaglutide s.c.6 Alignment with updated IBs  
Section 5.3.1 – Meals and 
dietary restrictions  Text in italic s was added as follows:  
Randomised treatment and other glucose 
lowering agents  should be withheld on the 
day of the fasting visit until blood  
sampling has been performed.  To clarify that participants should not 
take glucose lowering agents on the day 
of fasting visits until blood sampling 
has been performed  
Sections 5.4, 6.2, 6.3,  7.1.1, 7.2 , 
8, Appendix 12 Abbreviations  Replacement of IWRS by RTSM  To reflect the change in systems used 
in the study  
Section 8.2.2 – Physical 
Examinations  Text in italics  was added, and text crossed  
out was deleted as follows:    
From the body weight and height  
measured at V1 , the body mass index 
(BMI) should be calculated at V2  to 
evaluate inclusion criteria no. 7  To clarify that the BMI should be 
calculated using the weight measured at 
visit 1  
Section 8.3 Adverse events and 
other safety reporting  Addition of the clarifying note: “ All 
cerebrovascular events are to be reported 
and sent for adjudication, however the 
EAC will only confirm strokes”.  To clarify that the EAC will only 
confirm strokes  
Section 8.2.1. Dose , Appendix 8: 
Titration g uideline  In the description of collection of injection 
site “and insulin icodec ” is added and 
“should” has been changed to “must”.  eCRF correctly collects i njection site 
area collecte d in both arms, while 
protocol erroneously only described it 
for IcoSema. Injection site area in both 
arms is required for originally planned 
population PK analysis to assess a 
potential differential effect of injection 
region between IcoSema and the mono -
component  
Section 8.2.4. Eye examination  Text in italics  was added, and text crossed  
out was deleted as follows: For 
participants who discontinue randomised 
treatment, eye examination can be 
performed up to 2 weeks after the visit at 
week 52  visit 54A .  Clarification of visit number to 54A  
Appendix 2: Clinical laboratory 
tests Text and f ootnotes in italics  were  added to 
table 10.2:  
Hypersensitivity data will not be shared 
with investigators until after CSR 
finalisation.  To clarify which hypersensitivity  tests 
will be performed by which 
laboratories

c Samples collected from Chinese 
participants will be analysed by a central 
lab in China. Samples collected from 
participants in the rest of the world will be 
analysed by Novo Nordisk Måløv, 
Denmark  
d Samples will be analysed by Novo 
Nordisk Måløv, Denmark for all countries 
except China, where these tests will not be 
done (see Appendix 11, Section 10.11). 
e Samples collected from Chinese 
participants will be analysed in a special 
lab in China. Samples collected from 
participants in the rest of the world will be 
analysed by a special lab desi gnated by 
Novo Nordisk.  
Appendix 8. Titration guidance  Added text in italics :  
All participants should receive a loading 
dose at randomisation (V2), which 
consists of total daily basal insulin dose 
before randomisation x 7 + 50% of their 
total daily basal insulin dose x 7 Error in text, but calculations correct in 
table 10.5  
Appendi x 11: Country/Region 
specific requirements - China  Added text in italics :  
The following hypersensitivity analytes 
are not possible to be tested in China, see 
Appendix 2 (Section 10.2), and will not be 
included in the hypersensitivity case 
assessment:  
 Anti-human insulin IgE  
 Anti-insulin icodec IgE  
 Anti-semaglutide IgE  
The following hypersensitivity analytes 
will be tested by the Central lab in China:  
 Tryptase  
 Total IgE antibodies  
The following hypersensitivity analytes 
will be tested by special lab in China:  
 Anti-insulin icodec binding antibodies  
 Anti-semaglutide binding antibodies  To clearly reflect which 
hypersensitivity tests will be conducted 
in China due to local unavailability of 
some test and the impossibility of 
export ing samples outside China  
Appendix 11: Country/Region 
specific requirements - Japan  Text added to describe which 
contraceptive methods included in the 
protocol (Table 10 -3) have not been 
approved  in Japan.   PMDA requirement

 1 Protocol summary  
1.1 Synopsis  
This is an interventional, multi -national, multi -centre, randomised, 52 -week, open label, parallel 
group, treat -to-target, confirmatory study with two treatment arms.  
Rationale  
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of once  weekly IcoSema , which is a 
combination product of insulin icodec and semaglutide . IcoSema will be compared to  once weekly 
insulin icodec, both treatment arms with or without oral anti -diabetic drugs, in participants with  
type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin. The purpose is to show that there is 
an added benefit of the combination product compared to the once weekly insulin icodec mono -
component  according to regulatory guidelines on clinical development of fixed combination 
products . 
Overall, the results of the present study will be important for evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
IcoSema in daily basal insulin experienced participants with  type 2 diabetes when intensification is 
needed . Further more, once weekly IcoSema is developed to  provide a simple treatment regimen.  
Objectives, endpoints and estimand  
Primary objective  
To confirm superiority of once weekly IcoSema compared with once weekly insulin icodec both 
treatment arms with or without oral anti -diabetic drugs in terms of glycaemic control measured by 
change in HbA 1c from baseline after 52 weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately 
controlled with  daily basal insulin . 
Secondary objectives  
To confirm superiority of once weekly IcoSema compared to once weekly insulin icodec, both 
treatment arms  with or without OADs, in participants with T2D inadequately controlled with daily 
basal insulin in terms of:  
 Change in body weight from baseline after  52 weeks  
 Number of clinically significant hypoglycaemic (level  2) or severe hypoglycaemic (level  3) 
episodes during 52  weeks and the 5 week follow -up period

Estimand  
The primary estimand is described by the following 5 attributes:  
 Treatment condition: The effect of randomised treatment (titration of once w eekly IcoSema 
versus titration of once weekly insulin icodec) with or without oral anti -diabetic drugs , 
regardless of initiation of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic 
treatments for more than 2 weeks and adherence to randomised tr eatment  
 Population: type 2 diabetes  inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin  
 Endpoint: Change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 52  
 Remaining ICEs: None. The two intercurrent events are captured under treatment condition and 
handled as follows:  
 Initiat ion of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic treatments for 
more than 2 weeks by the treatment policy strategy  
 Discontinuation of randomised treatment for any reason by the treatment policy strategy  
 Population -level summary: Difference in mean changes from baseline  
Overall design  
The study duration is approximately 59 weeks and consists of:  
 an up to 2 weeks screening period  
 a 52-week treatment period  
 a 5-week follow -up period  
Treatment arms  and duration  
1290 participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive once weekly IcoSema or once weekly insulin 
icodec , both treatment arms  with or without oral anti -diabetic drug s. 
When discontinuing randomised treatment, the participant will be transferred to a suitable marketed 
product at the discretion of the investigator . 
Investigational medicinal products  
 IcoSema  700 units/mL + 2  mg/mL, subcutaneous, solution for injection , 1.5 mL pre -filled

 2 Introduction  
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterised by the presence of hyperglycaemia due to 
defective insulin secretion, insulin action or both. Chronic hyperglycaemia of diabetes mellitus is 
associated with significant long -term complications, particularly tissues damage and dysfunction or 
organ failure  - especially the kid ney, eye, and nerves.2 Diabetes is generally classified according to 
aetiological factors, where type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) constitutes the vast majority of 
cases. In the Internati onal Diabetes Federation’s Diabetes Atlas (2019), the estimated worldwide 
diabetes prevalence was 463 million, with a prediction that by 2045, the number of people  with 
diabetes will have increased to 700 million.3 
T2D is a progressive disease, and the need for treatment intensification over time can be covered in 
a simple setting by a titratable fixed ratio combin ation product as IcoSema. IcoSema is a  
combination product of insulin icodec and the glucagon -like peptide  1 (GLP -1) receptor agonist 
semaglutide, which is developed to provide an effective and convenient, once  weekly treatment 
regimen for people  with T2D.   
Insulin icodec is a novel long -acting insulin analogue which is under development (global phase 3a 
programme initiated during the fourth quarter of 2020) to safely cover the basal insulin 
requirements for a full week with a single  subcutaneous  (s.c.)  injection. Insulin icodec has a 
terminal half -life of approximately 196 hours . Insulin icodec is a recombinant protein produced 
using yeast.  
Semaglutide is a GLP -1 receptor ago nist with a half -life of 149 to 164 hours, suitable for once  
weekly s.c. administration.4 The long half -life was obtained by applyin g the fatty acid acylation 
technology that provides specific high -affinity albumin binding. Furthermore, semaglutide has full 
stability against DPP -4 degradation. Semaglutide exhibits GLP -1 receptor mediated effects, leading 
to lowering of glucose and decr eased appetite through physiologically relevant mechanisms. As a 
result, semaglutide provides strong glycaemic control and weight loss. In addition, the 
cardiovascular safety of semaglutide has been confirmed. The mechanism of action of semaglutide 
was cha racterized in extensive non -clinical and clinical stud ies.5, 6 Semaglutide (Ozempic®) is 
currently approved in more than 60 countries for the treatment of T 2D. In addition, semaglutide  is 
approved for use in combination with insulin .5 
IcoSema is expected to provide an effect on  HbA 1c reduction through actions on both fasting and 
prandial glycaemic control. IcoSema is also expected to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes  
and to provide  weight loss compared to basal insulin and basal -bolus insulin  treatment , and to show 
a comparable or better  gastroi ntestinal  adverse event  (AE) profile as  compared to semaglutide . 
2.1 Study rationale  
The present study  is a 52 -week, parallel study , with two treatment arms designed to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of once weekly IcoSema in comparison to  once weekly insulin icodec, both  
treatment arms  with or without oral anti -diabetic drugs ( OADs ), in participants  with T2D 
inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin. The purpose is to show that there is an added 
benefit of the combination product compared to the  once weekly insulin icodec mono -component 
according to regulatory guidelines on clinical development of fixed combination products .7

 Overall, the results of the present study  will be important for evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
IcoSema in daily basal insulin experience d participants with T2D when intensification is needed . 
Furthermore, once weekly IcoSema is developed to  provide a simple treatment regimen.   
2.2 Background  
Diabetes mellitus  
T2D is characterised by insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, increased hepatic glucose 
output due to glucagon dysregulation resulting in chronic hyperglycaemia.8 The pathogenesis is not 
fully understood but seems to be heterogeneous, involving environmental, lifestyle, and genetic 
factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin r esistance, impaired 
insulin secretion due to abnormal beta -cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver.9 
Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus  
The current treatme nt cascade recommended by the American Diabetes Association  and the 
European Association for the Study of Diabetes follows a stepwise approach comprising lifestyle 
changes in combination with pharmacological intervention.10 Metformin is recommended as initial 
therapy, followed by combination therapy with other OADs, GLP -1 receptor agonists and insulin as 
the disease progresses.10 
Despite the development of new treatments, a substantial proportion of people  with T2D fail to 
achieve the recommen ded glycaemic targets. This clinical inertia prolongs the duration of people s’ 
hyperglycaemia, which consequently puts them at an increased risk of diabetes -associated 
complications and reduced life expectancy. Specifically, there is an unmet medical need for 
products with the potential to improve clinical outcomes through reduced treatment burden, i.e. 
fewer injections, and increased treatment adherence and persistence11 compared to other treatment 
regimens requiring daily or several weekly injections.  
For people  with advanced T2D in need of improved fasting and prandial glycaemic control, 
combined treatment with a GLP -1 receptor agonist and a basal insulin can provide improved 
glycaemic outcomes.12 Experiences with fixed ratio combination products e.g. insulin 
degludec/liragl utide (Xultophy®) has shown improved treatment effect whilst reducing the side 
effects compared to the mono -components.13 However, market research has shown that  people  with 
diabetes would prefer fewer injec tions14 and increased flexibility15 than currently provided by once 
daily treatment . 
IcoSema  
IcoSema is a once weekly  injectable  fixed  ratio combination prod uct comprising the novel insulin 
icodec and the GLP -1 receptor agonist  semaglutide  and is developed for late stage treatment 
intensification for people  with advanced T2D. The development of IcoSema is based on learnings 
from other fixed ratio combination products e.g. insulin degludec/liraglutide (Xultophy®), showing 
that combination products  benefit from the complementary action s of both mono -components  on 
glycaemic control . Hence, I coSema benefits f rom both insulin  icodec  and the potent GLP -1 receptor 
agonist  semaglutide . IcoSema has been investigated in a clinical pharmacology  study 
(NN1535 -4359)  in participants  with T2D . Data from NN1535 -4359 has contributed to development 
of the IcoSema titration guidelines included in the p hase 3a development programme. A

Insulin icodec  
Insulin icodec is a novel long -acting insulin analogue  under development  which is designed for  s.c. 
administration with the aim of develop ing a safe once weekly injectable basal insulin treatment, 
with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 196 hours. Data from three completed 
phase  2 clinical studies  (NN1436 -4383, -4465 and -4466) showed that once weekly insulin icodec 
provided simi lar glucose lowering effects compared to once daily insulin glargine 100 units/mL . In 
addition, time in range was comparable or improved with once weekly insulin icodec compared to 
once daily insulin glargine  100 units/mL . Overall, once weekly insulin icod ec was well tolerated 
and no new safety issues related to insulin treatment were identified in the  phase 2 studies . A 
comprehensive review of results from the non -clinical and clinical studies of insulin icodec can be 
found in the current investigator’s brochure17 or any updates hereof.  
Study  population  
The study  population will consist of  participants  with T2D inadequately controlled with daily basal  
insulin . The study population  is further described in  Section 4.2. 
2.3 Benefit -risk assessment  
The main benefits and risks related to participation in the study are described in the below sections.  
The risks  of IcoSema  presented in this section are a combination of important and non -important  
risks for IcoSema and for the m ono-components insulin icodec and semaglutide.   
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events ( AEs) of IcoSema  may be found in the  current investigator’s brochure16 or

 2.3.1 Risk assessment  
Table  2-1 Risk assessment  
Risk of clinical significance  Summary of data/rationale for 
risk Mitigation strategy  
IcoSema  
Identified risk  
Gastrointestinal  AEs (Nausea,  
vomiting and diarrhoea)  Gastrointestinal AEs is a class risk 
for all GLP -1 receptor agonist  
products. The precise mechanism 
remains unclear but involve s a 
GLP -1 receptor -mediated activation 
and it is therefore considered a class 
risk for all GLP -1 receptor agonist  
products. In general, these reactions 
are mild or moderate in severity, of 
short duration, and dose dependent.   
In the phase 1 single dose study  
NN1535‑4359, more participants  
experienced gastrointestinal  AEs, 
predominantly nausea and vom iting, 
following administration of IcoSema 
compared to the mono -components.  
This was likely due to the relatively 
higher maximum concentration of 
semaglutide following IcoSema 
administration of 175 units  / 0.5 mg 
compared to separate dose 
administration of  0.5 mg 
semaglutide.  
Gastrointestinal  AEs have also been 
observed in non -clinical studies as 
well as the clinical studies with 
semaglutide. The most frequently 
reported AEs across the semaglutide 
clinical programmes were 
gastrointestinal  AEs (e.g., nausea,  
vomiting and diarrhoea).   
 To mitigate the risk of 
gastrointestinal AEs , once weekly  
IcoSema will be initiated at  a low 
starting dos e of 40 dose steps 
(equivalent to 40 units of insulin 
icodec and 0.114 mg of semaglutide , 
i.e. half the  semaglutide  starting dose  
of 0.25 mg ) and titrated  with 
±10 dose steps (equivalent to 
10 units of insulin icodec and 
0.029  mg of semaglutide)  to a 
maximum dose of 350 dose steps 
(equivalent to 350 units of insulin 
icodec and 1 mg of semaglutide).  
Participants  who exp erience  
vomiting and /or diarrhoea will be 
instructed  to maintain adequate fluid 
intake  to compensate for the  volume 
depletion.  
Identified risk  
Hypoglycaemia  
 Hypoglycaemia is an anticipated  
undesirable effect related to the  
pharmacological mechanism of  
insulin.  
In the phase 1  single dose study 
NN1535‑4359 hypoglycaemic 
episodes were reported in ~33% 
participants in the IcoSema arm and 
32% of the participants in the insulin 
icodec arm. No severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes were 
reported. Most hypoglycaemic 
episodes were asymptomatic .  
Hypoglycaemia has been observed 
in clinical studies with insulin 
icodec. There is a low risk of 
hypoglycaemic episodes when 
semaglutide is used as 
mono -therapy.  Participants with known 
hypoglycaemic unawareness will be 
excluded from the study . 
Frequent blood glucose 
measurements are encouraged 
throughout drug exposure by means 
of a blood glucose (BG)  meter. The 
participant will receive written 
information describing 
hypoglycaemic symptoms and how 
to manage low blood glucose level s. 
Prevention or worsening of 
hypoglycaemia will be sought by 
early detection and administration of 
carbohydrates and medical treatment, 
if needed.  
When adjusting IcoSema  dose, 
recommended titration schemes 
should be followed.  
Potential risk:  
Hypersensitivity  As with all protein -based drugs, 
treatment with IcoSema may evoke 
allergic reactions, including severe As a precaution, participants with 
suspected hypersensitivity to

systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
and angioedema.  
One non -serious type -1 
drug-induced hypersensitivity 
reaction was reported in the IcoSema  
phase 1  single dose  study NN1535 -
4359.  
No systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions have been observed in 
clinical studies with insulin icodec.  
Hypersensitivity is an adverse 
reaction identified in phase 3a 
studies for semaglutide in 
participants with T2D.  randomised treatment will not be 
enrolled in this study.  
Participants and investigators will be 
instructed about the signs and 
symptoms of allergic reactions and 
instructed to contact t he site 
immediately in case of signs of 
hypersensitivity.  
 
 
Potential risk:  
Serious allergic reactions  As with all protein -based drugs, 
treatment with IcoSema may evoke 
allergic reactions, including severe 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
and angioedema.  
No serious allergic reactions have 
been observed with IcoSema in the 
phase 1  single dose  study 
NN153 5-4359 . 
No systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions have been observed in 
studies with insulin icodec.  
Events of allergic reactions 
(generally mild and non -serious) 
have been reported in participants 
with T2D treated with semaglutide. 
Few events of anaphylacti c reaction 
were reported; however, none of 
these events were related to the 
treatment with semaglutide. Events 
of angioedema were also reported 
from post marketing sources.  As a precaution, participants with 
suspected hypersensitivity to  
randomised treatme nt will not be 
enrolled in this study.  
Participants and investigators will be 
instructed about the signs and 
symptoms of allergic reactions and 
instructed to contact the site 
immediately in case of signs of 
hypersensitivity.  
 
 
Potential risk:  
Medication  error due to potential 
mix-up  Despite the open -label study design, 
medication error is still an applicable  
risk for participants treated with 
multiple insulins. Medication errors 
can have clinical consequences such 
as hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia.  
No information is available from 
completed clinical studies with 
IcoSema. Very few medication 
errors have been observed in the 
completed clinical studies with 
insulin icodec, none associated with  
AEs. Participants will be instructed to 
visually verify the dialled  units on 
the dose counter of the pen. In 
studies involving different pens, 
participants must be instructed to 
always check the pen label before 
each injection to avoid  potential  
mix-ups. 
 
Potential risk:  
Injection site reactions  Injection site reactions may occur 
with all injectable peptide -based 
treatments.  
In the phase 1  single dose study  
NN1535 -4359 with IcoSema, one 
event of injection site haematoma 
was reported after administration of 
the mono -component semaglutide.  Participants will be instructed to 
monitor for signs and symptoms of 
injection site reactions. Participants 
should be instructed to contact the 
site immediately in case of signs of 
worsening of injection site reactions 
for further action.

 Risk of clinical significance  Summary of data/rationale for 
risk Mitigation strategy  
Injectio n site reactions were 
observed in participants with T2D 
treated with insulin  icodec .  
In the studies with semaglutide s.c. 
for T2D, injection site reactions 
were reported by a low 
(approximately 1%) proportion of 
participants with semaglutide and 
were not recurrent in those 
individuals.  Participants will be instructed on the 
most appropriate injection 
techniques. Recommendations on 
rotation of the site of injection are 
included in Table  6-1. 
Potential risk  
Diabetic retinopathy complications  
 The risk of diabetic retinopathy 
complications has been observed in  
T2D treated with semaglutide in 
clinical studies.  
In a 2 -year clinical study with. 
semaglutide s.c (NN9535 -3744) 
involving 3,297 participant s with 
T2D,  high cardio vascular risk, long 
duration of diabetes and poorly 
controlled blood glucose, 
EAC -confirmed events of diabetic 
retinopathy complications occur red 
in more participants  treated with 
semaglutide s.c  (3.0%)  compared to 
placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk 
increase for diabetic retinopathy 
complications was larger among 
participants  with a history of diabetic 
retinopathy at baseline. In the 
participants  who did not have a 
documented history of diabetic 
retinopathy the number of events 
was similar for semaglutide s.c  and 
placebo. In the other clinical  studies 
up to 1 year involving 4,807 
participants  with T2D, AEs related 
to diabetic retinopathy were repo rted 
in similar proportions of participants  
treated with semaglutide s.c  (1.7%) 
and comparators (2.0%).  Rapid improvement in glucose 
control has been associated with a 
temporary worsening of diabetic 
retinopathy, but other mechanisms 
cannot be excluded. Lo ng-term 
glycaemic control decreases the risk 
of diabetic retinopathy. These 
participants should be monitored 
closely and treated according to 
clinical guidelines.  
Participants will have an eye 
examination performed at baseline 
and at week 52 . Diagnostic artificial 
intelligence algorithms may possibly 
be used as screening tool. If 
diagnostic artificial intelligence 
algorithms are used and in case of 
changes indicated by the algorithm, 
an additional eye examination must 
be performed , see section  8.2.4 . 
Uncontrolled and potentially 
unstable diabetic retinopathy or 
maculopathy is an exclusion criterion 
in this study .  
Potential risk:  
Acute pancreatitis  Acute pancreatitis has been observed 
with the use of GLP -1 receptor 
agonist s. In the completed phase 3 
studies with semaglutide s.c. and 
oral semaglutide, both the event rate 
and the proportion of participants 
experiencing confirmed pan creatitis 
were similar with semaglutide and 
comparator. Few events were 
confirmed; the events occurred 
throughout the study periods and the 
overall rates were similar to the rates 
reported in background populations.  Participants should be informed of 
the c haracteristic symptoms of acute 
pancreatitis and if pancreatitis is 
suspected, IcoSema should be 
discontinued. If confirmed, IcoSema  
should not be restarted.

 Risk of clinical significance  Summary of data/rationale for 
risk Mitigation strategy  
Potential risk:  
Neoplasms (malignant and non -
malignant)  Participants with T2D, as well as 
participants with overweight or 
obesity, have an increased risk of 
certain types of cancer. There is no 
evidence from clinical studies that 
GLP -1-based therapies increase the 
risk of neoplasms. However, in the 
semaglutide s.c. as well as oral 
semaglutide p hase 3a studies, the 
proportion of participants with 
neoplasms (malignant and non -
malignant) were slightly higher with 
semaglutide than with comparator. 
The number of participants exposed 
to semaglutide s.c. or oral 
semaglutide for a longer period is 
consi dered insufficient for a 
thorough assessment of the risk of 
neoplasms.  
 Participants with presence or history 
of malignant neoplasm within 
5 years prior to the day of screening 
will not be enrolled in this study. 
Basal and squamous cell skin cancer 
and any  carcinoma in -situ is allowed.  
 
 
Potential risk:  
Pancreatic cancer  Participants with T2D have an 
increased risk of certain types of 
cancer such as pancreatic cancer. 
There is currently no support from 
non-clinical studies, clinical studies 
or post -marketing data that GLP -1 
based therapies increase the risk of 
pancreatic c ancer. However, 
pancreatic cancer has been classified 
as a potential class risk for all 
marketed GLP -1 receptor agonist s 
by regulatory agencies. There is no 
indication of an increased relative 
risk in the semaglutide treatment 
groups vs. comparator, includ ing 
placebo. The rates of EAC -
confirmed events of pancreatic 
cancer were consistently low across 
studies.  Participants with history of 
malignant neoplasm within 5 years 
prior to the day of screening will not 
be enrolled in this study.  
 
Potential risk:  
Medullary thyroid cancer  Thyroid C -cell tumours were seen in 
mouse and rat carcinogenicity 
studies after daily exposure to 
semaglutide for 2 years. The rodent 
C-cell tumours are caused by a non -
genotoxic, specific GLP -1 receptor 
mediated mechanism to which 
rodents are particularly sensitive. No 
C-cell tumours were observed in 
monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up 
to 52 -fold above the clinical plasma 
exposure at 14 mg/day. The GLP -1 
receptor is not expressed in the 
normal human thyroid, and therefore 
the clinica l relevance of the findings 
is considered to be low.  Exclusion criteria related to personal 
or first -degree relative(s) history of 
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 
or medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Study procedures  
Risk of COVID -19 infection in  
relation to participation in study  Participants  may be exposed to the 
risk of COVID -19 transmission and 
infection in relation to site visits if 
an outbreak is ongoing in the given 
country .  
 
 The risk of COVID -19 transmission 
in relation to site visits is  overall 
considered to be low, however this 
may vary between geographical 
areas.  
To minimize the risk as much as 
possible, the following measures 
have been taken:  
 Cautious participant 
recruitment planning ensures 
controlled pa rticipant 
enrolment in countri es where 
the COVID -19 pandemic is 
evaluated to be sufficiently 
under control, and at sites 
where health care resources are 
evaluated to be adequate . 
 Study procedures including the 
number and frequency of study 
procedures and assessments 
have been critically evaluated 
to limit the number of on -site 
visits to the extent possible. 
Remo te visits can be performed 
either by phone or by video call 
depending on  the preference of 
the participant and the 
investigator.   
 Guidance is provided to site 
staff to r equest that on -site 
visits are planned to be as short 
as possible. Physical contact 
between pa rticipants and site 
staff will be limited to the 
extent possible, and protective 
measures will be implemented 
(describe e.g. use of masks, 
sanitizers, no 
aerosol -generating procedures 
etc.). 
 Please refer to Appendix 10 
(Section 10.10 ) which lists the 
additional actions to be taken 
in case a site or country are 
locked down and it is not 
possible for participants to visit 
the site.  
Other  
Device m edication error  If the pen-injector  is damaged or 
used differently than described in the 
directions for use  a risk of overdose 
or underdose of randomised 
treatment  exists. This may cause 
hypoglycaemia  due to overdose or 
hyper glycaemia  due to underdose.  Training  in injections and use of 
devices  and guidance materials for 
investigator, site staff and 
participants will be provided .

Pregnancy and fertility.  Studies  with insulin icodec  in rats 
have shown no effects on fertility, 
embryo -foetal survival or on major 
and minor foetal abnormalities. In an 
embryo -foetal development study in 
rabbits, no effect on major and minor 
foetal visceral and skeletal  
abnormalities at any dose levels was 
observed. Consequently, insulin 
icodec is categorised as ‘unlikely 
risk of huma n 
teratogenicity/ fetotoxicity . 
Studies in  animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity in studies with 
semaglutide. There are limited data 
from the use of semaglutide in 
pregnant women.  The randomised treatment should not 
be used during pregnancy. Women 
of childbearing potential are required 
to use highly effective contraceptive 
methods when participating in the 
study , see Appendix 4  (Section  10.4, 
Table  10-3). If a participant wishes 
to become pregnant, or pregnancy 
occurs, the randomised treatment 
should be discontinued , please refer 
to Section 8.3.5  for further 
guidance). The effect of IcoSema on 
fertility in humans is unknown.  
 
Risk assessment has been conducted for the PDS290 pen-injector for IcoSema in accordance with 
ISO 14971:2019 when using the PDS290 pen -injector in people with T2D. All identified risks  (i.e. 
injection site reaction s, see Table  2-1) associated with using the PDS290 pen -injector for IcoSema 
according to the clinical procedures specified in this protocol have been reduced as far as possible 
and are acceptable, taking into account the current state of the art. The use of the PDS290 
pen-injector for IcoSema, in this study is therefore considered to be of non -significant risk.  
2.3.2 Benefit assessment  
Based on experience from the  mono -components and on the learnings from insulin 
degludec/liraglutide as described in the introduction, we expect at positive benefit  of the 
combination product IcoSema . This benefit assessment section is based on clinical data available 
for the mono -components insulin icodec and semaglutide in the T2D population.  
Insulin icodec is currently in development and has been shown to have a long and stable 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile supporting a once weekly treatment. Market 
research has shown that p eople  with diabetes mellitus would prefer fe wer injections and greater 
flexibility than those provided by the current once daily treatment  regiment.14 Therefore, the 
compliance and quality of life are expected to increase by introducing a once weekly basal insulin 
treatment.

 Clinical data on once weekly semaglutide have demonstrated superior glycaemic control, superior 
reductions in body weight versus placebo and active  comparators, and reduced cardiovascular risk 
compared to placebo in participants with T2D. Further, once weekly dosing offers flexibility and 
fewer injections as opposed to current therapy.  
Based on these data, the combination of semaglutide and insulin icodec in a once weekly fixed ratio 
combination product is expected to provide superior efficacy on HbA 1c lowering compared to the 
mono -components.   
IcoSema is also expected to provide weight loss and to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes 
compared to basal insulin.  
For all participants, the anticipated benefits include improved glycaemic control. To ensure all 
participants receive adequate treatment, investigators are encouraged to optimise glycaemic control  
every week  throughout the study  in accordance with the titration guidelines, see Appendix 8 
(Section 10.8). Participants will receive intense medical care by means of weekly contact with the 
sites.  
2.3.3 Overall benefit -risk conclusion  
No new significant safety information that changes the current benefit -risk profile of IcoSema 
emerged from the completed phase 1 sing le dose  IcoSema study  NN1535 -4359 or safety profile 
generated from clinical and non -clinical development programme for the mono -components.  
Necessary precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the study in 
order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the study . 
IcoSema is expected to provide an effect on HbA 1c reduction through actions on both fasting and 
prandial glycaemic control. IcoSema is also expected to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes  
and to provide  weight loss compared to basal insulin and basal -bolus insulin  treatment , and to show 
a comparable or better gastrointestinal AE  profile as compared to semaglutide.  
Considering the measures taken to minimise risk to participants, the potential risks identified in 
association with IcoSema  are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to p eople  
with T2D. 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefi ts and risks of IcoSema can be

3.3 Primary estimand  
The primary clinical question of interest  
What is the treatment effect between once weekly IcoSema and once weekly insulin icodec in 
change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 52 in participants  with T2D inadequately controlled with 
daily basal insulin regardless of discontinuation  of randomised treatment  for any reason and 
regardless of initiation of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic treatments 
for more than 2 weeks?  
The primary estimand is described by the following 5 attributes : 
 Treatment condition: The effect of randomised treatment (titration of once weekly IcoSema 
versus titration of once weekly insulin icodec) with or without OAD(s), regardless of initiation 
of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic treatments for more than 2 
weeks and adherence to randomised treatment  
 Population: T2D inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin  
 Endpoint: Change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 52  
 Remaining ICEs: None. The two intercurrent events are captured under treatment condition and 
handled as follows:  
 Initiation of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic treatments for 
more than 2 weeks by the treatment policy strategy

  Discontinuation of randomised treatment for any reason by the treatment policy strategy  
 Population -level summary: Difference in mean changes from baseline  
The rationale for the primary estimand is that this estimand c aptures both the efficacy and safety of 
the randomised treatment with and without additional anti -diabetic/glucose -lowering medication 
and thus aims at reflecting clinical practice . 
3.3.1 Secondary estimands  
The secondary clinical question of interest related to  secondary objective regarding body 
weight  
What is the treatment effect between once weekly IcoSema and once weekly insulin icodec in 
change in body weight  from baseline to week 52 in participants  with T2D inadequately controlled 
with daily basal insulin r egardless of discontinuation  of randomised treatment  for any reason and 
regardless of initiation of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic treatments 
for more than 2 weeks?  
The estimand addressing this secondary clinical question of interest and the rational e is the same as 
for the primary estimand with the endpoint attribute specified as: change in body weight from 
baseline to week 52.  
The secondary clinical question of interest related to secondary objective regarding number of 
clinically significant hypoglycaemic episodes  (level 2) or severe hypoglycaemic episodes 
(level  3) 
What is the treatment effect between once weekly IcoSema and once weekly insulin icodec on 
number of clinically significant hypoglycaemic (level 2) or severe hy poglycaemic (level 3) episodes 
during the time that participants  are considered exposed to randomised treatment in participants  
with T2D inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin regardless of initiation of non -randomised 
insulin treatment or additi onal anti -diabetic treatments, had all participants  adhered to randomised 
treatment until week 52?  
The secondary estimand addressing this clinical question of interest is described by the following 5 
attributes : 
 Treatment condition: The effect of randomised treatment (titration of once weekly IcoSema 
versus titration of once weekly insulin icodec) with or without OAD(s), regardless of initiation 
of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic treatments for more than 2 
weeks and had all participants  adhered to randomised treatment  
 Population: T2D inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin  
 Endpoint: Number of clinically significant hypoglycaemic (level 2) or severe hypoglycaemic 
(level 3) episodes during 52 weeks and the 5 week  follow -up period  
 Remaining ICEs: None. The two intercurrent events are captured under treatment condition and 
handled as follows:  
 Initiation of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic treatments for 
more than 2 weeks by the treatment policy strategy  
 Discontinuation of randomised treatment for any reason by the hypothetical strategy

  Population -level summary: Rate ratio  
Rationale for the secondary estimand: The estimand reflects the interpretation of the effect of 
randomised treatment with and without additional anti -diabetic/glucose -lowering medication 
without the confounding effect of discontinuation of randomised treatment. This interpretation is 
considered to be the most relevant interpretation for clinical practice and in alignment  with the 
evaluation of other safety parameters included in the study . In addition, collection of 
hypoglycaemic episode data after discontinuation of randomised treatment (beyond the standard 
5 week follow -up period) will require operational measures that will increase the study  burden on 
participants . This could lead to increased withdrawal rates and missing assessments on the primary 
endpoint jeopardising the primary objective of this study .

 4 Study  design  
4.1 Overall design  
This is an interventional, multi -national, multi -centre, randomised, 52-week, open label, parallel 
group, treat -to-target confirmatory study  with two treatment arms . The study investigat es the 
efficacy and safety of treatment with once weekly IcoSema compared to once weekly insulin 
icodec , both treatment arms  with or without OADs, in participants  with T2D inadequately 
controlled with daily basal insulin.  
The study  duration is approximately 59 weeks an d consists of:  
 an up to 2 weeks screening period  
 a 52-week treatment period  
 a 5-week follow -up period  
The study includes a screening visit (V1) to assess participant ’s eligibility. After screening, all 
eligible participants  will be randomised (1:1) at visit 2 (V2). The overall study design and visit 
schedule are outlined in  Figure  4-1 and the  study  flowchart (Section  1.2), respectively .  
Figure  4-1 Study design  
 
1290 p articipant s will be randomised (1:1) to receive once weekly IcoSema or once weekly insulin 
icodec . With the ex ception of  sulfonylureas, glinides and DPP -4 inhibitors that must be 
discontinued at randomisation (V2), t he dose and dosing frequency of any pre -study  OADs  should 
not be changed during the study , unless due to safety concerns.  
During the study, participants will measure daily  self-measured plasma glucose ( SMPG ). The 
SMPG measurements wil l be evaluated by the investigator at the weekly contact  either a s site visits, 
by phone or video call. At the weekly contacts , the dosing will be adjusted in accordance with the 
participant’s needs and safety , see also titration guideline s Appendix 8 (Section 10.8). However, it 
is always up to the discretion of the investigator to assess participant’s individual needs and safety 
in acco rdance with local standard of care.  
After the 52 weeks of treatment , participant s will come in for  visit V54, where data for the primary 
endpoint  will be collected. The visit at week 52  (V54) will be one week after the last dose of once 
weekly IcoSema or once weekly insulin icodec . After the 52 weeks of treatment participant s will be 
transferred to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator. See also titration 
guideline, Appendix 8 (Section 10.8).

 The treatment period is followed by a 5 -week  follow -up period  to ensure safety data collection. 
During the follow -up period, two follow -up visits (V55 and V56) will be performed, 2 and 5 weeks 
after the  visit at week  52 (V54) , respectively. Hence , the last follow -up vis it (V56) will take place  
6 weeks after the last dose of once weekly IcoSema or once weekly insulin icodec.  The last follow -
up visit  (V56)  is scheduled to allow for appropriate wash -out of randomised treatment , following at 
least 5 half -lives of once weekly IcoSema or once weekly insulin icodec . 
To  evaluate the overall glycaemic control  as specified by the endpoints (see Section 3.2.2.2 ), 
participants will have continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles collected, as specified by the 
flowchart (Section 1.2). The CGM will be blinded for both participants and investigators.  
In case of persistent and unacceptable hyperglycaemia as judged by the investigator based on the 
daily SMPGs, and in accordance with local standard of care , treatment with non -randomised insulin 
(basal or bolus) limited to up to 14 consecutive days can be considered to be added to the 
randomised treatment at the discretion of the investigator to safeguard the participants. Initiation of 
new anti -diabetic medication and any changes hereto must be recorded on the concomitant 
medication form in the eCRF.  
Event  adjudication will be performed for acute coronary syndrome events (acute myocardial 
infarction and unstable angina pectoris requiring hospitalisation), cerebrovascular events (stroke 
and transient ischemic attack), heart failure (requiring hospitalisation  and urgent heart failure visit) 
and all -cause death. All AEs will be collected from visit 2  and recorded from visit 3. 
Overall, the measures taken to ensure pa rticipant ’s safety, includes weekly contacts with site staff, a 
5-week follow -up period, trainin g of investigators and other site staff, safety surveillance including 
event adjudication and titration surveillance. In addition, in accordance with GCP, it is the 
investigators responsibility to assess participant's safety and at their discretion act acc ordingly.  
4.2 Scientific rationale for study design  
The study  is designed in alignment with the estimands ( Section  3) to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of once weekly IcoSema compared to once weekly insulin icodec during 52 weeks.  
In order to confirm the superiority of the fixed ratio combination of IcoSema to its insulin 
mono -component, once weekly insulin icodec is the  comparator. The treatment arms will be open 
label in order to avoid the risk of pen -mix-up in a double -blind, double dummy study , as the 
initiation and titration doses of IcoSema and insulin icodec  differ  – specifically  in terms of no 
loading dose /loading dose, respectively , see Appendix 8 (Section 10.8). Blinding of the study  would 
increase the treatment complexity and hence increase the burden on the  participant s. Further, the 
maximum  allowed weekly dose of IcoSema will be 350 dose steps (e quivalent to 350 units insulin 
icodec and 1 mg semaglutide) while there is no maximum allowed weekly dose of insulin icodec.  
The treatment duration of 52 weeks is evaluated to be adequate for assessing efficacy on glycaemic 
control as well as safety. This duration will also ensure sufficient time to reach the maintenance 
dose of IcoSema for the  broad study  population and allow adequate time in maintenance phase. The 
treat-to-target approach has been chosen to ensure optimal titration of both treatment arms based on 
SMPG values with the aim of improving HbA 1c in the treatment period.

 The evaluation of time in range will be based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles. To 
avoid influence on titration and the glycaemic control the CGM data will be bli nded for both 
participants  and investigator.  
Participant s entering  the study  will be inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin with or 
without OADs ensuring a study  population representative of a broad and advanced T2D population.  
Risk of hypoglycaemia increases when insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas and glinides are 
used in association with insulin and combination injectable anti -diabetic therapy .10, 18 Hence, to 
minimise the risk, sulfonylureas  and glinides are discontinued at randomi sation  (V2) . DPP -4 
inhibitors must likewise be discontinued since the combined use of a GLP -1 receptor agonist  
(semaglutide component of IcoSema) and a DPP -4 inhibitor is no t currently recommended .19 
To safeguard participant s, the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this study  will limit the 
study  population to participant s not suffering from advanced underlying diseases other than T2D 
and related diseases. This is to avoid compromising the safety of the participant s, and to strengthen 
the conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of IcoSema.  
For more information on the study population, see the inclusion and exclusion criteria, Sections 5.1 
and 5.2, respectively.  
4.3 Justification for dose  
The IcoSema  pen is developed  with one ratio and one titration  algorithm  for the phase 3a 
programme  in order to simplify the treatment regiments for patients and physicians.  
Once weekly IcoSema will  be switched from  the pre-study  daily basal insulin . IcoSema will be 
initiated at 40 dose steps (equivalent to 40  units of insulin icodec and 0.114 mg of semaglutide) , and 
titrated to target  according to the principles outlined in the titration guideline in Appendix 8 
(Section 10.8).  
The starting dose of 40 dose steps  (equivalent to 40 units of insulin icodec and 0.114 mg of 
semaglutide) is selected based on pharmacokinetics ( PK) findings from the development 
programme of IcoSema. The combin ation of the starting dose and  the titration algorithm of ±10 
dose step increme nts (equivalent to 10 units of insulin icodec and 0.029 mg of semaglutide) is 
considered  to be safe , due to the combined action of the two mono -components on both fasting  and 
prandial glycaemic control . Furthermore, the selected starting dose and titration  algori thm are 
expected to ensur e a comparable or better  gastrointestinal adverse event (AE) profile as compared 
to semaglutide  s.c.  
The maximum dose of 350 dose steps is equivalent to 350 units insulin icodec and 1 mg 
semaglutide , which is the currently  approved  maximum dose for semaglutide s.c. in treatment of 
T2D (as of 21 June 2021) .5,6 The maximum dose and the ratio of  IcoSema is based on the clinical 
findings16 and learnings from the once daily fixed ratio combination product , insulin 
degludec/liraglutide (Xultophy®).13 The ratio is selected with the focus on balancing the benefits  
from semaglutide and the expected durability of treatment with  the insulin comp onent. Providing 
350 units of insulin icodec to 1 mg of semaglutide, is expected to meet the clinical needs for the 
majority of the target population , while their safety is also ensured .

 Once weekly insulin icodec will be  switched from the pre -study  daily basal insulin , and initiated 
according to the principles outlined in the titration guideline in Appendix  8 (Section 10.8). A 50% 
loading dose will be applied to avoid glycaemic deterioration  during the first few weeks of 
treatment . No safety concerns have been identified in  subjects  with T2D , including vulnerable 
subjects,  using a loading dose when initiating insulin icodec ( trial NN1436 -4466 ). 
After randomisation, participant s should start once weekly injections of IcoSema or insulin icodec  
on the same day as randomisation. Due to the long half -life of the IcoSema and insulin icodec , the 
last once weekly injections must be taken 51 weeks after randomisation.

10.8).  
Guidance on missed doses can be found in the titration guideline in Appendix 8 (Section  10.8).  
4.4 End of study definition  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study

A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all periods of the 
study including  the visit at week 52 (V54) and the last follow -up visit (V56) . 
The primary endpoint is evaluated at the visit at week 52 (V54) . The primary completion date is 
defined as the date of visit  at week 52 (V54) on which the last participant in the clin ical study has 
an assessment for the primary endpoint. If the last participant is withdrawn early  from the study , the 
primary completion date  is considered the date when the  second -to-last participant complete s the 
visit at week 52 ( visit 54).

5.3 Lifestyle considerations  
5.3.1 Meals and di etary restrictions  
The participant s should be fasting when attending some of the visits, see flowchart (Section  1.2). 
Fasting is defined as at least eight  hours without food and drink intake, except for water and other 
prescribed medication. Randomised treatment  and other glucose lowering agents should be withheld 
on the day of the fasting visit until blood sampling ha s been performed. Any other prescr ibed 
medication should be taken as usual. If the participant  attends a fasting visit in a non -fasting state, 
the blood sampling procedures  and weight measurements  should be re -scheduled.   
5.3.2 Caffeine, alcohol and tobacco  
Tobacco use is defined as smoking at l east one cigarette or equivalent daily.  
5.4 Screen failures  
A screen failure occurs when a participant who consents to participate in the clinical study is not 
subsequently eligible for participation according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A minimal set  
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants 
to meet requirements from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes informed consent 
date, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria.  
A screen failure session must be made in the  Randomisation and Trial Supply Management  system 
(RTSM) . 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study may not be rescreened.  If the 
participant has failed one of the inclus ion criteria or fulfilled one of the exclusion criteria related to 
laboratory parameters, re -sampling is not allowed. However, in case of technical issues (e.g., 
haemolysed or lost  sample ), re-sampling is allowed for the affected parameter(s).

 6 Study interventions and concomitant therapy  
Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or 
medical device(s) int ended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol.  
Study intervention s comprise IcoSema, insulin icodec, and OADs . BG meter and CGM  are not 
considered study intervention s. 
Trial product s comprise investigational medicinal products (IMPs), including placebo and 
comparators, non -investigational  medicinal products (NIMPs) and/or investigational medical 
devices.  
Trial products consist of IcoSema  and insulin icodec . OADs  are NIMPs but not cons idered trial 
products in this protocol . 
Randomised treatment consists  of IcoSema and insulin icodec . Hence randomised treatment and 
IMPs  are covering the same . 
Trial product s and randomised treatment  consist  of IcoSema and insulin icodec . Randomised 
treatment will be used  throughout the protocol while trial products is used when addressing product  
accountability.  
6.1 Study interventions administered  
Training in the pen -injectors is the responsibility of the investigator or a delegate and must be 
repeated during the study  at regular intervals , as specified in the flowchart (see Section 1.2.) in 
order to ensure correct use of the pen -injector. The following documents must be provided to the 
participants:  
IcoSema: directions for use  
Insulin i codec: directions for use

Non-investigational medicinal products (NIMP)  
After randomisation participants should continue their pre -study OADs  (see list of allowed OADs 
in Section 5.1) throughout the entire study except for treatment with sulfonylureas, glinides and 
DPP-4 inhibitors that must be discontinued at randomisation. The OADs should be maintained at 
the stable, pre -study dose and at the same frequency during the entire treatment period unless due to 
safety concerns, which will be assessed at the discretion of the investigator. Combination products 
containing  either  sulfonylureas, glinides or DPP -4 inhibitors must al so be discontinued, while the 
residual anti -diabetic mono -component of the combination product should in general be maintained 
at the pre -study dose throughout the study similar to other OADs.  If the pre -study dose of the 
residual anti -diabetic medication is not available, the pa rticipant  should increase the dose to the next 
available dose.

Only participants enrolled in the study may use randomised treatment  and only delegated site staff 
may supply randomised treatment . Each site will be supplied with sufficient  randomised treatment 
for the study on an ongoing basis according to recruitment and randomisation.  
The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all trial products received, and that any discrepancies are reported and 
resolved before use of the trial products.  
All trial products  must be stored in a secure, controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area 
in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
delegated site staff.

 The investigator must inform Novo Nordisk immediately if any trial product has been stored outside 
specified conditions.  The trial product must not be dispensed to any participant before it has been 
evaluated and approved for further use by Novo Nordisk. Additional details regarding handling of 
temperature devia tions can be found in the Trial Materials Manual . 
The investigator or designee is responsible for trial product accountability and record maintenance 
(i.e., receipt, accountability and final disposition records).  Drug accountability should be performed 
in the RTSM . 
The investigator or designee must instruct the participant  to return all IMPs (both used and not 
used)  at the next dispensing visit.  
The investigator or designee must instruct the participant on how to manage and record  the in -use 
time of the dis pensed products.  The in -use time can be found in the Trial Materials Manual . 
 
Destruction of trial products can be performed on an ongoing basis and will be done according to 
local procedures after accountability is finalised by the site and reconciled by the monitor.  
All returned (used or un -used),  expired or damaged trial products (for technical complaint samples, 
see Appendix  5 [Section  10.5]) must be stored separately from non -allocated trial products. No 
temperature monitoring is required.  
Non-allocated trial products, including expired or damaged products, must be accounted as unused, 
at the latest at closure of the site.  
Acceptable temperature ranges and conditions for storage and handling of each trial product when  
not in use and when in use are described in the Trial Material s Manual and trial product label.  
Each single pen should be accounted  for. 
6.3 Measures to minimise bias: Randomisation and blinding  
All participants will be screened and centrally randomised  using an RTSM  and assigned to the next 
available treatment according to the randomisation  schedule. Trial product will  be allocated by the 
RTSM  and dispensed by the investigator at the study visits summarised  in the flowchart  
(Section  1.2). 
This is an open -label study; however, the specific trial products for a participant will be assigned 
using an RTSM . The site will access the RTSM  before the start of trial product administra tion for 
each participant.  Potential bias will be reduced by central randomisation  and adjudication . 
6.4 Drug treatment compliance  
Throughout the study, the investigator will remind the participants to follow the study procedures 
and requirements to encourage participant compliance.

 When participants self -administer trial product at home, compliance with trial product 
administration will be assessed, and the assessment documented in source documents at each visit 
where information is available. If any suspicion  of non -compliance arises, the site must enter into a 
dialogue with the participant, re -emphasizing the importance of compliance and uncover barriers to 
compliance. This dialogue must be documented. Compliance will be assessed by cross checking the 
followi ng sources and comparing these to the expected use:  
 Drug accountability information  
 Review of eDiaries including SMPG profiles, dosing  and hypoglycaemia reporting  
 Evaluating glycaemic control and adherence to the visit schedule  
6.5 Dose modification  
Doses are adjusted according to blood/plasma glucose values as described in Appendix  8 
(Section  10.8)  
6.6 Continued access to randomised treatment after end of study  
Randomised treatment will not be accessible after end of study.  When discontinuing  randomised 
treatment , the participant should be transferred to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of 
the investigator , please see the titration guideline  in Appendix 8 (Section 10.8). The medication 
should be recorded in the c oncomitant medication form, as described in Section 6.8.  
6.7 Treatment of overdose  
Accidental overdose must be reported as a medication error. Intentional overdose must be reported 
as misuse and abuse, ple ase refer to Section  8.3 and Appendix  3 (Section  10.3) for further details.  
In the event of an overdose, the inv estigator should closely monitor the participant for overdose -
related AEs/ serious adverse events ( SAEs ). 
A specific overdose for IcoSema and  insulin icodec cannot be defined; however, hypoglycaemia 
may develop over sequential stages if the doses administered are too high relative to the 
participant ’s requirements.  
Mild hypoglycaemia  can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products.  
Severe hypoglycaemia  where the participant  is not able to treat him/herself, can be treated by 
glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, by other drugs 
for the indication of treatment hypoglycaemia  in accordance with  local guidelines  or by glucose 
given intravenously by a medical professional. Glucose must also be given intravenously, if the 
participant  does not respond to glucagon within 10 -15 minutes. If the participant  has been 
unconscious, administration of oral carboh ydrates is recommended for the participant  upon 
regaining consciousness, in order to prevent a relapse.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator based on 
the clinical evaluation of the participant  and in accordance with local standard of care .

 7 Discontinuation of study intervention and participant wi thdrawal  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole is detailed in Appendix  1 
(Section  10.1.11 ). 
7.1 Discontinuation of study intervention  
Study intervention may be discontinued at any time during the study at the discretion of the 
participant or at the discretion of the investigator  for sa fety, behavioural, compliance or 
administrative reasons.  
7.1.1 Discontinuation of randomised treatment  
Discontinuation of randomised treatment corresponds to  discontinuation of IcoSema or insulin 
icodec . 
If a participant  discontinues  randomised treatment , the participant should  as soon as possible  attend 
the discontinuation visit  (V54A) .  
The investigator should change participant status in the healthcare professional  (HCP) web portal to 
'follow -up' at the discontinuation visit (V54A) to ensure that the partici pant should no longer report  
randomised treatment  dose.  
The participant should also complete the two follow -up visits  (V55 and V56 ).   
Hypoglycaemic episodes will not be collected after the last follow -up visit (V56) . 
Efforts must be made to have the participants who discontinue randomised treatment attend  the visit 
at week 52 (V54)  to collect : 
 Data for primary endpoint (HbA 1c). 
 Data for confirmatory secondary endpoint for body weight . 
AEs, medication related to  SAEs , and anti-diabetic medication should be collected and recorded in 
the eCRF until the visit at week 52  (V54).  No other concomitant medication than medication related 
to SAEs and anti-diabetic medication will be collected  and reported in the eCRF for participants 
who discontinue randomised treatment . 
Please, refer to Section  6.6 for treatment after discontinu ation of randomised treatment . 
The site should stay in contact with the participants who discontinu e randomised treatment  by 
phone, video call and/or site visits to motivate the participants  to attend the follow -up visits (V55 
and V56)  and the visit at week  52 (V54). Site contact s should be documented in the medical record.  
In case of any uncertainty regarding the scheduling of the visits after discontinuation of randomised 
treatment  or questions to said visits, the investigator should consult Novo Nordisk for further 
guidance .

 Only participants who withdraw consent will be considered as withdrawn from the study. 
Participants must be informed about the continued scientific importance of their data, even if they 
discontinue randomised treatment.  
The randomised treatment  must be disco ntinued, if any of the following applies for the participant:  
1. Safety concern related to randomised treatment  or unacceptable intolerability  
2. Pregnancy  
3. Intention of becoming pregnant  
4. Simultaneous use of an approved or non -approved investigational medicinal p roduct in another 
clinical study  
Note:  Simultaneous participation in a study with the primary objective of evaluating an 
approved or non -approved investigational medicinal product for prevention or treatment of 
COVID -19 disease or post -infectious conditions is allowed at the investigator’s discretion 
without discontinuation of  randomised treatment  if simultaneous participation is allowed by 
local authorities .  
5. Lack of efficacy , defined as fulfilment of ALL  criteria  (a, b and c ) below  after week 8 a nd 
onwards : 
a. Mean of pre -breakfast SMPG values (on the two days before and on the day of visit) of 3 
consecutive weeks  after week 8  are above 15 mmol/L  (270 mg/dL), AND  
b. no treatable intercurrent cause for the hyperglycaemia (e.g. non -compliance) has been 
identified . 
c. In such case, the participant must be called for a confirmatory fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG) measurement as soon as possible. A confirmatory FPG must be obtained and 
analysed by the central laboratory. If this FPG exceeds 15 mmol/ L (270 mg/dL ), 
participant fulfils the lack of efficacy criteria.  
To allow time for up -titration of the randomised treatment and to observe the expected effect of 
randomised treatment on glycaemic parameters, lack of efficacy criteria will be applied on  week 8 
and onwards.  
The primary reason for discontinuation of randomised treatment  must be specified in the CRF, and 
final trial product accountability must be performed. A discontinuation session must be made in the 
RTSM .  
7.1.2 Temporary discontinuation of  randomised treatment  
The participant  should adhere to the randomised treatment  to the extent possible, with the exception 
of any  AEs such as hospitalisation or safety concerns, at the discretion of the investigator. If a 
participant  due to an AE or safety co ncern  temporarily has discontinued randomised treatment , 
she/he is allowed to restart randomised treatment , unless any of the discontinuation criteria 
specified in Section  7.1 applies.

 7.2 Participant withdrawal from the study  
A participant may withdraw consent at any time at his/her own request.  
If a participant withdraws consent prior to  randomisation, he/she will not be asked to have any 
follow -up assessments performed. The following data must be collected: Demography, completed 
eligibility criteria, date of informed consent, date of screening and the date when participan t’s 
participation ended. The end of study form must be completed.  
If a participant withdraws consent after randomisation, the investigator must ask the participant if 
he/she is willing, as soon as possible, to have assessments performed according to discon tinuation 
visit V54A . The investigator  should also ask the participant  if he/she is willing to attend  the two 
follow -up visits V55 and V56 ( see Section 7.1 regarding the scheduling of the  follow -up visits) . See 
the flowchart for data to be collected.  
Final trial product accountability must be performed even if the participant is not able to come to 
the site. A discontinuation session must be made in the RTSM . 
If the participant withdraws consent, Novo Nordisk may retain and continue to use any data 
collected before such a withdrawal of consent for the purpose of the study or scientific research.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the investigator must document this in the me dical record.  
Although a participant is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing, the investigator 
must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the participant’s 
rights. Where the reasons are obtained, the p rimary reason for withdrawal must be specified in the 
CRF.  
7.2.1 Replacement of participants  
If a participant discontinues randomised treatment , withdraws consent or is withdrawn  from the 
study  by the investigator, he/she will not be replaced.  
7.3 Lost to follow -up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the site for a required visit:  
 The site must attempt to contact the participant  and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should cont inue in the study.  
 Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant   (where possible, at least three telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the pa rticipant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s source document.

 8 Study  assessments and procedures  
The following sections describe the assessments and procedures, while their timing is summarised 
in the flowchart  (Section 1.2). 
Informed consent must be obtained before any study -related activity, see Appendix  1 
(Section  10.1.3 ). 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to 
confirm eligibility or record reason for screen failure, as applicable.  
At screening, participants will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a study 
and giving contact details of relevant site staff th at can be contacted in case of emergency.   
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the flowchart  
(Section  1.2), is essential and required for study conduct.  
Assessments should be carried out according to the clinic’s standard of practice unless specified in 
the current section. Efforts should be made to limit the bias between the assessments. The suggested 
order of the assessments at randomisation visit (V2) is as follows:  
 Blood sample collection  
 Other assessments to confirm eligibility  
 Randomisation in RTSM  
 The investigator should create a participant  profile and record administrative information (e.g. 
subject ID, year of birth and gender ) and treatment arm in the HCP web portal  
 Participants should be provided with an eDiary and instructed in how to use it  
 The BG meter should be connected with the eD iary  
 A fasting SMPG should be measured using the BG meter  
 Dispensing  and dosing  of randomised treatment . 
For information regarding the eDiary and HCP web portal please refer to the site guide.  
Please refer to Section  6.4 for drug treatment compliance.  
All data entered in the eDiary is considered source data. The investigator should review all the data 
for the participants  through the HCP web portal, before or during each visit/phone contact.  
Review of eDiaries, ECG, laboratory reports,  eye- and physical examinations  must be documented 
in the source documents or the participant’s medical record. If clarification of entries or 
discrepancies in the eDiary is needed, the participant must be questioned, and a conclusion made in 
the participant’s source documents. Care must be taken not to bias the participant.  
Source data of clinical assessments performed and recorded in the eCR F must be available and will 
usually be in the participant’s medical records.

8.1.1 Self-measured glucose  
Participants will be provided with a blood glucose meter (BG meter)  including auxiliaries.  The BG 
meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with 
capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose va lues, which will be 
shown on the display.  
The BG meter provided by Novo Nordisk should be used for the measurements required in the 
protocol.  
Participants  must be instructed in how to transfer the results of the SMPG values  daily  into the 
eDiary.  
A baseli ne SMPG value, in fasting condition, should be collected using the BG meter at V2.  
Pre-breakfast daily self-measured plasma glucose   
Participant s should be instructed to measure their pre -breakfast SMPG daily from week 0 (V2) to  
last follow -up visit (V56) and to transfer the measured SMPG values into the eDiary.  
Selected titration data (e.g. certain SMPGs and dose data) from the eDiary will be used during the 
study for central titration surveillance, to ensure compliance with the titration guideline in 
Appendix  8 (Section 10.8). All data will be stored by Novo Nordisk, see Appendix 1 (Section 10.1). 
8.1.2 Continuous glucose monitoring  
Participants  will be equipped with a CGM device during the treatment period from week  47 (V49) 
to week 52 (V54) . The CGM system used in this  study  will be the Dexcom G6®. The CGM 
readings will be blinded to both the  participant  and investigator and will not be used for any insulin 
dose titration or hypoglycaemic episode reporting.  
If a participant  withdraws consent  during the study at a timepoint where she/he wear s CGM , a site 
visit should be scheduled in order to remove the CGM sensor and to ensure data upload  
CGM fitting and training  
The site staff will closely supervise and assist on fitting of the sensor and transmitter on the  
participant  during the site v isits. Training in the CGM is the responsibility of the investigator or site 
staff at the relevant visits. For information on fitting, and changing of the CGM parts, please refer to 
the Investigator’s  CGM  manual and  participant  CGM guide provided.

 If a participant is to have an  x-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Computed Tomography scan or 
high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) , the Dexcom G6 sensor, transmitter, and receiver should 
be removed . 
CGM sensor check  
The CGM sensor has an in -use period of 10 days. The sensor will automatically stop recording data 
exactly 10 days after sensor insertion and start. This should be taken into account when scheduling 
the clinic visits.  
The site staff should ensure that the  participant  has fitted the sensor correctly and that the CGM 
receiver is working. This will be done during the clinic visit, as specified in the flowchart (Section  
1.2).  
CGM data u pload  
CGM  data must be uploaded at the site by the site staff to the CGM software following the 
instruction provided to the sites. The upload will be documented by the system dire ctly. Special 
visit windows are included to optimize  CGM data collection , please see Section  1.2. 
The serial number of the CGM receiver must be recorded in the eCRF at the start of each CGM 
period. In case the CGM receiver is being replaced, the serial number should be updated.   
8.1.3 Clinical outcome assessments  
This section is only relevant for participants randomised to IcoSema. No clinical outcome 
assessments will be measured  for the participants randomised to insulin icodec.  The patient reported 
outcome questionnaire  is to be completed by t he participant without assistance of the site personnel . 
It takes approximately 5 minutes to complete the questionnaire.  
The following patient reported outcome questionnaire will be supplied in the eDiary  in a 
linguistically validated version in all languages relevant for this study :  
 Diabetes Treatment Preference Questionnaire ( DTPQ ). The DT PQ will be used to measure the 
preference of treatment and re asons for preference of  participants  randomised to IcoSe ma, 
considering pre -study basal insulin as comparator . Data will be collected between week 51  and 
week 52 (V54).   
8.1.4 Clinical efficacy  
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix  2 (Section  10.2), must be 
conducted in accordance with the flowchart (Section 1.2) and the laboratory manual.

 As part of the medical history, information on the following will be collected:  
 History of diabetes  
 History of cardiovascular disorder and procedure  
 History of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  (NAFLD ) 
 COVID -19 vaccine s 
A concomitant  illness  is any illness that is already present at the time point from which AEs are 
collected or found as a result of a screening procedure or other study procedures performed before 
exposure to study intervention under clinical investigation.  
In case of an abnormal and clinically significant finding fulfilling the definition of medical history 
or concomitant illness, the investigator must record the finding on the medical history/concomitant 
illness form.  
Information on hypoglycaemia unawareness will be r ecorded according to Clarke's questionnaire, 
question 8 .21 The investigator must ask the participant in the following way: "To what extent can 
you tell by your symptoms that your blood glucose is low?" Participants answering ‘never, rarely or 
sometimes’ are cons idered to have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, whereas those answering 
‘often or always’ are not.  
8.2.1 Dose  
The prescribed IcoSema and insulin  icodec  doses will be determined by the investigator in 
accordance with the titration guideline , see Appendix 8  (Section 10.8). 
The investigator must record the first and last date of trial product in the eCRF.  
During the study , starting at randomisation (V2), participant s must be instructed to report date, 
actual dose applied  and time of once weekly  IcoSema  or once weekly insulin icodec  in the eDiary. 
The injection site area  of IcoSema  and insulin icodec  must  be reported in the eCRF.

 Abnormal,  clinically significant findings at screening should be recorded as concomitant illness in 
the eCRF. At the following visits, any new abnormal, clinically significant findings or clinically 
significant deteriorations after randomisation  should be reported as an AE, see Appendix 3  (Section 
10.3). 
Body measurements will be measured and recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured and 
recorded at screening visit V1. Body weight will be measured and recorded accordingly to the 
flowchar t (Section 1.2). Waist circumference will be measured and recorded at visits V2, V28, V54 
and V54A (if applicable).  
 Fasting b ody weight should be mea sured in kilogram (kg) or pounds (lb) without coat and shoes 
wearing only light clothing. Body weight will be recorded to one decimal.  
 Body weight should be assessed with the same equipment throughout the study , if possible.  
 Height should be measured in c entimetres (cm) or inches (in) without shoes. Height will be 
recorded to the nearest whole number.  
 The waist circumference is defined as the minimal abdominal circumference located midway 
between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest and will be measured using a non -stretchable 
measuring tape. The measurement of waist  circumference should be performed  and recorded  in 
the eCRF to the nearest ½ cm or ¼  in using the same measuring tape throughout the  study . The 
waist circumference should be measured in a standing position with an empty bladder and 
wearing light clothing with accessible waist. The participant  should be standing with arms down 
their side and feet together. The tape should touch the skin but not  compress soft tissue. The 
participant  should be asked to breathe normally,  and the measurement should be taken when the 
subject is breathing out gently.  
From the body weight and height  measured at V1 , the body mass index ( BMI ) should be calculated 
to eval uate inclusion criteria no. 7 and recorded in the  participant ’s medical records  
8.2.3 Vital signs  
Pulse rate as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the 
participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., no use of television, cell phones).  
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements will be assessed sitting with a completely automated 
device. Manual techniques must be used only if an automated device is not available.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate are collected at screening (V1) , randomisation (V2),  V12, V20, V28, 
V38, V46 , V54,  and V54A . 
Blood pressure will consist of 3 systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements with intervals  
of at least 1 -2 minutes. An additional fourth blood pressure measurement must be performed if the 
first two readings on systolic or diastolic blood pressure differ by >10 mmHg. No more than four 
measurements should be performed.  
 
 The last 2 systolic and l ast 2 diastolic blood pressure measurements should be recorded in the 
CRF.

 The pulse rate for the last 2 measurements should be recorded in the CRF.  
8.2.4 Eye examination  
Participan ts with uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy are not 
eligible as this indicates retinopathy that has recently progressed to a level that requires intervention 
or is approaching intervention but has yet to be brought und er control.  
Results of an eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist or another suitably qualified health 
care provider (e.g., optometrist)  possibly aided by diagnostic artificial intelligence algorithms  
approved by FDA and/or CE -marked  must be available and evaluated by the investigator before 
randomisation to assess eligibility. The eye examination should be performed as a fundus 
photography (e.g., 2 -field 60 degree or better, colour or red -free) or by slit -lamp biomicroscopy 
examination (e.g.,  using a pre -corneal or corneal contact lens examination). Pharmacological pupil -
dilation is a requirement unless using a digital fundus photography camera specified for non -dilated 
examination.  If diagnostic artificial intelligence algorithms are used an additional eye examination 
may be necessary if indicated so by the algorithm.  
If the participant had such an eye examination performed within 90 days prior to screening, the 
investigator may base his/her evaluation upon the results of that examination. The  examination must 
be repeated before randomisation if the participant has experienced worsening of visual function 
since the last examination. If the applicable eye examination was performed before the participant 
signed the informed consent form, it must be documented that the reason for performing the 
examination was not related to this study.  
It is recommended that high risk T2D patients (individuals with T2D duration of ≥10 years, a 
baseline HbA1c >8% and confirmed diabetic retinopathy at baseline)  will have an additional eye 
examination  in accordance with local standard of care , i.e. every 6 -month performed  by an 
ophthalmologist or another suitably qualified health care provider (e.g., optometrist)  possibly aided 
by diagnostic artificial intelligence al gorithms approved by FDA and/or CE -marked . 
Eye examinations required  at the visit at week  52 (V54) can be performed within 2 weeks  before 
the visit, if results are available for evaluation at the visit. For  participants who discontinue  
randomised treatment , eye examination can be performed up to 2 weeks after visit 54A . The 
investigator should examine  the outcome of each eye examination. Relevant findings  before 
randomisation must be recorded as concomitant illness/medical history. While relevant findings 
occurring after randomisation should be reported as an AE, please refer to Section  8.3 and 
Appendix  3 (Section  10.3).  
8.2.5 Electrocardiograms  
The ECG should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant  in a supine/sitting 
position in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g. no use of television, cell phones).

 The ECG must be interpreted, signed and dated by the investigator to verify that the data has been 
reviewed.  
The ECG required at screening can b e obtained within two weeks  before randomisation  (V2) but at 
the latest at randomisation (V2) . The results must be interpreted by the investigator  before 
randomisation in order to determine the eligibility of the participant . 
The ECG required at the  visit at week 52 (V54)  can be obtained within two weeks  before the visit. 
The results must be available for evaluation at the visit.  
Abnormal, clinically significant findings at screening should be recorded as concomitant illness in 
the eCRF. At the follo wing visits, any new abnormal, clinically significant findings or clinically 
significant deteriorations after randomisation  should be reported as an AE, see Appendix 3  
(Section  10.3). 
8.2.6 Clinical safety laboratory assessments  
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix  2 (Section  10.2), must be 
conducted in accordance with the protocol flowchart  (Section 1.2) and the laboratory manual . 
8.2.7 Pregnancy testing  
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) should only be included after a negative, highly 
sensitive urine pregnancy test (refer to Appendix  2 (Section 10.2)). 
Pregnancy testing should be performed whenever a menstruation is missed or when pregnancy is 
otherwise suspected.  
Additional pregnancy testing should be performed during the treatment period, if required locally, 
refer to Appendix  11 (Section  10.11 ). 
8.3 Adverse events and other safety reporting  
The investigator is responsible for detecting, documenting, recording and following up on events 
that meet the definition of an AE or SAE . 
 
The definition of AEs and SAEs can be found in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3), along with a 
description of AEs requiring additional data collection. The definition and description of events for 
adjudication can be found in Appendix  9 (Section  10.9). 
 
Some AEs require additional data collection on a specific event form. The relevant event(s) are 
listed below in Table  8-1, together with event(s) for adjudication and other events requiring 
collection of additional information.

Appendix  3 (Section  10.3) and Appendix 7 (Section 10.7) for hypoglycaemic episodes and 
Appendix  9 (Section  10.9) for events requiring adjudication.  
8.3.1 Time period and frequency for collecting  adverse event  information  
All AEs and SAEs must be collected from first  administration of randomised treatment  and until the 
last follow -up visit in accordance with the flowchart (Section  1.2) or whenever, within the above 
time period, the site becomes aware of an AE or SAE.  
Conditions present prior to the timepoint from which AEs are collected and anticipated day -to-day 
fluctuatio ns of these conditions, including those identified during screening or during other study -
related procedures performed before exposure to randomised treatment , will be recorded as medical 
history/concomitant illness.  
AE and SAE reporting timelines can be f ound in Appendix  3 (Section   10.3). All  SAEs must be 
recorded and reported to Novo Nordisk within 24 hours, and the investigator must submit any 
updated SAE data to Novo Nordisk within 24 hours of it being available.  
Investiga tors are not obligated to actively seek for AE or SAE in former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has 
been discontinued from/completed the study, and the investigator cons iders the event to be related 
to the randomised treatment  or related to study participation, the investigator must promptly notify 
Novo Nordisk.

 8.3.2 Method of detecting adverse event s  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for 
completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
Care should be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non -
leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about events.  
8.3.3 Follow -up of adverse event s  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs  should be followed until final outcome of the event or until the 
participant is lost to  follow -up as described in Section  7.3. Further information on follow -up and 
final outcome of events is given in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
8.3.4 Regulatory reporting requirements for serious a dverse event s 
Prompt notification by the investigator to Novo Nordisk of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibili ties towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Novo Nordisk has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a s tudy intervention under clinical investigation. Novo 
Nordisk will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators. This also includes suspected unexpected 
serious adv erse reactions (SUSAR s). 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from Novo Nordisk will review and then file 
it along with the investigator’s broch ure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.3.5 Pregnancy  
Details of pregnancies in female participants will be collected after first exposure to IMP  and until  
the new-born infant is one month of age.  For details regarding collection and reporting of pregnancy 
information, please refer to Appendix  4 (Section  10.4). 
8.3.6 Technical complaints  
Technical complaints will be collected for all products listed on the technical complaint form.  
Instructions for reporting technical complaints can be found in Appendix  5 (Section  10.5). 
In order for Novo Nordisk to perform a complete investigation of reported SAEs, Novo Nordisk 
might ask the investigator to complete a technical complaint form.  
8.4 Pharmacokinetics  
Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of insulin  icodec and semaglutide . For participants

8.7.2 Hypersensitivity  
Participant s randomised to IcoSema or insulin icodec  and investigators will be instructed to detect 
signs and symptoms of systemic hypersensitivity.  
In the event of a systemic hypersensitivity  reaction  (not locally at the injection site), the participant  
should be called in as soon as possible to have additional blood samples taken  (Section 10.2). 
The blood sampling should be repeated 2 -4 weeks following onset of the systemic hypersensitivity 
reaction. If possible, the tests should also be performed on samples drawn before  first 
administration of IcoSema or insulin icodec . 
For details related to blood sampling, plasma preparation and storage, please refer to the laboratory 
manual.  
Analysis will be performed by Novo Nordisk or a Novo Nordisk appointed special laboratory

The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalised prior to first  participant  first visit and it will 
include a more technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. 
This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints 
including the primary and confirm atory  secondary endpoints.  
9.1 Statistical hypotheses  
The primary objective is to show that IcoSema is superior to insulin icodec in terms of change in 
HbA 1c from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 (V 54). 
Formally, let D be the mean treatment difference ‘IcoSema’  minus ‘insulin icodec’ of the change in 
HbA 1c (%) from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 (V 54). The null -hypothesis of IcoSema not being 
superior will be tested against the alternative hypothesis of superiority as given by  
H0: D ≥ 0% against H A: D < 0%  
Superiority will be considered confirmed if the upper bound of the two -sided 95% confidence 
interval for D is strictly below 0 %.  
The following sections detail the confirmatory secondary hypotheses. The confirmatory secondary 
objective s are to show that :  
 IcoSema  is superior to insulin icodec in terms of change in body weight from baseline week 0 
(V2) to week 52 (V 54) 
 IcoSema is superior to insulin icodec in terms of number of hypoglycaemic episodes (level 2 
and 3 combined) from baseline week 0 (V2) to week  57 (V 56) 
Formally, let D W be the mean treatment difference ‘IcoSema’ minus ‘insulin icodec’ in change in 
body weight (kg) from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 ( V54). The null -hypothesis of IcoSema not 
being superior will be tested against the alternative hypothesis of superiority as given by:  
H0: DW ≥ 0 kg against H A: D W < 0 kg.  
Superiority will be considered confirmed if the test procedure was not stopped , see sec tion 9.1.1  for 
details on the testing procedure , and if the upper bound of the two -sided 95% confidence interval 
for D W is strictly below 0 kg.  
Let RR be the rate ratio ‘IcoSema’ compared to ’insulin icodec’ of the rate of hypoglycaemic 
episodes (level 2 and level 3 combined). The null -hypothesis of IcoSema not being superior will be 
tested against the alternative hypothesis of superiority as given by:  
H0: RR ≥ 1 against H A: RR < 1.  
Superiority will be  considered confirmed if the test procedure was not stopped , see section  9.1.1  for 
details on the testing procedure,  and if the upper bound of the two -sided 95% confidence interval 
for RR is strictly below 1.

 9.1.1 Multiplicity adjustment  
The type I error will be controlled in the strong sense using a hierarchical (fixed sequence) testing 
procedure. This is based on priorit y ordering of the null hypotheses and testing them in this order 
using the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval approach until an insignificant result appears. 
Consequently, the null hypothesis will only be tested if the previous  null hypothes es have been 
rejec ted in favo ur of IcoSema . 
The steps in the hierarchical testing procedure are as follows:  
 Step 1: Change in HbA1c from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 (V 54) superiority  of IcoSema  
versus insulin icodec  
 Step 2: Change in b ody weight  from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 (V 54) superiority of 
IcoSema versus insulin icodec  
 Step 3: Number of hypoglycaemic episodes (level 2 and 3 combined)  from baseline week 0 
(V2) to week 57 (V 56) superiority of IcoSema versus insulin icodec . 
9.2 Analysis sets  
The following population s are defined :

 The full analysis set and the in -study  data points set  will be used to estimate the primary estimand  
and the confirmatory secondary estimand related to  body weight. For the confirmatory  secondary 
estimands related to  hypoglycaemic episodes the full analysis set and the on -treatment data points 
set will be used.  
9.3 Statistical analyses  
9.3.1 General considerations  
Baseline is defined as information collected at week 0 (V2). In case a measurement is not available 
at week 0 (V2) the most recent measurement prior to week 0 (V2) will be used as baseline.  
Presentation of results from a statistical analysis will include the estimated mean treatment 
difference (or ratio) presented together with the two -sided 95% confidence interval and the  
corresponding two -sided p -value.  
In the statistical models, explanatory factors will be coded as follows:  
 Randomised t reatment: Once weekly IcoSema, Once weekly insulin icodec  
 Region: Asia, Europe, North America, Other  
The regions will be defined as follows:  
 Asia: Japan , China, Taiwan , South Korea  
 Europe: Italy, Poland , Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Portugal  
 North America: United States  
 Other: India, South Africa, Turkey , Russia , Mexico, Australia  
9.3.2 Primary estimand analy sis 
The primary endpoint is change in HbA 1c from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 (V 54). 
The estimand (see Secti on 3), will be estimated based on the full analysis set using the in -study  data 
points set  which includes  all HbA 1c measurements obtained at week 52 (V 54) especially 
measurements from participants  experiencing intercurrent events. The imputation approach for the 
primary estimand is a multiple imputation similar to the one described by McEvoy.22 
 Missing HbA 1c measurements at week 52 (V 54) for participants  experiencing intercurrent 
events will be imputed from participants  experiencing intercurrent events and have a 
measurement at week 52 (V 54) in each treatment arm.  
 Missing HbA 1c measurements at week 52 (V 54) for participants  not experiencing intercurrent 
events are imputed from available measurements at week 52 (V 54) from participants  not 
experiencing intercurrent events in each treatment arm.  
The multiple imputation approach will be done the following way:  
 Imputation: An ANCOVA model for change in HbA 1c from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 
(V54) for participants  experiencing intercurrent events and have a measurement at week 52 
(V54) with randomised treatment as fixed factor, last available planned on-treatment HbA 1c

 observation without initiation of non -randomised insulin treatment or additional anti -diabetic 
treatments for more than 2 weeks , the time point (study day) of last available planned on -
treatment HbA 1c observation without initiation of no n-randomised insulin treatment or 
additional anti -diabetic treatments for more than 2 weeks  and baseline HbA 1c as covariate. If 
participants  not experiencing intercurrent events are missing measurements at week 52 (V 54) an 
ANCOVA model will be defined in a  similar way using available data from participants  not 
experiencing intercurrent events. The estimated parameters, and their variances, from the 
imputation models will be used to impute missing HbA 1c measurements at week 52 (V 54). This 
will be done 1000 t imes and results in 1000 complete datasets.  
 For each of the complete data sets, the primary endpoint will be analysed using an ANCOVA 
model with region and randomised treatment as fixed factors, and baseline HbA 1c as covariate. 
The estimates and standard deviations for the 1000 data sets will be pooled to one estimate and 
associated standard deviation using Rubin’s rule.23 
 From the pooled estimate and standard deviation the 95% confidence int erval for the treatment 
difference will be calculated. The corresponding two -sided p -value will also be calculated.  
This analysis has the underlying assumption that participants  with missing data behave similarly as 
comparable participants  within the same treatment arm i.e. that participants  experiencing 
intercurrent events with missing data at week 52 (V 54) behave like participants  experiencing 
intercurrent events with data at week 52 (V 54) within the same treatment arm and similar for 
participants  not experiencing intercurrent events.  
9.3.2.1  Sensitivity analysis  
The following sensitivity analysis will evaluate the robustness of the results towards the missing 
data assumption.  
For the primary endpoint, a two -dimensional tipping point analysis will  be performed where 
participants having imputed HbA 1c measurement at week 52 (V 54) are assumed to have a worse 
outcome in the IcoSema arm and a better outcome in the insulin icodec arm compared to what was 
imputed in the primary analysis. This is done by a dding or subtracting values Δ i to the imputed 
HbA 1c values before analysing the data. The value of Δ i will be varied independently in the two 
treatment arms. The plausibility of the values of Δ i where the conclusion of the primary analysis 
change will be e valuated to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results.  
9.3.3 Secondary estimand analys es 
9.3.3.1  Confirmatory secondary estimands  
9.3.3.1.1  Estimand related to c hange in body weight from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 
52 (V 54) 
The secondary estimand regarding change in body weight from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 52 
(V54) will be estimated using a model similar to the primary analysis above substituting body 
weight for HbA 1c. 
The robustness of the results towards the missing data assumption will be evaluated using an 
method following similar principles as for the primary estimand.

 9.3.3.1.2  Estimand related to n umber of clinically significant hypoglycaemic episodes 
(level 2) (<3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL], confirmed by BG meter) or severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes (level 3) from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 57 (V56)  
The secondary estimand regarding number of clinically significant hypoglycaemic episodes (level 
2) (<3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL], confirmed by BG meter) or severe hypoglycaemic episodes (level 3) 
from baseline week 0 (V2) to week 57 (V56) will be analysed as desc ribed below. The endpoint is 
defined as described in Appendix 7 (Sectio n 10.7). 
For participants  who discontinued randomised treatment, the number of episodes in the period 
where hypoglycaemic episodes are not collected (the period from time of follow -up 2 visit ( V56) to 
planned end of the on -treatment data point set ) will be imputed using a multiple imputation 
techni que, assuming that the episode  rate pre -follow -up 2 ( V56) follows the respective treatment 
arms rate whilst post -follow -up 2 ( V56) episode  rate is the rate of the comparator arm. The 
imputation will be done as follows:  
 First, a Bayes negative binomial mod el with log -link function is fitted to the number of episodes 
data for participants  in the comparator arm to obtain the posterior distribution of model 
parameters. The model will include region as fixed factor and the logarithm of the time period  
in which a participant is considered exposed to randomised treatment  as offset.  
 Second, based on the estimated parameters for the comparator arm in this model, the number of 
episodes in the missing period will be imputed for participants  having discontinued randomi sed 
treatment. One thousand  (1000 ) complete dataset are generated by sampling from the estimated 
distribution.  
 For each of the complete datasets, the number of episodes will be analysed using a negative 
binomial model with log -link function , treatment and region fixed factors and offset as 
described in step 1. The estimates and standard errors for the 1000 data sets will be pooled to 
one estimate and associated standard deviation using Rubin’s rule .23 
 From the pooled estimate and standard deviation the 95% confidence interval will be calculated 
and back -transformed to the original scale resulting in a treatment ratio and a 95% confidence 
interval for the treatment ratio. The corresponding two -sided p -value will also be calculated.  
The analysis has the underlying assumption that participants discontinuing randomised treatment 
behave similarly to participants  in the comparator arm after the follow -up period. The robustness of 
the results towards the missing data assumption will be evaluated using a method following similar 
principles as for the primary estimand.

 9.3.5 Other safety analyses  
The standard safety assessments (AEs, safety laboratory parameters, vital signs, etc.) will be 
reported descriptively; including any notable changes of clinical interest in laboratory parameters.  
9.3.6 Other analyses  
9.3.6.1  Pharmacokinetic modelling  
Insulin icodec serum concentration data and semaglutide plasma concentration data will be use d for 
population PK analysis. The objective of the population PK analysis is to evaluate the effects of 
relevant  covariates on insulin icodec and semaglutide exposure.  
The population PK analysis will be performed by Quantitative Clinical Pharmacology, Novo  
Nordisk. A more technical and detailed elaboration of the population PK analysis will be given in a 
modelling analysis plan, which will be prepared before database lock. In brief, previously 
developed PK models for insulin icodec and semaglutide will be a pplied. The absorption rate 
constants in the models will be fixed, and the apparent clearance and volume of distribution 
parameters will be re -estimated. The covariates of interest will be incorporated into the PK models 
using criteria which will be specif ied in the modelling analysis plan.  
The population PK analysis will be reported in a separate modelling report, which will not be part 
of the clinical study  report. The individual insulin icodec serum concentration data and the 
individual semaglutide plasma concentration data will be tabulated in the bioanalytical report.  
9.4 Interim analysis  
Not applicable for this study . 
9.5 Sample size determination  
The sample size is determined in order to have at least 90% power for meeting the primary 
hypothesis and reasonable marginal power (at least 90%) for also meeting the confirmatory 
secondary hypotheses.  
It is assumed that the amount of participants  experiencing an interc urrent event will be similar to 
what was observed in the subcutaneous semaglutide  for T2D development program, and that the 
intercurrent events will have the same impact on effect size and are equally distributed between 
treatment arms. The amount of participants  experiencing an intercurrent event ranged from 14.1% 
to 25.7% in open -label studies  with various durations except for semaglutide 0.5 mg in the Japan 
studies , see Table  9-1. Based on this the percentage of participants  experiencing an intercurrent 
event is expected to be 17%.

Participants  experiencing an intercurrent event is participants  discontinuing randomised treatment or initiating rescue 
medication. The definition of rescue medication differ across the studies  and is different from the current study . 
For the primary hypothesis and confirmatory secondary hypothesis that IcoSema is superior to 
insulin icodec in terms of change from baseline to week 52 (V54)  in HbA 1c and body weight 
respectively, the sample size considerations are based on the IDegLira (i nsulin degludec/liraglutide) 
studies  where participants  are previously treated with a basal insulin s, see Table  9-2.

CI: Confidence interval, ETD: Estimated treatment difference, IDeg: Insulin degludec, IGlar: Insulin glargine, 
IDegLira: insulin degludec/liraglutide, SD: Standard deviation. In the DUAL II studies  the insulin degludec dose was 
capped at 50 units. Data fro m after participants  discontinuing randomised treatment were not collected in the studies . 
Change from baseline in HbA 1c and change from baseline in body weight for DUAL II China were analysed using a 
mixed -effect model for repeated measurements. Change from baseline in body weight for DUAL II, DUAL II Japan and 
DUAL V were analysed using an analysis of variance model where  missing data was imputed using last observation 
carried forward.  
However, the current study  and the IDegLira studies  in Table  9-2 are different in key study  design 
aspects such as: in the IDegLira studies  the insulin degludec dose was capped at 50 units (except 
NN9068 -3952), the titration target was lower (4.0 -5.0 mmol/L [72 -90 mg/dL]), the study  duration 
was shorter, the population was different e.g. pr e-study  basal insulin dose was 20 -50 units per day 
and for participants  discontinuing randomised treatment data w ere not collected after 
discontinuation and hence not included. In addition the statistical methods to be used in the current 
study  also differ . The differences across development programmes are expected to impact the 
expected treatment differences. Based on these considerations it is considered reasonable to be able 
to detect a treatment difference of at least a -0.33% -point in change in HbA 1c between the treatment 
arms for participants  not experiencing intercurrent events and no treatment difference for

 participants  experiencing intercurrent events . Thus, with 17% of participants  expected to experience 
any of the specified intercurrent events be fore week 52  (V54) , this leads to a mean treatment 
difference of (1 -0.17) ∙ -0.33% -point = -0.274% -point for the specified primary estimand in the 
overall population. The standard deviation (SD) is assumed to be 1.1% -point based on the IDegLira 
studies . 
To be able to detect a treatment difference of -0.274%-point with the above considerations it 
requires 680 participants  to ensure 90% power.  
Based on the same considerations as above for change in HbA 1c it is considered reasonable to be 
able to detect at lea st a -2.5 kg difference for change in body weight between treatment arms for 
participants  not experiencing intercurrent events  and no treatment difference for participants  
experiencing intercurrent events. Thus, with 17% of participants  expected to experie nce any of the 
specified intercurrent events before week 52  (V54) , this leads to a mean treatment difference of 
(1-0.17) ∙ -2.5kg = -2.075kg for the specified secondary estimand in the overall population. The 
standard deviation (SD) is assumed to be 4.5 kg  based on the IDegLira studies . 
To be able to detect a treatment difference of -2.075kg with the above considerations it requires 200 
participants  to ensure 90% power.  
For the confirmatory secondary hypothesis that IcoSema is superior to insulin icodec in terms of 
number of hypoglycaemic episodes (level 2 and 3 combined) the sample size considerations are 
based on results from IDegLira studies  for severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes, see  
Table   9-3. However considering that the hypoglycaemic episode definition is different and the 
titration target is higher in the current study , which result in fewer hypoglycaemic episodes ,24 it is 
therefore expected that participants  treated with IcoSema will experience 0.8 hypoglycaemic 
episodes (level 2 and 3 combined) per year compared to 0.8  / 0.65 = 1.23 episodes  per year for 
participants  treated with insulin icodec  (Expected Rate ratio (RR) of 0.65). It is assumed that there 
is no treatment difference in rates after experiencing intercurrent events, corresponding to a 
treatment ratio of 1 in this period. Discontinuation  of randomised treatment  is assumed to be 
distributed equally over the study  duration. Thus, with 17% of participants  expected to experience 
any of the specified intercurrent events before week 52  (V54) , this leads to an expected RR of 
1 ∙ 0.17 / 2 + 0.65 ∙ (1 - 0.17 / 2) = 0.68 for the specified secondary estimand in the overall 
population. The dispersion parameter is assumed to be 3.6 based on the IDegLira studies .

 From the above assumptions 1290 participants  will be required to ensure sufficient marginal power 
(90%) for the confirmatory secondary hypothesis that IcoSema is superior to insulin icodec in terms 
of number of hypoglycaemic episod es (level 2 and 3 combined) and this is the hypothesis

 From the above assumptions and requirements for the primary and confirmatory secondary 
analyses, 1290 participants  will be randomly assigned to treatment . This will ensure sufficient 
marginal power of 90% for confirming superiority for the primary and the confirmatory hypotheses, 
and a joint power of 89.5%.  
9.6 Partial database lock  
A partial database lock may be performed at the end of the treatment period for all participants, i.e. 
after the date of the last participant last treatment visit. The database will  be updated after the partial 
database lock to include remaining safety information. The full database lock will be performed 
after the date of the last participant last visit.  
The analysis of the primary endpoint and all other efficacy endpoints will be p erformed based on 
the data from the partial database lock. Analysis of safety data will be performed after the full 
database lock. This approach is implemented to allow earlier availability of IcoSema  to a T2D  
patient population in need of treatment intens ification  expected to benefit from a n insulin and 
GLP -1 combination product . A detailed plan for data handling and operational aspects of the partial 
database lock and the database update will be finalised before the partial database lock.

 certain identifiers will be enforced to protect the identity of participants as required by local, 
regional and national requirements.  
The participant must be informed about his/her privacy rights, including that his/her personal study -
related data will be used by Novo Nordisk in acc ordance with local data protection law. The 
disclosure of the data must also be explained to the participant.  
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by auditors or other 
authorised personnel appointed by Novo Nordisk,  by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by 
inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
Personal data may be collected from participants due to process requirements from Novo Nordisk’s 
suppliers. This data is needed to ensure that the relevant data analysis for th e study can be 
performed, but will not be part of the data transferred to Novo Nordisk, the assessment of the study 
endpoints or the clinical study report. A list of any such data values must be kept as part of the 
study documentation along with an explana tion of why it was required.  
10.1.6  Committees structure  
10.1.6.1  Novo Nordisk safety committee  
Novo Nordisk will perform ongoing safety surveillance. If new safety signals are identified, these 
will be evaluated by an internal safety committee.  The safety committee may r ecommend 
unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an internal study -independent ad hoc 
group may be established in order to maintain the blinding of the study personnel.  
10.1.6.2  Event adjudication committee  
An independent external EAC is estab lished to perform ongoing blinded adjudication of selected 
AEs and deaths (see  Table  8-1 and Appendix  9 (Section  10.9)). 
The EAC will evaluate events sent for adjudication using pre -defined definitions and guidelines in 
accordance with the EAC charter. The evaluation is based on review of pre -defined clinical data 
collected by the sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering all required medical 
specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent 
of Novo Nordisk. The EAC will have no authority  to impact study conduct, study protocol or 
amendments. The assessments made by both the event adjudication committee and the investigator 
will be evaluated and included in the CSR.  
10.1.7  Dissemination of clinical study data  
Study information will be disclosed a t clinicaltrials.gov and novonordisk -trials.com and, if 
applicable, also on other national or regional study registries. It will be disclosed according to 
applicable requirements, relevant recommendations or regulations, such as the Declaration of 
Helsinki ,25 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE),27 the Food and Drug 
Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA),28 European Commission Requirements1, 29, 30 and in 
accordance with Novo Nordisk commitment to clinical transparency. If a participant requests to be 
included in the study via the Novo Nordisk e -mail contact at these web sites, Novo Nordisk may 
disclose the investigator’s contact details to the parti cipant. As a result of increasing requirements

 for transparency, some countries require public disclosure of investigator names and their 
affiliations.  
10.1.8  Data quality assurance  
10.1.8.1  Case report forms  
Novo Nordisk or designee is responsible for the data management  of this study including quality 
checking of the data.  
To demonstrate his/her oversight of the collected data, the investigator should sign the eCRF on a 
regular basis during the conduct of the study as well as at the end of the study, as described in the 
eCRF completion guideline , and review the HCP web portal.  
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on CRFs  and eDiary  unless transmitted 
electronically to Novo Nordisk or designee (e.g., laboratory and eDiary data). The investigator is 
responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically 
signing the CRF.  
The following will be provided as paper CRFs:  
 Pregnancy forms  
The following will be provided as paper CRFs to be used when access to the CRF is revoked or the 
CRF is temporarily unavailable:  
 AE forms  
 Safety information forms  
 Technical complaint forms (also to be used to report complaints on study intervention not yet 
allocated to a participant)  
Corrections to the CRF data may be made by the  investigator or the investigator’s delegated staff. 
An audit trail will be maintained in the CRF application containing as a minimum: the old and the 
new data, identification of the person entering the data, date and time of the entry and reason for the 
correction. If corrections are made by the investigator’s delegated staff after the date when the 
investigator signed the CRF, the CRF must be signed and dated again by the investigator.  
The investigator must ensure that data is recorded in the CRF as soon as possible, preferably within 
5 working days after the visit. Once data has been entered, it will be available to Novo Nordisk for 
data verification and validation purposes.  
10.1.8.2  Monitoring  
The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC  review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents (original documents, data 
and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any 
record(s) and report(s) that are important  to the evaluation of the study. If the electronic source data 
does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated

 printouts. In addition, the relevant site staff should be available for discussions at monit oring visits 
and between monitoring visits (e.g., by telephone).  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification of critical data points to confirm that 
data entered into the CRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete and verifiab le from 
source documents. Study monitors will perform ongoing source data review to ensure that the study 
is being conducted in accordance with the current approved protocol and any other study 
agreements,  ICH GCP26, and all applicable regulatory requirements, evaluating the adequacy of 
critical processes at site for the execution of the protocol, collectio n of study data, to ensure that the 
safety and rights of participants are being protected.  
Monitoring will be conducted using a risk -based approach including risk assessment, monitoring 
plans, centralised monitoring (remote assessment of data by Novo Nordi sk) and visits to sites.  
Quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be predefined in the relevant monitoring plan to identify 
systematic issues that can impact participant safety and/or reliability of study results. These 
predefined parameters will be monitored during the study, and important deviations from the QTLs 
and remedial actions taken will be summarised in the clinical study report.  
Monitors will review the participant ’s medical records and other source data to ensure consistency 
and/or identify omission s compared to the eCRF.  
10.1.8.3  Protocol compliance  
Deviations from the protocol should be avoided. If deviations do occur, the investigator must 
inform the monitor without delay and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and 
discussed.  
Deviations mus t be documented and explained in a protocol deviation by stating the reason, date, 
and the action(s) taken. Some deviations, for which corrections are not possible, can be 
acknowledged and confirmed via edit checks in the CRF or via listings from the study  database.  
10.1.9  Source documents  
All data entered in the eCRF or paper CRF must be verifiable in source documentation.  
Data in the service providers’ database is considered source data e.g. laboratory data  and CGM . For 
eDiary  (including patient reported outcomes) , data in eDiary  database is considered source data, 
unless stated otherwise in source d ocumentation  agreements.  
 
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the site. Any source data generated by 
investigator’s subcontractors must be archived and accessible by the site.  
Data that is transcribed into the eCRF or paper CRF  from source documents must be consistent with 
the source documents,  or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request 
previous medical records or transfer records. Also, current medical records must be available.  
If source data is entered directly in a paper CRF, each data entry or clear series of data entries must 
be signed and dated separately by the study staff making the entry.

 It must be possible to verify participant’s medical history in source documents, such as participant’s 
medical record.  
The investigator must document any attempt to ob tain external medical information by noting the 
date(s) when information was requested, and who was contacted.  
Definition of what constitutes source data must  be found in a source document agreement at each 
site. There will only be one source document defi ned at any time for any data element.  
10.1.10  Retention of clinical study documentation  
Records and documents, including signed informed consent forms, pertaining to the conduct of this 
study must be retained by the investigator for 25 years after end of study unl ess local regulations or 
institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the 
retention period without the written approval of Novo Nordisk. No records may be transferred to 
another location or party without writ ten notification to Novo Nordisk.  
The investigator must be able to access his/her study documents without involving Novo Nordisk in 
any way. If applicable, electronic CRF (eCRF) and other participant data will be provided in an 
electronic readable format t o the investigator before access is revoked to the systems and/or 
electronic devices  supplied by Novo Nordisk. Site -specific CRFs and other participant data (in an 
electronic readable format or as paper copies or prints) must be retained by the site. A cop y of all 
data will be stored by Novo Nordisk.  
Participant’s medical records must be kept for the maximum period permitted by the hospital, 
institution or private practice.  
10.1.11  Study and site closure  
Novo Nordisk reserves the right to close the site or terminat e the study at any time for any reason at 
the sole discretion of Novo Nordisk. If the study is suspended or terminated, the investigator must 
inform the participants promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. The investigator 
and/or Novo Nordis k must also promptly inform the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs and 
provide a detailed written explanation.  
Sites will be closed upon study completion. A site is considered closed when all required documents 
and study supplies have been collected and a site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a site by Novo Nordisk or investigator may include but are not 
limited to:  
 failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local 
health authorities, Novo Nordisk procedures or GCP guidelines  
 inadequate recruitment of participan ts by the investigator  
 discontinuation of further study intervention development.

development of the study intervention. All information supplied by Novo Nordisk in connection 
with this study shall remain the sole property of Novo Nordisk and is to be considered confidential 
information.  
No confidential information shall be disc losed to others without prior written consent from Novo 
Nordisk. Such information shall not be used except in the performance of this study.  
The information obtained during this study may be made available to other investigators who are 
conducting other cl inical studies with the study intervention, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. 
Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information 
obtained during this study to researchers who require access for research projects  studying the same 
or related diseases and/or study intervention studied in this study.  
Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical studies website a redacted CSR for this study.  
One or two  investigator s will be appointed by Novo Nordisk to review and sign th e CSR (signatory 
investigator s) on behalf of all participating investigators . 
10.1.14.1  Communication of results  
Novo Nordisk commits to communicate and disclose results of studies regardless of outcome. 
Disclosure includes publication of a manuscript in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, abstract 
submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting or disclosure by other means.   
The results of this study will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to 
international and national regulations. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data 
until specified milestones are reached, for example when the CSR is available. This includes the 
right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the releas e of such information may 
influence the results of the entire study.  
At the end of the study, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the 
investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publicati on and/or 
communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property.  
In all cases, the study results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete 
manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations. In the event of any di sagreement on the

10.1.14.3  Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s)  
For a multicentre clinical study, analyses based on single -site data usually have significant 
statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare 
professionals or participants, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. Thus, Novo 
Nordisk may deny a request or ask for deferment of the pub lication of individual site results until 
the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. In line with Good Publication Practice, such 
individual reports should not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the 
primary manuscript of th e study.  
10.1.14.4  Investigator access to data and review of results

 10.2 Appendix  2: Clinical laboratory tests  
The tests detailed in Table  10-1 and Table  10-2 will be performed by the central laboratory  and by 
the special laboratorie s. 
Additional tests may be performed at any time during the study as determined necessary by the 
investigator or required by local regulations. Only laboratory samples specified in the protocol 
should be sent to the central laboratory for analysis; if additional laboratory sampling is needed, 
e.g., to follow -up on AEs, this must be done at a local laboratory . 
The central lab oratory  will communicate to the investigator abnormal values of parameters not 
requested in the protocol but identified by the labo ratory equipment and/or their processes 
according to their laboratory S tandard Operating Procedure s. These data will not be transferred to 
the study database. The investigator should review such values for AEs and report these according 
to this protocol.  
The investigator must review all laboratory results for concomitant illnesses and AEs, with the 
exception of the pharmacokinetics  and antibodies  (sections  8.4 and 8.7.1 ), as these results will not 
be available to the investigator until after finalisation  of the clinical study  report . 
The investigator must keep an overview, e.g. a log, of laboratory samples not handled according to 
the laboratory manual. In addition, the investigator must keep an overview, e.g. a log, of laboratory 
samples stor ed at site.  
Laboratory samples will be destroyed no later than at the end of the study or no later than at 
finalisation of the CSR.  
Human bio samples  will be stored as described in Appendix  6 (Section  10.6).

 10.3 Appendix  3: Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events : Definitions and procedures 
for recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.3.1  Definition of adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant that is temporally 
associated with the use of IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP. An AE can therefore 
be any unfavourable and unintended sig n (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a n IMP.  
Events to be reported as AEs:  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results or safety assessments considered clinically significant in 
the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator, including events that have worsened 
from prior to the time point from which AEs are collected  
 Conditions detected or diagnosed after IMP administration even though it may have been 
present prior t o the time point from which AEs are collected  
 Exacerbation/worsening of a chronic or intermittent condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
 Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug intera ction  
 Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of IMP regardless of intent  
A ‘lack of efficacy’ or ‘failure of expected pharmacological action’ per se will not be reported as an 
AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the effi cacy assessments. However, the signs, 
symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if 
they fulfil the definition.  
Events NOT to be reported as adverse events : 
 Conditions present prior to the time point fro m which AEs are collected and anticipated day -to-
day fluctuations of these conditions. This includes those conditions identified during screening 
or identified during other study procedures performed before exposure to IMP.  
Note: Conditions present or occ urring prior to the time point from which AEs are collected 
should be recorded as concomitant illness/medical history.  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy). The condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE.  
 Medical or surgical procedures not preceded by an AE or worsening of a known condition.  
10.3.2  Definition of a serious adverse event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that fulfils at least one of the following criteria:  
 Results in death  
 
 Is life -threatening  
 The term ‘life-threatening’ refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at 
the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death, if it were more severe.

  Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolonga tion of existing hospitalisation  
 Hospitalisation signifies that the participant has been admitted at the hospital or emergency 
ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Compl ications that occur during hospitalisation are 
AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other seriousness criteria, the 
event is serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospitalisation’ occurred or was necessary, 
the AE should be consid ered serious.  
 Hospitalisation for elective treatment (e.g., elective medical or surgical procedures) of a 
condition that was present prior to the time point from which AEs are collected, and that did 
not worsen, is not considered an AE.  
Note: Hospitalisations for administrative, study -related, social and convenience reasons do not 
constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs.  Hospital admissions for 
medical or surgical procedures, planned before study inclusion, are not co nsidered AEs or SAEs  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 The term ‘disability’ means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. This definition is not intended to include experience of relatively  minor 
medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle), that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
 Important medical event:  
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in deciding whether 
SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations. This includes important medical events that 
may not be  immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may 
jeopardise the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be consi dered 
serious and reported as SAEs using the important medical event criterion.  
 The following must be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no 
other seriousness criteria are applicable:  
o Suspicion of transmission of infectious ag ents via IMP  
o Risk of liver injury defined as alanine aminotransferase or aspart ate 
aminotransferase  >3x UNL and total bilirubin >2x UNL where no alternative 
aetiology exists (Hy’s law)

 10.3.3  Description of  adverse event s requiring additional data collection and other events 
requiring collection of additional information  
Adverse events requiring additional data collection  
An AE requiring additional data collection is an AE where Novo Nordisk has evaluated that 
additional data is needed in the evaluation of safety.  A specific event form needs to be completed 
for these events.  
Medication error:  
 A medication error is an unintended failure in the IMP treatment process that leads to, or has the 
potential to lead to, harm to the participant, such as:  
 administration of wrong drug  
Note: Use of wrong DUN  is not considered a medication error unless it results in 
administration of wrong drug.  
 wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of subcutaneous  
 accidental administration of a lower or  higher dose than intended. The administered dose 
must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the study 
participant were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not 
necessarily occur.  
Misuse and abuse:  
 Situation s where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the 
protocol (e.g., overdose to maximise effect)  
 Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of an IMP which is accompanied by harmful 
physical or psychological effects (e.g., overdose with the intention to cause harm)  
Note: Medication error, misuse and abuse must always be reported on an AE form and a specific 
event form must be completed. The AE diagnosis on the AE form must reflect what occurred (e.g., 
accidental overd ose, intentional overdose or other). If the medication error and/or misuse and abuse 
resulted in a clinical consequence, this must be reported on an additional AE form.  
Hypersensitivity:  
Systemic hypersensitivity can be manifested as isolated symptoms such  as urticaria, angioedema, 
conjunctivitis, rhinitis, bronchospasm, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea , 
abdominal pain), or as anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock.  
Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially lethal, multisystem syndrome resulting  from the sudden release 
of mast cell - and basophil -derived mediators into the circulatio n.32 It most often results from 
immunologic reactions to foods, medications, and insect stings, although it can also be induced 
through nonimmunologic mechanisms by any agent capable of producing a sudden, systemic 
degranulation of mast cells or basophils33. Characteristic symptoms and signs, occurring minutes to 
a few hours after exposure to potential triggering agents or events may incl ude: flushing, urticaria, 
angioedema, hoarseness, throat tightness, stridor, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, 
abdominal pain, vomiting, and/or hypotension, dizziness or collapse.

 Local hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, redness, pruritus a nd oedema, may occur at the site 
of investigational drug injection.  
Drug hypersensitivity reactions are the adverse effects of pharmaceutical formulations (including 
active drugs and excipients) that clinically resemble allergy .34 They can be allergic and non -allergic.  
If a hypersensitivity event is suspected, the participant s must contact the site staff as soon as 
possible for further guidance. All events must be reported, and in case of systemic hypersensitivity, 
addition al information must be provided on a separate form .  
Injection site reactions : 
If an event of injection site reaction is observed, additional information must be obtained if 
available on a separate form.  
 
Acute gallbladder diseases : 
Events of symptomatic a cute gallbladder disease (including gallstones and cholecystitis)  
Malignant neoplasms : 
Confirmed malignant neoplasm by histopathology or other substantial clinical evidence  
Other events requiring collection of additional information  
Hypoglycaemic episodes   
All hypoglycaemic episodes must be recorded by the participant in the eDiary. Instructions on how 
to transfer SMPG values to the eDiary will be given to the participants . If the hypoglycaemic 
episode fulfils the criteria for an SAE the investigator/site must report it as such. One AE form and 
safety information form can cover several hypoglycaemic episodes, if the participant has not 
recovered between the episodes. For mor e information on hypoglycaemic episodes, please refer to 
Appendix  7 (Section  10.7). 
10.3.4  Recording and follow -up of adverse event  and/or serious adverse ev ent 
10.3.4.1  Adverse event  and serious adverse event  recording  
The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or 
other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be 
documented as the AE/SAE.  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics re ports) related to the event.  
There may be instances when copies of source documents (e.g., medical records) for certain cases 
are requested by Novo Nordisk. In such cases, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the

 subject ID, must be redacted on the copies of the source documents before submission to Novo 
Nordisk.  
For all non -serious AEs, the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the 
end of the study at the latest. For sign -off of SAE -related forms, refer to “AE and  SAE reporting via 
paper CRF” later in this section.  
Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication or NIMP: if an AE is considered to have a 
causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as NIMP or concomitant 
medication in the study , it is important that the suspected relationship is reported to Novo Nordisk, 
e.g., in the alternative aetiology section on the safety information form. Novo Nordisk may need to 
report this  AE to relevant regulatory authorities . 
10.3.4.2  Assessment of severity  
The investigator will assess severity for each event reported during the study and assign it to one of 
the following categories:  
 Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activitie s. 
 Moderate : An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
 Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
Note: An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Both AEs and 
SAEs  can be assessed as severe.  
10.3.4.3  Assessment of causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between IMP and the occurrence of each 
AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Relationship between an A E/SAE and the relevant IMP should be assessed as:  
 Probable  - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship.  
 Possible  - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.  
 Unlikely  - The event is most likely related to a etiology other than the IMP.  
Alternative aetiology, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other risk factors, 
as well as the temporal relationship of the event to IMP administration, should be considered and 
investigated.  
The investiga tor should use the  investigator’s brochure and/or product information, for marketed 
products, for the assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical 
records that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of c ausality.  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the investigator always 
makes an assessment of causality for every event before the  initial transmission of the SAE 
data .

 The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality, in light of follow -up information, and 
update the causality assessment in the CRF.  
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements  
10.3.4.4  Final outcome  
The investigator will select the most appropriate outcome:  
 Recovered/resolved : The participant has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment 
the condition has returned to the level observed when first documented  
 Recovering/resolving : The condition is improving, and the participant is expected to recover 
from the event.  This term may also be applicable for AEs ongoing at the time of death (where 
death was due to another AE).  
Note: For SAEs, this t erm is only applicable if the participant has completed the follow -up 
period and is expected to recover.  
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae : The participant has recovered from the condition but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or proce dure. If a sequela meets an SAE 
criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE.  
 Not recovered/not resolved : The condition of the participant has not improved, and the 
symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. This term may be applicable in cases o f 
chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE).  
 Fatal : This term is only applicable if the participant died from a condition related to the 
reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a participant before  he/she died should be 
assessed as ‘recovered/resolved’, ‘recovering/resolving’, ‘recovered/resolved with sequelae’ or 
‘not recovered/not resolved’. An AE with a fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE.  
 Unknown : This term is only applicable if the partici pant is lost to follow -up 
10.3.4.5  Follow -up of adverse event  and serious adverse event  
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Novo Nordisk to elu cidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible (e.g., severe hypersensitivity reactions, Hy’s 
law). This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
or consultation with other health care professionals.  
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognised  follow -up period, the 
investigator should, upon request, provide Novo Nordisk with a copy of the autopsy report 
including histopathology.  
New or updated info rmation should be recorded in the CRF.

 For SAEs, initial notification via telephone is acceptable, although it does n ot replace the need for 
the investigator to complete the AE and safety information forms within the designated reporting 
timelines (see Figure  10-1): 
 AE form within 24  hours  
 Safety information form within 5  calendar days  
 AE form and safety information form  must be signed within 7  calendar days after first 
knowledge by the investigator.  
 Specific event form within 14  calendar days.  
 For timelines related to events for adjudication, refer also to Appendix  9 (Section 10.9) and 
Figure  10-1. 
If the eCRF is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the sites will use the paper AE form, and if 
the eCRF is unavailable for more than 5 calendar days, then the site will use the paper safety 
information form. The site should enter the SAE data in the eCRF as soon as it becomes available.  
The relevant CRF forms (AE and sa fety information forms) must be forwarded to Novo Nordisk  in 
accordance with Section  10.1.5 . 
After the study is completed, the study database will b e locked, and the CRF will be 
decommissioned to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  If a site receives a 
report of a new SAE from a participant or receives updated information on a previously reported 
SAE after CRF decommission, the  site can report this information on a paper AE and safety 
information form (see below) or to Novo Nordisk by telephone.

 10.4 Appendix  4: Contraceptive guidance and collection of pregnancy information  
10.4.1  Definitions  
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile.  
If fertility is unclear (e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes), and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Females in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarcheal  
2. Females with one or more of the following:  
 Documented total hysterectomy  
 Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
 Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For females with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above 
(e.g., Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied in  
determining study enrolment.  
3. Postmenopausal female:  
 A postmenopausal state is defined as amenorrhoea for at least 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause in a female >  45 years of age.  Alternative medical causes for 
amenorrhoea include, but are no t limited to, hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy.  
 Females ≥ 60 years of age can be considered postmenopausal.  
Females on hormone replacement therapy  and whose menopausal status is in doubt are considered 
of childbearing potential and will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception 
methods.  
Note: Documentation regarding categories 1 -3 can come from the site staff’s review of particip ant’s 
medical records, medical examination or medical history interview.  
10.4.2  Contraceptive guidance  
Male participants  
No contraception measures are  required as the risk of teratogenicity/fetotoxicity caused by transfer 
of insulin icodec or semaglutide  in semin al fluid is unlikely .35   
Female participants  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use methods 
of contraception consistently and correctly. Table  10-3 lists the highly effective methods of 
contraception allowed. Local regulations may apply, see Appendix  11 (Section  10.11 ). 
Highly effective contraception should be utilised until the end of treatment.

 Highly effective contraception should be utilised for a least 35  days after last dose of IMP 
(corresponding to t ime during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure).  
Table  10-3 Highly effective contraceptive methods allowed36 
Highly effective methodsa (Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly):  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormo nal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationb 
 oral 
 intravaginal  
 transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
 oral 
 injectable  
 implantable  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing sys tem (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner  
Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential, and the absence of sperm has been confirme d. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 
90 days.  
 Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the participant.  
NOTES  
a. Contraceptive use by men or women should comply with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive 
methods for those participating in clinical studies.  
b. If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group guidelines, acceptable contraceptive 
methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action.  
 
The following methods are not acceptable methods of contraception: Periodic abstinence (calendar, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus  interruptus), spermicides only, and 
lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM).  
10.4.3  Collection of pregnancy information  
Female participants who become pregnant  
Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes pregnant 
while participating in this study.  
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to Novo Nordisk within 14 
calendar days of learning of a participant’s pregnancy (see Figure  10-2). 
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will 
collect follow -up information on participant and neonate which will be forwarded to Novo Nordisk 
within 14 calenda r days. Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer than 1 month beyond 
the delivery date.

 Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of foetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
While pregnancy i tself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any AE in connection with pregnancy 
or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. If 
relevant, consider adding ‘gestational’, ‘pregnancy -related’ or a similar term w hen reporting the 
AE/SAE.  
Pregnancy outcome should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Abnormal pregnancy 
outcome (e.g., spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies and ectopic 
pregnancy) is considered an SAE. In case of abnormal pregnancy outcome, paternal information 
should be recorded in the appropriate form after obtaining the necessary signed paternal informed 
consent.  
If the investigator learns of an SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which i s 
considered related to the IMP by the investigator, the SAE should be reported to Novo Nordisk as 
described in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3.)

 10.5 Appendix  5: Technical complaints:  Definition and procedures for recording, 
evaluation, follow -up and reporting  
10.5.1  Definition of technical complaint  
A technical complaint is any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges product 
(medicine or device) defects. The technical complain t may be associated with an AE but does not 
concern the AE itself.  
Examples of technical complaints:  
 Problems with the physical or chemical appearance of IMPs  or auxiliary supplies  (e.g., 
discoloration, particles or contamination)  
 Problems with packaging material including labelling  
 Problems related to devices (e.g., to the injection mechanism, dose setting mechanism, push 
button or interface between the pen -injector and the needle)  
Time period for detecting technical complaints  
All technical complaints wh ich occur from the time of receipt of the product at site until the time of 
the last usage of the product must be collected for products predefined on the technical complaint 
form.  
10.5.2  Recording and follow -up of technical complaints  
Reporting of technical comp laints to Novo Nordisk  
For contact details for Customer Complaint Center, please refer to Attachment I . 
Technical complaints on products allocated to a participant must be reported on a separate technical 
complaint form:  
1. For products with DUN: One technica l complaint form must be completed for each affected 
DUN.  
2. For products without DUN: One technical complaint form must be completed for each batch, 
code or lot number.  
Timelines for reporting technical complaints to Novo Nordisk  
The investigator must comple te the technical complaint form in the CRF within:  
 24 hours if related to an SAE  
 5 days calendar for all other technical complaints   
If the CRF is unavailable, or when reporting a technical complaint on a product that is not yet 
allocated to a participant, the information must be provided on a paper form to Customer Complaint 
Center, Novo Nordisk, within the same timelines as stated abo ve. When the CRF becomes available 
again, the investigator must enter the information on the technical complaint form in the CRF.

 Follow -up of technical complaints  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that new or updated information will be recorde d on the 
originally completed form.  
Collection, storage and shipment of technical complaint samples  
The investigator must collect the technical complaint sample and all associated parts and notify the 
monitor within 5  calendar days of obtaining the sample at site. The sample and all associated parts 
must be sent as soon as possible to Customer Complaint Center, Novo Nordisk, together with a 
copy of the completed technical complaint form. The technical complaint sample should contain the 
batch, code or lot n umber and, if available, the DUN. If the technical complaint sample is 
unobtainable, the reason must be stated on the technical complaint form. If several samples are 
shipped in one shipment, the sample and the corresponding technical complaint form should  be kept 
together.  
Storage of the technical complaint sample must be done in accordance with the conditions 
prescribed for the study intervention.  
10.5.3  Reporting of technical complaints for products not included in the technical 
complaint form

 10.6 Appendix  6: Retention of human biosamples  
Hypersensitivity reaction samples  
In case of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction, the additional blood samples taken in relation to the 
reaction (Section  8.7 and 10.2)  may be retained to follow -up on the hypersensitivity reaction. If 
deemed relevant by Novo Nordisk, relevant exploratory tests may be performed, e.g. histamine 
release (basophil activation). If measured, such data will be repor ted in a separate report.  
The samples will be stored at a central laboratory, at a central storage facility, and/or at an analysing 
laboratory  contracted by Novo Nordisk. The samples might be transferred to other countries, if not 
prohibited by local regulations. Only Novo Nordisk staff and bio -repository personnel will have 
access to the stored samples.  The samples may be shipped to a contract research organisation for 
analysis.  
The samples will be anonymised (identified only by a unique sample ID, vi sit number, study 
identification number and sampling date). Confidentiality and personal data protection will be 
ensured during storage after the end of the study  and no direct identification of the participant  will 
be stored together with the samples.  
Potential further analyses of the samples will not have any consequences for the  participant  and 
their relatives. Participant s can contact the investigator if they wish to be informed about results 
derived from stored  antibody samples  obtained from their own  body.  
The samples will be stored at Novo Nordisk or a Novo Nordisk designated referral central 
bio-repository  after the end of the study  and until marketing authorisation approval or until the 
research project terminates, but no longer than 15 years from  the end of the study , after which they 
will be destroyed.  
Antibody samples   
Antibody samples may be retained for later analysis for further characterisation of antibody 
responses towards drug, if required by health authorities or for safety reasons . A fraction of the 
individual participant samples may be pooled and used for further development of antibody assays , 
or for generat ing reagents for in study validation and control of future assay performance . 
The antibody samples will be stored at Novo Nordisk  or at a designated referral central 
bio-repository  after the end of the study  and until marketing authorisation approval or until the 
research project terminates, but no longer than 15 years from  the end of the study  after which they 
will be destro yed. 
Metabolism samples (PK samples)  
Samples for metabolism analysis may be retained for later analysis of metabolites if needed. The 
samples will be stored at Novo Nordisk  or at a designated referral central bio -repository  after end of 
study and until marketing authorisation approval or until the research project terminates, but no 
longer than 15 years from end of study after which they will be destroyed.

impairment requiring external assistance for recovery  
Notes: The Novo Nordisk terms are adapted from The International Hypoglycaemia Study Group ,37 ADA,38 ISPAD,39 
type 1 diabete s outcomes program ,40 Adva nced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes .41 Severe hypoglycaemia as 
defined by Seaquist42 and ISPAD.39 
 
Severe hypoglycaemia  
1Severe hypoglycaemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrates,  glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be 
available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to 
normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a lo w plasma glucose 
concentration.42 
Noctu rnal hypoglycaemia  
Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes: episodes occurring between 00:01 and 05:59 both inclusive.  
Reporting of hypoglycaemic episodes  
Reporting of hypoglycaemic episodes by BG meters:  
Plasma glucose (PG) should always be recorded in the (e)diary  when a hypoglycaemic episode is 
suspected.  
When a participant experiences a hypoglycaemic episode, the participant should record the general 
information in relation to the hypoglycaemia (timing, PG measurements, symptoms, etc.) as 
described in the  e-diary. The investigator should ensure correct reporting of the hypoglycaemic 
episode. In case a participant is not able to fill in the e -diary (e.g., in case of hospitalisation), the 
investigator should still report the hypoglycaemic episode on the hypo glycaemic episodes form.  
Upon onset of a hypoglycaemic episode the participant is recommended to measure PG every 15 
minutes until the PG value is ≥3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved in 
accordance with current guidelines.42 
Repeated PG measurements and/or symptoms will by default be considered as one hypoglycaemic 
episode until a succeeding PG value is ≥ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been 
resolved and should be reported as only one hypoglycaemic episode. In case of several low PG

 values within the hypoglycaemic  episode, the lowest value is the one that will be reported as the PG 
value for the hypoglycaemic episode, but the start time of the episode will remain as the time for the 
first low PG value and/or symptom. The remaining values will be kept as source data . 
If the severity of a hypoglycaemic episode changes, only one hypoglycaemic episode will be 
reported, reflecting the most severe degree of hypoglycaemia.  
Regarding the question: “To feel better, did you need help to get a sugary drink, food, or 
medicine?”  the investigator must instruct the participants to answer “Yes”, if the episode was an 
event that required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or 
take other corrective actions. PG concentrations may not be available  during an event, but 
neurological recovery following the return of PG to normal is considered sufficient evidence that 
the event was induced by a low PG concentration.42 
Please refer to Section 10.3.3  for information regarding reporting of hypoglycaemia in the eDiary.  
Diary review  
At each contact the investigator must review the diary data for correct reporting of PG values and 
hypoglycaemi c episodes. In case of incomplete or incorrect data in the diary, the participant must be 
questioned whether there have been any severe hypoglycaemic episodes since the last visit and 
report accordingly.  
Re-training of participants  
The participant must be re-trained in how to report hypoglycaemic episodes if the investigator 
identifies low PG values not reported as hypoglycaemic episodes. The training should be 
documented by the investigator in source documents.

 10.8 Appendix  8: Titration guideline  
Titration guidelines have been developed, providing recommended dose adjustments at different PG 
levels to ensure that  participants  receive an optimal treatment. However, it is recognised that 
treatment with insulin and combination products containing insu lin should be individualised , and 
the specific titration algorithms may not be applicable in certain clinical situations. Hence, it is 
important that other information, such as symptoms of hypo/hyperglycaemia, previous response to 
dose adjustments, other g lucose measurements and other indicators of the participant’s  level of 
glycaemic control, is taken into consideration when decisions on dosing are made. The investigator 
is responsible for the treatment of the participants  and can therefore overrule the gu idelines to avoid 
safety hazards.  
Initiation of trial products  
At randomisation, eligible participants will be randomised to receive IcoSema or insulin icodec.  
IcoSema  should be taken once weekly at the same day of the week. The starting dose at 
randomisat ion (V2) will be 40 dose steps, which is equivalent to 40 units of insulin icodec and 
0.114 mg of semaglutide.  
Insulin icodec  should be taken once weekly at the same day of the week. All participants should 
receive a loading dose at randomisation (V2), whi ch consist s of total daily basal insulin dose before 
randomisation x 7 + 50% of their total daily basal insulin dose  x 7. The following weekly dose (V3) 
should be the total daily dose x 7. In  Table  10-5, the weekly V2 and V3 doses for participants 
receiving from 20 units to 80 units per day have been calculated. Please, note that the displayed 
values are rounded to the nearest dose that is dividable by 10.

 The dose adjustment will be based on the three pre -breakfast SMPG values measured on two days 
prior to the dose adjustment and on the day of the contact.  
If one or more pre -breakfast SMPG values are missing, the dose adjustment should be performed on 
the remaining SMPG value(s).  
Adjustment of IcoSema and insulin icodec will be done in accordance with  Table  10-6.

Deviations from the algorithm  
It is recommended that the algorithm is followed. However, it is also important that the decision to 
adjust insulin doses is based on all relevant information. A reason for deviating from the algorithm 
should be entered into the HCP portal by the investigator, as applicable.  
Missing IcoSema and insulin icodec dose guidance  
If an IcoSema or insulin icodec dose is missed for ≤ 3 days after the planned dosing day, the 
participants should inject the planned dose. If the dose is missed for > 3 days, the participants 
should await the next planned day of injection. Please note that the visit window is +/ - 3 days.  
Dose recommend ation from end of treatment and during follow -up 
If it is decided that the participant should continue basal insulin treatment after end of study it is 
recommended that the participant is switched from IcoSema or insulin icodec to any available daily 
basal  insulin at the discretion of the investigator. The following should be considered:  
 Calculate the new daily  basal insulin dose by dividing the latest IcoSema dose in dose step or 
insulin icodec dose in units by 7.  
 Initiate the new daily basal insulin two weeks  after the last injection of IcoSema or insulin 
icodec.  
 Continue to measure pre -breakfast SMPG daily in the follow -up period. If pre -breakfast SMPG 
exceeds 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL), consider initiating the daily basal insulin dose earlier than 
two week s after the last dose of IcoSema or insulin icodec.  
 Consider titrating the basal insulin once or twice weekly according to the pre -breakfast SMPG 
values and the local label of the chosen insulin.  
If it is decided that the participant is switched to a GLP -1 receptor agonist, the start should also 
await two weeks off IcoSema. Thereafter, the treatment can be initiated in accordance with local 
label for the individual product.

 Data collection  
The participant should be instructed to report the following:  
 Date, dose and time of IcoSema or insulin icodec injections should be reported in the eDiary.  
 Injection site area of IcoSema  and insulin icodec . The investigator must  then register the 
injection site area in the eCRF  
 SMPG values with an indication of “pre -breakf ast” or “other” should be reported in the eDiary.  
 Hypoglycaemic episodes as described in  Appendix  3 (Section  10.3) and Appendix 7 (Section 
10.7) should be reported in the eDiary.  
While using the HCP web portal for titration, the following will be entered by investigator:  
 IcoSema or insulin icodec doses prescribed at this contact.  
 Reasons for deviation from the titration algorithm, if applicable.  
Data surveillance  
Surveillance of titration data will be performed centrally by Novo Nordisk in an unbiased manner. 
The data will be reviewed and significant deviations from the titration a lgorithm will be followed 
up. 
Titration data will consist of:  
 Relevant SMPG values  
 Recommended IcoSema or insulin icodec doses  
 Prescribed IcoSema or insulin icodec doses  
 Actual IcoSema or insulin icodec doses taken by the participant  
 Reasons for deviation from the titration guidelines. Deviations are divided into  
 “hypoglycaemia”  
 “gastrointestinal adverse event”  
 “other, please specify”  
 Hypoglycaemia information  
It is important that titration data are entered into the eDiary and into the eCRF in a timely manner, 
as the aim is to reduce the time in which the participant may receive inadequate treatment.  
The titration data should be reviewed by Novo Nordisk within 24 hours (on workdays). Novo 
Nordisk may contact the investigator by phone or via an online por tal (CONNECT) after e -mail 
notification to clarify reasons for deviation or to request entry of missing data. When the 
investigator receives an inquiry, a response should be received at Novo Nordisk within 24 hours (on 
workdays).  
Novo Nordisk will also  monitor changes in HbA 1c. Novo Nordisk’s medical staff may (virtually) 
visit at regular intervals to discuss progress in glycaemic control and titration of individual 
participants .

 10.9 Appendix  9:  Events requiring adjudication  
Event adjudication will be perf ormed in randomised participants. An event for adjudication is a 
selected AE or death evaluated by an independent external Event adjudication committee (EAC) in 
a blinded manner, please refer to Table  10-7 for event types in scope.  
For details on the EAC, refer to Appendix  1 (Section  10.1.6.2 ). 
Table  10-7 Adverse events requiring event adjudication  
Event type (AE category)  
(serious and non -serious AEs)  Description  
Death   All cause death  
Acute coronary syndrome (acute myocardial 
infarction and unstable angina pectoris requiring 
hospitalisation)   All types of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina 
pectoris requiring hospitalisation  
Cerebrovascular event (stroke and transient 
ischemic attack)   Episode of focal or global neurological dy sfunction that could be 
caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result 
of haemorrhage or ischemia, with or without infarction  
Heart failure (requiring hospitalisation and 
urgent heart failure visits)   New episode or worsening of existing heart failure leading to an 
urgent, unscheduled hospital admission or 
clinic/office/emergency department visit  
 
There are four ways to identify events relevant for adjudication as described below:  
1. Investigator -reported events for adjudication: in vestigator selects the appropriate AE category 
relevant for adjudication (see Table  10-7). 
2. AEs reported with fatal outcome  
3. AE search (standardised screening): All AEs not reported with an AE category relevant for 
adjudication will undergo screening to identify potential events for adjudication. Investigators 
will be notified of these events in the CRF.  
4. EAC -identified events: Unreported events relevan t for adjudication identified by the EAC 
during review of source documents provided for another event for adjudication. Investigators 
will be notified of these events in the CRF and has the option to report the EAC -identified 
event.  
For each event relevant  for adjudication, an event type specific adjudication form should be 
completed in the CRF within 14 days ( Figure  10-1). 
Copies of source documents shoul d be uploaded to the EAS as soon as possible and preferably 
within 4 weeks ( Figure  10-1). In cases where the EAS is not accessible for document upload, the 
investigator should ensure that the relevant source documents are collected and saved locally until 
the EAS is available. If no, or insufficient source documents are provided to the adjudication 
supplier, the investigator can be asked to complete a cli nical narrative to be uploaded to the EAS.  
If new information becomes available for an event sent for adjudication, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure the new information is uploaded to the EAS.

 10.10  Appendix  10: Mitigations to ensure participant safety and data integrity during an 
emergency situation  
10.10.1  Definition and scope of appendix  
A major emergency is defined as a situation that causes substantial restrictions to study site access 
for participants and/or sponsor representatives.  
In case local restrictions due to a major emergency , e.g. due to a COVID -19 outbreak,  lead to lock -
down of a site, the site must contact Novo Nordisk to allow for implementation of mitigations 
mentioned in this appendix base d on mutual agreement.  
According to local regulation, health authorities and independent ethics committees should be 
notified in case elements of the emergency appendix are activated.  
Table  10-8 indicates the minimum requirements for assessments that should be performed during a 
lock-down, but sites should always try to follow the assessments outlined in the original flowchart 
(Sectio n 1.2) to the extent possible. Implementation of specific mitigations should be based on 
assessment of feasibility at the individual site.   
Alternativ e visit formats are examples of the mitigations that can be implement ed: 
 Home visits: visits to be performed at the participant´s home   
 Off-site visits: visits to be performed at a place other than the site or the participant´s home   
Alternative visit formats and all other mitigations mentioned in this appendix can be implemented 
only if allowed and deemed feasible according to local regulations, requirements and/or guidelines 
at the sites  and countries  and should be performed by the s ite-staff. As a pre -requisite, sites need to 
ensure that the study site staff is covered by workers' compensation insurance, also when 
performing home and off -site visits.  
Sites should comply with local regulations, requirements and/or guidelines if they a re issued.  
10.10.2  Visits  
Screening (V1) and randomisation/baseline (V2) should always be performed as on -site visits. If a 
site is unable to perform these visits on -site, screening and randomisation of new participants at that 
site should be on hold until on -site visits are possible.  
Visits 4  and 8 should always be performed as on -site visits  to ensure collection of , at least,  
antibodies and PK samples .  
The visit at week 52 (V54) should always be performed as on -site visit . The visit window can be 
extended for up to 28 days . Participants should continue randomised treatment  until the visit at 
week 52 (V54)  takes place.   
The last follow -up visit  (V56) should always be performed as on -site visit  to ensure, at least, 
collection  of antibodies and PK samples.

 On-site visits ( visits V3, V5, V6, V12,  V16, V20, V24 , V28, V30, V34, V 38, V42, V46, V49 , V50, 
V51, V52, V53, V55 ) can be converted to remote visits (video, phone or similar) or home or off -site 
visits.   
At each visit, the in vestigator must indicate in the CRF how the visit was performed and specify the 
reason for the preferred assessment method.  
10.10.3  Assessments  
Assessments used for safety or the confirmatory endpoints (i.e.,  HbA1c, and body  weight ) should 
be prioritised , as well as antibodies , PK and CGM . The preferred order for the method of 
assessment is  shown in  Table  10-8): 
HbA 1c should be prioritised and be performed on -site at least at V1, V2 and V54.  
Body weight should be prioritised and be performed on -site at least at V1, V2 and V54 . 
Antibodies and PK should be prioritised and be performed on -site at least at V2  (antibodies only) , 
V4, V8, V54 and V56 . 
CGM  fitting and training  at V49 should  be prioritised and preferably  be on-site visit, but if not 
possible then home and off-site visit can be performed . If not on site remember to perform device 
initialisation at site before meeting the participant for CGM fitting.  
The site staff is responsible for providing appropriate training to the participant, enabling the 
participants to change the s ensor by themselves.  
The site should instruct the participants in manually stopping the sensor in the receiver menu when 
each sensor session is complete, and to keep the battery charged.  
If not possible to perform V50 , V52 and V53  as on -site visit, this can be performed as home, 
off-site visit or be conducted over the phone or  as video call.  
CGM fitting at V51 should be prioritised and preferably be on -site visit, but if not possible then 
home and off -site visit can be performed. CGM data must be upl oaded by the site staff to the CGM 
software . 
The site staff should ensure that the participant has fitted the sensor correctly and that the CGM 
receiver is working, especially when fitting of the sensor is performed over the phone or as video 
call. 
CGM dat a upload at V54 should be prioritised and be performed as on -site visit.  CGM data must be 
uploaded at the site by the site staff to the CGM software.  
The site should instruct the participants in manually stopping the sensor in the Receiver menu when 
the CG M period is complete , and to keep the battery charged . The site staff can collect the receiver 
from the participant up to 4 weeks later and bring the receiver to the site for CGM data upload .

 Specifications regarding how to perform these assessments using remote visits (phone visits or 
video contact)  or as home visits or off -site visits will be provided by Novo Nordisk  or the vendor.  
All laboratory samples should be analysed at the central and special laborator ies.  In case of lock 
down of the site, samples of V1, V2, V4, V 8, V54 and V56 should be prioritised , and the  Lack of 
Efficacy Criteria  5, Section 7.1.1  would be evaluated based on the SMPG only (instead of 
evaluating based on SMPG and  FPG).  
Home measurements of pregnancy test s and vital signs  (other than the ones to be collected at V1, 
V2 and  V54)  can be performed if on -site visits are not possible and if deemed feasible for the 
participant. Only findings meeting the definition for an AE (refer to Appendix  3 [Section  10.3]) 
should be reported in the CRF. Pregnancy tests  and equipment to perform vital signs  can be 
delivered  to the participants if on-site visits are not possible. The site is responsible for contr acting a 
suitable courier and costs will be reimbursed by Novo N ordisk. Participants ´ own home scales 
cannot be used for measuring body weight . 
If the assessments indicated in Table  10-8 cannot be performed as on -site visits, home -visits or  
remote visits  (video, phone or similar) , they should be performed at the first possible timepoint 
following the originally scheduled visit in agreement with Novo Nordisk.  
10.10.4  Study intervention  
Alternative dispensing methods of study intervention may be implemented, and details will be 
communicated and documented. The dispensing options will be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S and 
will be based on options and requirements at country level and if permitted by local regulations.

2 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
 
2.1 Background  Information  
 
The primary hypothesis of the present study is that supplementation with the Tension Relief test 
product will reduce the se verity of symptoms of a tension headache.  
 
A tension headache is generally a diffuse, mild to moderate pain in your head that's often described 
as a dull, aching head pain that feels like a tight band around your head. They can be episodic or 
chronic in nature. They are the most common type of primary headaches and affects approximately 
80% of the population. Because of its high prevalence, the socio -economic consequences of tension 
type headache are significant as they are associated with incr eased depression, anxiety, insomnia 
and overall decrease in quality of life. [4] In one population study, persons with episodic tension 
type headache reported a mean of nine lost work days and five reduced -effectiveness days, while 
persons with chronic ten sion type headache reported a mean of 27 lost work days and 20 reduced -
effectiveness days .[17] The burden is particularly high for the minority who has substantial and 
complicating co -morbidities . [18] 
The two main therapeutic avenues of tension type heada che are acute and prophylactic treatment. 
Simple or combined analgesics are the mainstay of acute treatment. Prophylactic treatment is 
needed in case of attacks that are frequent and/or difficult to treat. [4]  
All efforts to develop nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are devoid of 
gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system effects are still far from achieving a breakthrough. In 
order to avoid medications but still receive treatment for pain, there has been some existing 
research completed, demonstrating effective all natural solutions, such as  sublingual 
feverfew/ginger as a first -line abortive treatment for a population of migraineurs who frequently 
experience mild headache prior to the onset of  moderate to severe headache. [11, 3]  
Consequently, HLNatural  was formed to create an all-natural, herbal remedy product that is 
designed to avoid unnecessary synthetics, sweeteners, and preservatives found in over the counter 
remedies today while still pr oviding safe and effective relief. Tension Relief test  product  is a plant -
based remedy formulated with herbal and mineral ingredients with reported potential to reduce 
symptoms of a tension headache. The products combine ingredients previously reported as 
potentially beneficial into an easy -to-consume capsule designed for intake up to three  times per 
day. The test product is 1) Magnesium Glycinate, 2) Boswellia (40% Boswellic Acid), 3) White Willow 
Bark (15% Salicin), 4) Skullcap, 5) Feverfew, 6) a vegetari an capsule made of cellulose and water, and 
7) Rice Hull Concentrate. Below, the  7 ingredients of the test product are listed. All ingredients are 
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the FDA.  
Tension Relief  
Active Ingredients: Magnesium (as Magnesium glycinate), Boswellia (40% Boswellic acids), 
White Willow Bark (15%Salicin), Skullcap, Feverfew . 
10 
 Inactive Ingredients: Vegetarian capsule (vegetable cellulose, water), Rice Hull Concentrate .  
The ingredients in the Tension Relief test product have been included because they are potentially 
beneficial in promoting both head and body comfort. The justifications for their inclusion are briefly 
described here:  
 
Magnesium  is an important mineral in the body that acts as a cofactor to many physiological 
processes, and it is estimated that the majority of Americans do not get enough from the diet. 
Scientific investigation has confirmed that Magnesium improves cognition, promotes comfort, while 
also inc reasing calmness and energy. For example, in a clinical study of 78 people magnesium 
supplementation resulted in both significantly increased head comfort, but also increased brain 
energy. [16]  
 
Boswellia  is also known as guggle or frankincense. Boswellia has had mounting scientific research 
which confirms its use for a number of pain -relieving conditions.  This is mainly due to its confirmed 
activity of promoting cytokine balance and comfort. Boswellia extracts have gained attention 
additionally because th eir mechanism of action is entirely different than that of the NSAIDs. The 
Boswellic acids inhibit the enzyme 5 -LOX (5 lipoxygenase), thereby reducing inflammatory signaling 
molecules. Clinical trials have shown efficacy for promoting comfort and cytokine balance in 
different body systems. For example, one clinical study found Boswellia to promote long -lasting 
head comfort. Several other clinical studies found Boswellia to promote both joint comfort and 
cytokine balance. [6, 9, 11, 20]  
 
 
White Willow Bark is included for its ability to promote both head and body comfort. Although 
White Willow Bark is famous as being a source of salicylates, from which salicylic acid and Aspirin 
are produced, its activity is thought to not be due to just this component. Whit e Willow Bark extract 
also contains other phytochemicals, such as antioxidant flavonoids and bioactive tannins, which are 
thought to play a synergistic role in promoting cytokine balance and head and body comfort.  For 
example, an extract of willow bark wa s found to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) -2 mediated 
prostaglandin release, but not directly affect COX -1 or COX -2 activity. Additionally, constituents 
other  than salicin have been found to prevent prostaglandin and cytokine release. Several clinical 
studies  have found White Willow Bark to have beneficial effects while being tolerated much better 
than Aspirin. For example, in a Cochrane systematic review of studies, White Willow Bark 
(standardized to 120 -240 mg salicin) was found to significantly promote comf ort in the short -term 
compared to placebo. [2, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]  
 
Skullcap is an herb belonging  to the herbal class of plants called “nervines”, or tonics for the central 
nervous system. Generally, nervines are known to promote feelings of calm and r elax the body and 
mind. Skullcap has an herbal history for the use of a number of tension -related conditions, including 
tension felt in the head. Its inclusion in Tension Relief promotes feelings of calm, while also 
promoting comfort. For example, in a cli nical study involving healthy volunteers (with a low amount 
of tension), Skullcap was found to significantly enhance global mood. [7 , 26, 27 ] 
 
Feverfew  is a well-known  herb used for head comfort. This plant which produces masses of cheery 
white daisies has  long been used for promoting head comfort and cytokine balance. Clinical studies 
have shown Feverfew to not only promote head comfort, but also reduce sensitivity to light and 
noise, and improve quality of life in some people. [3, 10 , 28, 29, 30 ] 
11 
  
2.2 Scientific Rationale  
This test product was designed based on promising clinical research evaluating utilization of 
natural ingredients to safely impact the symptoms of tension headaches. While the 
evidence to support the use of these individual active ingredients is growing, well -design ed 
human clinical trials showing benefit are necessary to demonstrate efficacy of the test 
product’s unique formulation . 
Thus, the present study will include at least 200 patients who suffer the symptoms of mild 
to moderate tension headaches and will obser ve the level of symptoms reduction in this 
population after consuming the test product.   
 
2.2.1 Potential Risk  
Minimal risk is foreseen for participant s through their participation in the study. All the 
ingredients composing the test product are Generally Recog nized as Safe (GRAS) by the 
FDA for daily consumption at their present concentrations.  
The ingredients in th e test product have shown to have some theoretical drug 
interactions which have been listed in the appendix . (Appendix A)   
Potential side-effects have been observed in high doses which are significantly greater 
than the dose of the capsule as recommended in the instruction for use:  
• Diarrhea  
• Nausea  
• Stomach Cramps  
• Acid Reflux  
• Skin Rashes  
• GI Bleeding  
• Headaches  
• Liver Damage  
 
This study is determined by Sponsor and Principal Investigator to be a Minimal Risk 
Study.  
Minimal risk is defined by 45 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46.102 (i) as follows:  
12 
 “Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipate d in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests.”  
Refer to: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm#46.102  
 
2.2.2 Known Potential Benefits  
As with all medications, o ver the counter and prescription remedies for tension 
headaches may have  undesirable side effects. Addit ionally, these products are known to 
contain additives, dyes, fillers and other unnatural or synthetic ingredients that 
consumers are  looking to avoid. As such, these consumers are  seeking natural, plant -
based alternatives for symptom relief. Research part icipants may benefit from the 
intervention by eliminating such unwanted  side effects when treating their symptoms of 
pain and/or tension headache while achieving symptom relief.  If the intervention is 
shown to be efficacious, this would provide a viable p revention option for others in the 
general population to decrease their need for drugs that contain undesired ingredients. 
Other benefits include detailed surveillance of symptoms and documentation of 
activities, routine medications and supplements that may provide participants  and their 
regular physician or other healthcare provider with useful information for diagnosis and 
treatment of symptoms should they occur.  
 
2.2.3 Minimization of Risks  
 
Research participants will be carefully screened to meet enrollment criteria. Participants 
meeting exclusion criteria will not be enrolled. The study participant informed consent 
will be presented with clear description of the study requirements and  opportunity to 
have questions answered before enrollment. Once an event occurs review of symptoms 
will be ascertained at 15 and 30 minutes  for up to an hour. Reporting of adverse events 
will be reviewed routinely and in accordance with regulatory guidelin es (21CFR, GCP) by 
the Principal Investigator. Participants with occurrence of worsening symptoms or 
adverse events  should stop taking the test product and  may seek medical attention and 
exit the study.  
 
3 Study Objectives  
Beyond  the obvious physical symptoms,  lifestyle impact related to tension headaches 
include decreased work productivity and lost work time  [17, 18] . The purpose of the present 
study is to 1) evaluate the impact of the tension relief test product on the symptoms of 
tension headaches and functional status in adult men and women who suffer from mild to 
moderate tension headaches by using the 10 -point Mankoski scale [19] and 2) the 
13 
 subjective experience of these participant s related to general health, symptoms of tension 
headaches, and personal experience with the product s.  
This will be evaluated based on the primary and secondary endpoints. These endpoints, the 
analysis populations, and their respective measures are descri bed below. Further details on 
the methods for measuring the outcomes can be found in the Study Outcome Measures 
and Analysis Plan sections.  
 
 Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is reduction in tension headache severity. Patients will be asked to 
rate h eadache on the 10 -point Mankoski scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the product, 
15 minutes after taking the product, 30 minutes after taking the product and 1 hour after 
taking the product. The improvement in symptoms from baseline will be evaluated on a 
pairwise basis separately for each time point. P -values will be computed for the 
improvement . 
 
 There is no control group for the primary analysis.  
 
 Secondary Endpoints:  
• The time to other intervention will be analyzed.  
• A longitudinal analysis will be performed for patients who report on more than one 
incident of headache.  
• Comparison against the participant’s normal behavior . 
• Net Promoter Score . 
● Adverse events will be summarized.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
in similar studies appearing in the literature. There will be no formal statistical 
comparison of results from this study and historical studies . 
 
4 Study Design  
 
The present study will be a  prospective, one arm observational study. Patients will begin taking the 
capsules at the onset of headache symptoms. Onset is defined as the time the participant take s the 
test product for relief of symptoms.  When the participant decides to take the test product, they will 
report symptoms in the headache diary immediately before to taking the product and rate their 
symptoms on a 10 -point Mankoski scale. After consuming the product, the participant will complete 
a Mankoski scale at 15 minutes, 30 minutes an d 1 hour after taking the product. If needed the 
participant will be allowed to take alternative medication (alternative treatment) after an hour after 
taking the product. If alternative medication is taken, the participant will record this in their 
headac he diary.  
 
Study enrollment and management will be de -centralized, where participants do not visit an 
investigator or a clinic for clinical assessment. The participants will participate in the study at home.  
14 
 All data collected from during this study will  be reported by the patient via eCRFs, eDiary, and other 
electronic data entries.  If a visit is required, it will be conduct ed via remote contact b y telephone .  
 
4.1 Test  Product  
 
Below are descriptions of the test products and their ingredients.  
 
Tension Relief Product  
 
Description: Combining Boswellia, Magnesium, Feverfew, Skullcap and White Willow Bark for 
multi -faceted effective, yet health -building head comfort. This formula is designed to promote 
comfort of th e head and body in the short -term.  
 
Active Ingredients: Magnesium (as Magnesium glycinate), Boswellia (40% Boswellic  acids), 
White Willow Bark (15%Salicin), Skullcap, Feverfew . 
 
Inactive Ingredients: Vegetarian capsule (vegetable cellulose, water) Rice Hul l Concentrate . 
 
 
 
 
4.2 Required Behavior  
 
During the 1 hour after taking the test product, no medication  or supplementation (including 
all CBD products)  other than the test product should be taken.  Once the 1 -hour report has 
been submitted the patient may take other medications.  
 

15 
 Patients are as ked to limit the consumption of alcohol beverages to less than or equal to two 
drinks per day  and to abstain from  the use of cannabis for the duration of the study .  
 
4.3 Participation Period  
Participants are expected to participate in the study for 60 days af ter study start. The product 
may be used after each onset of tension headache, but not more often than three times per 
day. Patients will be discontinued from the study 60 days after study start or after three 
recorded headache episodes . Study start is defined as the day the participant received the test 
product  and completed the receipt of test product form.  
 
4.4 Data Collection  
All data in the present study will be self -reported by the participant and collected via their 
online portal (Hawthorne Effect Study Visit Management System (HE VMS )). Participants will be 
asked to take the test product according to the instructions for use, complete study surveys and 
respond to study reminders during the course of the study. The instructi ons for use and study 
forms  can be found in the appendix . (Appendices B, D, E, F, G ) 
 
5 Study Population  
 
5.1 Selection of the study Population  
 
The study population will consist of at least 200 adult patients who suffer from symptoms of tension 
headaches and who have completed the self -enrollment form and who meet the inclusion -exclusion 
criterion. The participants  will otherwise be in good health .  
The target sample size for this study is initially 200 participants, with a desired sample of 97 treated 
participants . This is described in detail in the Statistical Considerations section.  
At such time as 180 participants have been enrolled, the available data will be analyzed using a 
constant hazard model to determine if it seems realistic that the desired number of 97 treated 
patients will be met by the end of follow -up. If the expected nu mber of treated patients is less than 
97, the target sample size will be increased as needed, considering both the desire for 97 treated 
participants and the timelines of the trial sponsor. The actual outcomes of treated participants will 
not be considered  in this analysis, merely whether or not enrolled participants have reported 
starting using the test product.  
Enrollment will be stopped once 200 patients have been enrolled, no further patients will be offered 
a place in the trial once the target sample size criteria has been met.   All patients who have already 
been offered places, but who have not yet consented, will be allowed to participate as l ong as they 
have signed the study consent within 15 days and the total number of participants does not exceed 
125% of the target  (either 200 or the recomputed target if recomputation has been performed) .  
16 
 In order to ensure an age and sex distribution that  is reasonably representative of the US 
population, enrollment may be stopped early in some age and sex groups.  
Target population for this study are candidates who suffer from mild to moderate tension 
headaches.  
 
Participants  will be enrolled from across the United States. No participants  will be enrolled outside 
of the United States. It is expected that the geographical distribution of the participant s enrolled in 
the study will correlate with the geographical distribution of the general population across  the 
United States.  
 
Participants  will be recruited via  digital advertisements and social media . 
 
After clicking on an advertisement, potential participant s will then be directed to a website where 
they will complete a screening questionnaire (See Appendix  C). The screening questionnaire will 
automatically qualify or disqualify them for study participation. If the participant  qualifies, they  will 
be provided  an informed consent. Upon completion of the informed consent they will be deemed 
enrolled in the study.  
 
5.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Prior to being enrolled, participant s will fill out a screening questionnaire. The screening 
questionnaire will automatic ally qualify or disqualify them for study participation. The full screening 
questionnaire can be found in the Appendix. (Appendix C ) 
Inclusion Criteria:  
Adult candidates who are in overall good health and who suffer from mild to moderate tension 
headaches.  
Participant s will be deemed to be in good health if they do not report any of the existing medical 
conditions asked about in the screening questionnaire.  
Exclusion Criteria:  
 
17 
 ● Those w ho have been diagnosed with migraine  headaches . 
● Those who score between 36 -40 or 66-78 on screening questionnaire . 
● Is < 18 years of age  
● Women that are pregnant or breastfeeding . 
● Alcohol consumption more than 10 drinks per week .

● Unwilling to try test product for relief of pain and tension headache symptoms.  
● Participants who are currently taking any anticoagulation  medications daily . (Aspirin, Warfarin, 
Heparin etc.)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 Study Evaluation  
 
6.1 Study Procedures  
18 
 • Potential participants will review information about the study and complete a screening form.  
• During the screening process, the potential participant will be asked questions regarding their 
symptoms and medical history to ensure that they meet the requirements to participate in this 
study. Potential participant s will also be asked q uestions to ensure that they do not meet any of 
the exclusion criteria and  meet  all of the inclusion criteria.  
• After successful screening (participant does not meet any exclusion criteria), participants will 
review and sign study informed consent.  
• Upon v erification of signed informed consent, participant  will be enrolled into the study .  
• At time of enrollment, participant will be given access to the HIPAA compliant study portal.  
○ The study portal provides access to study information, signed informed consent form, 
instructions for product use, frequently asked questions, study surveys, headache diary, and 
data collection tools.  
• Participant shall complete baseline assessments upon access to the portal.  
○ Baseline assessment will include question s regarding the participants’ demographics, 
medications  and detailed information regarding their headaches including treatment.  
• To ensure that baseline assessments are completed before test product is used by the 
participant, study materials and study wel come package will be shipped to the participant  once 
the clinical study manager/clinical ops coordinator confirms that the baseline assessment has 
been completed.  
• The welcome package will include an information sheet that will outline instructions for thei r 
participation in the trial, the test product, and paper forms of the documents (paper form of 
study documents will be provided for real time data collection, in the event that the participant 
cannot log into the study portal to input data).   
• Once the pa rticipant receives the test product, the participant will log into the study portal to 
acknowledge the receipt of the test product.  
• Study start date will be  the reported  date of receipt of test product.  
• Participant will be sent weekly email reminders that remind them of their participation in the 
study.  
• At the onset of the headache , the participant will start a Headache Diary and complete a 10 -
point Mankoski pain scale.  
○ Onset is defined as the time the participant take s the test product for relief of symptoms . 
• After completing the surveys, the participant will take test product. The participant will take 2 
capsules with 6 -8 oz. of water per headache episode. With a max of 6 pills per day. (If 
participant takes 6 pills in 1 day th is will be defined as 3 headache episodes and the patient will 
be exited from the study).   
• After taking the test product , the participant will complete a Mankoski pain scale at 15 minutes, 
30 minutes, and 1 hour after taking the test product . 
• Once the par ticipant’s symptoms resolve, the participant will complete the headache diary.  
• If the participant takes any other medication outside of the test product, the participant will 
record this on the headache diary.  
• After taking the test product, the participa nt will be instructed to fill out an Adverse Event form 
for any side -effects experienced.  
• After the first headache episode, the participant will be asked to complete the same process for 
another 2 headache episodes; however, these are not required.  
• If the  participant completes the required assessments for a total of 3 headache episodes, they 
will be prompted, by email, to exit the study.   
19 
 • If the participant only completes the required assessments for the required 1 headache episode, 
the participant will be prompted, by email, to complete the study exit form and will be exited 
from the study on day 60 (60 days from the day of receipt of the test product).

6.3 Participant Enrollment and Follow -Up 
 
Patients suffering from mild to moderate tension headache symptoms will complete a cloud -based, 
HIPAA -secured screening survey to determine eligibility. All eligibility criteria must be met for 
participants to be approved for enrollment in the study. Parti cipants will be provided informed 
consent and the opportunity to ask questions related to the study procedures, risks and benefits, 
and rights related to participation in the study. Participants who sign the study informed consent 
will be prospectively enr olled in the study and provided a link to a patient portal, which provides 
study resources. Participants will take the study formula at the onset of symptoms and provide 
information related to pain and tension headache symptoms during the follow -up period.  A remote 
study coordinator may prompt participants to provide study information to ensure that the study 
forms are completed. Efforts will be taken to ensure minimal withdrawals and loss to follow -up.  
 
6.4 Adverse Event and Safety Monitoring  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrences described by the study 
participant.  All AEs will be self -reported and documented on the platform. The AEs will be reviewed 
by the study team including the remote trial coordinator and study principal i nvestigator and 
reported according to the IRB requirements. Participants who experience adverse events will be 
advised to  stop taking the test product and  seek medical attention.  
 
In the event that a participant experiences an adverse event , the clinical study manager or clinical 
ops coordinator will notify both the PI and Sponsor. The Sponsor will take appropriate action 
according to their standard operating procedures for any adverse events that warrant action by the 
Sponsor.  
 
6.4.1 Anticipated Adverse Events  
 
Anticipated Adverse Events are complications that are known to be associated with the 
test product  (in high doses exceeding recommended use):  
• Diarrhea  
• Nausea  
• Stomach Cramps  
• Acid Reflux  
• Skin Rashes  
• GI Bleeding  
• Headaches  
• Liver Damage  
23 
 6.4.2 Adverse Event Relationship  
 
Each reported AE will be assessed by the Investigator for relatedness, severity and causality.  
 
6.4.3 Serious Adverse Events  
 
A Serious Adverse Event is an Adverse Event that leads to death or to serious deterioration in 
the health of the particip ant that either resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, or a 
permanent impairment of a body structure or body function.  
 
6.5 Lost to Follow -Up 
 
If a patient fails to provide event information via the study/patient portal 30 days after the 
start of the trial , the remote coordinator will attempt to contact the participant to ascertain 
whether or not the participant has had a headache episode or not and if the participant 
wishes to and/or should continue in the study.   
 
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent metho ds). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s 
study record.  
 
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study and the study exit form will be completed.  
 
6.6 Test  Product Packaging /Handling/Storage/Accountability  
 
• The three -episode supply of test product will be packaged and labeled with ingredients 
and a study ID number .  
• Participants will receive guidance on how to report receipt, store, and use the test 
product.  
• Hawthorne Effect Inc. will support storage and shipment of test product, 
documentation of test product assignment, and completion of test product 
accountability.  
 
6.7 Study Management  
 
This study uses a decentralized clinical trial format to foster inclusivity, diversity and 
accessibility for a broad study population and to ensure efficiencies for enrollmen t and 
study data collection. The study will be managed using an end to end virtual clinical trial 
platform called Hawthorne Effect Study Visit Management Platform which is designed to 
24 
 make patient participation in clinical trials more accessible and as lea st burdensome as 
possible. The Hawthorne Effect platform ( www.hawthorne -effect.com ) is GCP/ICH/21CFR 
and HIPAA compliant. Hawthorne Effect uses a network of specialty vetted and trained 
healthcare professionals, or HEROs who are study investigators, screeners and conduct 
personalized patient visits for screeni ng and follow -up. For this trial, the Hawthorne Effect 
study visits will be virtual, and the platform will be used to collect patient reported 
outcomes and to track screening, enrollment and study compliance.  
 
 
7 Statistical Considerations  
 
7.1 Study Outcomes Measures  
Analysis populations : 
The intent to treat  (ITT) population consists of all participants who are consented, report 
the onset of a headache, and have taken the study medication at least once. The primary 
analysis will be in the ITT population.  
 
 Primary Endpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint is reduction in headache severity. Patients will be asked to rate 
headache on the 10 -point Mankoski scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the product, 15 
minutes after taking the product, 30 minutes after taking the product , and 1 ho ur after 
taking the product . The improvement in symptoms from baseline will be evaluated on a 
pairwise basis separately for each time point. P -values will be computed for the 
improvement.  
 
 There is no control group for the primary analysis.  
 
 Secondary E ndpoints:  
 
● Time to intervention (taking any product other than the study medication) will be 
analyzed as a time dependent variable, with the clock starting when the test product is 
taken.  
● A longitudinal analysis will be performed for patients who report on more than  one 
incident of headache .  
● Net Promoter Score . 
● Comparison against normal behavior will use the paired sample t-test.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
25 
 in similar studies appearing in the literature. Th ere will be no formal statistical 
comparison of results from this study and historical studies.  
 
Secondary endpoints will be gathered on the subjective experience of these participant s 
related to general health, personal experience with the product. The secondary endpoints 
will be self -reported by the participant  on their online portal. There will be a questionnaire 
related to general health and the subject ive experience of the partici pant  administered at 
baseline and at study exit.  
 
The purpose of the secondary analyses is to investigate the association between various 
baseline and other measurements and outcomes . These secondary analyses are considered 
hypothesis generating, and the descriptions are somewhat informal.  The trial data may 
suggest secondary analyses not described here.  
 
 
7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Based on information from a variety of studies, a highly pessimistic assumption is that there 
would be a mean improvement of 2 points on the Mankoski scale with a standard deviation 
of 5 points . Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 68 patients woul d result in a 90% 
power to detect an improvement using the paired -sample t-test. We also assume that 50% 
of the patients will experience headaches during the 60 -day period; the other patients 
would furnish no useful data. The final sample size of 200 patie nts has been chosen to allow 
for various contingencies, including uncertainties in the assumptions and about compliance 
in this self -reported trial.  If data from multiple headaches per patient are useful, the power 
to detect an improvement would increase.   
 
It should be emphasized that these assumptions are for sample size purposes only. Trial 
analysis will use the data as collected.  
As discussed above, the number 200 may be increased based on observed data concerning 
the number of participants with heart burn/indigestion. The actual outcomes of treated 
participants will not be considered in this analysis, merely whether or not enrolled 
participants have reported starting using the test product. The method of reevaluating the 
sample size will be described i n the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
7.3 Analysis Plan  
 
Separate tables will be presented showing  the changes from baseline for tension headache 
severity and functional status at each time point. The changes will be evaluated by the 
paired -sample t -test. An appropriate nonparametric analysis will also be reported.  
 
26 
 Secondary endpoints will be gathered on the subjective experience of these participant s 
related to general health, functional status, personal experience with the products. The 
secondary endpoints will be self -reported by the participant  on their online po rtal. There 
will be a questionnaire related to general health, functional status , and the subjective 
experience of the participant  administered at baseline and at study exit.  
 
The purpose of the secondary analyses is to investigate the association between  various 
baseline and other measurements and outcome variables . These secondary analyses are 
considered hypothesis generating, and the descriptions are somewhat informal.  The trial 
data may suggest secondary analyses not described here.  
 
General statistic al methods : 
 
Data will be analyzed using standard statistical methods, as further specified in a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), which will be prepared in detail later.  
 
• Data analysis will largely consist of summary statistics and graphs. The only formal group 
comparisons will be in covariate analyses.  
• For continuous variables data presentation will consist of means, confidence intervals 
computed using the t -statistic, me dians, and interquartile ranges. Group comparisons 
will use t -tests or ANOVA . 
• For discrete variables confidence intervals will use the exact intervals, where available. 
Group comparisons will use Fisher’s exact test, with the Monte Carlo version used 
where  computationally necessary.  
• For time to event variables analysis will use the Kaplan -Meier algorithm, and group 
comparisons will use the log -rank or proportional hazards methods, depending on the 
data type.   
• Visual analog scale values will be treated as continuous variables. Frequency counts will 
also be provided for scales with 10 or fewer distinct response levels.  
• Covariate analyses will investigate the relation between baseline and outcome variables, 
using methods appropriate to the data types involved . Age, gender, and baseline 
medications will be included in these analyses where appropriate data are available.  
• Present intention is that the analysis will be performed in R, and the precise form of 
algorithms will be the default of R. Kaplan -Meier, log -rank, and proportional hazards 
algorithms will be the defaults of the survival package. [13]  
• The exact items to be compared depend on what is reported in each historical control 
study. When possible, the items will include symptom relief at each time measur ed, 
including within -patient p -values, and time to the lowest level on a 4 -point scale and to 
27 
 the lowest 2 levels on a 10 -point scale. as well as reported baseline 
characteristics.  When two -arm studies are compared, both arms will be reported in this 
compa rison.  Specific studies to be considered will be identified prior to the analysis of 
actual trial data . 
 
 
8 Informed Consent Process  
 
The study protocol and informed consent will be reviewed approved by Advarra 
Institutional Review Board, prior to study start.  
 
Study candidates will learn about the study via digital advertisements. If interested in 
learning more, they will be referred to a website “landing page” that will provide detailed 
information about the study. They may opt to complete a screening survey ascertaining 
study eligibility through patient reported outcomes. If successfully completed (no exclusion 
criteria are selected), candidate will be invited to review the study consent form tutorial 
which includes the opportunity to ask que stions related to the study from the Principal 
Investigator or delegated authority of the investigator. Candidate will be prov ided with 
contact information to reach investigator or study manager as desired.  
 
Candidate may sign the informed consent via elec tronic signature as provided by 
Hawthorne Effect. The study manager will verify candidate signature prior to enrollment as 
a study participant . 
 
9 Subject Confidentiality  
All participant s’ data and personal information will be kept confidential. Only those involved 
with the study will have access to participant information. The data will be stored by 
Hawthorne Effect on a HIPAA compliant platform. The platform, which the data is stored 
on, will require a personalized username and password to gain access.  
 
10 Publication  
 
Prior to the first patient enrolled, study will be registered on clinicaltrials.gov and submit 
the results for advertisement and promotion purposes.  
 
11 Limitations  
 
28 
 The study described in this protocol has some limitations. There is no concurrent control, as 
seems appropriate for the first study on this combination product. The study relies solely on 
patients' subjective information and self -reporting; there is no medical review of symptoms, 
and no independent check on patient compliance .  Some patient groups are not studied, 
including those under 18 years of age and pregnant women.

Drug Interactions for Tension  Product  
 
BOSWELLIA  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for Boswellia. There are some theoretical 
Moderate Interactions, where Boswellia may interact in the metabolism of certain drugs (which 
utilize the same enzymes it inhibits). See Below for List.  
 
CYTOCHROME P45 0 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In vitro evidence shows that boswellia inhibits cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) ( 21178 ). 
Theoretically, use of boswellia with drugs that are metabolized by CYP1A2 might increase drug 
levels and increase t he potential for adverse events. Some drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 
include clozapine (Clozaril), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), fluvoxamine (Luvox), haloperidol 
(Haldol), imipramine (Tofranil), mexiletine (Mexitil), olanzapine (Zyprexa), pentazocine 
(Talwin), propranolol (Inderal), tacrine (Cognex), zileuton (Zyflo), zolmitriptan (Zomig), and 
others.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES  
Intera ction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In vitro evidence shows that boswellia inhibits cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) ( 21178 ). 
Theoretically, use of boswellia with drugs  that are metabolized by CYP2C19 might increase drug 
levels and increase the potential for adverse events. Some drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 
include amitriptyline (Elavil), carisoprodol (Soma), citalopram (Celexa), diazepam (Valium), 
lansoprazole (Prevacid ), omeprazole (Prilosec), phenytoin (Dilantin), warfarin (Coumadin), and 
many others.  
31 
 CYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In vitro evidence shows that boswellia inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 (CY P2C9) ( 21178 ). 
Theoretically, use of boswellia with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2C9 might increase drug 
levels and i ncrease the potential for adverse events. Some drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 include 
celecoxib (Celebrex), diclofenac (Voltaren), fluvastatin (Lescol), glipizide (Glucotrol), ibuprofen 
(Advil, Motrin), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar), phenytoin (Dilan tin), piroxicam 
(Feldene), tamoxifen (Nolvadex), tolbutamide (Tolinase), torsemide (Demadex), and warfarin 
(Coumadin).  
CYTOCHROME P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In vitro evidence shows that boswellia inhibits cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) ( 21178 ). 
Theoretically, use of boswellia with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 might increase drug 
levels and increase t he potential for adverse events. Some drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 
include amitriptyline (Elavil), codeine, desipramine (Norpramin), flecainide (Tambocor), 
haloperidol (Haldol), imipramine (Tofranil), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), ondansetron 
(Zofran),  paroxetine (Paxil), risperidone (Risperdal), tramadol (Ultram), venlafaxine (Effexor), 
and others.  
CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.

In vitro evidence shows that boswellia inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) ( 21178 ). 
Theoretically, use of boswellia wit h drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 might increase drug 
levels and increase the potential for adverse events. Some drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 
include amitriptyline (Elavil), amiodarone (Cordarone), citalopram (Celexa), felodipine 
(Plendil), lansoprazol e (Prevacid), ondansetron (Zofran), prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone), 
sertraline (Zoloft), and many others.

Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In vitro studies show that boswellia has immunostimulant properties ( 21179 ,21180 ). 
Theoretically, boswellia might decrease the effectiveness of immunosuppressive drugs. 
Immunosuppressant drugs include azathioprine (Imuran), basiliximab (Simulect), cyclosporine 
(Neoral, Sandimmune), daclizumab (Zenapax), muromonab -CD3 (OKT3, Orthoclone OKT3), 
mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), sirolimus (Rapamune), prednisone

MAGNESIUM  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for Magnesium. There are some anecdotal 
moderate interactions with various drugs, including antibiotics, antacids, and others.  
 
13.1.1.1  AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Use of an aminoglycoside antibiotic and magnesium concurrently can lead to neuromuscular 
weakness and possible paralysis. Both agents reduce presynaptic acetylcholine release, which 
can lead to neuromuscular blockade. This is most likely to occur with high doses of magnesium 
given intravenously ( 13362 ). The aminoglycosides include amikacin (Amikin), gentamicin 
(Garamycin), kanamycin (Kantrex), streptomycin, and tobramycin (Nebcin).  
13.1.1.2  ANTACIDS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Use of antacids may reduce the laxative effect of magnesium oxide. A retrospective analysis 
shows that use of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is associated 
with a higher dose of magnesi um oxide needed to attain a therapeutic laxative effect ( 90033 ). 
This may be due to the fact that, under acidic conditio ns, magnesium oxide is converted to 
magnesium chloride then magnesium bicarbonate, which promotes the osmotic laxative effect. 
Antacids, which reduce the acidity of the stomach, may reduce the conversion of magnesium 
oxide to the active bicarbonate salt.  
 
Some antacids include calcium carbonate (Tums, others), dihydroxyaluminum sodium carbonate 
(Rolaids, others), magaldrate (Riopan), magnesium sulfate (Bilagog), aluminum hydroxide 
(Amphojel), and others.  
13.1.1.3  ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
In vitro evidence suggests that magnesium sulfate inhibits platelet aggr egation at concentrations 
as low as 0.5 -1.0 mM ( 20304 ,20305 ). Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that infusion 
of magnesium sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity ( 20306 ). 
However, other clinical research seems to show that magnesium does not affect platelet 
aggregation, although inhibition of platelet -dependent thrombo sis (PDT) can occur ( 60759 ). 
Theoretically, concomitant use of magnesium with anticoagulants or antiplatelets could incr ease 
the risk of bleeding.  
 
Some of these drugs include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), dalteparin (Fragmin), enoxaparin 
(Lovenox), heparin, indomethacin (Indocin), ticlopidine (Ticlid), warfarin (Coumadin), and 
others.  
34 
 13.1.1.4  BISPHOSPHONATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Cations, including magnesium, can decrease bisphosphonate absorption. Ad vise patients to 
separate doses of magnesium and these drugs by at least 2 hours ( 13363 ). The bisphosphonates 
include alendronate (Fosamax), etidronate (Didronel), tiludronate (Skelid), and risedronate 
(Actonel).  
13.1.1.5  CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Magn esium inhibits calcium entry into smooth muscle cells and may therefore have additive 
effects with calcium channel blockers. Severe hypotension and neuromuscular blockades may 
occur when nifedipine is used with intravenous magnesium ( 3046 ,20264,20265 ,20266 ), although 
some contradictory evidence suggests that concurrent use of magnesium plus nifedipine does not 
increase the risk of neuromuscular weakness ( 60831 ). High doses of magnesium could 
theoretically have additive effects with other calcium channel blockers. These drugs include 
nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), nicardipine (Cardene), isradipi ne (DynaCirc), amlodipine 
(Norvasc), and others.  
13.1.1.6  DIGOXIN  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical evidence suggests that treatment with oral magnesium hydroxide or magnesium 
trisilicate reduces absorption of d igoxin from the intestines ( 198,20268 ,20270 ). This may reduce 
the blood levels of digoxin and decrease its t herapeutic effects.  
13.1.1.7  GABAPENTIN (Neurontin)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research shows that giving magnesium oxide orally along with gabapentin decreases 
gabapentin maximum concentration by 33%, time to maximum concentr ation by 36%, and area 
under the curve by 43% ( 90032 ). Advise patients to take these gabapentin at least 2 hours before,  
or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements.  
35 
 13.1.1.8  POTASSIUM -SPARING DIURETICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Potassium -sparing diuretics also have magnesium -sparing properties, which can counteract the 
magnesium losses associated with loop and thiazide diuretics ( 9613 ,9614 ,9622 ). Theoretically, 
increased magnesium levels could result from concomitant use of potassium -sparing diuretics 
and magnesium supplements. The potassium -sparing diuretics include amiloride (Midamor), 
triamterene (Dyrenium), and spironola ctone (Aldactone).  
13.1.1.9  QUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with quinolones and decrease their absorption ( 3046 ). 
Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium 
supplements. Quinolones (fluoroquinolo nes) include ciprofloxacin (Cipro), gemifloxacin 
(Factive), levofloxacin (Levaquin), moxifloxacin (Avelox), and others.  
13.1.1.10  SEVELAMER (Renagel, Renvela)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research shows that taking sevelamer may increase serum magnesium l evels. In patients 
on hemodialysis, sevelamer use was associated with a 0.28 mg/dL increase in serum magnesium. 
The mechanism of this interaction remains unclear ( 96486 ). Advise patients to talk to their 
healthcare provider before taking magnesium supplements if they are taking sevelamer.  
13.1.1.11  SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = A  
Parenteral magnesium shortens the time to onset of skeletal muscle relaxants by about 1 minute 
and prolongs the duration of action by about 2 minutes. This is thought to occur because 
magnesium potentiates the effects of skeletal muscle relaxants by decreasing acetylcholine 
release from motor nerve terminals ( 3046 ,97492 ). A clinical study found that low -dose 
rocuronium (0.45 mg/kg), when given after administration of magnesium 30 mg /kg over 10 
minutes, undergoes an accelerated onset of effect, which matches the onset of effect seen with a 
full-dose rocuronium regimen (0.6 mg/kg) ( 96485 ). Along with rocuronium (Zemuron), skeletal 
muscle relaxants include atracurium (Tracrium), cisatracurium (Nimbex), mivacurium 
(Mivacron), rapacuronium (Raplon), pancuronium (Pavulon), vecuronium (Norcuron), and 
others.  
36 
 13.1.1.12  SULFONYLUREAS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research suggests that concomitant administration of magnesium hydr oxide and non -
micronized glibenclamide increases the absorption of glibenclamide, leading to a 35 -fold 
increase in maximum insulin response compared to treatment with non -micronized 
glibenclamide alone ( 20307 ). Similarly, concomitant administration of magnesium hydroxide 
and glipizide increases the absorption of glipizide and enhances the maximal glucose decrease by 
35% com pared to glipizide alone ( 20308 ). This effect relates to the ability of magnesium -based 
antacids to elevate gastrointest inal pH, leading to increased solubility and enhanced absorption 
of sulfonylureas ( 22364 ). Due to this interaction, conc omitant use of sulfonylureas and 
magnesium -based antacids may theoretically increase the risk of hypoglycemia in some patients. 
Other sulfonylurea agents include carbutamide, acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, 
gliclazide, glibornuride, glyclopyram ide, and glimepiride.  
13.1.1.13  TETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with tetracyclines in the gut and decrease their 
absorption and antibacterial activity ( 12586 ). Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours 
before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements. Tetracyclines include demeclocycline 
(Declomycin), doxycycline (Vibramycin), minocycline (Minocin), and tetracycline 
(Achromycin, Sumycin).  
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS : In vitro evidence 
suggests that magnesi um sulfate inhibits platelet aggregation at concentrations as low as 0.5 -1.0 
mM ( 20304 ,20305 ). Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that infusion of magnesium 
sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity ( 20306 ). However, other 
clinical research seems to show that magnesium does not affect platelet aggregation, although 
inhibit ion of platelet -dependent thrombosis (PDT) can occur ( 60759 ). Theoretically, concomitant 
use of magnesium with other her bs and supplements that affect platelet aggregation might 
increase the risk of bleeding. Some other herbs and supplements that affect platelet aggregation 
include angelica, clove, danshen, garlic, ginger, glucosamine, Panax ginseng, and others.  
 
BORON : Bor on supplements can reduce urinary excretion of magnesium and increase serum 
levels in women ( 940,9529 ,9623 ). In young women, age 18 to 25 years, the effect appears to be 
greater in sedentary than athletic women ( 940). In postmenopausal women, the effect is more 
marked in women with low dietary magnesium intake ( 9623 ). The clinical significance of these 
effects, and whether they occur in men, is not known.  
 
CALCIUM : Calcium supplements can decrease the absorption of dietary magnesium, but only 
at very high, supra -therapeutic doses (2600 mg daily). However, in people with adequate 
magnesium stores, calcium do esn't have any clinically significant effect on long -term 
37 
 magnesium balance. Advise patients at high risk for magnesium deficiency to take calcium 
supplements at bedtime, instead of with meals, to avoid inhibiting dietary magnesium absorption 
(4623 ,7555 ,11159 ). Magnesium does not seem to affect calcium absorption ( 12587 ). 
 
VITAMIN D : One intestinal route of magnesium absorption is thought to be vitamin D 
dependent ( 9634 ). Various forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol, 25 -
hydroxyergocalciferol, 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol), and 1,25 -
dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) increase mag nesium absorption; especially when taken in 
high doses ( 9634 ,9635 ,9636 ,9637 ). This effect has been used to treat hypomagnesemia in people 
with malabsorption syndromes ( 9516 ,9635 ,9636 ). 
 
ZINC : Supplementation with high doses of zinc, 142 mg daily, appears to decrease magnesium 
absorp tion and magnesium balance in healthy adult males ( 9624 ). Also, moderately high dietary 
zinc intake, 53 mg daily, seems to  increase magnesium excretion without affecting copper 
metabolism in postmenopausal women. This might adversely affect bone health. Zinc may 
compete with magnesium for ion exchange transport in the intestine ( 12424 ). More research on 
the clinical importance of these observations is needed.  
 
 
 
WHITE WILLOW BARK  
There is one Serious Drug Interactions known for White Willow Bark, of which it is anecdotal. 
Just like aspirin, White Willow Bark might increase the risk of bleeding, and so the concomitant 
use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs should be avoided.   
 
13.1.1.14  ACETAZOLAMIDE  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Willow bark contains salicin, a plant salicylate. Human case reports suggest a combination of 
acetazolamide and salicylate increase unbound plasma levels of acetazolamide, as well as 
adverse effects related to acetazolami de (86481 ). Theoretically, willow bark might result in 
additive adverse effects associated with acetazolamide.  
13.1.1.15  ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Major  Do not take this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Concomitant use theoretically might increase the risk of bleeding due to decreased platelet 
aggregation. Willow bark has anti platelet effects, but less so than aspirin ( 12810 ). Avoid 
concomitant use with other anticoagulant and antiplatelet drug s. Some of these drugs include 
aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), dalteparin (Fragmin), enoxaparin (Lovenox), heparin, ticlopidine 
(Ticlid), warfarin (Coumadin), and others.

Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Willow bark contains salicin, a plant salicylate. Theoretically, willow bark might have an 
additive effect with other s alicylate -containing drugs such as aspirin ( 12808 ). 
13.1.1.17  CHOLINE MAGNESIUM TRISALICYLATE (Trilisate)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Willow bark contains salicin , a plant salicylate. Theoretically, willow bark might have an 
additive effect with other salicylate -containing drugs such as choline magnesium trisalicylate 
(12808 ). 
13.1.1.18  SALSALATE (Disalcid)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Willow bark contains salicin , a plant salicylate. Theoretically, willow bark might have an 
additive effect with other salicylate -containing drugs such as salsalate ( 12808 ). 
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS : Concomitant use 
of herbs that have antiplatelet/anticoagulant effects could theoretically increase the risk of 
bleeding in some people ( 12810 ). These herbs include clove, danshen, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, 
ginseng, meadowsweet, red clover, and others.  
 
SALICYL ATE -CONTAINING HERBS : Theoretically, concomitant use may potentiate 
salicylate effects and adverse effects ( 12808 ). Sali cylate -containing herbs include aspen bark, 
black haw, poplar, and meadowsweet.  
 
 
FEVERFEW  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for Feverfew. There are some anecdotal 
interactions of moderate concern, such as anticoagulant drugs, and also drugs t hat utilize 
enzymes that Feverfew may inhibit.

Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combinati on.  
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Some evidence suggests that feverfew may inhibit platelet aggregation. However, this has not 
been demonstrated in humans ( 6935 ,6936 ,6942 ,6943 ,6944 ,6945 ,6951 ). Theoretically, feverfew 
might have additive effects and increase the risk of bleeding when used with these drugs.

There's preliminary evidence that feverfew might inhibit cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) 
(12479 ). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans. However, watch for an in crease 
in the levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 in patients taking feverfew. Some drugs 
metabolized by CYP2C8 include amiodarone (Cardarone), paclitaxel (Taxol); nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac (Cataflam, Voltaren) and ibuprofen (Motrin); 
rosiglitazone (Avandia); and others.

for an increase in the levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 in patients taking feverfew. Some 
drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 include lovastatin (Mevacor), ketoconazole (Nizoral), 
itraconazole (Sporanox), fexofenadine (Allegra), triazolam (Halcion), and numerous others. Use 
feverfew cautiously or avoid in patients taking these drugs.  
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS : Some evide nce 
suggests that feverfew may inhibit platelet aggregation. However, this has not been demonstrated 
in humans ( 6935 ,6936 ,6942 ,6943 ,6944 ,6945 ,6951 ). Theoretically, concomitant use of feverfew 
and herbs that affect platelet aggregation could increase the risk of bleeding in some people. 
Some of these herbs include angelica, clove, danshen, g arlic, ginger, ginkgo, Panax ginseng, 
horse chestnut, red clover, turmeric, and others.  
 
 
SKULLCAP  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for Skullcap. There is one moderate interaction of

Make sure you discuss your HIT-6 results and your headaches at your next appointment with your doctor.
If You Scored 49 or Less
Your headaches seem to be having little to no impact on your life at this time. We encourage you to take HIT-6 monthly to
continue to track how your headaches affect your life.
If Your Score on HIT-6 is 50 or Higher
You should share the results with your doctor. Headaches that are disrupting your life could be migraine.
Take HIT-6 with you when you visit your doctor because research shows that when doctors understand exactly how badly
headaches affect the lives of their patients, they are much more likely to provide a successful treatment program, which may
include medication.
HIT is also available on the Internet at www.headachetest.com.
The Internet version allows you to print out a personal report of your results as well as a special detailed version for your d octor.
Don’t forget to take HIT-6 again or try the Internet version to continue to monitor your progress.
About HIT
The Headache Impact Test (HIT) is a tool used to measure the impact headaches have on your ability to function on the job, at
school, at home and in social situations.  Your score shows you the effect that headaches have on normal daily life and your
ability to function. HIT was developed by an international team of headache experts from neurology and primary care medicine
in collaboration with the psychometricians who developed the SF-36â* health assessment tool.
HIT is not intended to offer medical advice regarding medical diagnosis or treatment. You should talk to your healthcare
provider for advice specific to your situation.

ABOUT THE STUDY  
 
Background  
 
A tension headache is genera lly a mild to moderate pain in your head that ’s often described as 
a dull, aching head pain that feels like a tight band around your head. They can be episodic or 
chronic in nature. They are the most common type of primary headaches and affect 
approximatel y 80% of the population. Because of their  high prevalence, the socio -economic 
consequences of tension type headache s are significant as they are associated with increased 
depression, anxiety, insomnia and overall decrease in quality of life.   
 
Today , head ache suffer ers routinely take acetaminophen ( for example , Tylenol) or a non -
steroidal pain reliever ( for example , Advil) for symptom relief. The side effects of these 
common over -the-counter products can potentially lead to gastrointestinal and cardiovascu lar 
system effects.

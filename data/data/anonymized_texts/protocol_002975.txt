1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1 Glioblastoma Multiforme  
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignant brain tumor1.  
Despite advanced chemoradiotherapy, median survival is < 15 months, and < 5% of patients survive > 5 years
1-3.  Several  targeted agents including monoclonal antibodies have 
been tested in GBM patients with minimal success4, although these agents have shown 
anti-growth acti vity in vitro .  This high failure rate is likely due to the redundancy in key 
growth pathways and the molecular and cellular heterogeneity within each tumor.  Anothe r 
explanation is the poor CNS penetration of these drugs due to the blood brain barrier (BBB).  As a result, high drug doses were used to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations in the CNS, resulting in significant toxicities
4.  Thus an outstanding challenge in neuro-
oncology has been to generate drugs that have excellent CNS penetration or methods that can compromise the BBB to enhance drug delivery. 
 
1.2 MRI -guided Laser Ablation (MLA)  
 
MRI -guided laser ablation (MLA) therapy for GBM is a novel minimally invasive surgery 
approved for cytoreductive treatment of brain tumors
5.  Dr. Eric Leuthardt 
and Dr. Albert Kim performed one of the first MLA procedures in the country and are experts in this 
technique.  Currently Washington 
University has one of the largest clinical experiences using this new technology (Monteris, Winnipeg, CA), which has received FDA  
clearance for “use to ablate, necrotize, 
or coagulate soft tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy (LITT) in medicine and surgery in the discipline of neurosurgery with 1064 nm lasers,” and is marketed under the brand name 
of NeuroBlate.  MLA employs a small incision in the scalp and skull, through which a t hin laser probe is inserted 
and guided by MR imaging to the core of a tumor mass where it delivers hyperthermic ablation from the core to the rim.   The temperature at the 
core can reach 70°C, resulting in coagulative necrosis  (Fig. 1) .  The 

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 10 of 70 temperature decrease in the peritumoral region but remains high enough (> 40°C) to induce 
disruption of the BBB as evidenced by new contrast enhancement in this region, while the original tumor enhancement is lost due to the heat ablation  (Figs. 1 and 2).   
 
General characteristics that 
make the lesion(s) favorable 
to treatment include the 
follo wing: (1) the lesion(s) is 
(are) supratentorial and 
accessible from a cephalad 
approach (i.e., top one third of 
the head), (2) the lesion(s) is 
(are) unilateral, (3) the 
lesion(s)  is (are) relatively 
well circumscribed, (4) the 
volume of lesion(s) can be 
encompassed by two 3- cm 
cylinders (i .e., 2 treatment 
trajectories), (5) a safe 
trajectory c an be established 
relative to functional structures (i.e., eloquent cortex and corticospinal tract), and (6) the 
patient ’s body habitus c an fit into the bore of the MRI. Trajectories are chosen to maximize 
lesion ablation and minimize the number of passes.  MLA will be performed per FDA 
clearance for the NeuroBlate device using 1064n m lasers (for a detailed description of the 
procedure, please refer to these references5-8).  Live intra -procedural treatment monitoring 
is critical for stereotactic LITT in order to assess for real -time tissue temperature and avoid 
treatment beyond the target zone. Fortunately, recent technological advances in intraoperative MR imaging when coupled with the NeuroBlate apparatus now enable accurate intraoperative thermal monitoring that is necessary for successful and safe ablation of intracranial lesions. Intra -procedural repetitive measurements of a T1 -weighted 
2-dimensional- FLASH sequence, or sim ilar methods, provide temporally- sensitive 
thermometry measurements necessary to create controlled and conformal lesions (Fig. 1 C).   
 The disrupted BBB may also allow release of tumor antigens into the circulation and influx of immune cells into the peritumoral region.  In a series of patients treated with MLA at our institution, peritumor enhancement modestly increased 3 days after MLA while FLAIR 
signal changed only minimally, indicating that the post -MLA condition created 
peritumoral BBB disruption but early non- specific inflammatory edema was not a major 
feature.  Interestingly, both peritumoral enhancement and FLAIR signal significantly increased 2 weeks after MLA and then persisted for several weeks.  These delayed and persistent changes suggest that another effect of the BBB disruption after MLA could be the activation of an immune reaction leading to infiltration of tumor- specific lymphocytes 
and the resultant delayed inflammatory reaction.  

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 11 of 70 1.2.1 Prior Clinical Experience with MLA  
 
We have had one of the largest clinical experiences using MLA in the country.  To 
date we have done more than 80 cases, of which approximately two- thirds are high-
grade glial neoplasms. In regards to adverse events, patients have experienced transient aphasia, transient hemiparesis, transient hyponatremia, and a documented case of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Patients with aphasia or hemiparesis impr oved over time with steroid therapy. Hyponatremia resolved 
spontaneously. One patient experienced fatal meningitis. Subsequent in-depth analysis revealed that this patient’s meningitis was due to an operating room infrastructure -related contamination and not due to equipment contamination 
related to performance of the MLA procedure.  
 
1.3 Immune Dysregulation  
 
Recent work has collectively demonstrated striking immune dysregulation in patients with GBM, including T cell lymphopenia and anergy, cytokine dysregulation, increased regulatory T cell (Treg) populations, and NK cell dysfunction, among others, which reflect immunologic compromise and functional impairment
9-12.  However, a growing list of 
potential tumor antigens has been identified, suggesting that tumor cell -specific 
recognition by immune cells may be biologically relevant and therapeutically 
exploitable11,13.  Therefore, given the immune dysfunction characterized in GBM patients, 
approaches that potentiat e the anti -glioma immune response are particularly exciting.  A 
priori, because the immune system has evolved to recognize a tremendous diversity of antigenic epitopes in vertebrates, immune -potentiating efforts may be especially effective 
at targeting the  heterogeneity that defines GBM.  Recently, the success of antibody -based 
therapies targeting immune checkpoints
14,15 has generated field -wide enthusiasm that 
biological therapies may be broadly effect across many cancer types, including GBM.  Of these agents, those targeting the negative regulator proteins CTLA -4 and PD -1/PD -L1 have 
shown clinical efficacy but have not been studied in GBM patients.  
 
1.4 MK-3475 
 The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades
16.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies17-21 .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells an d the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors.  The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 12 of 70 PD-L2)22,23.  The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved24.  PD -1 and family members 
are type  I transmembrane glyco proteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding 
of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signali ng 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the 
tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic ta il, 
leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade 
22,25-27.  The mechanism by which 
PD-1 down modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as 
both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins28,29.  PD -1 was shown to 
be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -
cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells30,31 .  Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages 
and dendritic cells  32 .  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively 
expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues 
as well as in various tumors 28,33-35 .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors 
containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the ex tracellular region and contain short 
cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -1 ligand to PD -
1 inhibits T -cell activation triggered through the T -cell receptor.  PD -L1 is expressed at 
low levels on various non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, 
whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells found in 
lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen 
unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues 28.  Although healthy organs express little 
(if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstra ted to express abundant levels of this 
T-cell inh ibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in 
subjects with melanoma (MEL)  36.  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a 
critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
 Pembrolizumab  is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 
the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its 
ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  Keytruda
TM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in 
the United Stated for  the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.

1.4.1 Rationale for Dosing 
 An ope n-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety 
and clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this 
trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks  (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 13 of 70 were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in 
human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective 
evidence of tumor size reducti on at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose 
tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and 
a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target 
engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.    A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of MK -3475 were found to be dependent 
on body weight. The relationship between clearance and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body 
weights.  MK -3475 has been found to have a wide therapeutic range based on the 
melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight -based regimen are anticipated to remain 
well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 in the 
melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W  (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipat ed changes in exposure between 
different indication settings.  
 One of the potential immune -related adverse events of a PD -1 inhibitor is increased 
intracranial pressure due to edema resulting from drug -induced tumor -specific 
immune activation.  In addition, mild edema can occasionally occur after MLA.  Therefore, we have built in a dose escalation plan including a low dose of MK -
3475 of 100 mg Q3W, an intermediate dose of 150 mg Q3W, and a high dose of 200 mg Q3W in order to determine the safety of this combination.  
1.5 Study Rationale  
 The BBB is a major obstacle to drug delivery in the treatment of malignant brain tumors including GBM. Recent work also detailed immune dysregulation in patients with GBM, which is due in part to the BBB limiting tumor antigen presentation and access of immune 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 14 of 70 cells to the tumor.  MLA has been noted to disrupt peritumoral BBB, which could then lead 
to increased access of new tumor antigens to the lymphovascular system and vice versa of 
immune effector cells to the tumor for effective activation of the immune system . 
Therefore, t he combination of MK -3475 and MLA as proposed in this protocol is 
hypothesized to create a therapeutic synergy in which MLA increases material access to promote immune activation and then MK-3475 maximizes these tumor- specific immune 
reactions  to impart effective tumor control. 
 
1.6 Correlative Studies Background  
 
In both arms  of phase II , intratumoral PD -L1 expression will be determined by qRT-PCR 
and/or IHC. TIL profile will be assessed by flow and mass spectrometry or IHC to compare 
to the profile at initial surgery prior to recurr ence (when available). Glioma- specific 
immune response will be assessed in cultured TIL, peripheral blood, and sampled cLN (where available). Pre - and post -surgery peripheral blood will be assessed by flow 
cytometry through the Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy immune monitoring core (for Washington University samples) and the Tran lab or the University 
of Florida Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program (for the UF samples) for markers of T 
cell activation and anergy as well as cytokine profiles. In addition, PD-1-dependent 
signature in glioma cell- specific T cells from the peripheral blood and sampled cLN where 
samples and RNAseq are available can  be generated by novel RNAseq methodology 
developed at Washington University and University of Florida in order to characterize the PD-1-dependent transcriptional signatures and develop a PD -1 dependent biomarker 
program that will be easily de -convoluted to provide data on serial changes in (a) cell type 
composition and (b) cell type activation programs.  Furthermore, if necessary, serum or 
plasma will be assessed for the presence and level of soluble immune checkpoint 
molecules, cytokines, and chemokines using commercially available multiplex immunoassays.  
 
1.7 Rationale for Amendment 12  
 
Based on recent data
44-46, anti -PD1 antibody monotherapy given without or after surgical 
resection showed limited activity and failed to improve PFS or OS in recurrent GBM.  
Although this data was based on early staged small clinical trials, it is emerging knowledge in the field that due to the immunosuppressive nature and neoantigen access limitation of malignant gliomas that immune checkpoint inhibit ors are likely inadequate when used 
alone. As determined  during the May 2019 DSMC meeting, this has had an impact on the 
feasibility of completing enrollments in the MK -3475 monotherapy arm.  Therefore, in the 
spirit of minimizing harm, potential or perceived, to subjects and to complete the study in a timely manner,  patients will no longer be randomized in the phase II portion of this trial.  
After approval of Amendment 12, an additional 20 evaluable patients will be enrolled to 
participate  in a single treatment arm with both MLA and MK -3475. Survival endpoints 
will be compared to historical data based on the above existing data.  
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 15 of 70 2.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objectives  
 
Phase I: To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of MK -3475 when combined  
with MLA for the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas.  
 
Phase II : To determine the progression -free survival (PFS) of patients with recurrent GBM , 
WHO grade IV being treated with MK-3475 plus MLA. 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1. Phase I : To determine the toxic ity profile of MK -3475 in combination with MLA for 
the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas.  
 
2. Phase II : To determine the overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent GBM, WHO 
grade IV being treated with MK -3475 plus MLA  as compared to historical co ntrols 
treated with MK -3475 alone. 
 
3. Phase II: To assess the anti -glioma immune response before and after MK -3475 with 
MLA . 
 
4. Phase II : To correlate intratumoral expression of PD -L1 and the frequency of glioma 
cell-specific cytotoxic T cells with PFS and OS.  
 
5. Phase II : To identify PD -1-dependent biomarkers in glioma cell -specific T cells that 
negatively correlate with the frequency of glioma cell -specific cytotoxic T cells and 
PFS and OS.  
 
 
3.0 PATIENT SELE CTION 
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
1. Phase I : Histologically confirmed grade III or IV malignant glioma.  
Phase II : Histologically confirmed grade IV malignant glioma  (GBM) . 
 
Note: GBM variants and secondary GBM, and suspected secondary GBM are allowed for both phase I and phase II.  
2. Unequivocal evidence of tumor progression as documented by biopsy or brain MRI scan per RANO criteria (see Section 12).  
 
3. There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of standard frontline therapy to study registration unless there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence per RANO criteria (see Section 12).  When the interval is less than 12 weeks, t he use 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 16 of 70 of perfusion imaging and/or PET scan is allowed to differentiate between unequivocal 
evidence of tumor recurrence and pseudoprogression.  Standard frontline therapy is as described below: 
 
a. For grade IV malignant gliomas (GBM) : Standard frontline the rapy for newly 
diagnosed GBM must include maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy , and temozolomide chemotherapy.  If the tumor was initially 
diagnosed as either a grade II or III tumor and now has recurred or progressed as a grade IV GBM, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade IV GBM and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. 
 
b. For grade III malignant gliomas with 1p 19q codeletions : Standard frontline therapy 
for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal feasible 
surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy , and chemotherapy (PCV 
or temozolomide).  If the patient did not receive any or all components of the standard front line therapy as detailed above for newly diagnosed grade III gliomas with 1p 19q codeletions and the tumor then recurred or progressed, s/he must first 
receive at least one prior st andard therapy or any appropriate combination of the 
components of standard therapy as detailed above and must experience further recurrence or progression before s/he is deemed eligible for this study.   If the tumor 
was initially diagnosed as a grade II g lioma with 1p 19q codeletions and now has 
recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma with 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study 
as long as prior treatment included maximal feas ible surgical resection (biopsy 
alone allowed), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (PCV or temozolomide). 
 
c. For grade III malignant glioma without 1p 19q codeletions : Standard frontline 
therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maxima l 
feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy , and temozolomide 
chemotherapy.  If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II glioma without 1p 
19q codeletions and now has recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma without 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. 
 
4. Cand idate for MLA  based on the size, location, and shape of the recurrent tumor as 
determined by the performing neurosurgeon. Surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA is allowed per standard of care  but is not required; if the patient undergoes 
resection or d ebulking, it  must have occurred at least 3 weeks prior to the first dose of 
MK-3475.  
 
For Phase II : if surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA is not indicated, a biopsy of 
the tumor will be done at the same time of MLA to obtain tumor tissue for both 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 17 of 70 diagnostic purposes and immune monitoring.  
 
5. Patients who have undergone a resection for recurrence will be eligible . In those who 
have undergone a gross total resection, the MLA will be directed at treating a 
peritumoral margin of 0.5- 1cm surrounding the resection cavity to disrupt the BBB and 
potentially increase access of MK -3475 to the peritumoral infiltrating glioma cells.  
 
6. At least  18 years of age. 
 7. Karnofsky ≥ 60% (see Appendix A) 
 
8. Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: a. ANC ≥ 1,500/ mcL 
b. Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL 
c. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL or ≥ 5.6 mmol/L 
d. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR c reatinine clearance by Cockcroft -Gault ≥ 60 
mL/min for patients with serum creatinine > 1.5 x IULN  
e. Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ IU LN for patients with 
total bilirubin > 1.5 x IULN 
f. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x IULN 
g. INR or PT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 
h. aPTT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants  
9. Sexually active women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use contracepti ve methods as described in Section 5.8 prior to study entry , for the duration 
of study participation, and for 120 days after last dose of MK -3475.  Should a woman 
become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must  
inform her treating physician immedi ately.  
 
10. Patients with the a bility  to understand and willing ness to sign an IRB approved written 
informed consent document  will be enrolled into the trial. However, should a patient 
lose their ability to consent while participating in this study and s/he is still receiving 
clinical benefit  from participation , s/he may continue on study with the consent of a 
Legally Authorized Representative.

Cancer Center.  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 20 of 70  
The following steps must be taken before registering patients to this study:  
1. Confirmation of patient eligibility  by Washington University 
2. Registration of patient in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database  
3. Assignment of unique patient number (UPN)

coordinator will forward verification of enrollment and the UPN via email.  
 
4.1 Confirmation of Patient Eligibility  
 
Confirm patient eligibility by collecting  the information listed below  and scanning and 
emailing it to the research coordinator listed in the Siteman Cancer Center Clinical Trials 
Core Protocol Procedures for Secondary Sites packet at least one business day prior to 
registering patient: 
 
1. Your name and contact information (telephone number, fax number, and email 
address)  
2. Your site PI’s name, the r egistering MD’s name, and your institution name 
3. Patient’s race, sex, and DOB

9. Copy of appropriate source documentation confirming patient eligibility  
 
4.2 Patient Registration in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore Database 
 
Registrations may be submitted Monday through Friday between 8am and 5pm CT. Urgent late afternoon or early morning enrollments should be planned in advance and coordinated with the Washington Univer sity research coordinator.  Registration will be confirmed by 
the research coordinator or his/her delegate by email within one business day. Verification of eligibility and registration should be kept in the patient chart.  All p atients  at all sites must be registered through the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore 
database at Washington University. 
 
4.3 Assignment of UPN  
 Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study.  All data will be recorded with this identification number on the appropriate CRFs.  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 21 of 70 4.4 Phase II Patients  
 
As of Amendment 12, patien ts enrolled in the phase II portion of this trial will no longer 
be randomized. After registration and surgery (if applicable ), these patients will undergo 
MLA followed by MK-3475 treatment.  
  
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Patients enrolling in phase I will receive the first dose of MK-3475 will be given not more than 1 
week after MLA , and it will be administered every 3 weeks +/- 4 days thereafter until progression 
or unacceptable toxicity.  
 The phase II dos e will be determined during the phase I portion of this study.  Patients enrolling 
in phase II will need to have tissue available for diagnostic purpose and for immunological 
monitoring. Surgical resection/debulking is per standard of care and optional for the purpose of 
this study and the performing neurosurgeon will determine whether each patient will undergo 
surgery.   All phase II patients will undergo MLA followed by MK -3475.  Patient s who are planning to have 
surgical resection/debulking will have MLA performed at least 3 weeks but not more than 6 weeks 
after surgical resection/debulking.    
 Patients who are not planning to have surgical  resection/debulking will have a  biopsy for tiss ue 
diagnosis and immune monitoring during MLA . If there is a patient with suspected GBM and the 
pathology results are not available by the time the patient is scheduled to start treatment with MK -
3475, s/he will not be treated and will be removed from stud y. “Determined to be ineligible” will 
be listed as the “Reason Off Therapy” in the OnCore database. The date pathology results were reviewed and/or the date the final determination about eligibility was made will be used as the “Date Off Therapy.” Patients removed from study due to suspected GBM not being confirmed 
through pathology will not be included in the patient total enrolled and will be replaced.  All patients will receive their first dose of  MK-3475 not more than 1 week after MLA (if 
applicable) or biopsy, and then every 3 weeks +/ - 4 days thereafter .  For patients who had surgical 
debulking but did not undergo MLA, MK -3475 will be started at least 3 weeks but not more than 
6 weeks after surgical debulking, and then every 3 weeks +/ - 4 days thereafter .  Dosing of MK -
3475 will continue at the  dose determined by phase I until progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
 For all phase II patients, r esearch blood will be drawn prior to MLA and immediately prior to the 
first dose of MK -3475.  Subsequently, research blood will be drawn at doses 2, 4, 6, 9, 18, 36, and 
at the end of treatment.  In addition, an optional ipsilateral cervical lymph node may be sampled 
by FNA prior to or at the time of surgical procedure (including surgical debulking , MLA , or 
biopsy) and again 6 weeks after surgery.  Those patients who, in the event of surgical intervention 
for clinical reasons of a radiographically progressing tumor, undergo a subsequent surgical procedure (whether biopsy or resection) will have tissu e collected for correlative analysis after 
histopathologic diagnosis of recurrent  GBM.  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 22 of 70  
Additionally, for patients enrolled to phase II who have surgical intervention for a radiographically 
progressing tumor but subsequent surgical pathology demonstrating a predominant immune -
mediated reaction  with no obvious progression of tumor , such subjects will be deemed not to 
have progressed and be allowed to resume assigned study treatment at a time deemed safe by the treating physician, but no later than 8 weeks from the surgery.   
5.1 Premedication Administration  
 
No premedications are required, but antiemetics may be given as per institutional practice if needed.  
5.2 Agent Administration  
 
MK-3475 will be given intravenously over the course of 30 minutes ( -5 min/+10 min) on 
an outpatient basis.  The starting dose for the phase I portion of the study is 100 mg every 
3 weeks ; please refer to the dose escalation schema in Section 5. 4 for dosing during phase 
I.  As determined during the phase I  portion of the study, the phase II dose of MK -3475 for 
all patients is 200 mg .  In the phase I portion of this study, MK-3475 will be given every 3 
weeks starting no more than 1 week after MLA.   In the phase II portion of this study, MK -
3475 will be given every 3 weeks beginning no mor e than 1 week  (+/- 3 days) after MLA.  
 
5.3 MRI -Guided Laser Ablation  
 
MLA is a minimally invasive laser surgery, which employs a small incision in the scalp 
and skull, through which a thin laser probe is inserted and guided by MR imaging to the 
core of the tum or mass where it delivers hyperthermic ablation from the core to the rim.  
The maximal temperature in the core can reach 70 °C, resulting in coagulative necrosis.  
MLA will be performed as per standard of care.  In those who have undergone a gross total 
resection, the MLA will be directed at treating a peritumoral margin of 0.5 -1cm 
surrounding the resection cavity to disrupt the BBB and potentially increase access of MK -
3475 to the peritumoral infiltrating glioma cells.  
 
After initiation of anesthesia and placement of an MRI -compatible head holder, a  MRI -
guided navigation system is registered using preoperative MRI to define the centroid of the 
target lesion. After inserting the probe in the lesion and positioning the patient in the MRI 
scanner, the laser (1064 nm wavelength, 10- 14 Watts power, pulse duration 2.2 seconds 
on, 1.7 seconds off) is activated and real -time thermal isodose MRI is monitored to achieve 
sufficient treatment (no limit to exposure duration). The NeuroBlate  software provides 
predictive thermal dosage lines.  Yellow lines for 43 °C  are set for 2 min and blue lines for 
43°C for 10 min to estimate ablation volume. These thermal dosage lines will be used to 
establish treatment duration, movement of the probe, and additional trajectories depending 
on the location, shape and size of the target lesion. For some patients, additional trajectories 
are chosen preoperatively; for other patients, additional trajectories are chosen based on 
thermal dosage lines of the initial trajectory. After successful ablation, the probe is removed 
and the wound is closed in routine fashion.  Patients are generally hospitalized for one or 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 23 of 70 two days after the procedure, and monitoring will take place as described below. 
 Perioperative care will be consistent with current standard care for patients undergoing craniotomy or biopsy of a brain tumor.  This includes either ICU or step- down unit post -
operative stay. Typically, these patients are placed on perioperative steroids to reduce the 
risk of post -treatment edema. Also, the patients are placed on prophylactic ant iepileptics 
(i.e. Keppra) to mitigate perioperative and post- treatment seizures. During post -operative 
recovery, patients have routine neurological exams per the care team.  In the ICU this is on an hourly basis; in the stepdown unit this is every two hours. Additionally, post -operative 
labs are obtained immediately after surgery and on the following day to ensure there are no metabolic abnormalities. They are also seen in the morning and in the late afternoon by the neurosurgical team.  
 
5.4 Phase I Dose Escala tion Schema  
 
Dose Escalation Schedul e 
Dose Level  MK-3475 Dose  
Level 1  (Starting Dose)  100 mg IV q3wks  
Level 2  150 mg IV q3wks  
Level 3  200 mg IV q3wks  
 
A decision regarding dose escalation will not take place until all patients in the Level 1 
cohort have received the post -MLA dose of MK -3475 and the Principal Investigator has 
been able to review all toxicities  for 3 weeks after that dose. 
 
NOTE:  No later than two weeks following the completion of the first two months of 
treatment for the first 3 patients enrolled in this trial, interim safety data must be provided 
to the FDA as a formal IND submission.  This submission should include a listing of all AEs of grade 2 or greater severity observed.  For all AEs of grade 3 or greater severity, and for all SAEs, a narrative description of the events should be included, along with the timing 
of the event in relationship to study treatment, interventions, duration, and outcome.  
 
5.5 Definition of MTD, DLT, and Dose Escalation Criteria  
 
5.5.1 Definition of Maximum  Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose- limiting toxicity during the first cycle.  Dose escalations will proceed until the 
MTD has been reached or, failing that, 200 mg q3wks will be considered the MTD. 
 
5.5.2 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) 
 
DLT is defined as any of the following that occur during the  time frame between 
the first dose of MK -3475 and 3 weeks after the second dose of MK -3475 that are 
attributed as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study treatment:  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 24 of 70 • Grade 2 or greater diarrhea 
• Autoimmune hypophysitis 
• Grade 3 or greater h epatitis  
• Grade 2 or greater p neumonitis 
• Significant intracranial edema requiring high- dose steroid (defined as > 16 
mg/day and/or inability to taper steroids to ≤ 8 mg/day within 4 weeks due 
to recurrent symptoms attributable to excessive cranial edema)  
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity 
• Grade 3 or greater hematologic toxicity  
 
5.5.3 Dose Escalation Criteria  
 
Dose escalations will proceed as follows after the occurrence of DLT:  
Number of Patients with 
DLT at a Given Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule 
0 out of 3  Enter 3 patients at the next dose level  
2 or 3 out of 3  Dose escalation  will be stopped and 3 patients will be entered 
at the next lowest dose level  if only 3 patients were treated 
previously at that dose . 
1 out of 3  • Enter at least 3 more patients at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to the next 
dose level . 
• If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose escalation is 
stopped and 3  additional patients will be entered at the next 
lowest dose level  if only 3 patients were treated previously at 
that dose . 
≤ 1 out of 6 at highest dose 
level below the maximally 
administered dose  This is generally the recommended phase II dose.  At least 6 
patients must be entered at the recommended phase II dose. 
 
5.6 Toxicity, Response, and DLT Evaluations 
 
All patients who receive any treatment with MK -3475 are evaluable for toxicity.  Patients 
are evaluated from first receiving study treatment until a 30 -day follow -up after the 
conclusion of treatment or death. 
 All phase II patients are evaluable for disease response unless they come off study before 
any disease assessment.  
 
A phase I patient is evaluable for DLT assessment from the time of the first dose of MK -
3475 through 3 weeks following the second dose of MK -3475.  Once the patient has 
received his/her third dose of MK -3475, s/he will no longer be evaluated for DLTs.  
Patients who do not incur a DLT and who receive only a single dose of MK -3475 or who 
do not undergo MLA should be considered not evaluable for DLT and shoul d be replaced.  
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 25 of 70 5.7 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a patient’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards 
of medical care.  Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies while in screening for and enrolled in this trial:  
• Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy .  Treatment with 
bevacizumab as a steroid -sparing agent is allowed  on trial.  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than MK -3475 
• Radiation therapy  
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of treatment and while participating in the  trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. 
 
5.7.1 Supportive Care Guidelines for Infusion Reactions  
 
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.   The table below shows tr eatment guidelines for patients who experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of MK -3475.

5.8 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women  with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation ) are required to 
have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours  prior to the first dose of  
MK-3475.   
 
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  
 For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).    A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  Wom en in the following categories are not 
considered of childbearing potential:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note:  Documentation can c ome from the site personnel’s review of the 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
 
• Postmenopausal female 
o A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  
 A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 27 of 70 in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH 
measurements in the postmenopausal range is required .  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the non- hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT  during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
 
Contraception Requirements  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to 
participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described below) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior  
to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of trial therapy.  If there is any question that a subject of childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study.  
Male Participants: 
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to one of the following during the protocol defined timef rame:  
• Be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent 
• Use a male condom plus partner use of a contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1%  per year as described in the table below when having penile -vaginal 
intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant. 
o Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile -vaginal int ercourse or use a male condom during each 
episode of penile penetration. 
 
Female Participants  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use 
a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correct ly as described in the 
table below during the protocol- defined timeframe.  
 
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent a  
Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
● Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing ) hormonal contraception b, c 
○ Oral  
○ Intravaginal  
○ Transdermal  
○ Injectable  
● Progestogen -only hormonal contraception b, c 
○ Oral  
○ Injectable  
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dependency  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 28 of 70 ● Progestogen - only contraceptive implant b, c  
● Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS) b  
● Intrauterine device (IUD) 
● Bilateral tubal occlusion  
● Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed.  If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
● Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
treatment.  The reliability of sexual abstinence n eeds to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)  
Notes:  
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants 
of clinical studies.  
 
a) Typical use failure rates are lower than perfect- use failure rates (i.e. when used consistently and 
correctly).  
b) If hor monal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study treatment, 
condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment period and for at 
least [X days, corresponding to time needed to eliminate st udy treatment plus 30 days for study treatments 
with genotoxic potential] after the last dose of study treatment.  
c) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
hormonal contraceptives are limited  to those which inhibit ovulation.   
 
Pregnancy Testing 
WOCBP should only be included after a negative highly sensitive urine or serum 
pregnancy test.  
 Following initiation of treatment, pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected, after the last dose of study treatment, and as required locally.  Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
 
5.9 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for up to 
24 months (35 cycles; t he number of treatments is calculated starting with the first dose ) 
or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 29 of 70 • Documented and confirmed disease progression 
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient f rom study 
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar .  
 Patients currently on pembrolizumab beyond the 2 year/35 cycle limit at the time of the 
approval of Amendment 13 may continue to receive pembrolizumab unless there is 
progression, toxicity or agreement by the patient and PI to come off therapy.   Participan ts who discontinue pembrolizumab after receiving 35 doses are eligible for 
retreatment with pembrolizumab if they progress during follow -up provided they meet the 
requir ements detailed in Section 5.10 . Participants may receive an additional 17 cycles ( 12 
months) of pembrolizumab during the Second Course Phase (Retreatment). 
 
5.10 Second Course Phase  
 
All participants who discontinue treatment with pembrolizumab with at least stable disease  
are eligible for 17  further cycles (approximately 1 year) of pembrolizumab if they progress 
during follow -up.  This retreatment is termed the Second Course Phase of this study and is 
only available if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 
1. The study is open at the time the patient qualifies for retreatment.  
2. The patient experienced investigator -determined radiographic disease progression by 
RANO criteria (see Section 12) during the follow -up period after stopping initial 
treatment with pembrolizumab and: 
a. No new anticancer treatment was administered after the last dose of pembrolizumab and 
b. The participant meets all of the inclusion criteria for lab parameters and 
performance status  
3. The patient EITHER:  
a. Had stable disease, partial response, or complete response based on RANO criteria and discontinued pembrolizumab after completion of 35 doses 
(approximately 2 years) for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability or 
b. Discontinued pembrolizumab after attaining an investigator -determined 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 30 of 70 confirmed complete response by RANO criteria, received at least 8 cycles of  
pembrolizumab prior to discontinuation, and received at least 2 treatments with 
pembrolizumab beyond the date when initial CR was declared 
An objective response or disease progression that occurs during the Second Course Phase for a participant will not b e counted as an event for the primary analysis of either endpoint 
in this study.  
5.11 Duration of Follow- up 
 
Patients will have one follow -up visit 4 weeks (+/ - 1 week) after stopping treatment.  They 
will then be followed for up to 2 years for survival.  Rout ine follow -up will be conducted 
as per standard of care but is not mandated by this protocol.  Patients removed from study 
for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution  or stabilization of the 
adverse event.  
  
6.0 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than on body system simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications.   
Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administrat ion of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. 
For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in the table below. 
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 31 of 70  
General instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has been 
tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of las t dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
3. For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment sh ould be initiated if 
irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids.

initial receipt of the information.   
• Report a suspected adverse react ion that is both serious and unexpected 
(SUSAR, refer to Appendix B) no later than 15 calendar days after it is 
determined that the information qualifies for reporting.  Report an adverse event (refer to Appendix B) as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as:  
o A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure 
o One or more occurrences of an event that is not comm only associated 
with drug exposure but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug 
o An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 36 of 70 than in a concurrent or historical control group  
• Report any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of 
multiple studies, or clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug no later than 15 calendar days after it is determined that the information qualifies for reporting. 
• Report any findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest significant 
risk in humans exposed to the drug no later than 15 calendar days after it is 
determined that the information qualifies for reporting.  
• Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction of that listed in the protocol or IB within 15 calendar days after it is determined that the information qualifies for reporting.  
 
Submit each report as an IND safety report in a narrative format or on FDA Form 3500A or in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive.  Study teams must notify the Siteman Cancer Center Protocol Development team of each potentially reportable event within 1 business day after initial receipt of the information, and must bring the signed 1571 and FDA Form 3500A to the Siteman Cancer Center Protocol Development team no later than 1 business day prior to the due date for reporting to the F DA. 
 Each notification to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents (“IND Safety Report”) and must be transmitted to the review division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Resear ch (CBER) that has responsibility for review of the IND.  Relevant 
follow- up information to an IND safety report must be submitted as soon as the 
information is available and must be identified as such (“Follow -up IND Safety 
Report”).  
 
7.1.5 Reporting to Merck &  Co., Inc. 
 
The WU PI shall forward to Merck’s Global Safety group (FAX 215-661-6229) any SAE and SUSAR information, including, but not limited to, all initial and follow- up information involving any study subject in the study within 24 hours 
(whichever comes first) of learning of the SAE or SUSAR.  
 “Adverse Event” or “AE” shall mean any untoward medical occurrence in a Study subject who is administered the Study Drug regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the Study Drug exists.   By way of example and without limitation, 
an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the Study Drug.   “Serious Adverse Event” or “SAE” shall mean any untoward medical occurrence in a Study subject who is administered the Study Drug that results in death, a life -
threatening drug experience, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or

condition of the study, or overdose.  Other important medical events that may 
jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes 
listed previously should also be considered “serious.”  “Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction” or “SUSAR” shall mean any Serious Adverse Event, the nature, severity or frequency of which is not consistent with information in the most current investigator’s brochure, or with respect to a 
marketed product the most current Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) or Package Insert.  
 
7.1.5.1 Reporting Overdose  
 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific 
information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment  should be provided if clinically indicated.  
In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
 
If a dose of Merck’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is 
taken without any assoc iated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory 
results, the  overdose is reported as a non- serious Event of Clinical Interest 
(ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
 All reports of overdose with and without  an adverse event must be reported 
within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 661-6229)

considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them)  that occurs during the trial. 
 Pregnancies and infant exposures during breastfeeding that occur after the consent form is signed but before registration must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.    Pregnancies and infant exposures during breastfeeding that occur from the time of registration through 120 days following c essation of Sponsor’s 
product, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investigator.  All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination  of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of 
spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregn ancy 
continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 
working days to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 661-6229) 
 
7.2 Reporting Requi rements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington University Sponsor- Investigator and Designee of all serious adverse events (Refer to 
Appendix B)  within 1 working day of the occurrence of the event or notification of the 
secondary site’s PI of the event.  This notification may take place via email if there is not yet enough information for a formal written report using a FDA form 3500a ( MedWatch 
form)  and Washington University cover sheet (Appendix D).  A formal written report must 
be sent to the Washington University Sponsor-Investigator within 4 calendar  days (for 
fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions ) or 11 calendar days (for serious 
unexpected adverse reactions) of the occurrence of the event or  notification of the 
secondary site’s PI of the event.  
 The research team at a secondary site is responsible for following its site’s guidelines for reporting applicable events to its site’s IRB according to its own institutional guidelines.  
The research team at Washington University is responsible for reporting all applicable events to the FDA and Merck & Co. as needed. 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 39 of 70  
Washington University pre -approval of all protocol exceptions must be obtained prior to 
implementing the change. Local IRB approval must be obtained as per local guidelines. Washington University IRB approval is not required for protocol exceptions occurring at secondary sites.  
 
7.3 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
 
Events that do not require expedited reporting as described in Section 7.1 include: 
• Planned hospitalizations 
• Hospitalizations < 24 hours 
• Respite care  
• Events related to disease progression 
 
Events that do not require expedited reporting must still be captured in the EDC.

12.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
12.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 9 +/- 1 
weeks.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 9 weeks 
(not less than 4) weeks following initial documentation of objective response. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the updated response assessment criteria for high -grade gliomas: Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology 
(RANO) working group guideline [JCO 28(11): 1963-1972, 2010].  
Criteria for Determining First Progression Depending on Time from Initial Chemoradiotherapy  
First Progression  Definition  
Progressive disease < 12 
weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy
 Progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new 
enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high- dose region or 
80% isodose line) or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling (eg, solid tumor areas [ie, > 70% 
tumor cell nuclei 
in areas], high or progressive increase in MIB-1 proliferation index compared with prior biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression or increased anaplasia in tumor). Note: Given the difficulty of differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of progression, will not 
be sufficient for definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after 
completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.  
Prog ressive disease ≥ 12 
weeks after chemoradiotherapy 
completion
 1. New contrast -enhancing lesion outside of radiation field on 
decreasing, stable, or increasing doses of corticosteroids.  
2. Increase by ≥ 25% in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters between the first postradiotherapy scan, or a subsequent scan with smaller tumor size, and the scan at 12 weeks or later on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. 
 
3. Clinical deterioration not attributable to concurrent medication or comorbid conditions is sufficient to declare progression on current treatment but not for entry onto a clinical trial for recurrence. 
 
4. For patients receiving antiangiogenic therapy, significant increase in 
T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion may also be considered progressive 
disease. The increased T2/FLAIR must have occurred with the patient on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy and 
not be a result of comorbid events (eg, effects of radiation thera py, 
demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative 
changes, or other treatment effects).

Criteria for Response Assessment Incorporating MRI and Clinical Factors (Adapted from JCO 2010) 
Response  Criteria  
Complete response • Requir es all of the following: complete disappearance of all enhancing 
measurable and nonmeasurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks.  
• No new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions. 
• Patients must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologi c replacement 
doses only) and stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable disease only cannot have a complete response; the best 
response possible is stable disease.  
Partial response Requires all of the following:  
• ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained 
for at least 4 weeks.  
• No progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
• Stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan; the corticosteroid 
dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose 
at time of baseline scan.  
• Stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable 
disease only cannot have  a partial response; the best response possible is 
stable disease.  
Stable disease Requires all of the following:  
• Does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression.  
• Stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow-up imaging shows that this increase in corticos teroids was 
required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid 
dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  
Progression Defined by any of the following:  
• ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of 
enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement 
obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids
*. The absolute increase in any 
dimension must be at least 5mm when calculating the products. 
• Significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy
* not caused by comorbid events (e.g. 
radiation therapy, demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, 
postoperative changes, or other treatment effects).  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 51 of 70 Response  Criteria  
• Any new measureable lesion . 
• Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the 
tumor (e.g. seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of 
therapy, cerebrovascu lar events, infection, and so on) or changes in 
corticosteroid dose. 
• Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating 
condition; or clear progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
• NOTE. All measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be a ssessed using the same techniques as at 
baseline.  
• Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; FLAIR, fluid -attenuated inversion recovery.  
• Stable doses of corticosteroids include patients not on corticosteroids.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Bi-dimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins 
by MRI scan  of ≥ 10 mm .  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters).   
 
Non-measurable or evaluable disease:   Uni-dimens ionally measurable lesions or lesions 
with margins not clearly defined such as  areas of T2/FLAIR signal abnormality or poorly 
defined enhancing abnormality.  
 
Note: For cystic lesions, the only measurable part is any enhancement area around the cyst 
that is clearly defined and bi -dimensionally measurable. The cyst itself should not be 
considered measurable or non- measureable disease.  
 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions that are seen at baseline MRI. Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of thei r size (lesions with the longest diameter), but in addition 
should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  When there are too many measurable lesions, choose the largest 3 lesions as target lesions to follow.  The other measurable lesions should be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status determination.  Non-target lesions:  All non -measurable lesions should be identified as non -target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler.  All baseline MRI evaluations should be performed  prior to MLA . An MRI should be collected 
and evaluated after any surgical procedure (MLA, surgical resection/debulking, or biopsy).  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 52 of 70 MRI should also be collected prior to first dose of MK -3475 for patients not receiving any 
surgical procedure.    
    
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable on brain MRI when 
they are ≥ 10 mm in bi-dimensional diameter s as assessed using a ruler.  
 
Histology:  This technique can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases when biopsy or surgical resection of a measureable 
lesion is clinically indicated.  
 
Perfusion/CBV: This advanced brain MRI technique can  be used as an adjunct test to 
determine treatment response or disease status.  However, it should not be used as the primary or sole method to determine response or disease status.  
 Brain FDG -PET coupled with head CT or brain MRI:  This advanced metabolic  
imaging technique can be used as an adjunct test to determine response or disease status. However it should be used as the primary or sole method of determining response or disease status.  
 
12.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 Partial Response (PR):   ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of 
products of perpendicular diameters of all target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 25% increase in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of at least 1 target lesion, taking as reference the smallest sum of products of perpendicular diameters on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).   The absolute increase in any dimension must be at 
least 5mm when calculating the products of perpendicular diameters.  In the event of surgical intervention for clinical reasons of a radiographically progressing tumor when subsequent surgical pathology demonstrates a predominant immune -mediated reaction  with no obvious progression of tumor , 
the subject will be deemed not progressed and allowed to resume study treatment as assigned prior to the surgery at a time deemed safe by the treating physician, but no later than 8 weeks from the surgery.  Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters while on study. 
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 53 of 70 12.3.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s).  
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions on stable or increasing doses 
of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy
* not caused by comorbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects) . Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  
It must be representative of overall disea se status change, not a single lesion 
increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a l ater time by the review panel (or 
Principal Investigator).  
 
12.3.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressi ve 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

* Progression occurs when this criterion is present.  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 54 of 70 † Increase in corticosteroids alone will not be taken into account  in determining progression in the 
absence of persistent clinical deterioration.  
NOTE: Patients may continue on  treatment and rem ain under close obs ervation and evalu ation at 
4-8 week interv als if there is u ncertainty  regar ding whether  pseudoprogression may be present as 
determined by the investigators.  If subsequ ent radiographic or clinical assessments  suggest th at 
the pa tient is in fact exp eriencing pr ogression,  then the da te of progres sion should be t he time point  
at which t his issue was first raised.  Similarly, stab le disease may be assigned in cases of  presu med 
“pseudop rogres sion” associa ted with dec reased ster oid use. 
 
12.3.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement c riteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
12.3.5 Neurological Exam and Performance Status   
 Patients will be graded using the Karnofsky Performance Status scale and their 
neurological function evaluated as improved, stable or deteriorated in addition to objective measurement of tumor size. These parameters will be used to determine the overall response assessment.  
 
12.3.6 Progression -Free Surviv al 
 PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
  
13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, an 
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSM B) will be specifically convened for this 
trial to review toxicity data.  A DSM B will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical 
investigators and a biostatistician.  Like investigators, DSM B members a re subject to the 
Washington University School of Medicine policies regarding standards of conduct. Individuals 
invited to serve on the DSM B will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the trial principal 
investigator and/or appropriate university  officials, in accordance with institution policies. 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 55 of 70 Potential conflicts that develop during a trial or a member’s tenure on a DSM B must also be 
disclosed.  
 Until such a time as the first secondary site enrolls its first patient, a semi -annual DSM report to 
be prepared by the study team will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) semi- annually beginning six months after study activation at Washington 
University (if at least one patient has been enrolled) or one year after study activation (if no patients have been enrolled at the six -month mark). 
 The DSM report will be prepared by the study team  with assistance from the study  statistician , 
will be reviewed by the DSM B, and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (QASMC).  The DSMB must meet at least every six months beginning six 
months after study activation at Washington University or beginning six months after enrollment of the first patient at a secondary site, no more than one month prior to the due date of the DSM report to QASMC.    During the phase I dose escalation, the Principal Investigator will review all patient data at least monthly (or before each dose  escalation if occurring sooner than monthly), and provide a semi -
annual report to the QASMC.  During the phase II, the Principal Investigator /DSM B will review 
all patient data at least every six months, and provide a semi -annual report to the QASMC. This 
report will include:  
• HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal I nvestigator name, data coordinator 
name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician 
• Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study

suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, 
error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason 
• Study- wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  including numbers from 
participating sites  
• Protocol activation date  at each participating site  
• Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  at each 
participating site  
• Expected accrual end date , accrual by site,  and accrual by cohort

met the early stopping rules 
• Summary of toxicities at all participating sites separated by cohorts with the number of 
dose- limiting toxicities indicated  
• Abstract submissions/publications  
• Summary of any recent literature that may affect the  safety or ethics of the study  
 
Further DSMC responsibilities are described in the DSMC charter.  
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 56 of 70 Until such a time as the first secondary site activates this protocol, a semi -annual D ata and Safety 
Monitoring report to be prepared by the study team will be submitted to the QASM Committee 
beginning 6 months after study activation at Washington University. 
 The study principal investigator and coordinator will monitor for serious toxicities on an ongoing 
basis. Once the principal investigator or coordinator becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE 
will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according to institutional guidelines  (please refer to 
Section 7.0).  Refer to the Washington University Quality Assurance and Data Safety Monitoring Committee Policies and Procedures for full details on the responsibilities of the DSMC at https://siteman.wustl.edu/research/clinical -research -resources/protocol -office -prmcqas mc/.   
  
14.0 AUDITING  
 
As coordinating center of this trial, Washington University (via the Quality Assurance and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (QASMC) will monitor each participating site to ensure that all protocol requirements are being met; that applicable f ederal regulations are being followed; and that best 
practices for patient safety and data collection are being followed per protocol. Participating sites 
will be asked to send copies of all audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notif ication will be sent to the Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will 
obtain the audit materials from the participating institution.  
 Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. 
Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially sele cted, the research team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.  Items to be evaluated include:  
• Subject screening and enrollment 
• Reporting of adverse events 
• Maintenance of HIPAA compliance 
• Completeness of regulatory document ation  
• Completeness of participant documentation 
• Acquisition of informed consent  
• IRB documentation 
• Issues of protocol adherence

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 57 of 70 15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
15.1 Power Analysis  
 
In the phase I portion of the study, a traditional 3+3 design is used to determine the maximal 
tolerated dose (MTD) of MK -3475 when combined with MLA for the treatment of 
recurrent malignant gliomas.  
 Power analysis for phase II is based on PFS.  Using a 1-sided alpha of 0.15, with an accrual 
interval of 20 months and additional follow-up of 6 months (study period in Phase II is 26 months), and assuming a progression free survival probability at 6 month ( 6-PFS) of 40% 
for the MK -3475 alone group and 65% fo r MK -3475 + MLA combination group, we will 
need 17 patients per group with probability (power) 0.8. If the 6 -PFS of the MK -3475 alone 
group is 45% and 65% for the MK -3475 + MLA combination group, we will need 25 
patients per group.  We are planning to enro ll 20 patients per group for th e phase II portion 
of trial.

Six-PFS for all current commonly used treatments for recurrent GBM (e.g. bevacizumab, 
temozolomide, carboplatin, carmustine, lomustine, etoposide, irinot ecan) ranges from < 
10% to low 30% 39-43. Since historical data on 6- PFS in recurrent GBM for both MK -3475 
and MLA are not available, for the purpose of reasonable estimation of efficacy of the  MK-
3475 and MLA combination as compared to MK -3475 alone in recurrent/progressive 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 58 of 70 GBM, we will assume that the 6 -PFS of the MK -3475 alone group to be 40- 45% to derive 
sample size estimates for both groups as detailed above.  
 
15.2 Analysis Plan 
 
PFS and OS will  be estimated by Kaplan- Meier product limit method and the difference in 
PFS with recurrent GBM  being treated with MK -3475 alone vs. those being treated with 
MK-3475 plus MLA will be compared by log-rank test.  
 
Two-group t -test will be used to compare the anti- glioma immune response before and 
after MK -3475 with or without MLA. 
 Cox proportional hazard model will be used to determine the relationship between intratumoral expression of PD -L1, the frequency of glioma cell -specific cytotoxic T cells 
with PFS and OS while proportional hazard assumption will be 
examined .  
 Pearson correlation coefficient (r) will be calculated between intratumoral expression of PD-L1 and the frequency of glioma cell -specific cytotoxic T cells. Similarly, Cox 
proportional hazard model will be used to investigate the relationship between PD -1-
dependent biomarkers in gl ioma cell -specific T cells and PFS and OS
. 
 
15.3 Phase II Stopping Rules  
 
Toxicity will be reviewed on a continuous basis. Early stopping of this trial is calculated based  upon the grade 3 seizure rate. It is assumed that a maximum -tolerated seizure rate is 
50% and a seizure rate of 33% and or less is acceptable. For each treatment arm (n=20), based on the repeated significance testing (using R function toxbdry) with 80% power and 0.05 overall Type I error, the study will be halted if a treatment -related seizure occurs in 
the first patient, or both of the first 2 patients, or 3 of the first 4, or 4 of the first 5, or 5 of 
the first 7, or 6 of the first 9, or 7 of the first 1 1, or 8 of the first 14, or 9 of the first 16, or 
10 of the first 18, or if the 11th treatment -related seizure is observed before the last (20th) 
patient has completed the trial.  
 In addition, enrollment will stop and a review will be conducted to determin e whether 
modifications to the protocol are warranted or if the trial should be terminated if 2 patients 
in either group die or incur life -threatening (grade 4) adverse reactions that are thought 
to be at least possibly related to study treatment.  
 
15.4 Interim  Analysis  
 
Per DSMC request, an interim analysis was conducted  in June 2019.  The MK-3475 + 
MLA group included 2 GBM patients who received 200mg in Phase 1 and 10 patients in Phase 2.  PFS probability at 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment are 45.0%, 45.0%, and 
33.8%, the median PFS is 5.49 months. Survival probabilities at 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment are 75.0%, 62.5%, and 50.0%, and the median OS is not estimable.  For the MK-
3475 monotherapy (no MLA)  group, PFS probability at 3 months after treatment is 44.4% 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 59 of 70 and the median PFS is 2.73 months (95% CI: 1.41- 3.88). Survival probabilities at 3 and 6 
months after treatment are 83.3%, and 31.3%, and the median OS is 4.77 months (95% CI: 
1.74-8.78).   
 This analysis showed significant differences in PFS and survival probabilities between the 
MK-3475 + MLA group and the MK -3475 alone group.  Therefore, with Amendment 12, 
we are revising the study to a single arm (MK -3475 + MLA)  in the s pirit of minimizing 
harm, potential or perceived, to subjects and to complete the study in a timely manner. The recent study
46 shows median PFS was 2.4 months. To be conservative, we will use the 
shorter  mPFS for MK -3475 + MLA group and longer mPFS  from historical data. We will 
enroll additional 27 patients and expect 20 GBM patients  will be  evaluable for this study. 
With an accrual interval of 20 months and additional follow -up of 6 months, a two-sided, 
one-sample logrank test calculated from a sam ple of 32 subjects achieves 8 0.9% power at 
a 0.05 significance level to detect a median PFS of 5.1 months  in the MK -3475 + MLA 
group when the median PFS of the historical control is 2.9 months .  
 
15.5 Subgroup analysis  
 
For participants in the Second Course Phase (Retreatment) , PFS and OS will be estimated 
by Kaplan- Meier product limit method .  
  
16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 Washington University requires that each participating site sends its informed consent document 
to be reviewed and approved by the Washington University Regulatory Coordinator (or designee) 
prior to IRB/IEC submission.    
 Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has received official written documentation from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to  begin enrollment.  At a minimum, 
each participating institution must have the following documents on file at Washington University 
prior to study activation : 
• Documentation of IRB approval of the study in the form of a letter or other official 
document fro m the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by the IRB. 
• Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must 
include a statement that data will be shared with Washin gton University, including the 
Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if applicable), and the Washington University study team. 
• Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572 (if applicable), and the CVs of all 
participating inves tigators.  
• Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site.  
 The coordinating center Principal Investigator (or designee) is responsible for disseminating to the 
participating sites all study updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electronically to the secondary sites within 4 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 60 of 70 weeks of obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated s econdary sites are expected 
to submit protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt unless 
otherwise noted .  Upon the secondary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of such 
shall be sent to the Washington University study team within 2 weeks of receipt of approval. 
 Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protocol amendments or revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must be kept on file at Washington University.  The investigator or a designee from each institution must participate in a regular conference call 
to update and inform regarding the progress of the trial.

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 65 of 70 APPENDIX B:  Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:   Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug- related.  
 Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms listed 
that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office 
for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relatio nship 
between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  Definition: any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” 
if, in the view of the investigator, its occurren ce places the patient at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 
D. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view 
of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event 
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 66 of 70 o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but , based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Events of Clinical Interest  
 
Events of clinical interest for this trial in clude: 
1. an overdose of Merck product that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory results.  
2. an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is ≥ 3 x IULN and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is ≥ 2 x IULN and, at the same time, an al kaline phosphatase lab value that is < 
2 x IULN, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.  
 
F. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
G. Deviation 
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective IRB 
approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents including 
the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, r ecruitment materials, questionnaires/data 
collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

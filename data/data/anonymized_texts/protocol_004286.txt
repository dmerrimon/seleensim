Summary - Study Design  Language updated: 
x Patients will receive olipudase alfa every 2 weeks 
for 9 years or until olipudase alfa becomes commercially accessible (see maximum duration 
below), whichever comes first, unless the patient 
decides to enter another olipudase alfa clinical trial 
within the 9- year period prior to  when olipudase alfa 
is commercially accessible.  
x The term “commercially accessible” is defined as 
when olipudase alfa is commercially accessible to 
each patient on an individual basis 
(eg, reimbursement being  in place). The duration of 
study treatment with olipuda se alfa between local 
Regulatory approval an d commercial accessibility 
should not exceed 90 days. Therefore, as described 
below, after local Regulatory approval, the patient 
can continue in the LTS13632 study for a maximum 
of 127 days. 
x This duration will ensure a maximum 90 days of 
study treatment with olipudase  alfa for patients after 
local Regulatory approval and a safety follow up 
phone call 30 to 37 days after the last dose of study 
treatment. 
x Notwithstanding the above, every pediatric patient 
will be treated with olipudase alfa in the LTS13632 
study for at least 3 years.

are exposed to long -term treatment with olipudase alfa. 
Secondary objective(s)  
The secondary objectives of this study ar e to obtain data regarding the efficacy 
of olipudase alfa and to characterize olipudase alfa pharmacodynamics (PD) 
and pharmacokinetics (PK) followi ng long-term administration. 
STUDY DESIGN This is a multinational, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, long-term 
treatment study of patients who have previously participated in a study of 
olipudase alfa.  
x Patients will receive olipudase alfa every 2 weeks for 9 years or until 
olipudase alfa becomes commercially accessible (see maximum 
duration below), whichever comes first, unless the patient decides to 
enter another olipudase alfa clinical trial within the 9- year period prior 
to when olipudase alfa is commercially accessible.  
x The term “commercially accessible” is defined as when olipudase alfa 
is commercially accessible to each patient on an individual basis 
(eg, reimbursement being  in place). The duration of study treatment 
with olipudase alfa between local Regulatory approval and commercial 
accessibility should not exceed 90 days. Therefore, as described 
below, after local Regulatory approval, the patient can continue in the 
LTS13632 study for a maximum of 127 days.  
x This will ensure 90 days of stud y treatment with olipudase alfa for 
patients after local Regulatory approval and a safety follow up phone 
call 30 to 37 days after the la st dose of study treatment.  
x Notwithstanding the above, every pe diatric patient will be treated in 
the LTS13632 study for at least 3 years.  
x The patient can switch immediately a fter the end of study treatment to 
commercial treatment with out any gap in order to ensure continuity of 
treatment with olipudase alfa.  
Patients will start this study at the same dose they were receiving at  the end of

Dose regimen Patients will receive an IV infusion of o lipudase alfa every 2 weeks (± 3 days).  
Home infusion may be possible.  Patients must meet specific eligibility requirements.  In addition , the investigator and the sponsor must agree that 
home infusion is appropriate. Quarterly visits will occur at the site. If the site visit 
is not possible during a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency such as the COVID
-19 pandemic due to site closure or 
extenuating circumstances  that prevent an in- person site visit and home infusion 
is already approved for the eligible patien t, quarterly visits will be done at 
home.Patients will continue their current do se if they have not missed more than 
1 dose between studies.  Dose reintrodu ction regimens may be required for 
patients who have missed more than 1  dose between studies or during this 
study, depending on their usual dose .  For patients receiving home infusions 
who have missed 2  or fewer doses, the investigator can decide whether 
reintroduction should occur at the hospital/ study site or via home infusion. For 
patients who have missed 3  or more doses ≥0.6 mg/kg, reintroduction of 
olipudase alfa should occur at the hospital/st udy site.  If the site visit is not 
possible, During a regional or nation al emergency declared by a governmental 
agency, such as the COVID -19 pandemic, due to site closure or extenuating 
circumstances that prevent an in -person site visit, reintroduction may be done

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE Patients will be enrolled directly from th eir previous study.  (Note: The term 
“pediatric patients only” means patients  coming from the or iginal pediatric trial, 
DFI13803.  Some of these patients will reach adult age [18 years old] while in 
this study.  These patients will be adult s by age, but they will remain part of the 
“pediatric patient” cohort.)  
In case of more than 3  infusions missed between trials, assessments 
(eg, efficacy biomarkers, sphingomyelin and metabolites) may be repeated at 
study entry.  
Patients who require dose reintroduction will have these assessments at each 
infusion until reaching their usual dose of olipudase alfa:  
x Before infusion: vital sign measuremen ts, liver function tests (LFTs), 
hematology, and safety biomarkers. 
x Immediately after infusion: vital sign measurements. 
x 24 hours after infusion: vital sign measurements, LFTs, and safety 
biomarkers. 
x 48 hours  after infusion: vital s ign measurements, LFTs and safety 
biomarkers. The 48 hours post- infusion assessments will no longer be 
assessed after the cutoff date for a planned second database lock of 
the study for regulatory submissions in 2021. 
During the dose escalation period, for transaminases assessed after 
infusion, if any AST or ALT value is >2x baseline and >ULN, the test should 
be repeated prior to the next sc heduled infusion. Depending on the test 
results, the dose can be adjusted (repe ated or reduced) or treatment can

Baseline is defined as the following:  
x For initial dose escalation: last values  prior to first dose of olipudase 
alfa 
x For dose re -escalation: last values prior to the first re -escalation dose  
Safety will be monitored continuously.  Safety and efficacy assessments will 
occur regularly every  3, 6, 9, and 12 months.  In the first 5 years, 
pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations will occur every 3  months then every 6 
months after the cutoff date for a pla nned second database lock of the study for 
purpose of regulatory submissions in 2021 . After 5 years, PD evaluations will 
occur every 12 months. PK evaluation will occur every 12  months only in the 
first 5 years and upon introduction of Process C( ) or Pro cess C( ) at any 
time during the study.  
For patients completing or discontinuing/wi thdrawing from the study, there will 
be a post treatment period consisting of an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit 2  weeks 
(±7 days) after the last adm inistered dose of olipudas e alfa and a safety 
follow -up phone call 30  to 37 days after the last administered dose.  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination
Sample size is determined by the nu mber of patients who complete the 
treatment phase of a previous clinical study of olipudase alfa, sign the informed consent form of the LTS13632 study, and meet the eligibility criteria. It is 
expected that the sample size for this study will be
 approximately 25. 
Analysis populations
The safety set will include all enrolled patient s who received at least 1 dose 
(partial or total) of olipudase alfa in the current study.  
Analysis of safety
Safety analyses will include a summary of treatment duration, the total number

Summary statistics for the values, nom inal change from ba seline, and percent 
change from baseline will be presented fo r efficacy assessments at various 
study time points.  The association be tween changes in efficacy parameters and 
total amount of drug received will be examined.  
Plasma concentration -time data will be analyzed using actual dosing and 
sampling times by noncompartmental meth ods. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
will be calculated for each patient and summarized  by dose level and study 
week. As data permit, PK parameters m ay also be evaluated across dose level 
at each manufacturing scale.  Metabolite levels will be summarized by dose 
level and time point using descriptive statistics.
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD 
(per patient) x The maximum study duration per patient is 9 years or until olipudase 
alfa becomes commercially accessible (see maximum duration 
below), whichever comes first, unless the patient decides to enter 
another olipudase alfa clinical trial within the 9-year  period prior to 
when olipudase alfa is commercially accessible. 
x The term “commercially accessible” is defined as when olipudase alfa 
is commercially accessible to each patient on an individual basis 
(eg, reimbursement being  in place). The duration of study treatment 
with olipudase alfa between  local Regulatory approval and 
commercial accessibility should not exceed 90 days. Therefore, as described below, after local Regulat ory approval, the patient can 
continue in the LTS13632 study for a maximum of 127 days. 
x This will ensure 90 days of stud y treatment with olipudase alfa for 
patients after local Regulatory approval and a safety follow up phone 
call 30 to 37 days after the la st dose of study treatment. 
x Notwithstanding the above, every pe diatric patient will be treated in 
the LTS13632 study for at least 3 years.  
x The patient can switch immediately a fter the end of study treatment to 
commercial treatment with out any gap in order to ensure continuity of 
treatment with olipudase alfa . An EOT visit after the last administered 
dose of study treatment and a safety follow-up phone call 30 to 37 
days after the last administered dose of study treatment will also apply 
in case the patient switches immediately after the end of study 
treatment to comm ercial treatment.

Table 1 and Table 3 are the study flow charts for adult patients coming from study DFI13412, 
corresponding to the period Year 1 to Year 5 and beyond Year 5, respectively. Complementary flow charts have been added for the changes to be effective after the cutoff date for a planned second database lock of the study for purpose of regulatory submissions in 2021 ( Table 2 and 
Table 4 ).Table 5 ,Table 7 , and Table 9 are the study flow charts for pediatric patients  coming 
from the pediatric study DFI13803 and correspond to Year 1, Year 2 through Year 5, and beyond Year 5,  respectively. Complementary flow charts have been added for the changes to be effective 
after the cutoff date for a planned second database lock of the study for purpose of regulatory 
submissions in 2021 ( Table 6 , and Table 10 ).Table 11 and Table 12 are the pharmacokinetic (PK)
sampling schedules for adults a nd pediatric patients, respectively.
Patients will be enrolled directly from their previous study after providing informed consent.
In case of more than 3 infusions missed between trials, assessments (eg, efficacy biomarkers, 
sphingomyelin and metabolites) may be repeated at  study entry.  The investigator, after discussion 
with the sponsor, may order individualized assessments before the patient receives the first infusionin this study.
Dose reintroduction regimens may be required for patients who have missed more than 1 dose 
between studies or during this study (LTS13632) , depending on their usual dose. For patients 
receiving home infusions who have missed 2 or fewer doses, the investigator can decide whether reintroduction should occur at the hospital/study site or via home infusion. For patients who miss 
3or more doses ≥0.6mg/kg, reintroduction of olipudase alfa should occur at the study site. If the 
site visit is not possible during a regional or  national emergency declared by a governmental 
agency such as the COVID-19 pandemic due to si te closure or extenuating circumstances that 
prevent an in-person site visit, reintroduction can occur via home infusion in compliance with 
applicable country-specific regulations.
Patients who require dose reintroduction will ha ve these assessments at each infusion until 
reaching their usual dose of olipudase alfa:
xBefore infusion: vital sign measurements, liver function tests (LFTs), hematology, and 
safety biomarkers.
xImmediately after infusion: vital sign measurements.
x24 hours after infusion: vital sign measurements, LFTs, hematology, and safety 
biomarkers.
x48 hours after infusion: vital sign measurements, LFTs, hematology, and safety 
biomarkers. The 48 hours post-infusion assessments will no longer be assessed after the cutoff date for a planned second database lock of the study for purpose of regulatory submissions in 2021.

scheduled infusion. Depending on the test results, the dose can be adjusted (repeated or 
reduced) or treatment can be withheld to allow ad ditional transaminase monitoring, based 
on the physician’s clinical judgment.
Baseline is defined as the following: 
xFor initial dose escalation: last values prior to first dose of olipudase alfa
xFor dose re -escalation: last values prior to the first re -escalation dose
For a new manufacturing scale, if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample collection will take 
place at the patient’s last infusion under the current manufacturing scale and at the first infusion 
under the new manufacturing scale. For int roduction of drug product from Process C( ), if
treatment is not interrupted, PK sample collecti on will take place at the second infusion under 
Process C( ). If introduction of Process C( ) occ urs, sample collection of  anti olipudase alfa 
antibody (IgG) will be monthly for the first 6 months after in troducing the drug product from 
Process C( ) then quarterly after that.
If a PK or IgG sample collection for the planned introduction of drug product from Process C( ) 
was erroneously taken, the future sample collection will be adjusted to the blood volume per each 
age cohort in order to avoid excessive blood withdrawal. For specific details, ple ase refer to Study

aPatients from DFI13803 are to follow  the pediatric schedule of events in the LTS13632 study.  The pediatric schedule of events is based on pediatric patients receiving 64 weeks of treatment 
in the prior DFI13803 study. The adult sch edule of events is based on adult patients  receiving 26 weeks of treatment in the pri or DFI13412 study. Patients will receive olipudase alfa every 
2 weeks (±3 days). Quarterly visits will occur at the site. If the site visit is not possible du ring a regional or national eme rgency declared by a governmental agency such as the COVID-19 
pandemic due to site closure or extenuating  circumstances that prevent an in-person site visit and home infusion is already app roved for the eligible patient, quarterly visits will be done at 
home. Quarterly visit specific assessments that  need a site visit will not be done at that time and will be done as unscheduled  as so on as site visits become available. In such a case, some of

bAll patients will have a visit 2  weeks (±7  days) after the last dose of study treatment.  For the end of  study/early discontinuation visit, abdominal MRI, HRCT, chest X -ray, pulmonary function 
tests (PFTs) , Doppler echocardiography, hand X -ray, and pediatric health outcome questionn aires will not be repeated if they had been done within the prior 3 months.

aPatients from DFI13803 are to follow th e pediatric schedule of events in the LTS13632 study.  The pediatric schedule of events is based on pediatric patients re ceiving 64 weeks of treatment 
in the prior DFI13803 study.  The adult sch edule of events is based on adult patients  receiving 26 weeks of treatment in the pr ior DFI13412 study. All patients will have a visit 2 weeks 
(±3 days) after the last Quarterly visits  will occur at the site. If the site visit  is not possible during a regional or nation al emergency declared by a governmental agency such as the COVID- 19 
pandemic due to site closure or extenuatin g circumstances that prevent an in-person site visit and home infusion is already app roved for the eligible patient, quarterly visits will be done at 
home. Quarterly visit specific assessm ents that need a site visit will not be done at that time and wi ll be done as unscheduled as soo n as site visits become available. In such a case, some of 
the quarterly visit assessments may be done by home nurse (e g, lab sampling) and by the site through the phone (eg, Health-rela ted quality of life instruments ). Telehealth visits are an 
acceptable alternative to site visits, If the site visit is no t possible during a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency such as the COVID-19 pandemic due to site 
closure or extenuating circumstances that  prevent an in-person site visit, in accordanc e with institutional policy and with app licable country-specific regulations. 
bAll patients will have a visit 2 weeks (±7 days) after the last dose of study treatm ent.  For the end of study/early discontinu ation visit, abdominal MRI, HRCT, chest X-ray, pulmonary function 
tests (PFTs), Doppler echocardiography, hand  X-ray, and pediatric health outcome quest ionnaires will not be repeated if they ha d been done within 3 months prior. 
cAll patients will have a final safety follow-up phone call 30 to 37 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
dIf possible, the neurological examination should be  performed by the same neurologist who pe rformed it in the DFI13803 study.  If possible, the same neurologist should perform the 
neurological examination throughout the study. 
eWeight at previous on-site visit may be used to calculate drug do sage at current visit.  Weight is  not required at home infusio n visits unless quarterly visit occurs at home.  Body mass index 
(BMI) will be calculated. 
fAt time points when multiple assessments are scheduled, the order will be: vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram, pharmaco kinetics (PK). 
gAs indicated, an additional sample will be collected for hemog lobin and platelet count at lea st 24 hours and up to 2 weeks apar t from the sample collected for clinical laboratory tests.  If drug 
product from a manufacturing scale change or an updated manufact uring process is administered, 2 samples will be taken during a n infusion 3 months after introducing the new scale or the 
updated manufactured process one for deferential hematology and the ot her for hemoglobin and platel et count at least 24 hours a nd up to 2 weeks apart. 
hPatients must rest in the supine position for 5-10  minutes prior to and du ring all electrocardiograms. 
iUpon a manufacturing scale change that occurs  beyond Year 2, an abdominal MRI and pulm onary function tests will be performed at  the first 6-month visit after th e change, but only if that 
6-month visit is not a 12-month visit at which the assessment is already scheduled.  Pu lmonary function tests will be performed  for patients who had a baseline assessment in the DFI13803

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Human acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a serious, rare, life threatening lysosomal 
storage disorder for which only palliative treatmen t exists. Patients with ASMD are unable to 
metabolize sphingomyelin properly due to mu tations in SMPD1, the gene encoding acid 
sphingomyelinase (ASM), whose transcription and translation results in a defective (ASM) enzyme. Inactivity of ASM leads to the lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin and, secondarily, increases in cholesterol and other related lipids, mostly in the organs, such as the 
spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow.
Historically, ASMD has been diagnosed as Nieman n-Pick Disease (NPD) and of either Type A or
Type B disease. Type A (NPD A) is characterized as the early-onset and acute neuropathic form of (NPD) and results in failure to thrive, hepa tosplenomegaly, rapidly progressive neurological 
degeneration, and death, usually before the age of 3 years ( 1). Niemann-Pick disease Type B
(NPD B) is a milder disease with little or no neurological involvement that may already have 
manifestations in childhood.  The most common di sease manifestation is hepatosplenomegaly. 
Other more variable features include liver dys function, pulmonary disease, retinal stigmata, and 
growth retardation.  Niemann-Pick disease Ty pe B is usually diagnosed in childhood after 
organomegaly is observed, typically after the age of 2 years. Most patients diagnosed with Type Bdisease live into adulthood.  Being an autosomal recessive single gene disease, ASMD is acknowledged to generate a spectrum of phenotypes . Accordingly, cases classified as intermediate 
to the A and B extremes have been reported. Patien ts with this intermediate form (NPD A/B) may 
develop neurologic symptoms during childhood a nd have a chronic neurodegenerative disease 
course.
Sanofi Genzyme is developing a potential enzyme replacement therapy for ASMD with olipudase 
alfa, a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase, for the treatment of the non-neurological 
manifestations of ASMD.  This recombinantly-derived enzyme is expressed in Chinese hamster 
ovarian cells transfected with olipudase alfa  complementary DNA that encodes a 627-residue 
peptide chain.  The resulting gene product retains the enzymatic activity and lysosomal targeting of the native protein.
Proof of concept for olipudase alfa therapy has been demonstrated in the acid sphingomyelinase 
knock-out (ASMKO) mouse ( 2), which exhibits both systemic and neurological features of 
ASMD.  Repeat intravenous (IV) bolus administ ration of olipudase alfa to ASMKO mice led to 
dose-dependent reductions of sphingomyelin in viscer al organs and in the lungs to a lesser extent, 
but was unable to prevent neurologic decline and prolong survival ( 3,4). However, chronic 
dosing in the ASMKO animal model is limited because the mice succumb to the neurologic disease resulting from the natural progression of complete ASMD in approximately 6 to 8 months.
Pharmacodynamic (PD), pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicological studies conducted in the 
ASMKO mouse found significant reductions of sphingomyelin in the liver, lung, kidney, and spleen at olipudase alfa doses ranging from  0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg in a time-dependent manner;

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 -olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 72however, toxicity was observed in ASMKO mice given single high -dose boluses of olipudase alfa 
(≥10mg/kg).  The same single, high doses did not cause toxic effects in normal mice, Sprague 
Dawley rats, or cynomolgus monkeys, suggesting that catabolites of sphingomyelin, and not 
olipudase alfa itself, were the cause of the toxic effects.  Subsequent “ debulking” studies in 
ASMKO mice demonstrated that a slow reduction in the sphingomyelin load over time using 
multiple low doses of olipudase alfa (4 doses of 3.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa administered over 
8days) followed by a high dose (20 mg/kg 3 days la ter) prevented the toxicity associated with the 
single initial high doses.  These findings suggest that the observed toxicity is related to the rate of 
substrate degradation and that step -wise removal of substrate likely mitigates toxicity. 
Furthermore, re peat high doses of olipudase alfa (30 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 7 doses) 
administered after a 7 -day debulking period (3 mg/kg on Days 1,3,5,and7) also did not cause 
toxicity.
During clinical development of olipudase alfa, in cremental changes were made to the olipudase 
alfa manufacturing process. The different processes are referred to as Process B, C( ) and C( ). 
In a completed Phase 1 study ( 5), the safety, PK, and PD profiles of single, ascending doses of 
olipudase alfa were evaluated. Single doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa 
were in fused sequentially by dose cohort in 11 adult patients with ASMD. Study results found 
dose-related increases in ceramide, bilirubin, high -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), and 
other acute phase reactants in patients that peaked 24 to 48 hours postdos e and resolved by 
Day 14.  Reported adverse events (AE s) involving constitutional symptoms (pain, fever, nausea, 
and vomiting) were consistent with first -dose-related toxicity and occurred in a dose -dependent 
fashion as was previously observed in the ASMKO mouse.  Serious adverse events (SAE s) related 
to olipudase alfa treatment we re not reported. The sponsor terminated the study subsequent to 
asingle patie nt dosed at 1.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa presenting with hyperbilirubinemia and 
anacute -phase reaction (APR) with clinical symptoms. Of note, this patient was subsequently 
confirmed to have Gilbert’s syndrome. Because there were no other signs of liver tox icity or 
hemolysis, the observed hyperbilirubinemia may have been secondary to specific inhibition of 
bilirubin uptake into hepatocytes and/or glucuronide  conjugation of bilirubin within hepatocytes.
In a completed Phase 1b, open -label, multicenter ascendi ng-dose study in 5 adult patients with 
ASMD, the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa were evaluated during a 26 -week treatment 
period ( 6). Patients received an initial IV dose of 0.1 mg/kg of olipudase alfa, then the dose was 
escalated in a stepwise manner to a final target IV dose of 3.0 mg/kg.  All patients remained at 
3.0mg/kg for the remainder of the treatment period. Upon completion of the study, all patients 
enrolled into an open -label, long -term treatment study. Results from this trial demonstrated that 
the progressive, within -patient olipudase alfa dose escalation re gimen was well tolerated in adult 
ASMD patients. No serious or sev ere AEs or deaths were reported in the study.  Related AEs 
consisted predominantly of infusion -associated reactions (IAR s), most of which were mild in 
severity with all patients recovering witho ut sequelae. At the end of the 6 -month treatment period, 
apositive response to treatment with olipudase alfa was observed in several individual efficacy 
parameters. This included mean decreases in spleen and liver volumes by 25.3% and 17.1%, 
respectively; decreased interstitial lung disease (ILD) scores; increased percent predicted diffusing 
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL CO); reduction in serum chitotriosid ase, chemokine 
(CC-motif) ligand 18 (CCL -18), and angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE ); a positive trend

4.2 STUDY RATIONALE
Cumulative data from preclinical and human stud ies conducted to date with olipudase alfa 
demonstrate both the safety and tolerability of re peat dosing of olipudase alfa.  This study will 
provide long-term data on oli pudase alfa in pediatric and adult patients with ASMD.
This study is being conducted to allow patients with ASMD to continue the olipudase alfa 
treatment they were receiving at the end of th eir primary study after that study is completed. 
Individual dose adjustments are allowed in this study, but may also be recommended based on results from completed or ongoing studies of olipudase alfa. The primary objective of this study is to obtain safety data in pediatric and adult pa tients with ASMD who are exposed to long-term 
treatment with olipudase alfa. Secondary objecti ves are to obtain efficacy, PK, and PD data.
Treatment Period
x The current study is an open-label, long-term treatment study planned for 9 years, or until
olipudase alfa becomes commercially accessi ble (see maximum duration below), whichever 
comes first, unless the patient decides to enter an other olipudase alfa clinical trial within the 
9-year period prior to when olipuda se alfa is commercially accessible.
x The term “commercially accessible” is defined as when olipudase alfa is commercially 
accessible to each patient on an individual ba sis (eg, reimbursement being in place). The 
duration of study treatment with olipudase al fa between local Regulatory approval and 
commercial accessibility should not exceed 90 da ys. Therefore, as described below, after 
local Regulatory approval, the patient can continue in the LTS13632 study for a maximum of 
127 days.
x This will ensure 90 days of study treatment with olipudase alfa for patients after local 
Regulatory approval and a safety follow up phone call 30 to 37 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
x Notwithstanding the above, every pediatric patient will be treated in the LTS13632 study for 
at least 3 years to comply with the agreed PIP. 
x The patient can switch immediately after the e nd of study treatment to commercial treatment 
without any gap in order to ensure conti nuity of treatment with olipudase alfa.

This is a multinational, multicenter, nonrandom ized, open-label, long-term treatment study of 
approximately 25 patients who have previously pa rticipated in a study of olipudase alfa. 5 adult 
patients rolled over from study DFI13412 into  LTS13632 study and approximately 20 pediatric 
patients are expected to roll over from study DFI1 3803. Patients will be enrolled directly into this 
study from their previous study.
Treatment Period
xEnrolled patients will receive an IV infusion of olipudase alfa every 2 weeks for 9 years, or 
until olipudase alfa becomes commercially accessible (see maximum duration below), 
whichever comes first, unless the patient decides to enter another olipudase alfa clinical trial within the 9-year period prior to when olipudase alfa commercially accessible. 
xThe term “commercially accessible” is defined as when olipudase alfa is commercially 
accessible to each patient on an individual basis (eg, reimbursement being in place). The duration of study treatment with olipudase alfa between local Regulatory approval and

Treatment Period
xDuring the treatment period, patients will rece ive an IV infusion of olipudase alfa every 
2weeks for 9 years or until olipudase alfa becomes commer cially accessible (see maximum 
duration below), whichever comes first, unless the patient decides to enter a nother olipudase 
alfa clinical trial within the 9 -year period prior to when olipudase alfa is commercially 
accessible. 
xThe term “commercially accessible” is defined as when olipudase alfa is commercially 
accessible to each patient on an individual basis ( eg, reimbursement being in place). The 
duration of study treatment with olipudase alfa between local Regulatory approval and 
commercial accessibility should not exceed 90 days. 
xNotwithstanding the above, every pediatric patient will be treated in the LTS1 3632 study for 
at least 3 years. 
xThe patient can switch immediately after the e nd of study treatment to commercial treatment 
without any gap in order to ensure conti nuity of treatment with olipudase alfa. 
Inthe first 5 years, safety and efficacy assessm ents will occur at regular 3, 6,or12 month 
intervals then only selected assessments will occur every 6 or 12 months after 5 years.  
Schedule of Assessments 
In the first 5 years, pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations will occur every 3 months then every 
6months after the cutoff date for a planned second database lock of the study for purpose of 
regulatory submissions in 2021. After 5 years, PD evaluations will occur every 12 months. 
PK evaluations will occur every 12 months only in the first 5 years and upon introduction of 
Process C( ) or Process C( ) at any time during the study. Beyond 5 years, pharmacokinetic 
testing will only occur upon the introduction of Process C( ) or Process C( ).  For Process 
C( ), if treatment is not interrupted, PK sampl e collection will take place at the patient’s last 
infusion under the current manufacturing scale and at the first infusion under Process C( ).  For 
introduction of Process C( ), if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample collection will take place 
at the second infusion under Process C( ).  In case reintroduction of olipudase alfa coincides 
with introduction of drug product from Process C( ) or Process C( ), PK samples will be 
collected at the infusion at which patients receive their usual dose of oli pudase alfa under the new 
process. For schedule of PK assessment in adults, see Section 1.6,Table 11.
6.1.2 Post treatment period
For patients completing or discontinuing/withdrawing from the study, there will be a 
posttreatment period consisting of an end -of-treatment (EOT ) visit 2 weeks (±7 days) after the last 
administered dose of study treatment and a safety follow -up phone call 30 to 37 days after the last 
administered dose of study treatment .

6.2 INTERIM ANALYSIS
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. A formal summary of data or interim CSR may be produced to support regulatory approval(s) and/or other submission/application requirement(s). 
6.3 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION
The length of a patient's participation will be fr om the time the informed consent form is signed 
until the last planned assessment/visit.  The approx imate maximum study duration per patient is as 
follows:
xTreatment period of 9 years or until olipudase alfa becomes commercially accessible (see 
maximum duration below), whichever comes firs t, unless the patient decides to enter 
another olipudase alfa clinical trial within the 9- year period prior to when olipudase alfa is 
commercially accessible. 
xThe term “commercially accessible” is defined as when olipudase alfa is commercially 
accessible to each patient on an individual ba sis (eg, reimbursement being in place). The 
duration of study treatment with olipudase alfa between local Regulatory approval and 
commercial accessibility should not exceed 90 days. Therefore, as described below, after local Regulatory approval, the patient can continue in the LTS13632 study for a maximum 
of 127 days.
xThis will ensure 90 days of study treatment wi th olipudase alfa for patients after local 
Regulatory approval and a safety follow up phone call 30 to 37 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
xThe patient can switch immediately after the end of study treatment to commercial 
treatment without any gap in order to ensure continuity of treatment with olipudase alfa. 
xNotwithstanding the above, every pediatric patient will be treated in the LTS13632 study 
for at least 3 years.  
xFollow up period concluded with a safety follow up phone call 30 to 37 days after the 
patient’s last infusion in the LTS13632 study. A safety follow-up phone call will also 
apply in case the patient switches immediately after the end of study treatment to 
commercial treatment.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 808 STUDY TREATMENTS
8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S)
The study drug, olipudase alfa, is a sterile, white to off-white lyophilized cake supplied in 
single-use, 20 cc Type 1 glass vials. Each vial co ntains 20 milligrams of extractable olipudase 
alfa.
The study drug will be reconstituted with 5.1 mL of sterile water for injection to yield 
a concentration of 4.0 mg/mL of olipudase alfa.  The study drug will be further diluted in
0.9% sodium chloride for injection soluti on to a specific volume based on dose.
Detailed instructions on olipudase alfa preparation, storage, and administration are provided in the 
corresponding manual.
Refer to Section 8.5 for product handling and complaints reporting.
8.1.1 Treatments administered
Patients will receive olipudase alfa every 2 weeks (±3 days). Home infusions may be possible. To 
be eligible for home infusions, patients must meet the criteria in Section 10.2.1 .
Patients will start this study at the same dose they were receiving at the end of their primary study, 
provided that they have not missed more than 1 biweekly dose between studies.  
All patients will have a visit 2 weeks (±3 days).  Quarterly visits will occur at the site. If the site 
visit is not possible due to site closure or extenuati ng circumstances that prevent an in-person site 
visit (eg, during COVID-19 pandemic) and home i nfusion is already approved for the eligible 
patient, quarterly visits will be done at home. Quar terly visit specific assessments that need a site 
visit will not be done at that time and will be done as unscheduled as soon as site visits become 
available. In such a case, some of the quarterly visit assessments may be done by home nurse (eg, lab sampling) and by the site through the phone (eg, Health-related quality of life instruments). Telehealth visits are an acceptable alternative to site visits, if site visits are not 
possible during a regional or national emergency dec lared by a governmental agency such as the 
COVID-19 pandemic due to site closure or extenuating circumstances that prevent an in-person site visit, in accordance with institutional policy and with applicable country-specific regulations
.
Dose reintroduction regimens may be required for patients who have missed more than 1 dose between studies or during this study (LTS13632), depending on their usual dose.  For patients 
receiving home infusions who have missed 2 or fewer doses, the investigator can decide whether reintroduction should occur at the hospital/study site or via home infusion. For patients who have missed 3 or more doses ≥0.6mg/kg, reintroduction of olipudase alfa should occur at the
hospital/study site. If the site visit is not possibl e during a regional or national emergency declared

circumstances that prevent an in-person site visi t, reintroduction may be done via home infusion. 
Olipudase alfa reintroduction guidan ce will depend on the patient’ s usual dose and the number of 
missed infusions: 
xIf a patient misses 1 dose, continue at the dose previous to the missed dose.
xIf a patient misses 2 doses:
- If the previous dose was >0.6 mg/kg, the next dose must be 1 level below the last dose,-If the previous dose was ≤0.6mg/kg, the next dose must be equal to the last dose.
xIf a patient misses 3 or more doses:
- If the previous dose was >0.6 mg/kg, the next dose must be 0.3 mg/kg (0.3 mg/kg 
should be repeated at the subsequent infusion, similar to dose escalation schedule in the original study). Details will be provided in the study manual
-If the previous dose was ≤0.6mg/kg, the next dose must be equal to the last dose,
- If a patient has missed 3 or more doses ≥0.6 mg/kg, reintroduction of olipudase alfa for 
patients receiving infusions at home should occur at the hospital/study site. 
- If the site visit is not possible during a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency such as the COVID-19 pandemic due to site closure or extenuating circumstances that prevent an in-person site visit, reintroduction may be 
done via home infusion, if the patient has previously been approved for home infusion.
8.1.2 Route and method of administration
Patients will receive IV olipudase alfa over the same time period as in their original study. The 
length of the infusion time may be ad justed based on the patient’s tolerance of the infusion.
During the study, pediatric patients who reach adult age (18 years old) will receive the adult 
infusion volume.
See Section 8.1.5 for information on dose adjustments following dosing delays or missed doses.
8.1.3 Dosing considerations
Patients will receive the same olipudase alfa dose every 2 weeks, provided they have not missed 
more than 1 biweekly dose between studies.
Dosing will be based on an individual patient’s mass (ie, weight) as outlined in Section 8.1.1 . For 
patients who participated in the DFI13412 study and who had a body mass index (BMI) >30, the dose will be based on the mass (in kilograms) c orresponding to a BMI of 30 given the specific 
patient’s height.

Dose adjustments may also be considered at any time in consultation with the sponsor but may be 
recommended based on current safety or efficacy analysis results obtained from completed or ongoing studies of olipudase alfa.
8.1.5 Dosing delays or missed doses
Dose reintroduction regimens may be required for patients who have missed more than 1 dose 
between studies or during this study (LTS13632) , depending on their usual dose. For patients 
receiving home infusions who have missed 2 or fewer doses, the investigator can decide whether reintroduction should occur at the hospital/study si te via home infusion. For patients who have 
missed 3 or more doses ≥0.6mg/kg, reintroduction of olipudase alfa should occur at the 
hospital/study site.  If the site visit is not possib le due to site closure or extenuating circumstances 
that prevent an in-person site visit (eg, duri ng COVID-19 pandemic), reintroduction may be done 
via home infusion, if the patient has previously been approved for home infusion. 
Patients who require dose reintroduction will ha ve these assessments at each infusion until 
reaching their usual dose of olipudase alfa:
xBefore infusion: vital sign measurements, liver function tests (LFTs), hematology tests and 
safety biomarkers.
xImmediately after infusion: vital sign measurements.
x24 hours after infusion: vital sign measurements, LFTs, hematology and safety biomarkers
x48 hours after infusion: vital sign measurements, LFTs and safety biomarkers. 
The 48 hours post-infusion assessments will no longer be assessed after the cutoff date for a planned second database lock of the study for purpose of regulatory submissions in 2021.
During the dose escalation period, for transamina ses assessed after infusion, if any AST or 
ALT value is >2x baseline and >ULN, the test shou ld be repeated prior to the next scheduled 
infusion. Depending on the test results, the dos e can be adjusted (repeated or reduced) or 
treatment can be withheld to allow additional transaminase monitoring, based on the physician’s clinical judgment.
Baseline is defined as the following: 
xFor initial dose escalation: last values prior to first dose of olipudase alfa
xFor dose re-escalation: last values prior to the first re-escalation dose

If any of the following AEs occur, dosing will be temporarily stopped for the specific patient who 
experienced the AE:
xAny SAE, not related to the patient’s underlying condition and considered related to the 
study treatment.
xAny increase in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase (AP) >3x baseline 
(prior to olipudase alfa therapy, ie, baseline value from the primary study) and > the upper 
limit of normal (ULN).
xAny increase in total bilirubin or AP >1.5x baseline, in the presence of AST or 
ALT > 2 x ULN.
xAny increase in ALT or AST >3 x ULN combined with an increase in ALT or 
AST >2x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa th erapy), with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (>ULN).
xAny AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, raises significant concern 
regarding the safety of olipudase alfa at the administered dose.
8.1.7 Study interruption criteria
If either of these criteria are met,
x2 patients develop the same severe AE that is not related to their underlying condition, or
xA death occurs that is assessed as related or possibly related to olipudase alfa, an ad hoc 
DMC meeting will be held to review the safe ty data and provide its recommendations to 
the sponsor regarding further patient treatment.
After consideration of DMC recommendations, fina l decisions regarding discontinuation of study 
drug for all or selected clinical trial patients will be made by the Sponsor.
In the event a significant safety concern arises, the Sponsor may immediately decide to 
discontinue study drug dosing in all clinical trial patients prior to receipt of DMC recommendation.
If the study is temporarily or permanently halted, the Sponsor will notify the health authorities of 
the halt by a substantial amendment in regions where this applies.
8.1.8 Treatment discontinuation
A patient’s study treatment may be discontinued at any time at the patient’s request or at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor.  The following may be justifiable reasons for the investigator or sponsor to discontinue a patient from treatment:
xThe patient was erroneously included in the study (ie, was found to not have met the

LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 86During the study, prohibited medications include those that may decrease olipudase alfa activity 
(eg, chlorpromazine, tricyclic anti-depressants [eg, imipramine or desipramine]). See the most 
recent version of the study manual for a list of concomitant medications that may decrease olipudase alfa activity.
Cationic amphiphilic antihistamines, such as l oratadine, desloratadine, astemizole, ebastine, 
terfenadine, and clemastine, may decrease olipudase alfa activity. Therefore, the need for their use 
in oral or IV administration should be carefully considered. There is no restriction on topical
antihistamines.
Certain medications and herbal supplements can be hepatotoxic or can cause or prolong bleeding, 
and should not be taken within 10 days before an d 3 days after the biopsy procedure (only patients 
who previously participated in the DFI13412 study ). Potentially hepatotoxic medications or herbal 
supplements include, but are not limited to, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 
inhibitors, erythromycin, valproic acid, antidepress ants, kava, and echinacea. Medications that 
may cause or prolong bleeding include, but are not limited to, anticoagulants, ibuprofen, aspirin, 
garlic supplements, ginkgo, and ginseng.
These lists of prohibited medications and herbal supplements may be incomplete. The investigator 
may also prohibit medications and products not li sted here. Therefore, the investigator must 
review all medications and products for every pa tient. For more information on medications and 
herbal supplements that may decrease olipudase alfa activity or may be hepatotoxic, refer to the 
most recent version of the study manual.
Pretreatment in general is not recommended fo r prophylactic management of IARs.  For patients 
who experience moderate to severe or recurrent IARs (as defined in Section 10.5.1.3.2 ) suggestive 
of hypersensitivity, pretreatment regimens (eg, an tihistamines, antipyretics, glucocorticoids) may 
be prescribed by the investigator as per clinical judgment.  In particular, the need for cationic amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully considered given the 
potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity by such drugs.
8.6.1 Treatment of infusion-associated reactions
For management of mild IARs, infusion rate reductions  (eg, reduced to half the rate) or temporary 
interruptions may mitigate the reaction.  Fo r moderate to severe or recurrent IARs, the 
investigator may consider the use of pretreatment  medications (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, 
and/or glucocorticoids), if the symptoms are sugges tive of hypersensitivity reaction, in addition to 
infusion rate reductions, interruptions, or disconti nuation.  In particular, the need for cationic 
amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully considered given the 
potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity by such drugs.
Patients experiencing symptoms suggestive of hy persensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic 
or anaphylactoid reactions, during olipudase alfa  infusion should be managed according to the 
general standards of care consistent with the trea tment of such reactions. If anaphylaxis or other 
severe allergic reactions occ ur, immediate discontinuation of the infusion should be considered, 
and appropriate medical treatment should be initia ted.  Because of the potential for severe IARs, 
appropriate medical personnel and equipment to perf orm resuscitation must be readily available in 
the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 1019.3.1 Physician global assessment of change
The physician's global assessment of the patient’s progress will be evaluated prior to infusion at 
the time points specified in the study flow chart in Section 1.1 through Section 1.5 .
The investigator will evaluate the patient’s current clinical status compared to baseline in the 
first study before the patient received the first dose of olipudase alfa by marking 1 of the following 7 categories: marked improvement, moderate improvement, mild improvement, no change, mild worsening, moderate worsening, or marked worsening.
9.3.2 Cognitive and adaptive function (for  pediatric patients who performed the 
assessments in the DFI13803 study)
Cognitive function will be evaluated using the DP -3 assessment tool.  Adaptive function will be 
evaluated using the ABAS. These assessments will be performed only for pediatric patients who performed the assessments in DFI13803.  Completi on of these assessments may depend on patient 
age or cooperation, or both.
Assessment time points are specified in Section 1.3 and Section 1.4 . Refer to the study operations 
manual for further details.
9.3.3 Cycle ergometry
Cycle ergometry will be performed at the time points specified in Section 1.1 .  Completion of the 
assessment may depend upon patient cooperation.
Cardiopulmonary status will be assessed using a stationary 1-wheeled cycle as an ergometer to 
measure a person's work output under controlled condi tions.  Patients will be asked to ride the 
cycle at increasing workload levels until they  can no longer proceed.  Patients will breathe 
through a tube connected to a 1-way valve for continuous measurements of oxygen (O 2) uptake, 
carbon dioxide (CO 2) output, and tidal volume throughout the test.  Heart rate, respiratory rate, 
and digital O 2saturation will also be continuously monitored.  Steady-state levels for each 
workload will be calculated for O 2uptake, CO 2output, tidal volume, ventilation, and respiratory 
exchange ratio.  The maximum workload achieved will be recorded and expressed as percent predicted.  In addition, percent predicted maximum will be calculated for O
2uptake, heart rate, 
and tidal volume. Note that cycle ergometry asse ssments must occur at the same time for each 
assessment (ie, ±2 hours of the time of day of the first assessment).
Procedures for cycle ergometry assessments are detailed in the corresponding manual.

Blood samples for efficacy biomarkers will be collected prior to infusion at the time points 
specified in Section 1.1through Section 1.5. Biomarkers will include, but not be limited to, serum 
chitotriosidase, CCL -18.
Processing, storage, and shipment guidelines for sa mples to be sent to the sponsor are provided in 
the corresponding manual.
9.3.5 Bone disease assessments
Bone disease assessments will be obtained only fo r patients who previously participated in the 
DFI13412 study as specified in Section 1.1through Section 1.5.  Magnetic resonance imaging of 
the lumbar spine and both femurs will be u sed to determine bone marrow burden scores ( 20,21).
Dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and both femurs will provide total BMD 
measurements, BMD T -scores, and Z -scores.  The assessments may be performed on the same 
day as the spleen and liver volume MRIs.
All bone images will be sent to a central reviewer  for blinded analysis of potential bone disease.  
See the corresponding manual for further details.
9.3.6 Bone biomarkers
Serum bone -specific alkaline phosphatase and C -telopeptide levels will be evaluated as indicated 
inSection 1.1through Section 1.5.
9.3.7 Patient photographs
Photographs (eg, abdominal) will be taken as specified in Section 1.1through Section 1.5of
patients who volunteer to provide visual context of the disease.
9.3.8 Pharmacokinetics
For both adult and pediatric patients, PK testing will only occur yearly for the first 5 years and 
upon the introduction of Process C( ) or Process C( ) at any time during the study.  For Process 
C( ), if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample collection will take place at the pat ient’s last 
infusion under the current manufacturing scale and at the first infusion Process C( ). For 
introduction of drug product from Process C( ), if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample 
collection will take place at the second infusion under Proce ss C( ).  In case reintroduction of 
olipudase alfa coincides with introduction of a drug product from Process C( ) or Process C( ), 
PK samples will be collected at the infusions at which patients receive their usual dose of 
olipudase alfa under the new process.
Blood samples for pediatric patients are drawn at di fferent intervals than samples in adult patients 
(Section 1.6,Table 12andTable 11,respectively) and in different volumes ( Section 9.5).

9.3.8.3 Pharmacokinetic sampling and parameters in adults
9.3.8.3.1 Sampling time in adults
Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur at the time points listed in Section 1.1and Section 1.6.
Specific time points are detailed in Table 11. Ifa patient receives only a partial infusion (eg, due 
to asafety concern), PK sampling will be repeated the next time the patient receives that dose. If 
arepeat is required, all PK time p oints will be repeated.
Windows around PK blood samples are ±10 minutes for collection times less than 8 hours and 
±3hours for collection times of 8 hours or longer post infusion.
Blood samples may be drawn for PK assessments using an indwelling catheter from an arm that is 
not used for dose administration. The exact time of dose administration (start and stop times of 
infusion), rate of infusion, and dose will be recorded along with exact sampling times.
If a manufacturing scale change occurs, serial bloo d samples for PK will be collected at all of the 
same time points with the last infusion of olipudase alfa produced at the original scale and with 
the first infusion of olipudase alfa produced at  the new scale. For introduction of drug product 
from Process C( ), PK sample collection will only take place at the second infusion under 
Process C( ).

9.3.8.4.1 Sampling time in pediatric patients
Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur at the time points listed in Section 1.3 through Section 1.6 .
Specific time points are detailed in Table 12 for each age group.  To minimize the amount of 
blood drawn, post dose time points have been sele cted for sparse sampling of PK parameters.
If a patient receives only a partial infusion (eg, due to a safety concern), PK sampling will be 
repeated the next time the patient receives that do se. If a repeat is required, all PK time points will 
be repeated.
In adolescent patients, windows around PK blood samples are ±10 minutes for collection times 
<8 hours and ±3 hours for collection times ≥8hours post infusion.
Depending on patient age, blood samples may be drawn for PK assessments using an indwelling 
catheter from an arm that is not used for olipudase  alfa infusions. The exact time of olipudase alfa 
infusions (start and stop times of infusion), rate of infusion, time of infusion rate changes, and

Section 1.1 through Section 1.5 summarize the schedules of study ev ents for all patients enrolled 
into this study.  Individual assessments are described in Section 9 .
10.2 STUDY PROCEDURES
Infusions will take place at the study site, or for some patients, at home.
10.2.1 Home infusions
Home infusion may be possible.  Patients must meet the eligibility requirements outlined below.  
In addition, the investigator and the sponsor must agree that home infusion is appropriate.  To receive home infusions, the following criteria must be met:
xThe investigator must agree in writing that  home infusion is appropriate for the patient.
xThe patient, or the pediatric patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s), must be willing and 
able to comply with home infusion procedures.
xThe patient must, in the investigator’s (or de signee’s) opinion, have been clinically stable 
with no history of moderate or severe IARs for  at least 6 months, and must be on a stable 
olipudase alfa dose.  No infusion rate increase s will be allowed while a patient is receiving 
home infusions.
xThe patient must have no ongoing (not yet recovered) SAEs that, in the opinion of the 
investigator, may affect the patient’s ability to tolerate the infusion.
xHome infusion infrastructure, resources, an d procedures must be established and available 
according to applicable regional regulations.
xFor patients experiencing an IAR while being infused at home, the investigator should 
assess whether or not it is safe for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion or return to the study site for their following infusion and when the patient would be ready to resume home infusion. In case home infusion continues, the investigator will guide the home infusion staff on the measures to be followed for subsequent infusion to manage the 
IAR (eg, infusion interruption, premedication, ch ange the infusion rate, etc. See Treatment 
of infusion-associated reactions in Section 8.6.1 .
xIf recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity reactions occur, the investigator should assess 
whether or not it is safe for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion.
xIf a severe hypersensitivity reaction or an anaphylaxis reaction occurs, during an infusion 
given at home, treatment will be disconti nued immediately, and appropriate medical 
treatment will be initiated. The patient will re turn to the study site for further management

treated via home infu sion. See Section 8.6for details on severe hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis management.
xFor the switch from Process C( ) IMP to P rocess C( ) IMP, if the site visit is possible, 
the patient should  receive the first infusion at  the site. However, if the site visit is not 
possible during a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency such 
as the COVID -19 pandemic due to site closure or extenuating circumstances that prevent 
an in -person site visit, the first infusion of the Process C( ) IMP is allowed during home 
infusion for eligible patients in agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator in 
compliance wit h applicable country -specific regulations.
xPrior to beginning home infusions, the home infusion staff, including new staff members, 
must have been appropriately trained and/or licensed, if applicable, on proper procedures 
to prepare and administer infusion s, monitor patients, document procedures, and report to 
site on a timely basis.
xThe home infusion staff must have access to  and be trained on proper use of safety 
equipment, including, but not limited to, cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment.
xHome infus ion staff must keep source documen tation of the infusion, including 
documentation of any AEs.  Home infusion staf f must be amenable to providing specific 
source documentation to Sanofi Genzyme and agree to be monitored.  The Principal 
Investigator is still responsible for all study procedures and patient’s safety even when 
delegating infusion responsibilities to the home care company.
xAn additional questionnaire about home infus ion experience may be added any time 
before end of the study for patients who re ceived home infusion treatment for total time of 
at least of one year.
10.2.2 Alcohol consumption
Patients must be willing to abstain from the use of alcohol for 1 day prior to and 3 days after each 
study drug infusion (see Section 7.2).
Patients will be counseled to limit alcohol consumption durin g the study:
xMale patients to a maximum of 30 grams of alcohol per day (2 drinks/day).
xFemale patients to a maximum of 15 grams of alcohol per day (1 drink/day).
Patients who do not limit alcohol can be discont inued from the study according to investigator ’s 
discretion.
10.2.3 Pregnancy and contraception
Female patients of childbearing potential ar e required to have a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy 
test before enrolling in the trial and every 4 weeks prior to undergoing visit specific assessments 
and receiving olipudase alfa.

LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 11610.2.3.1 Pregnancy
Pregnancy will lead to treatment discontinuation in  all cases.  No studies of olipudase alfa have 
been conducted in pregnant women.  To ensure patient safety for this study, all female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy test every 4 weeks.
Female patients of childbearing potential and sexual ly mature male patients must be willing to 
practice true abstinence, or use 2 acceptable, effective methods of contraception.  Every effort will be made to prevent pregnancy during this study.  In all cases, the sponsor must be notified of all terminations to treatment as soon as possible and, if applicable, the date of withdrawal from the 
study must be recorded in the CRF and in the patient’s medical record.  If possible, all tests and evaluations listed for the end of study visit will be  carried out.  If a patient fails to return for the 
necessary visits, then every effort must be made to contact the patient and determine the reason(s), 
which will be recorded on the CRF.
Female patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover they are 
pregnant.  Male patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover 
that their sexual partner is pregnant.
If the investigator learns of a report of pregnanc y at any time after signing the informed consent,
the investigator should follow the instructions in Section 10.5.2.3.1 for female patients on the 
study to contact Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology (GPE) within 24 hours. For female 
partners of male patients on the study, the pregnancy form will be used to report the pregnancy to Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology (GPE ) within 24 hours. Follow-up of the pregnancy 
is mandatory until the outcome has been deter mined. The progress of the pregnancy must be 
followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, delivery, el ective termination, or 
spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy result s in the birth of a child, additional follow-up
information may be requested.
The investigator will be asked to obtain follow-up information after the gestational period to 
obtain maternal/fetal/neonatal outcome and any other relevant information.
Follow-up information may be requested at addition al time points. All study related visits/contacts 
involving a known pregnancy should include pr egnancy status assessment until pregnancy 
outcome is known.
If a female patient is discontinued because of pr egnancy, pregnancy will be documented as the 
reason for study discontinuation.  Spontaneous abortions and stillbirths are reported as SAEs, and the investigator should follow the instructions in Section 10.5.2.2 .
10.2.3.2 Contraception
Female patients of childbearing potential and sexually mature male patients are required to
practice true abstinence in line with their prefer red and usual lifestyle or use 2 acceptable effective 
methods of contraception, a barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) with spermicidal foam/g el/film/cream/suppository and an established 
nonbarrier method such as oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods, an intrauterine device,

of study drug.
Female patients will be considered capable of  bearing children unless they have not yet had 
menarche, had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or have undergone menopause (ie, are ≥50 years old without menses for ≥1year or are <50 years old with confirmed ovarian failure).
10.3 DEFINITION OF SOURCE DATA
Source data includes all information in original records  and certified copies of original records of 
clinical findings, observations, or other activities  necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.
Source documents are original documents, data and records (eg, hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory reports and notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcripts certified after verification as being accurate a nd complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medical-technical departments) involved in the clinical study. Source documentation must be maintained to  support information provided in the CRF.
All protocol-required information collected during th e study must be recorded by the investigator 
or other study personnel in the source documentation for the study. The source documentation will be used to enter the protocol-required information into the CRF. No data should therefore be directly entered into the CRF.
10.4 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporar ily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort.  Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the source and CRF.  In any 
case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.
Pregnancy will lead to treatment discontinuation in  all cases.  Sexually active female patients of 
childbearing potential and sexually active male pa tients who permanently discontinue must use 
2 forms of contraception for at least 15 days after their last dose.
10.4.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s)
Temporary treatment discontinuation, decided by the investigator, corresponds to more than 
1 dose not administered to the patient.  Dose reintroduction regimens may be required for patients who have missed more than 1 dose between studies, depending on their usual dose.
For patients receiving home infusions who have missed 2 or fewer doses, the investigator can 
decide whether reintroduction should occur at th e hospital/study site or via home infusion. For

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 118patients who miss 3 or more doses ≥0.6mg/kg, reintroduction of olipudase alfa should occur at 
the hospital/study site. If the site visit is not possible due to site closure or extenuating circumstances that prevent an in-person si te visit (eg, during COVID-19 pandemic), 
reintroduction may be done via home infusion. 
The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will determine whether the patient will be 
redosed.  Reintroducing patients to  olipudase alfa treatment will take into account the patient’s 
usual dose, the number of missed infusions, and the patient’s abi lity to tolerate the dose.
Upon reintroduction of treatment, certain asse ssments will be repeated at infusions 
(Section 8.1.5 ). The investigator will decide if additional specific assessments may be required 
before the patient can begin the reintroduction regimen.
Olipudase alfa reintroduction guidance is described in Section 8.1.1 . Reintroduction of olipudase 
alfa treatment will be done with appropriate monitoring at the discretion of the investigator and confirmation that the patient still meets the study criteria ( Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 ).
The duration of all temporary treatment discontinuati ons should be recorded by the investigator in 
the appropriate screens of the CRF.
10.4.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s)
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the investigator, sponsor, or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the 
IMP at any time.
10.4.3 List of criteria for perm anent treatment discontinuation
Patients may withdraw from treatment at any time and irrespective of the reason.  The investigator 
may also decide to withdraw a patient from treatment.
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons:
xUnacceptable toxicity.
xThe need for intervention or therapy precl uded by protocol, and determination by the 
investigator that it is medically necessary to do so.
xThe patient was unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol.
xThe patient wishes to be withdrawn from treatment.
xThe patient was erroneously included in the study (failed to satisfy all study criteria in 
Section 7 ).
xThe patient participated in another investigational study without the prior written 
authorization from the sponsor.
xThe patient is no longer deriving clinical benefit, in the opinion of the investigator.
xPregnancy.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 119In addition, the sponsor may decide to discontinue the trial prematurely for any other reason.
Any relevant abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of permanen t discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.
Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who are withdrawn from the study will be 
asked to complete all discontinuation assessments before withdrawal (as detailed in Section 1.1 ,
Section 1.2 ,Section 1.4 and Section 1.5 ).  They will also receive a safety follow-up telephone call 
from the study site 30 to 37 days after the final ad ministration of study drug.  If a patient fails to 
return for the necessary visits, every effort must be made to contact the patient to determine the 
reason(s).  The investigator will document the reason(s) for treatment discontinuation/study 
withdrawal on the CRF and in the patient’s medical record.  In all cases, the s ponsor must be 
notified of all study terminations as soon as possible.
10.4.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation
Patients or parent/legal guardians who decide to discontinue participation in the study should be 
contacted by the study investigator in order to obtain information about the reason(s) for discontinuation and collection of any potential AEs.
When possible, all tests and evaluations listed in Section 1.1 ,Section 1.2 ,Section 1.4 and 
Section 1.5 for the post treatment withdrawal visit should be carried out within 2 weeks of the last 
olipudase alfa infusion.  If a patient fails to re turn for the necessary visits, every effort must be 
made to contact the patient and determine th e reason(s) and record the reason(s) on the CRF.
In all cases, the sponsor must be notified of al l study terminations as soon as possible and the 
reason for and date of withdrawal from the st udy must be recorded in the CRF and in the patient’s 
medical record.
10.4.5 Procedure and consequence fo r patient withdrawal from study
Patients may withdraw from the study before study c ompletion if they decide to do so, at any time 
and irrespective of the reason.  Preferably the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for 
the patie nt’s failure to withdraw consent in writing.
The reason for withdrawal should be captured.  Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked 
about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE 
information elicited should be documented.
Patients who withdraw should be asked to come back for the end of study visit and will receive 
the safety follow phone call.
For patients who fail to return to the site, the investigator should make th e best effort to contact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to determine his/her health  status, including at least his/her vital status.

primary endpoints will be considered.
10.5 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING
The investigator is the primary person responsible for making all clinically relevant decisions on safety issues.
Any abnormal findings that meet the definition of an AE per Section 10.5.1 will be recorded on 
the CRF.  The investigator will continue to m onitor the patient until the parameter returns to 
baseline or until the investigator determines th at follow-up is no longer medically necessary.
All AEs (as described in Section 10.5.1 ) regardless of seriousness or relationship to study 
treatment will be collected from the time of wr itten informed consent until the patient completes 
participation in the study as defined in Section 6.3.1 .  Adverse events that started during the 
previous study which are ongoing at the time the patient signs the written informed consent should be reported in this study.
All SAEs (as described in Section 10.5.1.2 ) and any AESI requiring immediate notification 
(as described in Section 10.5.2.3.1 ) including those ongoing at the time of study completion) will 
be monitored until resolution, stabilization of the condition, or until it is mutually agreed upon by both the investigator and the sponsor safety physician to discontinue.
If, at any time after the patient has completed participation in the study (as defined in 
Section 6.3.1 ), the investigator or study staff becomes aware of an SAE that they believe is 
possibly related or related to IMP, then the event and any known details should be reported promptly to the sponsor.  Follow the reporting instructions in Section 10.5.2.2 .
All AEs diagnosed by the investigator will be reported per applicable regulations and guidelines.  
Definitions for AEs, SAEs, AESI; and instructions  for AE monitoring and reporting, are provided 
inSection 10.5 through Section 10.8 . All AEs will be coded using the version of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) currently in effect at the time of the considered database lock.
The investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports. Any abnormal 
findings that meet the definition of an AE per Section 10.5.1 will be recorded on the CRF. The 
investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parameter returns to baseline or until the 
investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 12110.5.1 Definitions of adverse events
10.5.1.1 Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical o ccurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessarily have to have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.
10.5.1.2 Serious adverse event
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
xResults in death, or
xIs life-threatening ( Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), or
xRequires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or
xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
xIs a medically important event.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above.
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which conditions have to be consider ed as medically important events.  The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive:
xIntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:
- Allergic bronchospasm,- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc).
xDevelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.
xSuicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality.
xSyncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling).
xBullous cutaneous eruptions.

10.5.1.3 Adverse event of special interest
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor may be appropriate.  Such events may require further investigation inorder to characterize and understand them.  Adverse events of special interest may be added or 
removed during a study by protocol amendment.  Reporting guidelines and follow-up instructions 
are provided below.
AESIs include pregnancy, IARs (hypersensitivity reactions, APRs, and CRSs).
10.5.1.3.1Pregnancy
Pregnancy of a female patient entered in the study,  and pregnancy occurring in a female partner of 
a male patient entered in this study.  See Section 10.2.3.1 for details.
10.5.1.3.2Infusion-associated reactions
Some AEs may be manifestations of IARs, including hypersensitivity reaction, APR, and CRS.  
However, original signs and symptoms must be reported as AEs.  In the CRF, investigators are 
asked to identify whether a specific AE represents a clinical manifestation of the IAR.
Infusion-associated reactions are defined as AEs that occur during the infusion or within up to 
24 hours after the start of infusion and are considered as related or possibly related to the studytreatment by the investigator or the sponsor.  An event occurring ≥24hours after the start of 
an infusion may be judged an IAR at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor.  For this study of olipudase alfa, IARs may present as different types of reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions, APRs, and CRS.
10.5.1.3.2.1 Hypersensitivity reactions
Infusion-associated hypersensitivity reactions seen with other enzyme replacement therapies are typically immunoglobulin-mediated (IgG/IgE) and occur after sensitization. After subsequent 
exposure to the antigen typically early into or shortly after the infusion, a “sensitized” patient may 
experience a broad range of allergic reactions that can be mild to severe or life-threatening.  Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic reaction) is a serious,  IgE mediated allergic reaction that is rapid in 
onset, and may cause death ( 22). Anaphylactoid, or non-immunologic anaphylaxis, reactions may 
present with similar serious clinical manifestations as anaphylaxis, but without prior exposure to the drug and are due to nonimmunologic-med iated mast cell degranulation.  Although 
mechanistically different, anaphylactic and an aphylactoid reactions are treated similarly.

LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 123Common symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions seen with other enzyme replacement therapy 
include urticaria, rash, dyspnea, and less frequently, angioedema. Other symptoms of hypersensitivity IARs, APRs, and CRS include fever, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, 
pain, and headache.
There were no IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity in the Phase 1b trial ( 6).
10.5.1.3.2.2 Acute phase reactions
Acute phase reactions are considered a type of IAR.  Acute phase reactions were observed in the 
Phase 1 single-dose study ( 5) and the Phase 1b repeat-dose study ( 6) in 2 patients during dose 
escalation.  The patients successfully completed the trial.  Typically, APRs occurred within 12 to
72 hours after olipudase alfa infusion and were in dicative of an inflammatory response as they 
were associated with elevations in hsCRP and changes acute phase reactants including, but not 
limited to, neutrophils, iron, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, transferrin, albumin, prothrombin time,and partial thromboplastin time. Typical AEs that were reported by the patient included, but were not limited to, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and pain; and were concurrent with the changes in specific laboratory paramete rs. Accordingly, APRs will be  determined based on combined 
significant laboratory findings and clinical symptoms.
10.5.1.3.2.3 Cytokine release syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome is another type of IAR,  attributed to the release of excessive amounts 
of cytokines shortly after the IV administration of certain therapeutic agents.  The severe form of 
CRS is cytokine storm, which may be life threaten ing.  Nonclinical studies of high-dose olipudase 
alfa have suggested the possibility of CRS.  There were no events characterized as cytokine 
release syndrome in either the Phase 1 single- or the Phase 1b repeat-dose trials with olipudase alfa ( 5,6). The Phase 1 single-dose study demonstrated increases in IL-8 and IL-6; macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1, alpha component (MIP- 1α); macrophage inflammatory protein 1, beta 
component (MIP- 1β); and other cytokines and biomarkers (based Myriad Rules -Based Medicine 
Human Multi-Analyte Profile
®antigen panel) after a single dose of ≥0.3 mg/kg of olipudase alfa 
(5). In the Phase 1b trial, increases in mean IL-6 and IL-8 values were associated with the 
first administrations of olipudase alfa at doses 0.6 mg/kg through 2.0 mg/kg and tended to be concurrent with acute phase responses ( 6). Unlike immunoglobulin-mediated hypersensitivity 
reactions, no prior antigen exposure is required for the development of CRS.  Symptoms of CRS develop soon after exposure, and range from mild  to severe.  Although CRS shares some 
symptoms with other IARs (ie, hypersensitivity reactions and APRs), symptoms typical of CRS include pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, pain, myalgia, and in severe cases, multiorgan system 
dysfunction or failure, severe headache, and pulmonary edema.  Cytokine release syndrome will 
be determined based on combined significant laboratory findings and clinical symptoms.
10.5.1.3.3Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) of study drug
An overdose (accidental or intentional) of study drug is defined as an increase of at least 30% of the dose to be administered in the specified duration or if the dose is administered in less than half

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 124the recommended duration of administration.  An  asymptomatic overdose will be reported as 
a standard AE.
10.5.1.3.4Laboratory values
The following laboratory values and symptoms will be considered AESIs (see also dose stopping criteria in Section 8.1.6 ), as follows:
xAny increase in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or  AP >3x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa 
therapy) and > ULN.
xAny increase in total bilirubin or AP >1.5x baseline in the presence of AST or 
ALT > 2x ULN.
xAny increase in ALT or AST >3x the ULN combined with an increase in ALT or 
AST >2x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa ther apy) with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (> ULN).
10.5.1.3.5Other significant events
Any AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, raises significant concern regarding the safety of olipudase alfa at the administered dose will be considered an AESI.
10.5.1.4 Definitions for cr iteria of adverse events
10.5.1.4.1Relationship to study treatment
Assessment of the association between the AE and study exposure is important for regulatory 
reporting.  This assessment is to be made in blinded studies and also for known comparators.  For each AE/SAE the investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility demonstrated by evidence which suggests a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE according to the categories below:
xNot related: There is no suspicion of a cau sal relationship between exposure and the AE.
xUnlikely related: There is no evidence for a causal relationship between exposure and the 
AE; however, such a relationship cannot be ruled out.
xPossibly related: There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal relationship 
between exposure and the AE.
xRelated: There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between exposure and 
the AE.
A relationship to the investigational product must be assigned for each AE/SAE recorded, even if 
there is only limited information at the time. The investigator may change his/her opinion of 
causality in light of follow-up information, amending the AE/SAE report accordingly.

Female patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover they are 
pregnant.  Pregnant female patients will be discontinued from the study.
Male patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover that their 
sexual partner is pregnant.
If the investigator learns of a report of pregnancy at any time after signing the informed consent, 
the investigator should follow the instructions in Section 10.5.2.3.1 to contact the sponsor within 
24 hours.  The investigator will be asked to complete the AE form, the safety complementary form, and the pregnancy form.  The patient will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known.  The investigator will be responsible for this follow-up.
If not otherwise established, the investigator will inform the patient that the sponsor is required to 
gather information regarding the course and outcome of the pregnancy after exposure to a study product.  The progress of the pregnancy must be fo llowed until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known (ie, delivery, elective termination, or spontan eous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the 
birth of a child, additional follow-up information may be requested.
The investigator will be asked to obtain follow-up information no later than 2 months after the 
gestational period to obtain maternal/fetal/neonatal outcome and any other relevant information.  
Follow-up information may be requested at additional time points.  All study-related visits/contacts involving a known pregnancy shou ld include pregnancy status assessment until 
pregnancy outcome is known.
Please note that pregnancy is an AESI, not an AE or SAE.  All information received will be 
assessed for any AEs and SAEs and processed per st udy guidelines.  If the patient is discontinued 
because of pregnancy, pregnancy will be documented as the reason for study discontinuation.  Spontaneous abortions and stillbirths are reported as SAEs.

xThe potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the sponsor according to predefined criteria/thresholds based on literature review  and defined by the sponsor for clinical 
laboratory tests and vital signs.
xPCSA criteria will determine which patients  had at least 1 PCSA during the treatment 
period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the treatment period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the treatment PCSA percentage.
xTreatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time 
from first dose to the last dose of IMP +14 Days.
11.6.3.1 Adverse events
The definitions in Section 10.5.1 will be used for AEs.  Pretreatment AEs will be listed and 
presented separately from treatment-emergent AEs.
All AEs will be coded using the most recent ve rsion of the MedDRA.  Adverse event incidence 
tables will present by system organ class (SOC ) (sorted by internationally agreed order) and 
preferred term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, and the number and percentage of patients experiencing an AE.  Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment phase.  The denominator for computation of percentages is the sa fety population within each treatment group.
All treatment-emergent AEs, all treatment-emer gent AEs potentially related to olipudase alfa, all 
treatment-emergent AEs leading to treatment  discontinuation and study discontinuation, all 
treatment-emergent AEs that are IARs, all treatment-emergent SAEs (including treatment-related 
SAEs), and all AEs with fatal outcomes (includi ng fatal treatment-emergent AEs) will be

responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the Study Monitoring Plan. 
13.3 SOURCE DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS
According to the ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the monitoring team must check the CRF entries against the source documents, except for the pre-identified source data directly recorded in the CRF.  The informed consent form will include a statement by which the patient 
allows the sponsor’s duly authorized personnel, the ethics committee (IRB/IEC), and the regulatory authorities to have direct access to original medical records that support the data on the 
CRFs (eg, patient's medical file, appointment books, original laboratory records, etc).  These 
personnel, bound by professional secrecy, must ma intain the confidentiality of all personal 
identity or personal medical information (according to confidentiality and personal data protection 
laws and rules).
13.4 USE AND COMPLETION OF ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS AND 
ADDITIONAL REQUEST
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ma intain adequate and accurate CRFs (according to 
the technology used) designed by the sponsor to record (according to sponsor instructions) all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation in a timely manner.  All CRFs should be completed in their entirety in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data.
Should a correction be made, the corrected information will be entered in the CRF overwriting the 
initial information.  An audit trail allows identifying the modification.
Data are available within the system to the sponsor as soon as they are entered in the CRF.The computerized handling of the data by the sp onsor when available in the CRF may generate 
additional requests (discrepancy resolution form) to which the investigator is obliged to respond 
by confirming or modifying the data questioned.  The requests with their responses will be managed through the CRF.
13.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
The following computerized systems may be used during the different steps of the study:
xFor data management activities, Medidata RAVE.

The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly before the Clinical Trial Summary.
17.2.1 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 06 ( 29-Jan-2021 )
This amended protocol (0 6) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the
European Union.
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT
The primary reasons for this amendment are described below:
1. During a regional or national emergency declar ed by a governmental agency such as the 
COVID -19 pandemic, to allow more flexibility with regard to additional options for monitoring 
techniques in compliance with applicable country -specific regulations.
2. During a regional or national emergency declar ed by a governmental agency such as the 
COVID -19 pandemic that can lead to site closure or e xtenuating circumstances that prevent an in -
person site visit, for the switch from Proc ess C( ) investigationa l medicinal product (IMP) to the 
updated manufacturing Process C( ) IMP, ad ding the possibility to perform the first infusion at 
home for eligible patients in agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator and in 
compliance with applicable country -specific regulations. 
3. Liver function test (LFT) monitoring after infusion i s already included in this protocol. 
However, review of the interim data from th e clinical development program has identified 
"Transient elevation in transamina ses associated with ceramide release during the dose escalation 
phase with olipudase alfa" as an important identified risk. There fore, additional recommendations 
for the management of transaminase elevation during dose escalation have been added to the 
protocol. 
Other important changes include:
1. In the context of this long -term study, the assess ments have been streamlined to reduce patient 
burden. Assessments to ensure patient safety will be preserved. This change will be implemented

patient safety is not being 
compromised. 
Transient elevation in 
transaminases associated with ceramide release during the 
dose escalation phase with

The following parameters will no longer been assessed:  
- Metabolites in plasma: ACE, sphingomyelin  
- Metabol ites in dried blood spot  
- 48 hours after infusion: vital sign measurements, 
LFTs, hematology, and safety during dose re -

Timing changed from quarterly to every 6 months through 
Year 5 for the following parameters:  
- Metabolites in plasma: ceramide,  lyso-
sphingomyelin  
- Efficacy biomarkers: serum chitotriosidase, CCL18

During the dose escalation period, for transaminases assessed 
after infusion, if any AST or ALT value is >2x baseline and >ULN, the test should be repeat ed prior to the next scheduled 
infusion. 
Depending on the test results, the dose can be 
adjusted (repeated or reduced) or  treatment can be withheld to 
allow additional transaminase monitoring, based on the 
physician’s clinical judgment.  
Baseline is defined as the following:  
· For initial dose es calation: last values prior to first dose of 
olipudase alfa  
· For dose re -escalation: last values prior to the first re-
escalation dose  this trial. 
Assessments to ensu re patient 
safety have been preserved.  
The 48 hours post -infusion 
assessments no longer assessed 
after the cutoff date for a planned 
second database lock of the 
study for purpose of regulatory 
submissions in 2021; however, 
24 hours post -infusion 
assessments remain. Therefore, 
patient safety is not being 
compromised.  
Transient elevation in 
transaminases associated with ceramide release during the dose 
escalation phase with olipudase 
alfa has been added as an important identified risk.
 
Therefore, additional 
recommendations for the 
management of transaminase 
elevation during dose escalation have been added to the protocol. 
Section 9.1.15 – Immune 
response assessments Added: If introduction of a drug  product from Process C( ) or

Section 9.3.8 
Pharmacokinetics PK testing will only occur yearly for the first 5 years and upon 
the introduction of Process C( ) or Process C( ) at any time 
during the study.  For Proce ss C( ), if treatment is not 
interrupted, PK sample collection will take place at the patient’s 
last infusion under the current manufacturing  scale and at the

the patient should  receive the first infusion at the site. 
However, if the site visit is not possible du e to site closure or

17.2.4 Amended protocol 03  based on Protocol Amendment 03 (25 April 2018)
REASON FOR AMENDMENT:
1. Extend the study treatment period from 5 years to 9 years
In section(s): Clinical Trial Summary: Study Design, Duration of Study Period; 1 Study Flow 
charts (1.1 through 1.6 [former protocol amendment 2 sections 1.1 through 1.4]); 4.2 Study 
Rational; 6 Study Design; 6.1.1 Treatment Pe riod; 6.3 Duration of Study Participation
Rationale:
LTS13632 was set to follow patients rolling over from previous adult study (Phase 1b) and 
Pediatric study (Phase 1/2). The objective is to assess long term safety and efficacy for 5 years or until marketing approval whichever comes first. So far, there was no marketing approval and no other treatment option available in the study countries.
This change aim to extend safety and efficacy follow up of the enrolled patients if they wish, for 
4 more years or until marketing approval whichever comes first. The treatment period will change from 5 years to 9 years to allow for better treatm ent options for patients at the end of treatment. 
It is also included in this change that if marketing approval was not available, extension of follow 
up beyond 9 years would be considered with sponsor’s approva l.
Specific schedules of assessment for both adults and children populations in this extension period 
have been proposed.
2. Remove a redundant exclusion criterion
In section(s): Clinical Trail Summary: Study Population, Main Selection Criteria (Exclusion 
Criteria); 7.2.2 Exclusion criteria related to the current knowledge of the compound and condition
99&/,1
Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 160Rationale:
The exclusion criterion number E 06 states that “T he patient has an alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >250 IU/L or total bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL”.
However, patients enter the study by rolling ove r from previous studies (adult Phase 1b and 
pediatric Phase 1/2) without any screening assess ment before rolling over after end of treatment of 
the previous study. 
Moreover, Liver Functions are strictly followed in previous studies and this extension study via 
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and Dose Stopping Criteria which are also reviewed by Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
Based on the above, EC 06 is redundant and this amendment proposes to remove.
3. Remove the option of another liver bi opsy after 5 years treatment in adult 
patients
In section(s): 1.1 Flow Chart for Adults; 9.1.12 Liver biopsy for sphingomyelin in liver tissue 
(only patients who previously participated in the DFI13412 study)Rationale:
In the current protocol (Protocol Amendment 2) it is indicated that an additional biopsy may take 
place at 5 years in the study, but only if necessary based on analysis of the 3 year biopsy for the group of adult patients.
The 3 year biopsy analysis of the adult patients did not show evidence suggestive of a progressive 
worsening of fibrosis to cirrhosis in patients treated with olipudase alfa. Hence it was decided that further biopsies after 5 years treatment is not needed.
4. Update the target number of patients to be approximately 25 instead of 17 
In section(s): Clinical Trial Summary: Total Expected Number of Patients; Statistical 
Considerations, sample Size Determination; 6 Study Design; 11.2 Determination of the Sample 
Size
Rationale:
All adult patients were recruited. This change serves to update the target number of patients 
according to Phase 1/2 pediatric (DFI13803) study amendment 4 (dated 21-Aug-2017), which 
plans to enroll approximately 20 patients, instead of 12.
5. Remove selected assessments from the flow chart list 
In section(s): 1.3 (former protocol amendment 2 Se ction 1.2) Flow Chart for Pediatric (Former 
DFI13803) Patients: Year 1; 1.4 (former protocol amendment 2 Section 1.2) Flow Chart for 
Pediatric (Former DFI13803) Patients: Year 2 Through Year 5; 9.3.3 Cycle ergometry;

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 161Rationale:
Remove cycle ergometry in pediatric patients. The assessment has not provided any benefit to 
follow activities in children due to the difficult applicability and low compliance.
Remove Angiotensin Converting Enzyme measure ment in both adult and pediatric populations. 
The assessment does not provide any benefit to follow efficacy or safety.
6. Add option to conduct a future additional questionnaire about home infusion 
experience to patients who received home infusion treatment 
In section(s): 9.1.2 Secondary endpoints (e fficacy); 9.2.6.3 Additional questionnaires; 
10.2.1 Home infusions
Rationale:
This is a provision in the protocol of the option to conduct future additional short and one-time 
questionnaire about home infusion experience to pati ents who received home infusion treatment.
7. Add Differential liver DNA methylation densities of PPAR ɣgene promoter in 
plasma ccfDNA
In section(s): Clinical Trial Summary (End Points), (Other endpoints); 9.1.3 Other endpoints; 
9.3.10 Differential liver DNA methylation densities of PPAR ɣgene promoter in plasma
Rationale:
Differential liver DNA methylation of peroxis ome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
(PPARɣ) gene promoter has recently been shown to stratify patients in terms of fibrosis severity. 
Plasma DNA methylation signatures reflect the mo lecular pathology associated with fibrosis liver 
disease. Remarkably, PPAR ɣhypermethylation correlated with progression to cirrhosis in 
alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and with specific stages of liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). DNA methylation markers at the human PPAR ɣpromoter detectable in 
circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) display differential methylation densities and could potentially be used to non-invasively stratify liver fibrosis severity in patients with NAFLD.
(Hardy T, et al. Gut 2016;0:1-8. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2016-311526 [downloaded Apr 11, 2016]  and 
Yi.it.B, et.al. Gut Epub ahead of print: doi:10.1136/ gutjnl-2017-315668 [downloaded Feb 26, 2018])
In order to assess this potential biomarker in ASMD patients, it would be clinically useful to 
compare the differential methylation densities of the adult patients participating in the LTS13632 study to base differential methylation densities while they were participating in the Phase 1b(DFI13412) study.
Whenever possible, and if enough volume of left-over plasma is available at all time points of 
interest, plasma samples that were obtained at th e same time of the liver biopsy performed at Year 
3 study visit will be used to assess ccfDNA differ ential methylation densities. These densities will

Phase 1b (DFI13412) study, to detect change in fibrosis differentiation using this biomarker. In this way, there will be no additional bl ood draws or procedures added to the protocol.
8. Clarify language of collection of blood samples (beyond 5 years) and 
pharmacokinetics sample and analysis
In section(s): 1.6 (former protocol amendment 2 section 1.4) Study Flowchart: Pharmacokinetic 
sampling; 9.3.8 Pharmacokinetics; 9.3.8.3.1 Sampling time in adults; 9.3.8.4.1 Sampling time in 
pediatric patients; 9.5 Sampled Blood Volume
Rationale:
Clarify and update language to address stud y extension and clarify other procedures.
9. Clarify reporting guidelines of Adverse Events of Special Interest
In section(s): 10.5.2.5 Summary of adverse event reporting, table 22 (former protocol amendment 
2 table 17)Rationale:
Adding AESI lab values to the relevant table
17.2.5 Amended protocol 02 based on Prot ocol Amendment 02 (25 April 2017)
REASON FOR AMENDMENT:
1. Change in assessments that will not be repeated at end of study/early discontinuation 
visit 
In section(s): 1.1, 1.3
Rationale:
Correction of error in previous section.
2. Dose calculation based on weight in site and home infusion visits
In section(s): 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
Rationale:
Weight change between visits is insignificant, therefore dose calculation using weight from 
previous site visit is allowed. In home infusion visit, the last weight taken on site will be used.

17.2.6 Amended protocol 01  based on Protocol Amendment 01 (23 March 2016)
REASON FOR AMENDMENT:
Changes listed in this section are regarded as “substantial” because they have a significant impact 
on:
xThe safety or physical or mental integrity of the patients,
xThe scientific values of the trial; or,
xThe conduct or management of the trial.
1.Change expected number of patients from “65 -70 patients” to “up to 17 pat ients.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Study population, Total expected number of 
patients), 6.Rationale: This trial allows current patients to continue treatment.  Based on the number of 
patients in this trial and the DFI13803 pediatric trial, the maximum number of patients is 
already known to be 17.
2. Provide option for home infusions.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 8.1.1, 10.2.
Rationale: Patients are on stable doses that th ey have been tolerating well.  This provision 
eases the travel and hospitalization burden on pa tients without affecting patient safety.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 1653.Provide specific guidelines on treatment “r eintroduction” defined as management of 
patients who have missed 1 or more olipudase alfa doses.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 8.1.1, 8.1.5.
Rationale: Issue was not addressed in previous version.
4. Remove the requirement that the sponso r must be consulted to determine the 
appropriate dose of olipudase alfa for dose  adjustments or if a patient misses 1 or 
more doses.
In section: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 8.1.1, 8.1.4.
Rationale: Guidance on how to restart treatmen t when patients have missed consecutive 
doses is provided in Section 8.1.1 of the protocol.
5. Remove continuous heart rate monitoring as an endpoint.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Endpoints,  Primary endpoints, Data pertaining to the 
safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa), 1.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.
Rationale: Patients in the LTS13632 trial have  all completed the dose escalation regimen. 
As such, they are outside the period where fluc tuations of ceramide could lead to more 
severe adverse events. The results of conti nuous ECG monitoring to date from studies 
DFI13412 and LTS13412 have not revealed any cl inically significant changes. Moreover, 
enzyme therapies, as a class effect, are not known to detrimentally effect cardiac function. 
As such, continuous ECG monitoring was removed.
6. Add these endpoints.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Endpoints,  Primary endpoints, Data pertaining to the 
safety and tolerability of oli pudase alfa), 9.1, 9.2.2.1, 9.2.2.2, 9.2.7, 9.2.8, 9.2.9, 9.3, 9.3.7,

-Hand X-ray for bone age and bone maturation (pediatric patients),
-Tanner staging (pediatric patients),
-Linear patient growth by height Z--score (pediatric patients).
xOther endpoints:
-Cognitive and adaptive function (pediatric patients only, until age 6 years),
-Bone biomarkers,

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 166-Photographs (optional).
Rationale: These are relevant clin ical endpoints for pediatric patients entering the trial, 
which were part of the primary pediatric study, and for continued evaluation of adult 
patients (eg, liver biopsy).
7.Specify that, “The term ‘pediatric patients only’ means pat ients coming from the 
original pediatric trial, DFI13803.  Some of  these patients will reach adult age 
[18 years old] while in this study.  They wi ll continue the assessments schedule they 
were on in the original trial.  These patients will be adults by age, but they will remain part of the “pediatric patient” co hort.” They will not follow the adult 
procedures in this study (eg, liver biopsy).
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Assessment schedule), 1.1, 9, 9.4.9.1.
Rationale: Pediatric patients will not have some baseline assessments for comparison 
(eg, liver biopsy, DXA of femurs and spine).  This statement is intended to clarify to site 
personnel which assessments pertain to adults and which to pediatric patients.
8. Add that for patients who mi ssed 3 infusions or more in fusions between trials, some 
assessments may be repeated at study entry after discussion between the sponsor and 
the investigator.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Assessment schedule), 1.1.
Rationale: Since the rate at which sphingomyelin reaccumulates when olipudase alfa is 
interrupted, it may be necessary to repeat some efficacy assessments in case of prolonged 
investigational product suspension.
9.Add: “If a patient has missed 3 or more doses ≥0.6 mg/kg, reintroduction of 
olipudase alfa for patients receiving infusions at home should occur at the 
hospital/study site.  If a patient misses 2 or fewer doses, the investigator can decide 
whether reintroduction for patients receiv ing infusions at home should occur at the 
hospital/study site.”
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 1.1, 8.1.1, 8.1.5.
Rationale: To ensure patient’s safety.
10. Add assessments for patients who require dose reintroduction.
xPatients who require dose reintroduction  will have these assessments at each 
infusion until reaching their usual dose of olipudase alfa:
-Before infusion: vital signs, liver function tests, hematology, ECG, and safety 
biomarkers,
-Immediately after infusion: vital signs and ECG,
-24 hours: vital signs, liver function tests, and safety biomarkers,

biomarkers.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Assessment schedule), 1.1, 8.1.5.
Rationale: To monitor patient safety during reintroduction.
11. Add that PK testing will only occur yearly and upon the introduction of a new 
manufacturing scale.
In sections: 1.2, 9.4.8.
Rationale: Provide appropriate and continuous monitoring, in particular for manufacturing 
scale changes.
12. Add that for a new manufacturing scale, if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample 
collection will take place at the patient’s last infusion under the current manufacturing scale and at the first infusion under the new manufacturing scale.
In sections: 1.1, 1.2, 9.4.8.
Rationale: To provide patients’ data on drug comparability.
13. Add that if a manufacturing scale change occurs, immune response assessments will 
be monthly for the first 6 months after starting the new scale, and quarterly after that.
In sections: 1.1, 1.2, 9.4.8.
Rationale: Per FDA request.
14. Add that in case reintroduction of olipudase alfa coincides with a manufacturing 
scale change, PK samples will be collecte d at the infusion at which patients receive 
their usual dose of olipudase alfa under the new manufacturing scale. 
In sections: 1.2, 9.3.8.
Rationale: To provide patients’ data on drug comparability.
15. Added PK sampling times, number of samples, and parameters in adults and 
pediatric patients.
In sections: 1.2, 9.3.8.3.

17. Added PK total blood volumes for pediatric patients.
In sections: 1.2, 9.5.
Rationale: Specify maximum blood volume f or blood samples per health authority 
requirement.
18. Add that the patients must be willing and able to avoid certain medications and 
herbal supplements for 10 days before and 3 days after liver biopsies.
In sections: 7.2.1, 8.6.
Rationale: Decrease the risk of bleeding from liver biopsies and to avoid liver toxicity.
19. Clarify patient stopping criteria.
In section: 8.1.7
Rationale: The role of the DMC in an emergenc y is to review safety data and recommend
stopping the study if necessary to ensure patient safety.  However, this does not limit the 
ability of investigators to make an immediate decision to discontinue dosing in an individual patient due to any AE that raises significant concern regarding the safety of olipudase alfa, as described in Section 8.1.6 of the protocol.
20. Remove O
2saturation from vital signs.
In section: 9.2.4.
Rationale: As part of this amendment to the protocol, dose escalation is not part of the 
trial.  Patients are on stable doses, and therefore monitoring without measuring 
O2 saturation is appropriate.
21. Change safety biomarker test from multiplex immunoassay to specific biomarkers 
including, but not limited to, hsCRP, iron, ferr itin, cardiac tropon in I, IL-6, IL-8,
plasma ceramide and calcitonin.
In sections: 9.2.5, 9.2.10.
Rationale: Given current know ledge about the study drug, broad immunoassay can be 
replaced by targeted testing.
22.Change the definition of overdose from “at least twice the intended dose within the 
intended therapeutic interval” to “an increa se of at least 30% of the dose to be 
administered in the specified duration, or if  the dose is administered in less than half 
the recommended duration of administration.”
In section: 10.5.2.3.1.
Rationale: To align with the investig ator brochure and the Sanofi template

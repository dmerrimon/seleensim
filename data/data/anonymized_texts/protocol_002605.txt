Study SUN -15-04:  The Use of Bellafill® for Atrophic Acne Scar Correction  in the Full Facial Area  
INVESTIGATOR:  TELEPHONE: 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  
You are being asked to participate in a research study designed to evaluate the safety  and efficacy of Bella fill 
injection (a collagen gel polymethymethacrylate ( PMMA ) microsphere based filler material ) for the correction of 
facial acne scars. 
Bellafill has been proven to be safe and effective in improving the appearance of atrophic acne scars by raising 
the base of the scar so that it is level with the surrounding skin.  The FDA approved Bellafill for the correction of 
acne scars in December 2014. 
The study involves up to 50 normal healthy male or female participant s, 21 years of age  or older  who desire 
correction of their acne scarring  with an injectable filler .  The study will be sponsored and financed by Suneva 
Medical, Inc. and conducted at approximately 10 sites in the U.S . 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?  
If you decide to be in this study and the study doctor says you can be in the study, your participation will last 
approximately 8 months. You will have to come to the study site for 5 visits.   
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
You will get t reatment with Bellafill injection  on your face, as well as touch up treatments (if necessary to achieve 
optimal correction). The Bellafill  treatment in this study is provided to you at no charge . 
To participate in the study, you must also agree to the following responsibilities : 
•You must review and sign this informed consent form  and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) release .  You must sign the photography release section on the last page of this informed

doctor’s instructions .
•Prior to attending all study visits, you must refrain  from applying facial cosmetics .
•Yo

treatment(s) dur ing the study period, or you may be discontinued from the study.
•Prior to the use of acne therapies , you must obtain permission from your study doctor  (to ens ure that they will
not interfere with the Bellafill  treatment).
•If you are a female who is at age where you could become pregnant , you must use a medically effectiv e
contraception and practice such contraceptive method throughout the study .
Visit 1 (Sc re ening Visit , Month -1):  This visit lasts about 45 minutes.  The study doctor will assess acne scars  
and determine if you are eligible to participate in this study.  You r medical history, current medical conditions, 
medication use, and previous treatment received will be reviewed. You may be asked to stop using some 
medications such as aspirin. A urine pregnancy test  (UPT)  will be performed if you are of childbearing potential.  
Your face will be photographed and the doctor will rate the severity of your scars.   You will receive a “ Bellafill  Skin 
Test” where a very small amount of collagen (0.1cc) will be implanted into the skin of your forearm  (to confirm that 
you are not sensitive to the collagen that is part of Bellafill ). 
Visit 2  (Treatment Visit, Day 0):  This visit lasts about 60 minutes.  Your Bellafill  skin test results will be reviewed 
and, you will be asked if you have used any new medications/treatments.  If applicable, a UPT will be performed. 
You will  complete a short questionnaire, and then you will receive injections of Bellafill to treat your acne scars .  
Visit 3  (Month 1 ):  This visit lasts about 60 minutes.   You will be asked if you experienced any side effects or 
used any new medications/treatments since the last visit.  If applicable, a UPT will be performed . The study doctor 
will examine you and determine if touch- up injections of Bellafill are required  to obtain optimal treatment effect.

filler cannot be removed without surgery.  Side effects of Bellafill® implant may include:  
•lumpiness  at injection area more than one month after injection
•swelling, redness , rash, itching , infection or increased sensitivity  at the injection sites
•blurred vision
•flu-like symptoms  or allergic reactions

As in any research study, the possibility of unknown risks exists.   You will be notified if any significant new 
findings or additional information is discovered during the course of this study, which may affect your willingness 
to continue participating in this study.  
The safety of Bellafill® for use during pregnancy, in breast feeding females, or in patients under 18 years of age 
has not been established.  All women of childbearing potential must have urine pregnancy test s prior to receiving 
Bellafill  treatments (including touch -ups), and must use medically acceptable methods of contraception. 
Medically acceptable methods of contraception are ho rmonal methods  (contraceptive pill or implant ), an 
intrauterine device (IUD) , barrier method such as diaphragm plus sperm icide, condom plus spermicide, or 
vasectomized partner(s).   Barrier methods must be in use at least 14 days prior to study drug administration, 
hormonal methods and IUD s must be in use at least 30 days prior to study administration. Females of 
childbearing potential who are not sexually active or who have a male partner who has had a vasectomy at least 3 months prior to receive Bellafill treatment (or who has a confirmed ‘0’ sperm count ) are not required to use 
reliable method of contraception.  
WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS?  
A potential benefit  is that your acne scarring is partially or fully corrected, however this is not guaranteed. 
WILL I GET PAYMENT?  
You will receive  compensation for each visit that you attend., i.e.,  Visit 1 25.00, Visit s 2 thru 4 $50.00 for each visit 
and $75.00 for Visit 5.  The total  payment for your participation will depend upon your treatment group assignment

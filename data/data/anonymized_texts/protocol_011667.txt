2. Introduction  
 
 
Widespread testing is the cornerstone of COVID -19 control aroun d the world. However, U.S. 
testing to identify people with infected SARS -CoV -2 has been slow to start and continues to lag. 
An important feature of SARS -CoV -2 is that it can be transmitted while a host is unaware of 
infection (asymptomatic). Epidemiologic evidence has demonstrated that pre -symptomatic and 
asymptomatic transmission of virus has driven the current epidemic1. Antigen tests have a great 
potential for screening asymptomatic people2. To limit outbreaks, testing is needed to identify as 
many indiv iduals who are transmitting infection as quickly as possible. Antigen Tests have the 
potential to readily identify an individual who is at or near peak infection. Rapid Tests, while less 
sensitive, perform best during the early stages of COVID -19 infection ; when viral load and 
potential for spread is high.  
 
There is an unmet need to provide broad testing that can serve high risk and low resource 
communities. The FDA’s authorization for antigen tests for home use is helping to expand 
Americans’ access to testing, reducing the burden on laboratories and test supplies3. The Biozek 
Antigen Rapid Test can be easily performed by untrained personnel with results in less than 15 
minutes. The increased potential for repeated testing, remote or at home testing, cou ld help 
contain the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
3. Background  
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
In December 2019, an outbreak emerged identifying a novel coronavirus, severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SA RS-CoV -2). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
declared it a global pandemic in March 2020.   Testing in the U.S. appeared to be insufficient for 
optimal early containment of the virus. With the resurgence of the disease  (COVID -19), the U.S. 
has recently seen the highest number of hospitalizations since the beginning of the pandemic and 
rates are expected to increase in future weeks4. Given the continued community transmission of 
SARS -CoV -2 in the US, there has been sustained focus on the role of testing to reduce the 
spread. Presently, the gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is used to diagnose 
COVID -19 by detecting the presence of specific genetic material of the virus. PCR test requires 
laboratory processing and it may take days t o obtain results. In turn, an individual could be 
negative at time of testing but positive by the time the result is returned5. PCR testing is 
performed by a trained healthcare professional at an approved testing facility. In contrast, The 
BIOZEK Rapid Ant igen Test detects specific proteins on the surface of the virus and it can be 
self-administered. Results are generated in 15 minutes and can be performed at home or any 
remote location. In efforts to meet the exponential demand in testing, the introduction  of a new 
and effective Rapid Test could potentially end the spread of COVID -19.

 4. Study Objectives:   
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
The primary objective of the study is to assess sensitivity and specific ity of BIOZEK COVID -19 
Antigen Rapid Test on a sample collected by healthcare professionals.  
 
Secondary objectives are to assess sensitivity and specificity of BIOZEK COVID -19 Antigen 
Rapid Test on self -collected samples.  
 
Additionally, the objective is to achieve the same results from the tests performed via self - 
collection and by the healthcare professionals. Such a comparison would demonstrate any 
distinctions  between tests performed by healthcare professionals and by the subject.  
 
RT-PCR Ct Values w ill be requested and analyzed.  
 
5. Investigational Product  
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
The BIOZEK COVID -19 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette (Nasopharyngeal Swab) is a qualitative 
membrane -based immunoassay for the detection of SARS -CoV -2 Antigens in human 
nasopharyngeal swab specimens. SARS -CoV -2 antibody is coated in the test line region. During 
testing, the specimen reacts with SARS -CoV -2 antibody -coated particles in the test. The mixture 
then migrates upward on the membrane by capillary action and reacts with the SARS -CoV -2 
antibody in the test line region.  
If the specimen contains SARS -CoV -2 Antigens, a colored line will appear in the test line region 
as a result of this. If the specimen does not contain ant igens to SARS -CoV -2, no colored line will 
appear in the test line region, indicating a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, a 
colored line will always appear in the control line region, indicating that the proper volume of 
specimen has been a dded and membrane wicking has occurred.

Swab specimens should be extracted and tested as soon as possible after swab specimen 
collection.  
 
Specimen Extraction  
Only the extraction buffer and/or t ubes provided in this kit is to be used for specimen extraction.  
 
Swab specimen extraction with pre -filled integrated buffer tube (Option 1)  
1. Unscrew the cap of the extraction tube with the extraction  buffer inside.  
2. Place the swab specimen into the  extraction buffer, for better mixture and extraction to release 
antigen, rotate the swab for approximately 10 seconds while pressing the swab head against the 
inner wall of the tube at least 5 times to release the antigen.  
3. Remove the swab while squeez ing the swab head against the inner wall of the tube to get 
maximum solution left inside the extraction tube. Dispose of the used swab in your biohazard 
waste.  
4. Tighten the cap onto the sample extraction tube. Use the extracted  sample solution as a fina l 
sample for testing as soon as possible.  
 
Swab specimen extraction with extraction buffer and tube separately (Option 2&3)  
(Extraction buffer in 10mL buffer bottle or disposable buffer vial)  
1. Place the extraction tube in the workstation and add approx. 350μL Extraction Buffer into the 
extraction tube as following:  
Extraction buffer in 10mL bottle: Add 10 drops of extractio n buffer into the tube.  
Extraction buffer in disposable buffer vial: Tear to open the small disposable vial and add the 
Entire Extraction Buffer into the tube.  
2. Place the swab specimen into the extraction buffer. Rotate the swab for approximately 10 
seconds while pressing the head against the inner wall of the tube 5 times to release the antigen.

BIOZEK Version: Final 1.0 – March 5, 2021  
 3. Remove the swab while squeezing the swab head against the inner wall of the tube to get 
maximum solution left inside the extraction tube. Dispose of the us ed swab in your biohazard 
waste.  
4. Fit the tip onto the top of the extraction tube. Use the extracted  sample solution as a final  
sample for testing as soon as possible.  
 
NOTE: For extraction buffer in 10mL bottle, it is suggested not to use the extracti on buffer 
beyond 3 months after opening the extraction buffer bottle.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Viral Transport Media (VTM) specimen extraction  
1. VTM should not contain guanidinium.  
2. When using Viral Transport Media (VTM) specimen, it is important to ensure that the V TM 
containing the swab specimen has been balanced to room temperature (15 - 30°C).  
3. Using a pipette to transfer 350μL VTM specimen into the specimen extraction tube with 
approx.350μL extraction buffer inside, shake to mix it well for extraction. Use the extracted  
sample solution as a final  sample for testing as soon as possible.  
 
NOTE : The storage of the extracted specimen is stable for 2 hours at room temperature or 24 
hours at 2 -8°C. 
 
Standard Testing Procedure  
Allow the test, extracted specimen and/o r controls to equilibrate to room temperature (15 -30°C) 
prior to testing.  
 
Remove the test cassette from the sealed foil pouch and use it within one hour. Best results will 
be obtained if the test is performed immediately after opening the foil pouch.  
 
Invert the specimen collection tube and add 3 drops of the extracted specimen  (approx.75μl) to 
the specimen well(S) and then start the timer. |  
 
Wait for the colored line(s) to appear. Read the result in 15  minutes. Do not interpret the result 
after 20 minutes.

Figure 1: Interpretation of Results for Test Cassette  
 
After the te st is performed, remaining material should be disposed of in biohazard disposal.  
 
Control Material:  
Internal Quality Control  
An internal procedural control is included in the test. A colored line appearing in the control 
region (C) is an internal positive procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume and 
correct procedural technique. A clear background is an internal negative procedural control. If 
the test is working properly, the background in the result area should be white to light pink and  
not interfere with the ability to read the test result.  
 
External Quality Control  
Positive and negative controls are not included in this kit.  
 
 
Interpretation of results  
POSITIVE: *  Two distinct colored lines appear. One colored line should be in the control region 
(C) and another colored line should be in the Test region (T). A positive result in the Test region 
indicates detection of COVID -19 antigens in the sample.  
*NOTE: The int ensity of the color in the test line region (T) will vary based on the amount of 
COVID -19 antigen present in the sample. Any shade of color in the test region (T) should be 
considered positive.  
 
NEGATIVE: One colored line appears in the control region (C) . No apparent colored line 
appears in the test line region (T). INVALID: Control line fails to appear in the control region 
(C). Insufficient specimen volume or incorrect procedural techniques are the most likely reasons 
for control line failure. Review th e procedure and repeat the test with a new cassette. If the 
problem persists, discontinue.  
 

 
11 
BIOZEK Version: Final 1.0 – March 5, 2021  
  
 
If the specimen contains SARS -CoV -2 Antigens, a colored line will appear in the test  line region 
as a result of this. If the specimen does not contain antigens to SARS -CoV -2, no colored line 
will appear in the test line region, indicating a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, 
a colored line will always appear in the control  line region, indicating that the proper volume of 
specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.  
 
As shown in illustration above, the specimen (A) migrates via capillary action along the 
membrane to react with the colored conjugate (B). COVID -19 antigen present in the specimen 
binds to the conjugate, forming a colored antibody -antigen complex. The Anti -SARS -CoV2 
immobilized in the test zone of the membrane captures the test region (C). The formation of a 
visible colored line in the test region  indicates a positive result (C). The absence of a colored 
line in the test zones suggests a negative result. In the control zone of the membrane, 
immobilized reagents capture colored conjugate regardless of test specimen composition. The 
resulting visible  colored band (D) confirms the control  line. 
 
How to Store Biozek COVID -19 Antigen rapid test.  
Store the BIOZEK COVID -19 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette (Nasopharyngeal Swab) packaged in 
the sealed pouch and extraction buffer at room temperature or refrigerate d (2-30°C). The test and 
extraction buffer are stable through the expiration date printed on the sealed pouch and buffer 
label. The test must remain in the sealed pouch until use. DO NOT FREEZE. Do not use the kit 
beyond the expiration date. Do not use the  kit if the package of the test cassette or buffer is 
damaged.

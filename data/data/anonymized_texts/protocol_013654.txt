Brief Summary of the 
Protocol  The overall objective of this study aims to evaluate the on -eye 
toric clinical performance of investigational LID226397  contact 
lenses and AOfAHP contact lenses in a daily wear dispensing 
trial. Volunteer subjects aged 18 or over who are habitual  soft 
toric contact lens wearers, have at least 3 months of contact lens 
wearing experience (excluding AOfAHP habitual lens wearer s 
and habitual daily disposable lens wearers), and who wear their 
habitual lenses at least 5 days per week and at least 10 hours per 
day, will be included. This is a prospective, randomized  
 bilateral, crossover, controlled, double -masked,  
multicenter  clinical  study.  
Objective(s)  The primary objective  is to evaluate the percentage of 
LID226397  contact lenses with axis orientation within 
±30 degrees from the 90º axis (ideal location), 10 min after lens 
insertion at dispense visit.

5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Rationale and B ackground  
LID226397  contact lenses are indicated for the optical correction of refractive ametropia  
(myopia or hyperopia , with astigmatism ) in persons with nondiseased eyes. The LID226397  
contact lenses are a frequent  replacement silicone hydrogel (SiHy) c ontact lenses being 
developed in an effort to maintain prolonged on -eye performance by utilizing an inherently 
wettable core lens material . These SiHy lenses  have  a water content of 55%, contain a UV 
blocker,  High Energy Visible Light  (HEVL ) filter , and light blu e handling tint. LID226397  
contact lenses use the Precision  Balance 8|4™ ballasted toric design concept, successfully

Alcon – Business Use Only  adopted for AIR OPTIX ™ for Astigmatism. A front -curve orientation feature will consist of a 
fiducial mark at 6 o ’clock for  on-eye assessment of lens rotation.  
 
In order for the toric contact lenses to perform effectively, they must maintain the correcting  
cylindrical axis in appropriate and stable orientation.  Therefore, i t is critical to have t imely 
lens orientation to ideal a xis, minimal lens rotation , and lens oscillation to achieve optimal 
performance and stable correction of astigmatism with minimal visual blur. For performance 
confirmation purpose , the study aims to evaluate the on -eye clinical performance of 
investigation al LID226397  contact lenses to support contact lens product development and to 
evaluate product performance in the intended population.  
 
  
The AOfAHP contact lenses have been chosen as the comparator product because these 
lenses have the comparable wear modality and same indication for correction of astigmatism.  
5.2 Purpose of the Study  
The overall objective of t his study aims to evaluate the on -eye toric clinical performance of 
investigational LID226397  contact lenses  and AOfAHP contact lenses  in a daily wear 
dispensing trial. Volunteer subjects aged 18 or over who are habitual toric soft contact lens 
wearers, have at least 3 months of contact lens wearing experience  (excluding AO fAHP 
habitual lens wearers  and habitual daily dispo sable lens wearers ), and who wear their habitual 
lenses at least 5 days per week and at least 10 hours per day, will be included. This is a 
prospective, randomized  , bilateral, crossover , controlled, double -masked, 
multicenter  clinical study. T he outcomes of this study will be used to support contact lens 
product development

regulatory requirements and standards.   
There are no immediate plans to submit the results of this study for publication; however, the 
results may be offered for publication if they are of scientific interest, or if the results relate to 
a product that is subsequently approved or cleared for mar keting.  
Alcon reserves the right of prior review of any publication or presentation of information 
related to the study . The auth or(s) of the publication will be the individual with substantial 
contribution to the conception or design of the work, OR the acquisition, analysis, or 
interpretation of data. Additionally, the author will draft the work or revise it critically for 
important intellectual content; provide final approval of the version to be published; and 
agree to be accountable for all aspects of  the work, ensuring that questions related to the 
accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  
5.3 Risks and Benefits  
Risk management principles have been applied to both the planning and the intended conduct 
of the clinical investigation, in order to ensure the reliability of the clinical data generated and 
the safety of the subjects. The clinical investigation process risks are managed through 
appropriate training and monitoring according to the protocol -specific monitoring plan . 
Investigational device risks , including risks associated with use of device and methods and 
procedures for application of device , are defined in the investigator ’s brochure and/or product 
labeling and are managed through review of safety assessments outlined in this protocol.  
Contact lenses may offer improved peripheral vision and the convenience of not wearing 
spectacles. Material properties and design characteristics of  serafilcon A contact lenses are 
features consistent for successful contact lens wear. Based upon nonclinical testing and 
documented rationale for applicability of test results, LID226397  contact lenses, which is 
made of the same material as  Alcon  serafilcon A sphere contact lens, are assessed to be 
nontoxic and biocompati ble for on -eye use.  
 
In the US, Acuvue Oasys contact lenses have approved indications for use for both daily wear 
and extended wear for up to 6 continuous nights. Further details on any known potential risks 
and benefits can be found in the product package  insert.

Alcon – Business Use Only  A summary of the known potential benefits  and risks  associated with LID226397  contact 
lenses can be found in the IB. The potential harms associated with on -eye exposure to the 
new lens materials include toxicity response, blurred vision, and ocul ar discomfort. In 
general, when worn for daily wear, the risks with LID226397  contact lenses are anticipated to 
be similar to other marketed soft contact lenses worn for daily wear.  
There may also be unknown risks to use of  LID226397  contact lenses. Any risk to subjects in 
this clinical study will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study 
procedures, clinical oversight, and monitoring. Site personnel will educate subjects on proper 
hygiene and lens handling, and compliance with th e use of contact lenses for daily wear 
according to the protocol. Subjects should be instructed not to wear contact lenses while  
swimming due to increased risk of infection , or while sleeping. Site personnel should advise 
the subjects to remove contact len ses and return for prompt follow -up of symptoms such as 
ocular discomfort, foreign body sensation, excessive tearing, vision changes, or hyperemia.

Alcon – Business Use Only  7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, randomized   bilateral, crossover, controlled, double -masked, 
multicenter clinical study , evaluating the LID226397  and AOf AHP contact lenses,  to be 
conducted at approximately 6 sites.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 crossover sequences ,  
 and exposed to test and comparator lenses for bilateral wear.  Subjects will 
be expected to complete all 7 scheduled visits.  Subjects will be asked to wear their habitual 
spectacles only (no contact lens wear) during the washout periods for 3 to 4 days after Visit 1 , 
and for 2 (at least 48 hours) to 4 days after Visit 4. All study contact lenses will be prescr ibed 
according to subject ’s prescription and fitted using the manufacturers fitting instructions. 
Investigator will insert the contact lenses with scribe mark in the direction of the intended 6  
o’clock position (90º axis),  
. 
 
This is a double masked study design where both the investigator and the subjects will be 
masked to the details of the study products and assigned treatment (lens) sequences. 
Differences in scribe marks and lens thickness profile between the study lenses could result in 
potential inadvertent unmasking of investigator.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
Subjects will be provided with CLEAR  CARE  Cleaning & Disinfecting Solution to use with 
the study lenses  for the duration of study . LacriPure saline will be permitted for ri nsing the 
lens(es) after removal and prior to insertion, if required.

7.2 Rationale for Study Design  
This study design is justified based upon an evaluation of the results of relevant preclinical 
and clinical testing, as described within the IB.  
The investigational contact lens is intended for the optical correction of refractive ametropia 
(myopia or hyp eropia, with astigmatism) in persons with non -diseased eyes . 
The purpose of this study is to  evaluate the on -eye clinical performance of investigational 
LID226397  contact lenses to support contact lens product development and to evaluate 
product performance in the intended population.   
 
 
The primary and  endpoints were selected to fulfil l the primary 
 objectives of the study. Procedures for measurement of these endpoints 
were selected based on common practice for these assessments . The design of this study is 
justified based upon preclinical and clinical testing, as de scribed within the investigator’s 
brochure.   
 AOfAHP contact lenses were chosen as the comparator product

Alcon – Business Use Only  because these lenses also are reusable contact  lenses  and have the comparable wear modality 
and same indication for correction of astigmatism  (see Package Insert for AOHP contact 
lenses) .  
The intended use of this contact lens is vision correction  in asti gmatism ; therefore, the 
measurement of  lens axi s orientation, 10 min after insertion is planned as the primary 
effectiveness endpoint.  
 
 
 
  
The crossover design will ensure that the same subject is exposed to both the test and 
comparator lens materials; therefore, objective assessments  
will be obtained for both lenses from the same subject.  
 
 
 The study will exclude any current /habitual  
AOfAHP lens and daily disposable contact lens wearers , and any previous wearers of 
AOfAHP or daily disposable contact lenses  in the past 3 months  prior to consent in order to 
reduce potential bias of wearers to their habitual contact lenses. There are no immediate plans 
to submit the results of this pivotal  study for publication; however, the results may be offered 
for publication if they are of scientific interest, or if the results relate to a product that is 
subsequently approved or cleared  for marketing.  
7.2.1 Purpose and Timing of Interim Analyses and Resulting Design 
Adaptations  
Interim analyses will not be performed .  
7.3 Rationale for Duration of Treatment/ Follow -Up 
Subjects will wear each study product bilaterally for their respective wear cycl es on a daily 
wear modality.  
 The lenses will be provided by a qualified 
unmasked study staff member in such a manner that the subject  and the investigator remain 
masked to the lens type. The primary  endpoints will be assessed on dispense 
visits  respectively .

7.4 Rationale for Choice of Comparator  Product  
AOfAHP contact lenses were chosen as the comparator product because these lenses also are 
reusable contact lenses (see Package Insert for AOHP contact lenses) and have similar 
indications for correction of astigmatism .

• Hypopyon  
• Hyphema  
• Neovascularization within the central 6 mm o f the cornea  
• Permanent vision loss as defined by loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A  (e.g., with 
manifest refraction or habitual correction)  from enrollment visit that fails to resolve  
• Uveitis (anterior, intermediate, or posterior)  
• Corneal abrasion affecting ≥ 50% of corneal surface area  
Significant Non serious Adverse Events  
A significant nonserious AE is a device -related, nonsight threatening adverse event that 
warrants discontinuation of any contact lens wear for greater than or equal to 2 weeks. In 
addition,  the investigator must report any occurrence of the following as a Significant 
Nonserious Adverse Event:  
• Peripheral nonprogressive noninfectious ulcers  
• All symptomatic corneal infiltrative events  
• Corneal staining score greater than or equal to grade 3 (Ref er to MOP for grading 
scales)  
• Temporary vision loss as defined by loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A  (e.g., with 
manifest refraction or habitual correction)  from enrollment visit that persists for 2 or 
more weeks  
• Neovascularization score greater than or equal  to grade 2 (Refer to MOP for grading 
scales)  
The above events are based on the categories provided in the ISO 11980 and the US FDA 
Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.  
 
Device Deficiencies  
 
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be associated 
with patient harm (i .e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due to a de vice 
deficiency. The investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the Device 
Document ID:  
V-CLN -0040694  Status: Approved , Version: 3.0 
Approved Date: 06 Sep 2023  Page 58 of 81 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient harm 
separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications (e .g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens/solution cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging deficit (e .g., mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/conta iner)  
• Suspect product contamination  
11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the investigator should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions shown 
below and rep ort as applicable:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
In addition, changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnaires evaluated  
during the study are to be reviewed by the investigator. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the investigator, is to be reported as an A E. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent . Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to t he start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are no t 
considered AEs if the investigator assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable ), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness

V-CLN -0040694  Status: Approved , Version: 3.0 
Approved Date: 06 Sep 2023  Page 59 of 81 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  and causality. In addition, the investigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator products on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must 
submit all available infor mation on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness . 
• Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness . Additional relevant information after initial 
reporting must be entered into the eCRF as soon as the data become available.  
• Document  any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary, Autopsy Report, 
Certificate of Death, etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Adverse Device 
Effect (for related AEs) and Serious Adverse Event  eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become nonoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device Deficiency Form. The 
completed form is emailed to the study sponsor at msus.safety@alcon.com , for US , according 
to the timelines outlined above; however, the reported information must be entered into the 
EDC system once it becomes operational.  
Study sponsor representatives may be contacted for any protocol -related question and their 
contact information is provided in the Manual of Procedures that accompanies this protocol.  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copies of applicable portions of the subje ct’s medical records. The 
investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigato r must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Document ID:  
V-CLN -0040694  Status: Approved , Version: 3.0 
Approved Date: 06 Sep 2023  Page 60 of 81 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to  work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator must assess the causality ( related or not related to 
the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed by 
study sponsor utilizing  the same definitions, as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but  there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by the medical device or study procedure.  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes f or the AE).  
The study sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator of any AE that is 
upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to relat ed. 
11.4 Return Product Analysis  
Study sponsor representatives and their contact information are provided in the MOP that 
accompanies this protocol.  
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must incl ude the Complaint #, which will be provided by study sponsor after the 
case is entered in the study sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Management System 
(GPCMS), if applicable.  
11.5 Unmasking of the Study Treatment  
Masked information on the identity of the assi gned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the study. If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of subject safety, the 
investigator is encouraged to contact an appropriate study sponsor representative prior to 
unmasking the informati on if there is sufficient time. Dependent upon the individual 
circumstances (i.e., medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to contact with the

and of the c ircumstances involved. Additionally, the study sponsor may be required to 
unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting requirements.  
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for adequate and saf e medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator should provide the study sponsor with any new safety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved /ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study completion (i.e., database lock).  
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the post market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated 
to the medical device ’s manufacturer a s per local requirements.  
The investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products (i.e., ACUVUE 
OASYS for ASTIGMATISM with HYDRACLEAR PLUS ) directly to the manufacturer as 
per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory requirements.  
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study  
Women of childbearing potential or women who are pregnant at the time of study entry are 
not excluded from participation. Pregnancy should be included in the Pregnancy eCRF when 
a pregnant woman enters the study or if a woman  becomes pregnant during the study. 
Pregnancy is not reportable as an AE; however, complications may be reportable and will be 
decided on a case -by-case basis.

Alcon – Business Use Only  There are no safety hypotheses planned in this study. The focus of the safety analysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of adverse events as well as the other 
listed parameters.  
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs informed consent to study exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety analyses will be cond ucted using the safety analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (frequencies and percentages) for 
ocular and nonocular AEs will be presented by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
Preferred Terms. AEs leading to study disc ontinuation and SAEs will be identified. Individual 
subject listings will be provided, as necessary.  
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur after signing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP.  
Each biomicroscopy parameter wi ll be tabulated by its grade. For each biomicroscopy 
parameter, frequencies and percentages of eyes that experience an increase of ≥ 2 grades from 
baseline (last assessment prior to study lens exposure) to any subsequent visit within the 
same period will b e presented. A supportive listing will be generated which will include all 
biomicroscopy data from all visits within the same period for those eyes experiencing the 
increase.  
Two listings for device deficiencies, prior to exposure to study contact lenses a nd treatment -
emergent, will be provided. Additionally, each device deficiency category will be tabulated.  
No inferential testing will be conducted for the safety analyses .

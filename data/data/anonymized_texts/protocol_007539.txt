Detailed Title A phase IIb, randomized, placebo -controlled, single center, 
observer -blind, human- challenge study  to evaluate the 
efficacy , safety and immunogenicity  of 2 vaccinations with 
GVGH Shigella sonnei vaccine (1790GAHB) administered by  
intramuscular route in heal thy non- immune adult population .
Indication The targeted indication of the vaccine is the prevention of 
moderate to severe diarrheal disease caused b y Shigella 
sonnei (S. sonnei ).
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the study
GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) has 
developed a vaccine against S. sonnei (1790GAHB vaccine) 
using the new Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens 
(GMMA) platform technology .
The study  vaccine could be the stepping stone for the 
development of a multivalent broadl y protective Shigella 
vaccine for vaccination of impoverished communities where 
shigellosis is endemic. However, a standalone monovalent 
vaccine against S. sonnei could be used to protect travelers
against diarrheal shigellosis, as the vast majority  of travelers’
shigellosis is caused b y S. sonnei , and even to protect infants 
in endemic regions where shigellosis is primaril y caused b y 
S.sonnei .
The 1790GAHB vaccine has been tested in two Phase I dose 
escalation studies in Europe to assess its safet y and 
immunogenicit y via three routes of administration: 
intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN) and intradermal (ID). The 
results from the first study (dose escalation with IM 
vaccination) have shown that the vaccine has an acceptable 
safet y profile and is well -tolerated up to a dose of 100 µg. 
Additionally , the serologic assessment showed that one dose 
of 1.5/25 µg OAg/protein of 1790GAHB vaccine elicits 
serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti -S sonnei
lipopoly saccharide (L PS) levels ≥ 121 enzy me-linked 
immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) units/mL  (EU/mL) (i.e., 
median antibody  titerin a panel of 87 Israeli convalescent 
subjects after natural infection by  S. sonnei ). The results from 
the sec ond study  (dose escalation with ID, IN and IM 
vaccination) showed that 1790GAHB vaccine is well -
tolerated also when administered by  the ID and IN routes of 
vaccination. However, immunogenicit y data have shown that 
1790GAHB vaccine administered by  the ID and IN routes is 
not as immunogenic as 1790GAHB vaccine administered by 
the IM route.

Protocol Amendment 6 Final
23-JUL -2019 9Therefore, it has been decided to proceed with the clinical 
development program of this vaccine onl y using the IM 
vaccination route. In terms of dosage, the regimen teste d in 
Phase I studies (three doses given onemonth apart) did not 
show an y significant benefit from the third dose in terms of 
immunogenicit y, therefore a two dose schedule was selected 
for next studies. A Phase IIa stud y, conducted in endemic 
regions of Af rica (i.e., Keny a), has just been completed and 
confirmed the acceptable safet y profile and immunogenicity 
of 1790GAHB vaccine .
Performing a vaccine -human challenge study  may give the 
opportunity  to establish evidence of clinical protection 
induced b y the candidate S. sonnei vaccine (1790GAHB 
vaccine) at an earl y development stage.
Rationale for the study design
A human challenge m odel of S. sonnei disease for vaccine 
testing was established in Thailand [ Bodhidatta , 2012] and 
showed an attack rate (AR) of 75% in non -immune adult 
volunteers receiving a challenge dose of 1680 colony  forming 
units (CFU) of S. sonnei strain 53G. Clinica l and laboratory  
endpoints of infection and disease, namel y diarrhea , 
dysentery , fever and shedding of S. sonnei in stools were used 
to calculate the AR and thus to establish the optimal infective 
dose. In a subsequent study  though [ Pitisuttithum , 2016], t he 
AR in the control group, using this model, was much less than 
previously  published.
Given this variability , before starting a vaccine -challenge 
study , the proposed human challenge model of S. sonnei to be 
used has been appropriately  developed and the ch allenge dose 
and AR reliabl y established by the Cincinnati Children’s 
Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) (Ohio, United States of 
America). The current GSK vaccine -human challenge study  
will be conducted at CCHMC and will use the developed 
challenge model. Volunteers will be treated after development 
of sy mptoms of shigellosis.
Rationale for the use of placebo
As currently  there is no widely  available vaccine against 
shigellosis, the efficacy  and safet y of the 1790GAHB vaccine 
will be evaluated against a placebo. The placebo is used to 
better describe the safet y profile of the S. sonnei vaccine as 
well as its ef ficacy  in terms of clinical protection against 
shigellosis caused b y S. sonnei .

Adequate contraception: Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per y ear when 
used consistently  and correctl y and when applicable, in 
accordance with the product label for example:
Abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse, when 
this is their preferred and usual lifesty le,
Combined estrogen and progesterone oral 
contraceptives,
Injectable progestogen,
implants of etonogestrel or levonorgestrel,
Contraceptive vaginal ring,
Percutaneous contraceptive patches,
Intrauterine device or intra uterine s ystem,
Male partner sterilization prior to the female 
subject’s entry  into the study , and this male is the 
sole partner for that subject,
The information on the male sterility  can come from 
the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical 
records; or interview with the subject on her medical 
history .
Male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide 
(foam, gel, film, cream or suppository ),and/or 
progesterone alone oral contraceptive.
Adequate contraception does not apply  to subjects of 
childbeari ngpotential with same sex partners, or for 
subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from 
penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent 
basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifest yle.
Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered re lated 
to the medicinal product.
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavorable
and unintended sign (in cluding an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product. 
For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), 
abuse or misuse.

Protocol Amendment 6 Final
23-JUL -2019 35Adverse Event of Special 
Interest: Adverse events of special interest (AESIs): are predefined 
(serious or non-serious) adverse events of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the product or program, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by  
the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate, 
because such an event might warrant further investigation 
in order to characterize and understand it.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unawa re of the treatment assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, 
and only  when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level 
of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded or 
when required in case of a serious adverse event. In an 
observer -blind study , the subject and the site and sponsor 
personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
subjects are blinded while other stud y personnel may be 
aware of the treat ment assignment (see Section 6.2.3 for 
detail s on observer -blinded studies).
Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
End of Study :
(Synony m of End of Trial)For studies without collection of human biologicals 
samples or imaging data EoS is the last subject last visit 
(LSLV).
For studies with collection of Human Biologicals 
Samples or imaging data, EoS is defined as the date of the 
last testing/reading released of the Human Biological 
Samples or imaging data, related to primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. EoS must be achieved no later than 
8 months after L SLV.
Epoch: An epoch is a set of consecutive timepoints or a single 
timepoint from a single protocol. Epochs are defined to 
support a main purpose which is either to draw 
conclusions on subject participation or to draw a 
complete conclusion to define or precise the targeted 
label 
of the product. Supporting means that data collected 
at the timepoints included in an epoch must be sufficient 
to fulfil the purpose of the epoch.
Typical examples of epochs are screening, primary  
vaccinations, boosters, yearl y immunogenicity follow -
ups, a nd surveillance periods for efficacy  or safet y.
eTrack: GSK’s tracking tool for clinical trials.

23-JUL -2019 36Immunological correlate 
of protection:The defined immune response above which there is a high 
likelihood of protection in the absence of an y host factors 
that might increase susceptibility  to the infectious agent.
Investigational vaccine :
(Synony m of 
Investigational Medicinal 
Product)A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient being 
tested in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used in a way different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further inf ormation about 
an approved use.
Menarche: Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a 
young female and is preceded by  several changes 
associated with pubert y including breast development and 
pubic hair growth. Menarche usuall y occurs within 1-2 
years of breast development, thelarche. However, a y oung 
female can become pregnant before her first menses. 
Thus, a conservative definition of non- childbearing 
potential in a pre -menarcheal female is a y oung female 
who has not y et entered puberty  as evidenced by  lack of 
breast development (palpable glandular breast tissue).
Menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation 
of menstrual cy cles, menses, and implies the loss of 
reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical 
definition accepts menopa use after 1 year without menses 
with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age

Guidance for Industry  defines pharmacogenomics as 
Study  of variation of DN A and RNA characteristics as 
related to drug or treatment response. Pharmacogenetics, 
which is a subset of pharmacogenomics, is “the study  of 
variations in DNA sequence as related to drug response.” 
Pharmacogenomic biomarkers include germline (host) 
DNA an d RNA as well as somatic changes (e.g., 
mutations) that occur in cells or tissues. 
Pharmacogenomic biomarkers are not limited to human 
samples but include samples from viruses and infectious 
agents as well as animal samples. The term 
pharmacogenomic experi ment includes both the 
generation of new genetic or genomic (DNA and/or 
RNA) data with subsequent anal ysis as well as the 
analysis of existing genetic or genomic data to understand 
drug or treatment response (pharmacokinetics, safety , 
efficacy  or effective ness, mode of action). Proteomic and 
metabolomic biomarker research are not 
pharmacogenomics.

23-JUL -2019 401. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Shigellosis is a major public health problem around the world; it is one of the leading 
causes of diarrheal disease in low and middle income countries and is estimated to cause 
an all age mortalit y of 164 300 deaths every  year [GBD , 2015]. The majority  of these 
cases occur in children less than 5 y ears of age living in middle and low income 
countries. Currentl y, there are no vaccines licensed for use in these populations (except 
for China) and available interventions are under threat from the increasing rates of 
antibiotic resistance of Shigella sonnei (S. sonnei )around the world. Natural infection 
generates a seroty pe specific protective immune response against the O antigen (OAg) of 
the bacterial lipopoly saccharide (LPS) . Previousl y, S.sonnei 
and Shigella flexneri type 2a 
were selected for a prototype OAg conjugate vaccine that produced a protective efficacy  
of 70% in children three y ears of age and older. However, there was no noted efficacy  in 
children younger than three years of age, thus necessitating new approaches to vaccine 
development. Additionally, it is likely  that a multivalent OAg vaccine will be required in 
order to achieve broad protection against the 4 -6 seroty pes causing the largest burden of 
disease in young children liv ing in sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia.
Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure for information regarding the pre -
clinical and clinical studies with the 
1790GAHB vaccine andthe epidemiological 
information .
1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.2.1. Rationale for the study
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) has developed a 
vaccine against S. sonnei (1790GAHB vaccine) using the new Generalized Modules for 
Membrane Antigens (GMMA) platform technology  that in future could be also used to 
develop vaccines against other gram negative pathogens. 
The study  vaccine could be the stepping stone for the development of a multivalent 
broadly  protective Shigella vaccine for vaccination of impoverished communities where 
shigellosis is endemic. However, a standalone monovalent vaccine against S. sonnei
could be used to protect travelers against diarrheal shigellosis, as the vast majority  of 
travelers’ shigellosis is caused by  
S. sonnei , and even to protect infants in endemic 
regions where shigellosis is primarily  caused b y S. sonnei .
The 1790GAHB vaccine has been tested in two Phase I dose escalation studies in Europe 
to assess its safet y and immunogenicit y via three routes of administr ation: intramuscular 
(IM), intranasal (IN) and intradermal (ID). The results from the first study  (dose 
escalation with IM vaccination) have shown that the vaccine has an acceptable safety  
profile and is well- tolerated up to a dose of 100 µg. Additionally ,the serologic 
assessment showed that one dose of ≥ 1.5/25 µg OAg/protein of 1790GAHB vaccine 
elicits serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti
-S sonnei LPS levels ≥ 121 enzyme -linked

23-JUL -2019 41immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) units/mL (EU/mL ) (i.e., median antibody  titer in a panel 
of 87 Israeli convalescent subjects after natural infection by  
S. sonnei ). The results from 
the second stud y (dose escalation with ID, IN and IM vaccination) showed that 
1790GAHB vaccine is well- tolerated also when administered by  the ID and IN routes of 
vaccination. However, immunogenicity data have shown that 1790GAHB 
vaccine 
administered b y the ID and IN routes is not as immunogenic as 1790GAHB vaccine
administered b y the IM route. Therefore, it has been decided to proceed with the clinical 
developm ent program of this vaccine onl y using the IM vaccination route. In terms of 
dosage, the regimen tested in Phase I  studies (three doses given onemonth apart) did not 
show an y significant benefit from the third dose in terms of immunogenicity, therefore a 
two dose schedule was selected for next studies.
A Phase IIa study , conducted in endemic regions of Africa (i.e., Keny a), has just been 
completed and confirmed the acceptable safet y profile and immunogenicity of 
1790GAHB vaccine .
Performing a vaccine -human challenge study  may give the opportunity  to establish 
evidence of clinical protection induced b y the candidate S. sonnei vaccine (1790GAHB 
vaccine) at an earl y development stage.
1.2.2. Rationale for the study  design
A human challenge m odel of S. sonnei disease for vaccine testing was established in 
Thailand [Bodhidatta , 2012 ]and showed an attack rate (AR) of 75% in non -immune 
adult volunteers receiving a challenge dose of 1680 colony  forming units (CFU) of S. 
sonnei strain 53G. Clinical and laboratory  endpoints of infection and disease, namel y 
diarrhea , dysentery , fever and shedding of S. sonnei in stools were used to calculate t he 
AR and thus to establish the optimal infective dose. In a subsequent study  though 
[Pitisuttithum , 2016] , the AR in the control group, using this model, was much less than 
previously  published.
Given this variability , before starting a vaccine -challenge study , the proposed human 
challenge model of S. sonnei to be used has been appropriatel y developed and the 
challenge dose and AR reliably  established by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital 
Medical Cent er(CCHMC) (Ohio, United States of America). The current GSK vaccine -
human challenge stud y will be conducted at CCHMC and will use the developed 
challenge model. Volunteers will be treated after development of s ymptoms of 
shigellosis.
1.2.3. Rationale for the use of placebo
As currently  there is no widely  available vaccine against shigellosis, the efficacy  and 
safet y of the 1790GAHB vaccine will be evaluated against a placebo. The placebo is used 
to bet ter describe the safety  profile of the S. sonnei vaccine as well as its efficacy  in terms 
of clinical protection against shigellosis caused b y S. sonnei .

Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure for the summary  of potential risks and 
benefits of the 1790GAHB vaccine .
The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strateg y for this study  
protocol:
1.3.1. Risk assessment
Important Potential/Identified 
RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Investigational vaccine: 1790GAHB vaccine
Symptomatic Neutropenia Eight cases ofGrade 2 or Grade 3 
neutropenia were reported from 
Phase 1 clinical trials 
(asymptomatic).
All cases occurred in the first 20 
days after administration of first 
vaccine dose , and reversed after 
discontinuation.
Literature review of reports of 
neutropenia in association with 
vaccination indicates factors noted 
to be associated with neutropenia 
(including ethnicity, and low 
baseline counts) with the majority 
of cases detected wit hin 2 weeks 
of the vaccination. None of the 
reported cases was clinically 
symptomatic.
Five cases of asymptomatic 
neutropenia (Grade 1 and 2) have 
been reported at Day 7 after 
receipt of the first dose in 5 
subjects.
One of the 5 subjects had an 
additional Grade1 neutropenia 
episode at Day 28, and another 
one had two additional episodes, 
one of which was Grade 3 (940 
cells/mL) at 7 days after the 
second dose and the second was
Grade 2 (1,410 cells/mL) at 28 
days after second vaccination. All 
cases were resolved before last 
study visit.Exclusion criteria for this clinical study
include :
 Subjects with a low baseline 
neutrophil count below 1800 
cells/µL (LLN).
 Previous history of Benign Ethnic 
Neutropenia, or drug related 
Neutropenia.
 Concomitant treatment with 
neutropenic agents.
Monitoring for this clinical study to 
include:
 Baseline neutrophil counts .
 Full blood counts with differential 
measured at 7 days post each 
scheduled vaccination .
 Assessment of clinical impact of 
neutropenia .
Subjects will be clos ely monitored 
during the entire study and have 
hematology repeated every 7 days 
when neutropenia is identified until 
resolution. If a case of neutropenia does 
not resolve based on most recent 
available laboratory results, before the 
second vaccination, or challenge agent 
administration, the subject will not be re -
vaccinated or administered the 
challenge agent .

Study Procedures
Risks related to blood sample 
collectionWhen blood samples are taken 
from a vein, there is a risk of 
bruising at the site. There is a rare 
possibility of bleeding, fainting and 
infection or of nerve injury 
soreness.Safe sampling procedures will be 
applied by appropriately trained and 
qualified staff to minimize distress and 
sampling errors.
The potential risk of feeling faint, or 
experiencing mild local pain, bruising, 
irritation or redness at the site where 
blood was taken, is mentioned in the 
informed consent form. The amount of 
blood to be taken for sampling will not 
be harmful to the subject’s health.
Risk related to rectal sw abs Rectal swabs may cause 
discomfort for patients and in case 
of special conditions (e.g. 
hemorrhoids , and rectal polyps) 
bleeding might happen.Rectal swabs are only collected when it 
is not possible to obtain a stool sample. 
Study staff will instruct the subjects on 
how to do the rectal swab .
Other (c hallenge phase)
Severe and invasive diarrhea after 
challengeIllness caused by Shigella ranges 
from mild (watery diarrhea being 
the main symptom) to severe 
illness (fever and abdominal 
cramping with frequent small 
volume blood streaked stools 
containing mucus) , dehydration 
and even shock.
Perianal soreness, which is a skin 
irritation on your buttocks as a 
result of diarrhea, is possible .Administration of an effective antibiotic 
will significantly red uce, or eliminate, 
symptoms within 24 hours of initiation. 
In addition, all challenged subjects will 
receive an effective antibiotic on the 5th
day after challenge or earlier as 
required and intensive care unit is 
available to provide appropriate care in 
case of emergency.
If perianal soreness occurs, it can be 
treated with topical lotion .
Risk of bacteremia after challenge Bacteremia can occur with any 
invasive bacterial infection not 
appropriately contained with 
adequate antibacterial therapy .The S. sonnei 53G challenge strain used 
in the challenge phase is known to be 
susceptible to multiple antimicrobial 
agents including Trimethoprim -
Sulfamethoxazole ( TMP -SMX )and 
quinolones which will be used in this 
study. To ensure there is no spread of 
shigella in the environment, subject will 
be discharged only following two 
negative Shigella cultures in stools.
Reiter’s syndrome A post -dysenteric reactive arthritis, 
with ocular and/or urethral 
inflammation, which has an onset 
typically 1 to 3 weeks after the 
onset of diarrhea , has been 
reported to occur in patients with 
shigellosis.Data suggest that the risk of reactive 
arthritis following shigellosis may be 
higher in persons carrying the human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) -B27, thus the 
exclusion of subjects with a positive 
HLA-B27 test at screening.

Other (challenge phase)
Risk related to antibacterial 
therapyThere are documented side effects 
with the use of antibiotics.However ,ciprofloxacin, the antibiotic 
given to all subjects on the 5thday after 
challenge, is generally well -tolerated. 
The most frequently reported drug 
related events for all indications of 
ciprofloxacin therapy have been 
nausea, diarrhea , abnormal liver 
function tests, vomiting, and rash which 
are all mild to moderate in most cases.
The most common symptoms that 
happen after taking TMP -SMX are 
nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, skin 
rash and itching.
All subjects will be monitored closely 
and given adequate care when the need 
arises.
1.3.2. Benefit assessment
There may  not be a direct medical benefit to the subject as a result of taking part in this 
study . However, the study  vaccine may  provide protection against S. sonnei bacteria as 
well as the administered challenge agent .
The subject, b y participating in th is study  may  help provide data about the tolerability  of 
the experimental vaccine and about its ability  to stimulate the immune sy stem to produce 
antibodies against S. sonnei and provide clinical protection.
1.3.3. Overall benefit: Risk conclusion
Based on the clinical experience with 1790GAHB vaccine, tested in clinical studies, it is 
expected that 1790GAHB vaccine will also have an acceptable safet y profile in future 
clinical studies and will be associated with clinically  acceptable local and sy stemic 
reactions. In previous studies, the vaccine has shown good immunogenicity. If 
immunogenicit y will correlate to clinical protection in this proposed study, the vaccine 
will help protect the subjects who received it from shigellosis caused b y S. sonnei .
However, a similar benefit is not anticipated for subjects who will receive placebo. 
Overall, all subjects may  help in the characterization of the vaccines’ immunogenicity  
and ability  to provide protection. Administration of the challenge agent causes dis comfort 
and illness that ranges from mild (watery  diarrhea being the main sy mptom) to severe 
(fever and abdominal cramping with frequent small volume blood streaked stools 
containing mucus) diarrhea. However ,the S. sonnei 53G challenge strain used in the 
challenge phase is known to be susceptible to multiple antimicrobial agents including 
TMP- SMX and quinolones which will be used in this study  and will be given to all 
challenged subjects 5 day s after administration of the challenge agent (day 62) or earlie r 
if medically  needed. Additionally , should an y allergic reaction occur after challenge 
administration, an intensive care unit with medications is available at the study  site in 
order to treat the possible anaph ylactic/allergic reactions.

3. STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW
This study  will evaluate the efficacy , safet y and immunogenicit y of the 1790GAHB 
vaccine administered via IM route to adults (18 -50 years of age at enrolment). The 
objectives will be assessed through the conduct of the study  in two phases: a vaccination 
ph
ase with 1790GAHB vaccine or placebo followed by  a challenge phase with S. sonnei 
strain 53G.
The total of 72 subjects will be divided in 4 cohorts of 18 subjects each (for logistical 
reasons due to bed capacity  at the stud y site). The vaccination and chal lenge will be done 
in overlapping cohort s and randomization will ensure there is the same number of 
vaccines and controls in each cohort. However, if for an y reason, a cohort 
does not reach 
the planned 18 subjects, additional subjects can be added in the n extcohorts. The 
maximum number of subjects must not be more than 20 (maximum number of beds in the 
clinic) in each cohort.

23-JUL -2019 483.1. Vaccination Phase
During the screening period befo re the first vaccination (Day  -45to Day  -1), subjects 
providing informed consent will have their medical history  recorded and be scre ened for 
general health status.
Female subjects with child bearing potential must use acceptable birth control measures 
(defined as hormonal [e.g., oral, injection, transdermal patch, implant, cervical ring], 
barrier [e.g., condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide], intrauterine device, 
or be in a monogamous relationship with a partner who has been vasectomized for 6 
months or more prior to the sub ject’s stud y entr y) during the entire stud y participati on.
Refer to the glossary  of terms for the definition of adequate contraception.
At the end of the screening, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility . Onl y subjects who 
meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for 
enrolment. Following informed consent and confirmation of eligibility  according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either the stud y vaccine or the placebo. Subjects will receive two vaccinations, 28 days 
apart.
Subjects will be observed at the site for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination. All 
subjects will have their vital signs (temperature, heart rate, sitting blood pressure )taken
before vaccination and at the end of the observation period to ensure they  are stable 
before they  go home. Subjects will be provided with a diary  card and will be trained on 
how to fill it in. Subjects will be reminded before they  go home of the importance of 
filling the diary  card and a phone call will be performed by  the site staff to the subjects at 
2 and 6 day s following each vaccination t o remind them that the diary  card should be 
completed (no update on the status of the subject’s health will be solicited during these 
phone calls, as they  are not intended for safet y data collection) and of the clinical visit at 
7 day s after each vaccinati
on. The diary  card will be used to collect all solicited and 
unsolicited AEs, and medications for the first 7 day s after each vaccination starting 6 
hours after the administration of the vaccine /placebo . At 7 day s following each 
vaccination and until 28 days after vaccination, only  unsolicited AEs, solicited adverse 
reactions that continue at the 7thday, and related medications will be collected during 
visits at the study  site. Any  AE reported in the diary  card bey ond the 7thday will be 
followed up accordingl y and the frequency  of the follow -up will depend on its nature.
Prior to each vaccination, subjects will be assessed through their medical history  since the 
last visit and phy sical examination to check if continued participation in the study  is in 
their best interest and that there are no contraindications for vaccination (e.g. fever or 
acute illness on the day  of vaccination). Subjects will also be evaluated for continued 
eligibility  with regard to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Vaccination wi ll only  take 
place after the subjects’ medical history , clinical examination and evaluation of inclusion 
and exclusion criteria confirm his/her continuous eligibility . Investigator judgment will 
also apply  to evaluate subjects’ continued eligibility  in the study . Subjects will be 
encouraged to visit the study  clinic or call the study  staff if they  have fever or are unwell 
between planned visits. This, depending on the nature, may  prompt an unscheduled visit 
by a stud y physician. Any  Grade 3 or more reaction after vaccination may  also prompt a 
review b y a stud y physician at the study  clinic.

23-JUL -2019 493.2. Challenge Phase
Four weeks after completion of the two -dose vaccination schedule (approximately  28 
days after Visit 3) subjects will be admitted the day before the challe nge date (Day  56) 
and will stay  for 9days in the inpatient unit. Biological sample collection could start for 
logistical reason at Day  56 (the day  of admission before challenge). The day of challenge 
(Visit 5; Day  57), they  will be administered a 1500 CFU challenge dose of S. sonnei 53G. 
Before receiving the challenge, all inclusion and exclusion criteria and hematology will 
be assessed .
When assessing inclusion and exclusion criteria, the investigator will also inquire about
antibiotic treatment during the week prior to the challenge date. Any  subject who had a 
course of antibiotic the week prior to challenge, will not receive the challenge agent.
Subjects will fast for 90 minutes prior to receiving the S. sonnei 53G challenge inoculum 
and an additional 90 minutes after challenge. All subjects in the same cohort will be 
challenged in the same day  using the same inoculum, which will ensure the consistency  
of the dose used. Approximately  5 minutes before drinking the challenge suspension, the 
subject will d
rink a 120 mL  solution of sodium bicarbonate to neutralize gastric acidit y. 
A subject with fever or signs of acute illness will not receive the challenge agent and an y 
subject who vomits following ingestion of the challenge agent will not be re -dosed. A 
note will be made in the subject source documents regarding the apparent amount of the 
vomitus (small, moderate or large). The subject will still continue in the study  and 
undergo all study -related procedures
. Care will be taken to ensure that a minimum 
amou
nt of time, not to exceed 2 hours, is spent between the reconstitution of the 
challenge inoculum and the oral administration o f the inoculum to the subject.
Two mL  of the inoculum will be retained for pre- and post -challenge quantification of the 
dose. Ali quots of the retained inoculum will be streaked onto try pticase soy agar (TSA) 
plates and after incubation, average number of colonies on the TSA plates will be 
counted and CFU/mL  will be calculated. Study  staff will take all necessary precaution 
needed fo r handling of S. sonnei 53G and adhere to the CCHMC policy  and procedures.
During thefirst 8 days in the inpatient unit (Day  57 to Day  64) following challenge,
subjects will be monitored daily  for AEs, gastrointestinal or other s ystemic signs and 
symptoms. Subjects will be assessed for vital signs (including sitting blood pressure, 
temperature and pulse rate) according to local standards for inpatient care. Stoo l analy sis 
will be carried out daily  during the inpatient stay . All stools will be collected and visually  
assessed for consistency, blood or mucus. Stools that are loose or watery  (grades 3- 5) will 
be weighed, and if there is visible blood, a 
Hemoccult test will be performed to confirm 
presence of occult blood. Up to two stools with blood present b y visual inspection in a 24 
hour period will be tested by  Hemoccult . Study  staff will record the information in the 
subject’s source document. I f a subject is una ble to produce a stool by  midnight, a rectal 
swab will be obtained (up to 2 adequatel y collected swabs per day ). Study  staff will 
record the information in the subject’s source document. The first stool sample collected 
during a 24 hour period on the day  after challenge agent administration (from 00:01 to 
24:00) will be anal yzedby culture and quantitative poly merase chain reaction (qPCR) 
specific for S. sonnei 53G. The day  before discharge (Day  64), two stool samples will be 
collected to confirm that the s ubject is no longer shedding. Instructions for appropriate

investigators. For diarrhea episodes to be considered as separate episodes, there should be 
at least a 6 -hour interva l between them (refer to Section 4for details on stool grading) .
On the 5thday after challenge (Day  62), subjects will receive as first -line treatment
500mg of ciprofloxacin twice dail y for 3 days. Subjects with contraindic ation to 
ciprofloxacin may  receive as second -line treatment trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole 
(160 mg/800 mg twice daily ), amoxicillin (500 mg three times dail y)for 5 day s, orany 
antibiotic that is deemed suitable according to local guidelines and the invest igator’s 
assessment can be used.
Subjects may  be treated with antibiotics before the 5thdayafter challenge (Day  62)if:
They  have diarrhea (any severit y stool Grade 3 or higher) andtwo or more of the 
following s ymptoms: severe abdominal pain/cramps, severe nausea, severe 
headache, severe m yalgia, severe arthralgia, gross blood in  2 stools, any fever 
(38.0ºC measured orally), or an y vomiting.
They  experience unexpectedly  severe e vents such as hy potension (disproportionate 
to volume loss), renal d ysfunction, or altered mental state (e.g. somnolence) at the 
discretion of the investigators.
A study  physician determines earl y treatment is warranted for other reasons.
A subject receivi ng early antibiotic treatment will still remain on the unit until the 
planned day  of discharge (the 9thdayof inpatient stay : Day  65). On thatday, if a subject 
isclinically  well and ha shad at least 2 negative stool cultures, collected at least 6 hours 
apart, for S. sonnei , s/he will be discharged. A subject that, on the planned day  of 
discharge, still ha dS. sonnei isolated from the Day 64 stools will be asked to remain in 
the unit unti l s/he is no longer shedding. A subject still shedding 48 hours after initiation 
of ciprofloxacin will be switched to a Septra DS (1 tablet twice a day for five day s). If a 
subject is still positive 48 hours after the second -line antibiotic is administered
, a culture 
and antibiotic sensitivity  test will be obtained and therapy  initiated based on sensitivity
results. If a subject has two consecutive negative stool samples and is eligible to be 
discharged from the inpatient stay  but did not finish his treatme nt course, s/he can be 
given the remaining doses to complete at home.
Following discharge, subjects will return at 28 days (Visit 6), 56 days (Visit 7) and 6 
months (Visit 8) after challenge for outpatient clinical assessment. During these visits, 
clinical assessment will be done to assess their general health status and find out about 
the occurrence of AESI, any  AE and SAE. 
Subjects will be advised at the time of their discharge to contact the stud y staff/doctor if 
they feel unwell. The subjects will be f ollowed up until 6 months after the challenge. At 
the last study  visit, at 6 months after challenge, the subject will be reviewed for the 
occurrence of an y AESI and the site staff will ensure all AEs are resolved.
Through the entire stud y, all subjects wil l be advised to report to the stud y facility 
whenever they  are sick. Standard patient care, according to local guidelines will be 
provided for all illnesses in both the outpatient and inpatient facilities. Additional 
investigations may  be conducted if the investigator considers them necessary  to better 
evaluate the subject’s condition. An overview of the study  design is given in Figure 1.

23-JUL -2019 61GSK will provide full details of the above procedures to the investigator, either verbally , 
in writing, or both.
Freely  given and written informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to 
participation in the study . 
GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Informed Consent F orm (ICF) which will embody  
the ICH GCP and GSK Biologicals required elements. While it is strongly  recommended 
that this model I CF is to be followed as closely  as possible, the informed consent 
requirements given in this document are not intended to pre-e mpt any  local regulations 
which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y 
effective. Clinical judgment, local regulations and requirements should guide the final 
structure and content of the local version of the ICF.
The investigator has the final responsibility for the final presentation of the ICF, 
respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF generated b y the 
investigator with the assistance of the sponsor’s representative must be acceptable t o 
GSK Biologicals and be approved (along with the protocol, and an y other necessary  
documentation) b y the IRB/IEC.
6.2. Subject identification and randomization
6.2.1. Subject identification
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially  to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to the study  center .
6.2.2. Randomization of treatment
6.2.2.1. Randomization of supplies
The randomization of supplies for the Vaccination Phase (1790GAHB vaccine and 
placebo) within blocks will be performed by the study biostatistician or delegate . Entire 
blocks will be shipped to the study  
center .No randomization will be done for the 
challenge phase .
6.2.2.2. Treatment allocati on to the subject
The treatment numbe rs will be allocated b y dose.Throughout the stud y, a single 
treatment number will identify  each dose to be administered to each randomized subject.
6.2.2.2.1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target will be to enroll approximately  72eligible subjects who will be randomly  
assigned to 
two study  groups in a 1: 1 ratio (approximately  36subjects in each group).

Protocol Amendment 6Final
23-JUL -2019 62Subjects will be enrolled in 4 overlapping cohorts of 18 subjects each, for logistical 
reasons at the clinical site, therefore a 1:1 ratio should be maintained at the cohort level.
However, if for an y reason, a cohort does not reach the planned 18 subjects, additional 
subjects can be added in the next cohorts. The maximum number of subjects must not be 
more than 20 (maximum number of beds in the clinic) in each cohort.
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
the Source DataBase for Internet Randomization system (SBIR). The randomization 
algorithm might use a minimization procedure; more details are provided in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan.
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF from the subject and having checked the
eligibility  of the subject, the site staff in charge of the vaccine/placebo administration will 
access SBIR. Upon providing the subject identification number, the randomization
system will determine the study  group and will provide the treatment number to be used 
for each dose.
A randomization blocking scheme (1:1 ratio) will be used to ensure the balance between 
treatments is maintained, accounting also for the enrolment cohorts: same number of 
vaccine and control recipients in each cohort.
The number of each administered treatment m ust be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
When SBI R is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the Study  Procedures 
Manual (SPM) for specific instructions.
6.2.3. Allocation of subjects to assay  subsets
Leftover serum samples collected at Day  1 and 28 day s after second vaccination for the 
antibody  response analy sis will be used for the Fc gl ycosylation test (immunological tests 
mentioned in the tertiary  objectives) that will be performed at Rockefeller University  (see 
Appendix B).
6.3. Method of blinding
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By  observer-
blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study , the va ccine /placebo recipient and those responsible for the 
evaluation of an y stud y endpoint (e.g. safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity  and 
efficacy ) will be unaware of which vaccine (stud y vaccine or placebo) was administered. 
To do so, vaccine /placebo prepar ation and administration will be done by  authorized
medical personnel who will not participate in any  of the study  clinical evaluation assay s.
The laboratories in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the treatment , 
subject and visit number , and codes will be used to link the subject , visit and study
(without any  link to the treatment attributed to the subject) to each sample.

Please refer to the SPM and I nvestigator Manual for details on biospecimen management 
(handling, storage and shipment).
Samples stored at the clinical site or shipped to exte rnal laboratories will not be labelled 
with information that directly identifies the subject but will be coded with a unique 
sample identifier .Samples anal yzed locall y (e.g., safet y lab samples) would have a label 
with the subject’s identifiers and medica l record number.
Collected samples will be used for protocol- mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, development and quality  assurance of the laboratory  tests 
described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality  of these 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects will be asked to give a specific consent to allow GSK or a contracted 
partner to use the samples for future research. Future research will be subject to the 
laws and regulations in the respective countries and will only  be performed once an 
independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has approved this research.
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from GSK 
Biologicals.
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject .
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform an y other biological assay s except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s). 
If additional testing is performed, th e marker priority  ranking given in Section 6.7.4 may 
be changed.
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 years (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study  visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall yto and discussed 
and agreed with GSK Biologicals.

Note that hematology data post vaccination/c hallenge will be transferred from the study  
laboratory  performing the testing into the clinical database as soon as possible to ensure 
that all necessary  information are available for IDMC reviews. In addition, results will be 
communicated as soon as possible to the investigators via lab repor ts, hard copies, faxes 
or emails.
Microbiome anal ysis in stool will be done using 16s ribosomal deox yribonucleic acid 
(DNA) amplicon sequencing and/or shotgun whole genome sequencing. These will use 
DNA sequencing to identify  the bacteria and their genes p resent in the sample to explore 
associations to immunogenicity and challenge outcome. Shotgun sequencing might 
generate subject’s DNA sequence information; however, these sequences are filtered out 
and will not be analyzed. Depending on the results of the microbiome analysis, additional 
follow -up studies might include microbiome gene expression profiling ( ribonucleic acid
sequencing or another method), culture and functional characterization of the bacteria in 
the sample in animal models.
Fecal markers of i ntestinal inflammation will be meas ured as a sensitive predictor for 
inflammatory  activities in the gastrointestinal tract. This analy sis willassess if 
concentrations of inflammatory  markers such as calprotectin and m yeloperoxidase will 
increase after oral challenge with S. sonnei 53G andwill additionally  investigate if the S. 
sonnei 1790GAH Bvaccine canreduce or abrogate the inflammatory  response in the 
intestine after oral challenge .
Gene expression will be studied using high -throughput techno logies (including but not 
limited to RNAseq or microarray s) measuring the relative abundance of RNA molecules 
in PBMCs harvested at several timepoints following vaccination and challenge. 
Computational analy sis will subsequently  identify  pathway s and biolo gical themes 
associated with vaccination and acute disease and transcriptional patterns may  be related 
to metadata including humoral and cellular responses to vaccination.

6.7.5. Immunological correlates of protection
No generally  accepted immunological correlate of protection has been demonstrated so 
far for Shigellosis and consequently  for the candidate vaccine. However, in GVGH Phase 
I clinical protocols a high seroresponse was defined as a post- vaccination level of 
121serum IgG E U/mL against the S. sonnei OAg containing LPS used as coating 
antigen in GVGH ELISA. This concentration corresponds to a titer of 1:800 in the 
ELISA method published by  Cohen [ Cohen, 1989] and is the median antibody  
concentration of a set of 87 Israeli convalescent subjects previously  exposed to S. sonnei . 
The value of 121 E U/mL in the GVGH ELISA (anti-S. sonnei LPS IgG -ELIS A)has been 
determined b y calibration against the Cohen ELISA (i.e., the GVGH standard serum was 
tested in Cohen’s lab using the Cohen’s methodology ) [Gerke , 2015].
The availability  of this threshold has allowed GVGH to correlate the immunogenicity  
data induced b y 1790GAHB vaccine with antibody  levels after natural exposure in 
humans, which are associated with clinical protection from subsequent infections with the 
same Shigella serot ype [ Cohen
, 1991; Ferreccio, 1991]. To confirm the proof of concept 
outcome of GVGH Phase I studies (post -immunization median antibody  titer in vaccinees 
121 EU/mL ), as part of the objectives of this study , any potential correlation between 
antibody  response (ELISA and SBA) after vaccination and likelihood of infection will be 
evaluated. Additionall y, potential correlation between antibod y response by  ELISA and 
serum bactericidal activity  will be explored. Further correlat ion can be established post -
challenge.

the non -dominant arm, an inject ion in the dominant arm may be performed.
Precautions to be observed in administering study vaccine/placebo or challenge 
agent:
Prior to administration of the vaccine/placebo or challenge agent, subjects must be 
determined to be eligible and it must be clinically  appropriate in the judgment of the 
investigator to vaccinate/challenge. Eligibility  for vaccination/challenge is determined by  
evaluating the entry  criteria outlined in p rotocol Sections 5.2, 5.3, 6.6.11 and 6.6.12.
Study  vaccine/placebo or challenge agent should not be administered to individuals with 
known hy persensitivity  to any  component of the vaccine/placebo or challenge agent. 
Standard immunization practices are to be observed and care should be taken to 
administer the vaccine/p lacebo intramuscularl y. Before administering vaccine/p lacebo , 
the vaccination 
site is to be disinfected with a skin disinfectant (e.g., 70% alcohol). Allow 
the skin to dry . DO NOT inject intravascularly.
As with all injectable vaccines/products , trained medical personnel and appropriate 
medical treatment should be readil y available in case of anaphy lactic reactions following 
vaccine /placebo administration. For example, epinephrine 1:1000, diphenhy dramine, 
and/or other medications for treating anaph ylaxis should be available.

The investigator will use SBI R to obtain the replacement vial number. The replacement 
numbers will be allocated by  dose . The sy stem will ensure, in a blinded manner that the 
replacement vial matches the formulation the subject was assigned to by  randomization .
7.5. Contraindications to subsequent vaccination or challenge
Eligibility  to administration of a second dose of the vaccine and challenge agent should 
be reconfirmed. The following events constitute absolute contraindications to further 
administration of 1790GAHB vaccine or the placebo and the challenge agent. If an yof 
these events occur during the study , the subject must not receive additional doses of 
vaccine/placebo and challenge agent but may  continue other study  procedures at the 
discretion of the investigator (see Section 9.5).
Anaph ylaxis following the administration of vaccine /placebo .
Pregnancy  (see Section 9.2.1).
Hepatomegal y, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness.
Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, 
including, HIV infection.
Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intra muscular 
injection unsafe.
The following event sconstitute contraindications to administration of 1790GAHB 
vaccine or the challenge agent at that point in time; if any of these event soccur at the 
time scheduled for vaccination, the subject may  be vaccinated at a later date, within the 
time window specified in the protocol (see Section 6.5), or the subject may  be withdrawn 
at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 9.5
):
Neutropenia below 1800 cell/µL (LLN ) based on most recent available laboratory  
results. Subjects with previous neutropenia or unresolved neutropenia may be re -
evaluated prior to vaccination or prior to challenge at the discretion of the 
investigator .
Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccina tion.
Fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C / 100.4°F. 
The preferred location for 
measuring temperature in this study  will be the oral cavity .
Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory 
infection) without fever can be administered vaccine/placebo and challenge 
agent.

The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and 
reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE ) as provided in this protocol.
Each subject will be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should they /the 
subject manifest an y signs or sy mptoms they  perceive as serious.
9.1. Safet y definitions
9.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal pr oduct. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. ,lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Examples of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
incre ase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccine/p
lacebo administration 
even though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspe cted interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study
vaccine/placebo or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported 
as an AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study vaccine/placebo.
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Secti on 9.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. ,endoscop y, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. ,social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).

or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the

of the eCRF.
9.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life
-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ,
Note: I n general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency  ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalization are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospitalization ’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences

23-JUL -2019 879.1.3. Solicited adverse events
The term “reactogenicit y” refers to solicited signs and symptoms (“solicited AEs”) 
occurring in the hours and day s following a vaccination, to be collected b y the subjects
for 7consecutive day s, using a pre defined Subject Diary .
The study  staff must review the data entered into the Subject Diary  as described in 
Section 12.2.
Note: Any  solicited AEthat meets an y of the following criteria must be entered into 
subjects’ source document (see Section 12.2) and also as an AEon the Adverse Event 
CRF:
Solicited local or sy stemic AEthat continues bey ond day  7 after vaccination .
Solicited local or sy stemic AEthat leads to a visit to a healthcare provider (medically  
attended AE, see Section 9.3.3.4).
Solicited local or sy stemic AEleading to the subject withdrawing from the study  or 
the subject being withdrawn from the stud y by the investigator ( AEleading to 
withdrawal).
Solicited local or sy stemic AEthat otherwise meets the definition of a SAE (see 
Section 9.1.2).
Solicited AEs after vaccination are included in the Subject Diary . Each AE is to be 
assessed using the scoring s ystemreported in Section 9.3.3.2.1 .
9.1.3.1. Solicited local A dverse events
The following local (injection site) AEs will be solicited:

During the challenge phase after the subjects have received the challenge agent, events 
associated with the administration of the challenge agent will be collected and recorded 
by the investigator in the CRF .These events include diarrhea , abdominal pain, abdominal 
cramps, gas, anorexia, nausea, headache, my algia, malaise, arthralgia, fever, and 
vomiting beginning the day  of administration of study  challenge agent until 7days after 
chall enge (i.e., Day 64). Any  unresolved events will be followed to resolution or 
stabilization. Oral rehydration will be initiated and recorded for subjects with a Grade 2 
or higher AE of diarrhea, vomiting, dy sentery  or dehy dration. The hy dration of subjects 
developing diarrhea will be maintained with oral electroly te solutions by offering at least 
1.5 mL  for each gram of diarrheal stool lost, as tolerated. Subjects who develop vomiting 
will be offered at least 1.0 mL  for each gram of emesis lost, as tolerated. Subjects will be 
evaluated b y a physician who will consider intravenous hy dration for subjects who:
Cannot tolerate oral fluids,
Experience fluids loss that exceeds their ability  to drink replacement fluids,
Have > 1000 mL deficit in intake in a 24 hour period,
Experience weight loss of more than 5%,
Have urine specific gravity  >1.030 for 12 hours,
Have s yncope or near -syncope,
Grade 3 tach ycardia, or
Grade 3 h ypotension.
If the subject is unable to tolerate fluids b y mouth and intravenous fluids are dee med 
necessary  by the assessing ph ysician, a 0.9% sterile saline solution 1 -liter bolus will be 
administered intravenously . This bolus will be repeated as needed to resolve Grade 2 and 
above s ymptoms at the discretion of assessing ph ysician. Fluid maintenan ce will be 
continued using 0.45% NaCl, 5% dextrose, and 20 mEq KCL
 per liter at a rate of 
100mL/hour until subject is able to resume oral rehy dration. If the subject develops 
grade 4 h ypotension despite the aggressive fluid management, the subject will be
transferred from the inpatient unit to a hospital setting.
9.1.4. Unsolicited A dverse Events
An unsolicited AEis an AE that was not solicited using a Subject Diary  and that was 
spontaneously  communicated by  a subject who has signed the informed consent or a 
solicited local or sy stemic AE that continues bey ond the solicited period at day  7after 
vaccination .
Potential unsolicited AEs may  be medicall y attended (defined as s ymptoms or illnesses 
requiring hospitalization, or emergency  room visit, or visit t o/by a health care provider), 
or were of concern to the subjects. In case of such events, subjects will be instructed to 
contact the site as soon as possible to report the event(s). The detailed information about 
the reported unsolicited AEs will be collec ted b y the qualified site personnel during the 
interview and will be documented in the subject’s records.

Unsolicited AEs will be collected until 28 day s after each vaccination and until 28 day s 
after challenge .
9.1.5. Clinical laboratory  parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualify ing as adverse events or seri ous adverse events
In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory  findings (e.g., clinical chemistry , 
hematology , urinaly sis) or other abnormal assessments that are judged by the investigator 
to be clinically  significant will be recorded as AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an 
AE or SAE (refer to Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2). Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  
findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantly  
worsen following the start of the study  will a lso be reported as AEs or SAEs.
The investigat or will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically  
significant. Clinicall y significant modifications in hematology will be assessed by  
medical judgment b ased on interpretation of deviations from institution’s normal values 
and recommendations from CBER FDA GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY: Toxicity  
Grading Scale for Healthy Adults and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Trials and predefined list of sign and sy mptoms related to neutropenia.
9.1.6. Adverse events of special interest
Adverse eve nts of special interest (AESIs) are predefined (serious or non -serious) AEs of 
scientific and medical concern specific to the product or program, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication by  the investigator to t
he sponsor can be 
appropriate, because s uch an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.
During the two Phase I studies with the study vaccine, n o SAE were reported. Two 
subjects of African descent experienced a transient and clinically  asymptomatic Grade 3 
neutropenia (the two episodes were graded as SAEs ) that was finall y classified as 
“benign ethnic neutropenia ”. In addition to these two Grade 3 cases (one in each stud y), a 
total of 6 cases of transient and clinically  asymptomatic Grade 2 neutropenia ( onecase in 
H03_01TP and 5 cases in H03_02TP) has been reported. GVGH has defined neutropenia 
as AESI. In the phase 2 study  in endemic population, 
there have been 10 cases of 
neutropenia from 6 subjects of which one was severe, three moderate and 6 mild. All of 
these events were clinically  asymptomatic.
During the course of this study , symptomatic neutropenia will be considered as AESI s.

symptomaticall y. This is completely diagnosed b ylaboratory  testing for complete blood 
count. However , only symptomatic neutropenia cases will be considered as AESI  and 
reported as such.
The following grading will be used to classify  neutropenia :
Grade 1: 1800 -1500 cells/ µL.
Grade 2: 1499- 1000 cells/ µL.
Grade 3: 999- 500 cells/ µL.
Grade 4: < 500 cells/ µL.
In performing their assessment of sy mptomatic neutropenia cases, investigators are 
strongl y advised to use the table below.

In order to facilitate the documentation of AESI in the eCRF, a list of MedDRA preferred 
terms (PTs) andPT codes corresponding to the above diagnoses will be available to 
investigators at stud y start.
When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as AESI. Sy mptoms, signs or conditions which might (or might not) re present 
the above diagnoses, should be recorded and reported as AEs but not as AESI  until the 
final or definitive diagnosis has been determined, and alternative diagnoses have been 
eliminated or shown to be less likely .

9.2.1. Pregnancy
Female subjects who become pregnant before the 2ndvaccination and before the 
challenge must not receive additional doses of study  vaccine/placebo, nor the challenge 
agent, but may  continue other study  procedures at the discretion of the investigator.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any  adverse pregnancy  outcome 
or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy  for medical reasons will be 
recorded and reported as an AE or a SAE.
Note: The pregnancy  itself should alway s be recorded on an electronic pregnancy  report.
The following should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in 
Sections 
9.4.1 and 9.4.3:
Spontaneous pregnancy  loss, including:
Spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy  loss before/at 22 weeks of 
gestation)
Ectopic and molar pregnancy
Stillbirth (intrauterine death of fetus after 22 weeks of gestation).
Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the 
EMA Guideline on pregnancy  exposure [ EMA , 2006 ].It is recognized that national 
regulations might be different.
Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 
days of life). 
Any congenital anomal y or birth defect (as per [ CDC MACDP ] guidelines) 
identified in the offspring of a study  subject (either during pregnancy , at birth or 
later) regardless of whether the fetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes 
anomalies ide ntified b y prenatal ultrasound, amniocentesis or examination of the 
products of conception after elective or spontaneous abortion.
Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy  AND considered 
by the investigator to be reasonabl y rela ted to the study vaccine/placebo or challenge 
agent will be reported to GSK Biologicals as described in Section 9.4.3. While the 
investigator is no t obligated to activel y seek this information from former study  
participants, he/she may  learn of a pregnancy  through spontaneous reporting.

All AEs starting within 28days following administration of each dose of study  
vaccine/ placebo (day of vaccine/p lacebo administration to 28 day s after administration )
and c hallenge agent administration must be recorded into the appropriate section of the 
eCRF, irrespective of intensity  or whether or not they  are considered vaccination -related.
The time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at the first receipt of study  
vaccine/placebo and will end at the conclusion of the study  for each subject. See Section 
9.4for instructions on reporting of SAEs.
In add ition to the above -mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil 
international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study  participation (i.e. 
protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy ) or are 
related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine will be collected and recorded from the 
time the subject consents to participate in the study until she/he is discharged from the 
study .
The time period for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin at the first receipt of 
study  vaccine/placebo and will end at the conclusion of the study . See Section 9.4for 
instructions on reporting of pregnancies.
The time period for collecting and recording of AESI s will begin at the first receipt of

23-JUL -2019 949.3.2. Post -study adverse events and serious adverse events
A post -study  AE/SAE is defined as any  event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting period defined in Table 19. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs 
or SAEs in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE at 
any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to t he study vaccine/placebo or challenge agent , the investigator 
will promptly  notify  the Study  Contact for Reporting SAEs.
9.3.3. Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events
9.3.3.1. Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse 
events
As a con sistent method of collecting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as:
‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine/placebo or since the 
previous visit? ’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the inves tigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory  and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the 
subject’s medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the
eCRF . However, there may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases 
are requested b y GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded 
on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such ca ses, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.

The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment 
will be based on the in vestigator’s clinical judgment.
Every  effort should be made by  the investigator to evaluate safet y information reported 
by a subject for an underly ing diagnosis and to capture this diagnosis as the event in the 
AE page. In other words, the practice of reporting only  symptoms (e.g., “cough” or “ear 
pain”) are better reported according to the underl ying cause (e.g., “asthma exacerbation” 
or “otitis media”).

9.3.3.2.2. Assessment of causality
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study  vaccine/placebo or challenge agent will be considered and investigated. The 
invest igator will also consult the IB to determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK Biologicals. The 
investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up information and 
update the SA E information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
All solicited reactions will be considered causall y related to vaccination or challenge. 
Causality  of all other AEs should be assessed b y the investigator using the following 
question:
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study
vaccine/placebo or challenge agent ?
YES: There is a reasonable possibility  that the study  vaccine/placebo or challenge 
agent contributed to the AE. 
NO: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to the 
administration of the study  vaccine/placebo or challenge agent. There are 
other, more likel y causes and administration of the study vaccine/placebo or 
challenge agent is not suspected to have contributed to the AE.
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 9.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical history .
Other medication.

9.4.7. Regulatory  reporting requirements for serious adverse events
The investigator will promptly  report all SAEs to GSK in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 9.4.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility  to promptly  notify , 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory  authorit y and other regulatory  agencies about the 
safet y of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by  the 
investigator to the Stud y Contact for Report ing SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of other subjects are met.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy  and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator safet y report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccine/placebo or challenge agent and 
unexpected. The purpose of the report is to fulfil specific regulatory  and GCP 
requirements, regarding the product under investiga tion.

The investigator will follow subjects:
With SAEs, AESI s (serious or non- serious), or subjects withdrawn from the study  as 
a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilized , disappeared, or 
until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up.
With other non- serious neutropenia cases, until the event is otherwise explained or 
they are lost to follow -up.
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to GSK Biologicals u sing a paper/ electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy  report as applicable.
GSK Biologicals may  request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as f ully as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. I f a 
subject dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized follow -up period, 
GSK Biologicals will be provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology .
9.5.2. Follow -up of pregnancies
Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . At the end 
of the pregnancy , whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother 
and child wil l be forwarded to GSK Biologicals using the electronic pregnancy  report and 
the Expedited Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generall y, the follow -up period 
doesn’t need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery .
Regardles s of the reporting period for SAEs for this study , if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it should alway s be reported as SAE.
9.6. Treatment of adverse events
Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical p ractice. A ny medication admi nistered for the treatment of a SAE /AESI s 
should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject’s eCRF (refer to 
Section 7.6).
9.7. Unblinding
GSK Biologicals’ policy  (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial 
Directive and US Federal Regulations) is to unblind the report of an y SAE which is 
unexpected and at tributable/suspected to be attributable to the study  vaccine/p lacebo or 
challenge agent , prior to regulatory  reporting. The GSK Biologicals’ Central Safet y 
Physician is responsible for unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with the 
specified ti meframes for expedited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 9.4.1 ).

Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in the case of a 
medical emergency, or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged by the investigator.
The emergency unblinding process consists of an automated system SBIR that allows the 
investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to the subject’s individual study treatment.
The investigator has the option of contacting a GSK Biologicals’ On-call Central Safety 
Physician (or Backup) if he/she needs medical advice or needs the support of GSK to perform the unblinding (i.e. he/she cannot access the automated Internet-based system).
Any emergency unblinding must be fully documented by using the Emergency 
Unblinding Documentation Form, which must be appropriately completed by the investigator and sent within 24 hours to GSK Biologicals.

9.9. Subject card
Study subjects must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main contact for information about the clinical study.
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each subject. In 
an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible attending physician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant information may be obtained by contacting the investigator.
Subjects must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at all times during 
the study duration.

occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for
scheduled visits or follow -up.
Information rela tive to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y 
the subject himself/herself, or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reas ons was responsible for withdrawal:
Serious adverse event.
Unsolicited non- serious adverse event.
Solicited adverse event

investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified by  the 
subject, in the eCRF .
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study  because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study  as result of a SAE/AE until resolution 
of the event (see Section 9.5.1.2

23-JUL -2019 10911.4. Determination of sample size
Primary objective -Efficacy
In comparing the protective efficacy  of 1790GAHB vaccine against the placebo group the 
following assumptions will be made:
Assuming a true VE of 70%, a t otal number of 21 confirmed cases will be needed to 
demonstrate that the LL of the two -sided 90% CI for the VE is above 0% with 80% 
power (by Pass 2013, One Proportion Power Analysis, one -sided test, one -sided alpha =
5%).
Based on the results obtained by  the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center , 
where the challenge model was developed, in subjects receiving a challenge with 1500 
CFU of S. sonnei 53G, the attack rate for the primary  case definition of this study  is 58%.
Thus considering an AR of 58% in the placebo group and a percentage of non -evaluable 
subjects of 22%, approximately  72 subjects (36 per group) will be recruited to reach these 
21 cases.
The assumption on the value of true VE is based on the percentage of subjects with 
seroresponse observed in previous studies where the 1.5/25 µg OAg/protein dose of 
1790GAHB vaccine was evaluated. In the phase I study  in Europe, the observed 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse was 63% and 88% after 1stand 2ndvaccination 
respectivel y. In the P hase IIa stud y, conducted in endemic region, the observed 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse was 68% and 90% after 1stand 2ndvaccination ,
respectivel y.

11.5.7. Sub-groups
The analysis for the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be repeated for the two subgroups of 
subjects who were responders or non- responders at the immunogenicit y assessment of the 
pre-challenge visit .
11.6. Derived and transformed data
Screening (anti S. sonnei LPS IgG Screening -ELISA)
The cut -off value for the anti S. sonnei LPS IgG Screening- ELISA is defined by  
the laboratory .
A seronegative subject is a subject whose titeris below the cut -off value.
A seropositive subject is a subject whose titeris greater than or equal to the cut -
off value.
Immunogenicit y (anti S. sonnei LPS IgG -ELISA) :
The cut -off value for the anti S. sonnei LPS IgG-ELISA is defined by  the 
laboratory .
Seroresponse is aimed to define a significant increase in anti S.sonnei LPSIgG 
concentration in post- vaccination samples and relies on the definition already  used in 
a previous phase II study in Keny an population . For the purpose of this study  
seroresponse is defined as:
If the baseline value is greater than 50 EU/mL  then an increase of at least 50% 
in the post -vaccination sample as compared to baseline.
If the baseline value is less or equal to 50 EU/mL  then an increase of at least 
25EU/mL  in the post -vaccination sample as compared to baseline.
Note: Threshold values/increas es given in the definition of seroresponse might be 
subject to change during the course of the study  (e.g., in case of 
optimization /qualification/validation of the anti S. sonnei LPSIgGELISA).
The GMC calculations are performed by  taking the anti -log of the mean of the 
log concentration transformations. Values to be used for the antibody  
concentrations below the assay  cut-off will be described in the S tatistical 
Analy sis Plan (SAP).
Handling of missing data: for a given subject and a given immunogenicity  
measurement, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not be replaced.

Handling of missing data: subjects who missed reporting s ymptoms 
(solicited/unsolicited or concomitant medications) will be treated as subjects 
without symptoms (solicited/unsolicited or concomitant medications, 
respectivel y). In case of significant non -compliance of study  procedures for 
reporting s ymptoms, the anal ysis plan will be reassessed to ensure more accurate 
reporting of stud y data by further ana lysis.
For the anal ysis of solicited sy mptom, missing or non -evaluable measurements 
will not be replaced. Therefore, the analy sis of the solicited sy mptoms based on 
theAll Enrolled Set will include only  subjects/doses with documented safety  
data (i.e., symptom screen completed).
11.7. Analysis of demographics
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for 
age, height and weight at enrolment will be calculated overall and by  vaccine /placebo 
group.
Distributions of subjects b y gender and geographic ancestry  will be summarized .
11.8. Analysis of efficacy
VE will be evaluated at the end of stud y period. VE will be estimated as 1 -RR where RR 
is the risk ratio (proportion of subjects reporting the disease in the vaccinated group over 
the proportion in the placebo group) together with 90% CI s.
11.9. Analysis of immunogenicity
Analysis of binary variables:
The number and percentages of subjects will be summarized . Two -sided 95% CI s for the 
percentages will be computed.
Antibody  titers
/concentrat ion below the limit of detection in the respective assay  will be 
set to half the limit for the purposes of anal ysis. Missing values of immunogenicity  will 
be excluded from analy ses (i.e. complete -case analy sis) since they  are considered missing 
completely  at random, i.e. not informative an d with no impact on inferences.
Analysis of continuous variables:
The antibody  concentrations/titers will be logarithmically  transformed (base10) (to fulfil 
the normal distribution assumption). GMCs will be calculated, wit h their associated two -
sided 95% CI s, by  exponentiating the corresponding log -transformed means and their 
95% CI .
Additionally , within -subject geometric mean ratios (GMRs) will be computed for 
geometric mean titers/GMCs at each time point after vaccination versus baseline (Day  1). 
The GMRs and 95% CIs will be constructed b
y exponentiating the mean within -subject 
differences in log -transformed titers and the corresponding 95% CIs.

The primary  anal ysis will be performed on the All Exposed Set .
Analysis of solicited local and systemic adverse events and other reactions :
Solicited AEs will be summarized according to d efined severity  grading scales.
Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each AE will be presented for each 
symptom severit y. Summary tables showing the occurrence of an y local or sy stemic AE 
overall and at each time point will also be presented.
Post-vaccination /challenge solicited AE reported from Day  1 to 7 day s post-
vaccinat ion/challenge will be summarized by maximal severity  and by  vaccine /placebo
group. The severity  of solicited local AE will be summarized according to categories 
based on linear measurement.
Injection -site pain and s ystemic reactions occurring up to 7 days after each vaccination 
will be summarized according to “ mild”, “moderate” or “severe”.
Each solicited local and systemic AE will also be further summarized as “none” versus 
“any”.
Analysis of unsolicited AEs :
All the AEs occurring during the stud y, judged either as probabl y related, possibly  
related, or not related to vaccination /challenge by the investigator, will be recorded.
The original verbatim terms used by  investigators to identify  AEs in the eCRFs will be 
mapped to preferred terms using the MedDRA d ictionary . The AEs will then be grouped 
by MedDRA preferred terms into frequency  tables according to s ystem organ class. All 
reported AEs, as well as AEs judged by the investigator as at least possibly related to 
study  vaccine/placebo or challenge agent, w ill be summarized according to sy stem organ 
class and preferred term within sy stem organ class. These summaries will be presented by  
vaccination group. When an AE occurs more than once for a subject, the maximal 
severit y and strongest relationship to the v accine /placebo group will be counted.
Separate summaries will be produced for the following categories:
SAEs .
AEs that are possibl y or probably related to vaccine/placebo or challenge agent .
AEs leading to withdrawal from the study .
Data listings of all AE s will be provided by  subject. I n addition, AEs in the categories 
above will be provided as listed data.

Except for anal yses on objectives with a pre defined success criterion and an appropr iate 
type I error control (see S ection 2), comparative analy ses will be descriptive with the aim 
to characterize the difference in reactogenicity  and immunogenicit y efficacy between 
groups. These descriptive anal yses should not be i nterpreted.
11.12. Conduct of analy ses
Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan outlined in this protocol 
will be described and justified in the final study  report.
11.12.1. Sequence of analy ses
The total of 72 subjects will be divided in 4 cohorts of 18 subjects each (for bed 
availability  at the stud y site). The vaccination and challenge will be done per cohort.
However, if for an y reason, a cohort does not reach the planned 18 subjects, additional 
subjects can be added in the next cohorts. The maximum number of subjects must not be 
more than 20 (maximum number of beds in the clinic) in each cohort.
The following 2 interim analyses are planned:
1.After completion of the 
Visit 5 (Day 64):post-challenge efficacy data of all 
subjects (all 4 cohorts) 
2.After Visit 6 (Day 85): secondary immunogenicity data and tertiary SBA 
immunogenicity data of all subjects (all 4 cohorts).
(Amended: 23July 2019)
All analy ses will be conducted before unblinding on clean and final data. (Amended: 23 
July 2019)
An integrated Clinical Study 
Report containing all data will be written after the End of 
Study and made available to the investigators. (Amended: 23 July 2019)
If the data for tertiary  endpoints become available at a later s tage, (an) additional 
analysis/analyses will be performed. These data will be documented in annex(es) to the 
study  report and will be made available to the investigators at that time.
11.12.2. Statistical considerations for interim analyses
No statistical adjustment will be made for the interim analy ses, which are intended to 
provide final outputs related to the different endpoints and timepoints in a phased 
manner.

publications must be fulfilled.
12.1. Electronic case report form instructions
A validated GSK defined electronic data collection tool will be used as the method for 
data colle ction.
In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to GSK. Subject data 
necessary  for anal ysis and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database 
or data s ystem. Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with 
applicable GSK sta ndards and data cleaning procedures.
While completed eCRFs are reviewed b y a GSK Biologicals’ Site Monitor at the study 
site, omissions or inconsistencies detected b y subsequent eCRF review may necessitate 
clarification or correction by  the investigator or appropriatel y qualified designee. In all 
cases, the investigator remains accountable for the study  data. 
The investigator will be provided with a n electronic format in read only  mode of the final 
version of the data generated at the investigational site once the database is archived and 
the study  report is complete and approved b y all parties.
12.2. Subject Diary
Paper Diaries (pDiaries), hereafter referred to as Subject Diaries will be the only source 
document allowed for solicited local and s ystemic adverse events (including body  
temperature measurements), starting after the initial 30 minute post -vaccination period at 
the clinic. The following additional rules appl y to documentation of sa fety information

Following closure of the study , the investigator must maintain all site study  records 
(except for those required by  local regulations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be easily  accessible, when needed (e.g. audit or 
inspection), and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the 
facility , supporting s ystems, and staff. Where permi tted by  applicable laws/regulations or 
institutional policy , some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format 
other than hard copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such action is take n. The investigator must ensure that all reproductions 
are legible and are a true and accurate cop y of the original and meet accessibility  and 
retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the 
investigator must ensure that an acceptable back -up of the reproductions exists and that 
there is an acceptable quality  control procedure in place for making these reproductions.
GSK will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records 
to comply  with all applicable regulatory  requirements. The minimum retention time will 
meet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated b y ICH GCP, any  
institutional requirements, applicable laws or regulations, or GSK standards/procedures , 
otherwise, the minimum retention period will default to 25 y ears after completion of the 
study  report.
The investigator/institution must notify  GSK of any  changes in the archival 
arrangements, including, but not limited to archival at an off -site facility , transfer of 
ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site. 
12.5. Qualit y assurance
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements, GSK may  
conduct a qualit y assurance audit. Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory  
inspection of this study . Such audits/inspections can occur at any  time during or after 
completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution 
agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all rele vant documents and to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.

23-JUL -2019 121Anti S. sonnei LPS antibody  determination from serum:
Anti- S. sonnei LPSIgG antibodies in serum (for all timepoints except screening) will be 
measured b y ELISA in the GVGH -Laboratories ( Siena , Italy). The ELISA is performed 
using S. sonnei LPS as coating antigen. A standard curve is run in duplicate on each 
plate. Results are expressed in ELI SA units (EU) /mL  of serum. 1 unit equals the 
reciprocal of the dilutio n to give an OD of 1.
Serum Bactericidal Activity  in serum:
Serum bactericidal activity  against S. sonnei will be measured by serum bactericidal 
assay .This assay  is currently  in development in a GVGH laboratory . 
S. sonnei determination from stool:
Culture: The presence of S. sonnei in stool samples will be assessed using a 
qualitative procedure and following the SOPs of the local or designated laboratory  
for culture, isolation and identification of S. sonnei from stool specimens.
qPCR :S. sonnei qPCR determination will be done following the SOPs of the local or 
designated laboratory  for identification of S. sonnei by a qPCR f rom stool 
specimens.
S. sonnei s IgAand total sIgAdetermination from stool :S. Sonnei ELISA will be 
performed following the SOPs of the local or designated laboratory  for ELISA assay  
from stool specimens. The S. sonnei s IgA result will be normalized to the total sIgA.
Stool inflammatory  markers assay
Inflammatory  markers including c alprotectin and my eloperoxidase levels in stools 
(ng/mL) will be measured using commerciall y available (Epitope Diagnostics, I nc.) 
quantitative ELI SA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

23-JUL -2019 122Glycosylation profiles of IgG antibodies:
The activity  of IgG antibody  is mediated through two functional domains, the Fab and the 
Fc. The Fc domain mediates effector functions though specific interactions with FcγRs 
expressed on the surface of leukocy tes, and activation of diverse immunomodulatory  
pathway s impacting both innate and adaptive immunity  [1]. The mechanisms of Fc 
domain diversification that determine Fc -FcγR interaction include IgG subclass and Fc -
associated gl ycan structure [ 2]. Distinct profiles are enriched following vaccination or 
during inflammatory  diseases or infection. Vaccination with 1790GAHB is hy pothesized 
to enrich certain IgG subclasses and Fc gl ycan structures and specific profiles of elicited 
IgG will contribute to clinical protection observed in controlled human infection models.

Amendment date: 19 February 2019
Coordinating author: (XPE Pharma for GSK Biologicals)
Rationale/background for changes:
!Subjects of African descent are known to have a lower Absolute Neutrophil Count 
(ANC) than subjects of European descent. African Americans represent about 75% 
of all included subjects in the study so far, which is more than was initially anticipated. Furthermore, all cases of neutropenia recorded so far in the study occurred in African-American subjects. The threshold and grading scale, appropriate for this population, in line with the recommended criteria of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), have been added to the protocol. This change will provide a more appropriate definition of neutropenia for African-American subjects as a basis to decide on eligibility for participation in the study and for vaccination and administration of the challenge agent, and will mitigate the risk that African-American subjects are excluded from the study due to episodes of neutropenia that are not clinically relevant.
!The current definition of “more severe diarrhea” was inconsistent with the 
definition of “Shigellosis”. A change has been introduced to the definition of “more severe diarrhea” for a clear classification of cases.
!Minor editorial mistakes are corrected.

Important 
Potential/Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Investigational vaccine: 1790GAHB vaccine
Symptomatic Neutropenia Eight cases of Grade 2 or Grade 3 
neutropenia were reported from 
Phase 1 clinical trials 
(asymptomatic).
All cases occurred in the first 20 days 
after administration of first vaccine 
dose, and reversed after 
discontinuation.
Literature review of reports of 
neutropenia in association with 
vaccination indicates factors noted to 
be associated with neutropenia 
(including ethnicity, and low baseline 
counts) with the majority of cases 
detected within 2 weeks of the 
vaccination. None of the reported 
cases was clinically symptomatic.
Five cases of asymptomatic 
neutropenia (Grade 1 and 2) have 
been reported at Day 7 after receipt 
of the first dose in 5 subjects.
One of the 5 subjects had an 
additional Grade1 neutropenia 
episode at Day 28, and another one

which was Grade 3 (940 cells/mL) at

measured at 7 days post each 
scheduled vaccination.
 Assessment of clinical impact of 
neutropenia.
Subjects will be closely monitored during 
the entire study and have hematology 
repeated every 7 days when neutropenia is 
identified until resolution. If a case of 
neutropenia does not resolve based on 
most recent available laboratory results,
before the second vaccination, or 
challenge agent administration, the 
subject will not be re -vaccinated or 
administered the challenge agent.

Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 1.0 Background 
 
Thirteen thousand new cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are  diagnosed every year (Last 
accessed May 27, 2011 ). Prognosis  and treatment of this blood cancer remain challenging in 
adult patients compared to pedi atric patients. Remission rates are about 65% for front-line therapy 
and relapse rate is about 50-60%  at 4 years (Robak and Wrzesien -Kus 2002; Burnett, Wetzler et 
al. 2011). Both cytogenetic and molecular features predict favo rable versus adverse prognosis and 
govern our therapy options for t hese patients (Byrd, Mrozek et al. 2002; Marcucci, Haferlach et 
al. 2011). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is recommended for adverse prognosis group at 
diagnosis but is deferred to the  time of relapse in patients wi th favorable prognosis (Dohner, 
Estey et al. 2010). Cytarabine and anthracycline (7+3 regimen) is the most used regimen and all 
other regimens have failed to s how any survival advantage (Dohn er, Estey et al. 2010). 
 
Kit is a receptor tyrosine kin ase and is vital in leukemic cells. It is expressed in more than 10% of 
the blasts in 95% of relapsed AML cases and mediates leukemic proliferation and has anti-apoptotic effects (Domen and Weis sman 2000; Hans, Finn et al. 2 002). AML with high c-kit 
expression is associated with lower complete remission (CR) rat es, shorter CR duration, and 
shorter overall survival (OS) (D el Poeta, Venditti et al. 2003) . On multivariate analysis, c-kit 
mean fluorescent index >20.3 correlates with a decreased progre ssion-free survival and overall 
survival, independent of known prognostic factors (Advani, Rodr iguez et al. 2008). Patients with 
core-binding factor (CBF) AML carry a superior outcome compared  to other AML subgroups, 
but patients positive for c-kit mutation (for example D816F) ca rry a worse prognosis evidenced 
by higher relapse rate and inferior survival to wild-type kit C BF AML (Bloomfield, Lawrence et 
al. 1998; Paschka, Marcucci et al. 2006). Schnittger et colleag ues studied 1940 AML patients for 
kit D816 mutations and found it positive in 33 cases (1.7%) {Schnittger,2006 #40}. Eight out of 
33 patients were positive for t(8, 21). Kit mutations were found to have an independent negative 
impact on event free and overall survival in patients with t(8, 21). The D816V receptor expressed 
in Ba/F3 cells were fully sensitive to PKC412. On the expressio n level of kit, a semi-quantitative 
RT-PCR done on 60 acute leukemia cases correlated with complete  remission rates {Han, 2006 
#41}. Further research showed dow n-regulation of miRNA-193b in AML cells where kit was 
mutated or overexpressed {Gao, 2011 #43}. Restoration of MiR-19 33b expression in AML cells 
resulted in reduced c-Kit expression and inhibited cell growth.  Finally, expression of c-kit has 
been linked to increased P-glycoprotein, a major mediator of multi-drug resistance (MDR) in de novo AML{Sincock, 1997 #39}.There fore, targeting kit expression  seems to be a of great impact 
in this group of patients.  
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (including imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib) are important drugs 
that are used for ABL inhibition in patients with chronic myelo id leukemia (CML) or 
Philadelphia (Ph) positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) ( Kantarjian, Shah et al. 2010; 
Saglio, Kim et al. 2010). They are FDA approved agents for the management of CML in all its phases (including blast phase) (Sa wyers, Hochhaus et al. 2002; Kantarjian, Giles et al. 2006; 
Cortes, Rousselot et al. 2007). Kit is also inhibited by these TKI, more so with a second 
generation agents like nilotinib (Kantarjian, Giles et al. 2006 ). They have also been recently tried 
in combination with chemotherapy with increased efficacy and sy nergy in patients with Ph+ 
ALL.  Imatinib has been given to a pa tient with refractory AML and c- kit positive overexpression (no 
m
utation) who achieved complete  hematological remission followe d by complete clearance of 
leukemic blasts in bone marrow lasting for more than 5 months ( Kindler, Breitenbuecher et al. 
2003). Imatinib has been given in combination with chemotherapy  achieving very encouraging 
MC1284 8 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 results (Walker, Komrokji et al . 2008; Brandwein, Hedley et al.  2011). Dasatinib is now under 
study with combination chemothe rapy in CALGB phase II study in patients with core binding 
factor AML ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Nilotinib is currently given in addit ion to chemotherapy 
(mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high  dose cytarabine, NOVE-HiDAC) in the setting of relapsed 
and refractory AML ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). I n addition, nilotinib is giv en to relapsed Ph+ALL patients 
and is well tolerated (including combination with high dose cyt arabine). All of these active trials 
reflect the great interest of having those effective agents tes ted in patients diagnosed with AML. 
 
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is caused by the reciprocal translocation of the ABL 
kinase on chromosome 9 to the BCR region on chromosome 22. This results in a novel 
oncoprotein with constitutively activated ABL kinase activity l eading to downstream pathway 
activation and uncontrolled myeloproliferation. The BCR-ABL fus ion oncogene (the Philadelphia 
chromosome, Ph+) is the hallmark  of Ph+ CML and is the driving characteristic molecular event 
in this diseases (Druker 2008) (Vardiman 2009). The other disea se in which the BCR-ABL 
translocation plays an essential role in pathogenesis is Ph+ ac ute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(Ph+ALL), an aggressive form of b lood cancers. Chemotherapy agents or single agent tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKI) alone can induce high response rates bu t the response is often temporary. 
Therefore, combination of a targeted agent (TKI) with chemother apy may provide a more durable 
response (Stock 2010). 
 
Imatinib, an adenosine tri-phos phate (ATP)-competitive specific  inhibitor of the protein tyrosine 
kinase activity associated with Bcr-Abl, has revolutionized treatment of CML and significantly 
improved the prognosis of patient s since its approval in 2001. It is effective in most patients with 
CML with minimal toxicity, and is now frontline drug therapy fo r CML. However, despite the 
remarkable success of imatinib, a percentage of patients are in tolerant to the drug and resistance 
can develop. Some patients do not tolerate imatinib due to the development of SAEs, including grade 3 or 4 skin rash, fluid retention, cardiopulmonary events , thrombocytopenia, liver function 
abnormalities, and diarrhea, which persist in spite of optimal supportive care measures; other patients do not tolerate due to pr olonged AEs of lower grade which do not meet criteria of a SAE 
(O’Hare 2006). Imatinib resistance is primarily due to mutation  of the Bcr-Abl gene, impairing 
the ability of imatinib to bind to  the tyrosine kinase domain o f Bcr-Abl. Overexpression of the 
Bcr-Abl protein may also cause resistance. Rates of resistance increase with each stage of 
progression of CML (CP < AP < BC) (Apperley 2007).  
 Nilotinib is a synthetic aminopyr imidine, which was developed a s a second-generation inhibitor 
of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. It is a more potent and selective i nhibitor of Bcr-Abl than imatinib in 
vitro, and has shown efficacy in patients harboring a variety of Bcr-Abl mutations associated with imatinib resistance, except T 315I. Nilotinib has an impressive anti-leukemia activity in mouse 
models of 190 BCR/ABL positive lymphoblastic leukemia (Kaur, Fe ldhahn et al. 2007). Its 
concentration in cell lines and primary CD34+ CML cells is not mediated by active uptake or 
efflux by major drug transporters (a known mechanism of resistance to imatinib (Davies, 
Jordanides et al. 2009). Nilotinib induces apoptosis in imatini b-resistant K562 CML cells via 
increase of caspase-3 enzyme and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Ekiz, Can et al. 
2010). Most importantly, it poses synergistic activity with che motherapeutic drugs in imatinib-
sensitive and –resistant BCR/ABL + cells (
 Radujkovic, Fruehauf et al. 2010). Nilotinib is 
approved for use in the treatment of chronic phase and accelera ted phase Philadelphia 
chromosome positive CML in adult patients resistant to or intol erant to prior therapy including 
imatinib and newly diagnosed adu lt patients with Philadelphia c hromosome positive CML. 
 
Nilotinib also inhibits the pla telet-derived growth factor rece ptor (PDGFR), stem cell factor (Kit), 
colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R), discoidin domain r eceptor (DDR), and ephrin-A4 
MC1284 9 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 receptor (EphA4) kinases, and blocks the downstream cellular ev ents mediated by these enzymes. 
Nilotinib was given to patients with metastatic melanoma harbor ing Kit gene mutation, where 
22% achieved partial response and 55.6% had stable disease {Cho , 2011 #45}. Nilotinib was 
tested as third-line therapy in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), where disease 
control rate at week 24 was 29%  and 66% patients had stable dis ease >6 weeks as best 
response{Sawaki, 2011 #46}. In mast cells, nilotinib, as well a s imatinib, was potent against mast 
cell with wild type c-kit and D560G c-kit mutant but no signifi cant activity against cells 
expressing c-kit D816V mutant tyrosine kinase {Verstovsek, 2006 #48}. However, Von Bubnoff 
showed that nilotinib did s uppress the growth of Ba/F3c-kit D814V at concentrations of 1-2 µm {von 
Bubnoff, 2005 #53}. Similar results were found in cells express ing the human c-kit D816V. 
 
1.1 Toxicology in animals 
 
Nilotinib was not considered genotoxic, but was embryolethal an d produced fetotoxicity 
in embryo-fetal development st udies in rats and rabbits at dose s that also produced 
maternal toxicity. There were no signs of teratogenicity. In th e pre- and postnatal study, 
administration of nilotinib to fe male rats was associated with decreased pup body weight 
and changes in some physical development parameters at a dose t hat also produced 
maternal effects. Carcinogenicity studies are currently ongoing . 
 The fertility of male and female  rats was not affected. Nilotinib is considered to be 
embryolethal, because of an increased post-implantation loss ob served in both the fertility 
study, with treatment of both m ales and females, and in the emb ryotoxicity study with the 
treatment of females. It is recommended that women of childbear ing potential should use 
effective contraceptive measures during the entire treatment pe riod. Any women in early 
pregnancy when treatment starts should be informed about the potential risk to the fetus. Since nilotinib is transferred in to the milk in lactating rats with a milk/plasma 
concentration ratio of approximately 2, women who are using the  drug should not breast 
feed. 
 
1.2 Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism 
 
The extent of nilotinib absorption following oral administration was estimated to be approximately 30%. The bioavaila bility of nilotinib was increas ed when given with a 
meal. Compared to the fasted sta te, the systemic exposure [area  under the plasma drug 
concentration time curve (AUC)] in the fed state increased by 1 5% (drug administered 2 
hours after a light meal), 29% (30 minutes after a light meal),  or 82% (30 minutes after a 
high fat meal), and the maximum concentration (C
max) increased by 33% (2 hours after a 
light meal), 55% (30 minutes after a light meal), or 112% (30 m inutes after a high fat 
meal).  
With once daily (q.d.) dosing at steady-state, C
max and AUC increased with increasing 
dose from 50 mg to 400 mg in a generally dose-proportional manner, but appeared to 
plateau at dose levels starting at 400 mg, remaining relatively  constant over the dose 
range from 400 mg to 1200 mg. Dividing the daily dose in a twic e daily schedule 
overcame the dose-limiting exposur e to some extent with daily s teady-state serum 
exposure to nilotinib with 400 mg twice daily dose being approx imately 35% greater than 
with 800 mg q.d. dose. However, t here was no further relevant i ncrease in exposure to 
nilotinib when given 600 mg dose with the twice daily schedule (1200 mg/day). With 
multiple oral doses of nilotinib, steady-state conditions were achieved by day 8 after 
initiating nilotinib treatment.  There was a 2-fold or 3.8-fold  accumulation with q.d. 
MC1284 10 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 dosing or twice daily dosing, respectively, in serum concentrat ions between the first-dose 
and steady-state. The median time to reach C max of nilotinib (t max) was 3 hours. Drug 
elimination half-lives calculate d during the dose interval aver aged 17 hours for q.d. 
dosing, consistent with the observed accumulation in serum conc entrations.  
 
Exposure to nilotinib in female p atients was approximately 20% greater than in male 
patients. There was no differen ce in nilotinib apparent clearan ce between Caucasians and 
non-Caucasians. The population pha rmacokinetic (PK) analysis sh owed that nilotinib PK 
is not affected by age. Hepatic impairment has a modest effect on nilotinib 
pharmacokinetics; however, impaire d renal function is not expec ted to influence nilotinib 
PK.  Results of a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study in patients with 
GISTs who progressed on previous imatinib therapy suggest that nilotinib might have 
inhibitory effects on the metabolism of imatinib. The increases in serum concentration levels of imatinib on Day 8 were , in general, within the variability of fluctuation of serum 
imatinib concentrations in a dos ing interval, suggesting that t he inhibitory effects of 
nilotinib on the metabolism of i matinib might not be clinically  significant. 
 
Coadministration of ketoconazo le with nilotinib increased nilot inib C
max by 84% and 
AUC by 3-fold on average. Single-dose nilotinib did not appear to affect ketoconazole 
concentrations. Single-dose administration of nilotinib (600 mg ) with a single dose of 
midazolam resulted in mean increase in midazolam C max and AUC of 20% and 31%, 
respectively.  
Rifampin 600 mg, administered as a pretreatment for 8 days, had  a pronounced impact on 
a single 400 mg dose of nilotinib. Apparent clearance of niloti nib was increased by 4.8-
fold on average. Induction with rifampin significantly reduced Cmax and AUC of 
nilotinib by 64% and 80%, respectively. 
 
Concurrent intake of grapefru it juice increased the nilotinib C
max by 60% and AUC 0-∞ by 
29%, but the median time to reach peak concentration (t max) and the mean elimination 
half-life (t 1/2) were not altered.  
 
Concurrent administration of nilo tinib with a single oral dose of 25 mg warfarin in 
healthy subjects showed a lack of interaction between two drugs . Pharmacokinetic 
parameters of S- and R-warfari n as well as pharmacodynamic para meters of warfarin 
were all found to be similar between two treatments (warfarin+n ilotinib versus warfarin 
alone), with the geometric mean r atios and 90% CIs all being wi thin 80-125% range. 
 Co administration of esomeprazo le with nilotinib caused a modes t reduction in the rate 
and extent of nilotinib absorption. The mean C
max, AUC 0-tlast and AUC 0-∞ of nilotinib were 
decreased by about 27%, 34% and 33%. The mean T 1/2 of nilotinib, however, was found 
to be similar between two treatments. 
 
1.3 Efficacy  
 
1.31 Efficacy in CML 
 
1.311 Imatinib resistant and imatinib intolerant CML-CP and CML-AP 
 
MC1284 11 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 A Phase II study [CAMN107A2101], was conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of nilotinib in CML-CP and CML-AP patients with 
imatinib-intolerant or imatinib-resistant (due to either a prim ary 
resistance to imatinib or due to  acquired resistance primarily due to 
known Bcr-Abl mutations).   A total of 321 CML-CP patients in the Phase II study  were evaluated for 
efficacy. Of these, 71.4% were im atinib-resistant and 29.6% were 
imatinib-intolerant. Previous therapies, in addition to imatini b, which 
72.2% of patients had received at doses ≥ 600 mg, included prio r 
interferon (64.4% of patients). P atients were treated with nilo tinib 400 
mg b.i.d. for 6 months, and could be dose-escalated to 600 mg b.i.d. for lack of efficacy. Fifty-one of 321 patients (15.9%) were dose-e scalated 
due to lack of efficacy. Dose reduction from either 400 or 600 mg b.i.d. 
occurred in 34.1% of all patients treated, primarily due to AEs .  
 The median duration of exposur e in CML-CP patients was 341 days  
(exposure range of 1 - 624 days). T he median average daily dose  of 
nilotinib for CML-CP patients was 792 mg which is indicative of  
relatively infrequent dose inte rruptions and reductions. At the  time of 
data cutoff, 188 (58.8%) patient s were ongoing and 132 (41.3%) had 
discontinued treatment. The reasons  for discontinuation were mainly due 
to AEs (51 patients, 15.9%) and disease progression (51 patient s, 
15.9%).  
The achievement of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) is associa ted 
with a survival benefit in CML patients treated with imatinib. For 
nilotinib-treated CML-CP patient s, the percentage of patients w ho 
achieved MCyR by intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was 56.3% (median 
exposure of 341 days; range 1 to 624 days). This is indicative of the 
durability of the response in CML-CP. A complete hematological 
response (CHR) was achieved in 76.2% of CML-CP patients. 
 
MC1284 12 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 Table 1-1 Response rates in CML-CP patients 
 
The patients evaluated for efficacy consisted of  119 out of 127 enrolled 
CML-AP Phase II patients of which 80.7% were imatinib-resistant  and 
19.3% were imatinib-intolerant . Previous therapies included int erferon 
(58.0% of patients) and imatin ib (82.9% of patients received doses ≥ 600 
mg). Patients were treated with nilotinib 400 mg b.i.d. for 4 m onths and 
could be dose-escalated to 600 mg b.i.d. for lack of efficacy.  
 
The median duration of exposure was 202 days for the overall en rollment 
population (N = 119; exposure range of 2 - 611 days). Notably, 67 (56%) and 29 (24%) CML-AP patients ha ve been exposed for longer than 6 and 
12 months, respectively. Twenty- nine of 119 patients (24.4%) we re dose-
escalated due to lack of efficacy. Dose reduction from either 4 00 or 600 
mg b.i.d. occurred in 42.0% of all patients treated, primarily due to AEs. 
Sixty-seven (56.3%) of  CML-AP patients enrolled have received 
nilotinib for 6 months or more. T he median average daily dose o f 
nilotinib for CML-AP patients was 790.0 mg,  and is indicative of 
relatively infrequent dose inte rruptions and reductions through out the 
treatment period. At the time of data cutoff, 48 (40.3%) patients were 
still on treatment and 71 (59.7%) had discontinued treatment. The 
reasons for discontinuation included disease progression (35 patients, 29.4%) and AEs (15 patients, 12.6%).   The anticipated prognosis for i matinib-resistant or -intolerant CML-AP 
patients is poor since all will eventually progress to CML-BC, typically 
within 6 month’s time. Despite thi s, nilotinib-treated CML-AP patients 
achieved high rates of hematological response (HR) for the ITT population. The percentage of patie nts who achieved confirmed H R by 
ITT analysis was 47.1% (median exposure of 202 days; range 2 to  611 
days). The current estimate for median time to progression (TTP) has 
been reached at 16.4 months in CML-AP patients.

1.312 Newly diagnosed CML-CP 
 
Study [CAMN107A2303] is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, 
multicenter study comparing the efficacy of nilotinib 300 or 40 0 mg 
b.i.d. to imatinib 400 mg qd in adult patients with newly diagn osed Ph+ 
CML in CP. A total of 846 patient s with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP, 
diagnosed within 6 months, and stratified by Sokal risk score, were 
randomized 1:1:1 to nilotinib 300 mg bid (n=282), nilotinib 400  mg bid 
(n=281), and imatinib 400 mg qd (n=283) arms.  
 
The primary endpoint was rate of major molecular response (MMR)  at 
12 months (mos). All patients had a minimum of 12 months of tre atment 
or discontinued early; median follow-up was 14 mos. MMR was def ined 
as a value of ≤ 0.1% of BCR-ABL/ABL ratio on the International Scale. 
Molecular response was assessed by RQ-PCR at baseline, monthly for 3 
months and every 3 months ther eafter. Samples were analyzed at a 
central PCR laboratory. The maj or secondary endpoint was rate o f 
complete cytogenetic response (CCy R) by 12 mos based on bone ma rrow 
cytogenetics.  
 
Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and Sokal score s were 
well balanced among the 3 arms; patients with high-risk Sokal s cores 
were 28% in all arms. Median dose intensities of nilotinib deli vered were 
592 mg/day for 300 mg bid and 779 mg/day for 400 mg bid; imatin ib 
dose intensity was 400 mg/day. Overall, 84%, 82%, and 79% of patients 
remained on the study for 300 mg  bid nilotinib, 400 mg bid nilotinib, and 
400 mg qd imatinib, respectively. Rates of MMR at 12 mos were 
superior for nilotinib 300 mg bid compared with imatinib 400 mg qd 
(44% vs. 22%, P  < .0001) and also for nilotinib 400 mg bid compared 
with imatinib 400 mg qd (43% vs. 22%, P < .0001). Median time to 
MMR among patients who achieved MMR was faster for nilotinib 30 0 
mg bid (5.7 mos) and nilotinib 400 mg bid (5.8 mos) compared wi th 
imatinib 400 mg qd (8.3 mos). Rates of CCyR by 12 months were 

MC1284 14 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 significantly higher for both nilotinib at either 300 mg bid compared with 
imatinib 400 mg qd (80% vs. 65%, P < .0001) and for nilotinib 400 mg 
bid compared with imatinib 400 mg qd (78% vs. 65%, P = .0005). 
Overall, progression to advanced disease was lower for nilotini b 300 mg 
bid (2 pts) and nilotinib 400 mg bid (1 pt) compared with imati nib 400 
mg qd (11 pts). Overall, both drugs were well-tolerated.  Rates of 
discontinuation due to adverse events or laboratory abnormaliti es were 
7% for nilotinib 300 mg bid, 11% for nilotinib 400 mg bid, and 9% for 
imatinib 400 mg qd. Patients we re monitored for QT prolongation  and 
LVEF. No patients in any treatme nt arm showed a QTcF interval >  500 
msec. There was no decrease from baseline in mean LVEF anytime 
during treatment in any arm. The study is ongoing.  
 
Nilotinib at both 300 mg bid and 400 mg bid induced significant ly higher 
and faster rates of MMR and CCyR compared with imatinib 400 mg qd, 
the current standard of care in p atients with newly diagnosed C ML. 
Nilotinib was effective across all Sokal scores. After only one  year of 
treatment, both nilotinib arms resulted in a meaningful clinica l benefit 
compared to imatinib, with reduc tion of transformation to AP/BC. 
Nilotinib exhibited a favorable safety and tolerability profile . The 
superior efficacy and favorable tolerability profile of nilotin ib compared 
with imatinib suggests that nilotinib may become the standard o f care in 
newly diagnosed CML (Saglio et al, 2009). It was approved in 20 10 for 
the management of newly diagnosed CML CP patients. 
 
1.313 CML-BC and Ph+ ALL 
In a landmark study (  Kantarjian, Giles et al. 2006), 119 patients with 
imatinib-resistant CML or Ph+ ALL were enrolled in a phase I do se-
escalation study at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600  mg, 
800 mg, and 1200 mg once daily and at 400 mg and 600 mg twice d aily. 
Of the 33 patients with blast phase, 13 had a hematological res ponse and 
9 had a cytogenetic response. Of the 46 patients with accelerated phase, 33 had a hematologic response and 22 had a cytogenetic response . A 
total of 51 ABL mutations were observed in 37 of 91 patients wh o had a 
baseline assessment for mutational status. Nilotinib was effect ive in both 
groups (regardless of mutation analysis) with no significant di fferences 
in response rates. T315I mutation was found in 2 patients and d id not 
respond to nilotinib. Frequently noted side effects were mild-m oderate 
rashes; transient, clinically insignificant elevations of indirect bilirubin levels and myelosuppression. The maximum tolerated dose was sel ected 
as 600 mg twice daily, though 400 mg twice daily showed similar  
response rates.  A similar efficacy was reported in a small phase I/II of niloti nib in 
Japanese patients with imatinib-resistant or –intolerant Ph+ CM L or 
relapsed/refractory Ph+ALL (Tojo, Usuki et al. 2009Tojo, Usuki et al. 
2009). Three out of seven patients with Ph+ALL had a complete 
hematologic response and 2 out of 4 patients with CML-BC had 
hematologic response (1 did achie ve complete hematologic respon se). 
 
1.314 AML 
MC1284 15 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019  
Three current studies have been activated to study the clinical  effect of 
adding nilotinib in patients w ith acute myeloid leukemia. 
 
Brandwein and colleagues are ch ecking the safety and efficacy of 
nilotinib combined with mitoxant rone, etoposide, and high-dose 
cytarabine (NOVE-HiDAC) induction chemotherapy for high risk AM L 
patients ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); which include relapsed and refractory A ML in 
addition to secondary AML from myeloproliferative neoplasm or chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia. Patient s need to be positive for c-kit  (CD117) 
in at least 30% of the blasts measured by flow cytometry. This is a phase 
I/II study where nilotinib dose is escalated in the first phase  to get the 
maximum tolerated dose, and th en proceed with phase II to asses s the 
clinical efficacy. No results have been reported yet. 
 
Duyster and colleagues are studying the combination of nilotini b and 
RAD001 in patients diagnosed with AML. Patients could be newly diagnosed but unfit for chemothera py or have a relapsed/ refrac tory 
AML diagnosis. No results have been reported yet on this group of 
patients.  Kim et al will be studying the combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin (7+3) in combination with nilotinib at a higher dose (400mg orally bid) in patients diagnosed with previously untrea ted CML 
myeloid BP or Ph+AML ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This is a phase II study us ing 
a higher dose of nilotinib than our proposed dose (300mg bid). The primary goal is to increase complete remission rates with secon dary 
goals of safety and survival.  In the clinical practice, we have  given nilotinib in combinatio n with 
chemotherapy (7+3) for newly dia gnosed or relapsed refractory P h+ 
AML with no excessive toxicity (personal experience). Due to ra rity of 
Ph+AML cases, no protocol have yet published for these cases, 
therefore, we have been treating them as AML cases with adding tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 
 
1.4 Nilotinib safety  In Phase II study [CAMN107A2101] , nilotinib given at the recomm ended dose of 400 
mg b.i.d. was well tolerated in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant CML-CP (study [CAMN107A2101E2], Group A) and CML-AP (study [CAMN107A2101E1], Group A) 
patients as evidenced by the hi gh actual median dose intensitie s of 797 mg/day and 780 
mg/day for both populations.  In addition, the median cumulativ e duration of dose 
interruption was low relative to the median exposures in both C ML-CP and CML-AP 
populations. Adverse events (AEs) were generally managed either  with dose reduction, 
dose interruption, or supportive care. Discontinuation for drug  related adverse reactions 
was observed in 16% of CML-CP and 10% of CML-AP patients.  
 
1.41 Frequent adverse events  
MC1284 16 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 Table 1-3 lists the adverse even ts for the Phase II of study [C AMN107A2101]. 
The most frequently reported AEs overall included thrombocytope nia, rash, 
headache, nausea, pruritus, fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, constipa tion, neutropenia, 
vomiting and arthralgia.  These AEs were generally mild to mode rate (CTC 
grade 1 or 2), were manageable  with symptomatic treatment, and were reversible.

1.42 Myelosuppression  

MC1284 18 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019  
Myelosuppression, as expected for this class of drug in a CML p opulation, was 
seen with nilotinib, with CTC gra de 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
anemia reported in 29.38%, 31%, a nd 10.7% in CML-CP and 41.9%, 42.1%, and 
27.4% in CML-AP patients (Table 1 -4). Treatment emergent grade 3/4 
cytopenias were reported in hig her proportion of CML-AP patient s than CML-
CP. The majority of first episodes of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia occurred within  the first 2 months of therapy,  and were 
generally manageable with dose ad justment or study drug interru ption, only 
rarely requiring treatment discontinuation. Severe clinical consequences such as 
febrile neutropenia, sepsis, pneumonia and bleeding associated with 
thrombocytopenia, occurred infrequently in patients in both dis ease categories.

1.43 Blood chemistry 
 
Serum lipase and amylase 
Lipase and amylase were observed in clinical trials but not in preclinical 
toxicology studies. Increased lipase was reported in 13.1% and 12.8% of CML–
CP and CML-AP patients, respectively. Lipase (11.3%) is one of the most 
frequently reported grade 3 or 4 biochemical laboratory abnorma lities. As for 
amylase it was reported in 2.6% and 2.3% of CML-CP and CML-AP p atients, 
respectively.   
 
Hepatotoxicity Low grade increases in bilirubin and hepatic transaminases were frequently 
observed in CML-CP and CML-AP pat ients. However, grade 3/4 even ts occurred 
in 7.3% and 9% for bilirubin, 2.5% and 2.3% for AST, and 4.1% a nd 3.7% for 
ALT in CML-CP and CML-AP patients, respectively.  Elevations of  bilirubin 
occurred early, were transient, and the more severe cases were managed with 
brief treatment interruptions or dose reductions, rarely requir ing treatment 

MC1284 19 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 discontinuation. Patients with normal LFTs at baseline infreque ntly went on to 
develop grade 3 or 4 bilirubin or hepatic transaminase values o n treatment. Of 
interest, a significant increase in relative risk of hyperbilirubinemia was seen in 
patients with the (TA) 7(TA) 7 genotype at the (A (TA) nTAA) el ement of the 
UGT1A1, suggesting that genetic susceptibility may contribute t o the 
development of hyperbilirubinemi a in some patients (Kantarjian 2006).  
Elevations of bilirubin and transa minases were observed in anim al models, with 
histologic lesions in monkey showing bile duct hyperplasia, sin usoidal cell 
hyperplasia, and periportal fibrosis, partially reversible at 4  weeks. 
 
The incidence of grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia was 12.2% and 6.1% in CML-CP 
and CML-AP patients. No CML-CP or CML-AP patients required dose  
adjustment and/or study drug interruption due to hyperglycemia.  No CML-CP or 
CML-AP patients discontinued nilotinib due to hyperglycemia. Fu rthermore 
there was no evidence that insu lin requirements increased in in sulin-dependent 
diabetics receiving nilotinib. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypophosphatemia was 15.1% in CML-CP and CML-AP patients each.  There were no reports of clinical sympto ms related to 
hypophosphatemia.

MC1284 20 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 1.44 Clinically significant adverse events 
Rash and pruritus 
Rash and pruritus were frequently reported by patients in the p ivotal phase II 
study (2101): rash (CML-CP: 30.8%, CML-AP: 21.2%) and pruritus (CML-CP: 
26.2%, CML-AP: 17.5%). Four CML-CP patients (1.3%) discontinued due to 
skin toxicity: two cases of rash or rash generalized, one case of dermatitis 
allergic, one case of pruritus, a ll suspected of study drug rel ationship. Two CML-
AP patients (1.7%) discontinued due to 4 AEs related to skin to xicity: 2 cases of 
rash, one case of urticaria and one case of skin burning sensat ion, all but the 
latter suspected of study drug relationship.  
Fluid retention 
The rates for all CTC grades of effusions (pleural, pericardial ) and edema were 
low. Peripheral edema was seen i n 5.1% and 6.2% f or CML-AP and CML-CP, 
respectively. AE related to pleural effusion was 2.7% and peric ardial effusion 
<1%. The incidence of fluid retention appeared to be slightly higher in elderly 
(>65 years old).   
 Bleeding-related events 
Bleeding-related events are not u ncommon in CML patients with compromised 
marrow function at baseline. GI and CNS hemorrhages were included as the 
indicators for significant bleeding. GI hemorrhage was common i n both newly 
diagnosed CML-CP and imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-AP and CML-CP patients treated with nilotinib. However, the incidence of SAEs  indicative of GI 
hemorrhage was 1% in each of these CML patients’ populations. C NS 
hemorrhage was infrequent but medically significant. All report s of CNS 
hemorrhage were SAEs.    
QT prolongation 
In the phase III study in newly d iagnosed Ph+ CML-CP patients the change from 
baseline in mean time-averaged Q TcF interval at steady-state ob served in the 
nilotinib 300 mg twice daily group was 6 msec. In the 300 mg tw ice daily 
treatment group, no patient had an absolute QTcF of >480 msec. No events of 
Torsade de Pointes were observed in any of the treatment groups .  
 
In the phase II study in imatinib-resistant and intolerant CML patients in chronic 
and accelerated phase, treated w ith nilotinib 400 mg twice dail y, the change from 
baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF interval at steady state wa s 5 and 8 msec, 
respectively. QTcF of >500 msec was observed in 4 patients (<1%  of these 
patients).   
Nilotinib should be used with caution in patients who have or w ho are at 
significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as tho se:  
1- with long QT syndrome 
2- with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including r ecent myocardial 
infarction, CHF, unstable angina o r clinically significant brad ycardia   
 Left ventricular function 
AEs related to cardiac failure or dysfunction occurred in 3 CML  patients (1.0%) 
overall in Phase II of study 2101. Patients who presented with cardiac events 
within 12 months prior to nilotin ib administration, such as myo cardial infarction, 
MC1284 21 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 unstable angina, clinically significant atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and 
congestive heart failure (CHF) w ere excluded from nilotinib tri als. It is therefore 
unknown whether patients with th ese concomitant conditions may be safely 
treated with nilotinib.    
 
1.45 Serious adverse events 
 
In the CML-CP study (2101E2) 22. 6% of patients experienced an S AE. The most 
frequent SAEs were thrombocytopenia (3.4%), neutropenia (2.2%),  angina 
pectoris (2.8%), pyrexia (2.5%), and myocardial infarction (1.3 %). In the CML-
AP study (2101E1) 30.8% of patients experienced an SAE. The mos t frequent 
SAEs were thrombocytopenia (8.0%), neutropenia (6.7%), pneumoni a (5.8%), 
and pyrexia (4.4%). Other SAEs occurred in less than 1% of patients and are 
listed in detail in the Investigator’s Brochure.  Deaths and Sudden Cardiac Deaths (SCD) 
Two deaths in CML-CP patients and 2 deaths in CML-AP have a cau se of death 
suspected of study drug relationship by the investigator (multi -organ failure, 
sudden death, CNS hemorrhage and pneumonia.) These four cases a re briefly 
described in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
10 deaths in CML-CP and CML-AP were related to progressive dise ase or 
underlying medical condition rather  than the study drug (sepsis , multi-organ 
failure, cardiac disorders, CNS hemorrhage) and are briefly sum marized 
described in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
A review of all cases received to date from all sources has ide ntified a total of 12 
cases that meet the conservatively modified definition of sudde n cardiac death 
(SCD).  These 12 cases have all been reported in the context of  adverse event 
reporting for clinical trials including the Compassionate Use P rogram. No reports 
of sudden death have been received from post marketing sources.  A total of 7170 
patients have received nilotinib in clinical trials through 31- Jan-2010 for an 
incidence of sudden death of 0.21%. 15 of these 16 cases have b een reported as 
sudden death from a cardiac or presumed cardiac cause while 1 were reported as 
sudden death from unknown cause.  The sudden deaths are summari zed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. So far data indicated, the relative early occurrence of some of these deaths relative to the initiation of Nilotinib suggests the possibility 
that ventricular repolarizati on abnormalities may have contribu ted to their 
occurrence.  
 
Safety in Phase I Study 
In the Phase I CAMN107A2103 study [overall safety population (N =53)], AEs 
were reported in 100% of patients in each of the 5 dosing group s. Rash was the 
most common AE overall as well as the most common drug-related AE in the 
safety population. There were two deaths during the study (one in the nilotinib 
monotherapy group and one in the selected phase II dose group n ilotinib 400 mg 
bid + imatinib 400 mg qd), both of which were assessed by the investigator to be 
due to disease progression and were not suspected to be related  to study drug. 
SAEs occurred in 32.1% of patients; none of these were suspecte d by the 
investigator to be study drug related.   
MC1284 22 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 Overall, six patients (11.3%) experienced AEs associated with s tudy treatment 
discontinuation. In addition to the two patients discontinuing due to death, two 
patients discontinued due to SAEs  (abdominal pain and alteratio n of general 
status due to progressive disease) and two patients due to stud y drug-related AEs 
(hyperbilirubinemia and rash). T he event of hyperbilirubinemia in the nilotinib 
monotherapy patient improved afte r discontinuation of study dru g, but was 
reported as ongoing at the time of discontinuation from the stu dy. The rash in the 
nilotinib 400 mg bid + imatinib 400 mg bid patient resolved after 34 days. Both 
events were considered as DLTs. 
 
Seventeen patients (32.1%) experienced a total of 52 SAEs, with  gastrointestinal 
disorders the most frequently affected system organ class. Of these patients, two died. No SAEs were suspected by th e investigator to be study dr ug related.

1.5 Study rationale/ purpose  
 

MC1284 23 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 AML has been a challenging cancer for hematologists and adult p atients. Combination 
chemotherapy using cytarabine and anthracycline (known as 7+3) induction success and 
relapse rates have been challenge d by many concepts but yet rem ains the standard 
therapy. These strategies included using higher doses of anthra cycline or cytarabine, 
addition of novel agents (like proteosome inhibitors or monoclo nal antibodies (like 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin), or even using agents directed against d rug-resistance targets. 
Fernandez H et colleagues random ized 657 patients diagnosed wit h AML between the 
ages of 17-60 to receive 7+3 but  at different doses for daunoru bicin (90 mg/m2 vs 45 
mg/m2). Patients who received h igh dose daunorubicin had higher  complete remission 
rates (70% vs 57%, p<0.001) and better median overall survival (23.7 months vs 15.7 
months, p=0.003){Fernandez, 2009 #54}. In a similar study repor ted by Lowenberg et al, 
813 patients were randomized to the same treatment but in patients equal or older than 60 
years. The complete remission ra te favored the higher dose daun orubicin (64% vs 54%, 
p=0.002), however the overall survival did not differ significa ntly {Lowenberg, 2009 
#55}. Dose intensification of cytarabine was studied compared t o standard dose (2gm/m2 
IV q12 hours x 12 doses vs. 200 mg/m2/day continuos IV daily x 7 days) in addition to 
daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily x 3 d ays in AML patients less than 65 years old. A total of 
665 patients were treated where CR rates 55% vs 58% (high vs st andard dose cytarabine) 
for patients aged less than 50 and there was no significant dif ference in 4-year overall 
survival (32% vs 22%, p=0.41){Weick, 1996 #56}. The British hem atologists tested the 
role of adding gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3mg/m2 on day 1 of induction and course 3 of 
consolidation) to induction chemotherapy in their MRC AML 15 trial in 1113 patients diagnosed with AML and age less than 60{Burnett, 2011 #58}. Unf ortunately, no overall 
survival benefit was found to adding this treatment in neither induction nor consolidation. 
On subsequent analysis, patients with favorable cytogenetics ha d a favorable effect from 
adding gemtuzuamb (p=0.001). Finally, in randomized study done by ECOG (3999), the 
addition of zosuquidar (a modulator of P-glycoprotein), did not  improve the outcome of 
older patients newly diagnosed  with AML (499 patients){Cripe, 2 010 #59}. Remission 
rate was 52% vs 49% (p0.158) on placebo, while median overall s urvival was 7.2 vs 9.4 
months on placebo compared to pa tients who received zosuquidar.  
 Over the last decade, molecular breakthroughs in understanding the genes role and 
pathways governing the cell cycles, proliferation, apoptosis an d transcription have 
revolutionized our understanding and treatment of myeloid disea se, especially chronic 
myeloid leukemia, myeloprolifera tive neoplasms and acute myeloi d leukemias. Based on 
this molecular profiling we are a ble to identify high risk AML cases for low chance of 
remission and high risk of relapse. Consequently this affected our treatment recommendation, especially with r egards to whether to proceed w ith allogeneic 
transplantation or not. For example patients harboring CEBPA mutation (single vs double mutations) had a favorable outco me compared with wild type AML cases {Taskesen, 
2011 #62}. In fact double mutation CEBPA was the only prognosti c factor for overall 
survival on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.36, p<0.0001) . On
  the other hand, high 
EVI1 expression in young patients diagnosed with AML predicts w orse outcome by 
having low CR rates (odd ratio 0.54, p=0.002) and adverse event-free survival (hazard ratio 1.46, p<0.001){Groschel, 2010 #63}. Patients who received allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation in CR1 had a better 5-year relapse free surviva l (33% vs 0%) compared to 
without transplantation. FLT3 is another potential gene, where mutations (internal 
tandem duplicate or tyrosine kinase domain mutation) predicts w orse clinical outcome 
(especially in patients with normal cytogenetics){Kottaridis, 2 001 #64}{Whitman, 2008 
#65}{Stirewalt, 2006 #67}. This became of utmost significance s ince many FLT3 
inhibitors have been tested in trials with encouraging results.  This include both as a single 
MC1284 24 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 agent and in combination with chemotherapy {Fischer, 2010 #68}{ Levis, 2011 
#69}{Borthakur, 2011 #71}{Al-Kali, 2011 #70}{Zarrinkar, 2009 #72}. 
 
Kit encodes for a transmembrane protein, which has tyrosine kinase activity. It is also 
thought to be a proto-oncogene w ith important role in hematopoi esis. Kit is activated by 
SCF (stem Cell factor) and results in proliferation of blast ce lls in many cases at 
diagnosis and at relapse. There  has been a strong correlation b etween levels of Kit 
phosphorylation and AML cell lines proliferation {Kanakura, 199 3 #76}. Many 
mutations in c-Kit are seen in core binding factor AML cases an d predict worse clinical 
outcome. Paschka P et al assessed Kit mutations in exon 8 and 1 7 in 61 cases with AML 
harboring inv(16) and 49 AML cases with t(8;21) treated with st andard chemotherapy 
and high dose cytarabine consolidation{Paschka, 2006 #78}. Kit mutations were detected 
in 30% of AML inv(16) and 22% with AML t(8;21). In inv(16), cum ulative incidence of 
relapse for both Kit mutations c ompared to Kit wild-type (56% v s 29%, p=0.05); mutated 
Kit also predicted worse overall survival (after adjusting to s ex). Additionally, Kit 
intensity (<20.3) assessed by fluorescence was found to be correlated with decreased 
progression-free and overall survival on multivariate analysis (independent of age, white 
blood count, and cytogenetics){Adva ni, 2008 #79}. Finally, a va riant of t(8;21) called 
AML1-ETO9a was found to be correlated with c-kit overexpression /mutations and 
predicts poor prognosis{Jiao, 2009 #80}.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (including imatinib, nilotinib , and dasatinib) have 
changed the prognosis and therapy paradigms of patients diagnos ed with CML, as well as 
Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Imatinib was fi rst approved in patients 
diagnosed with chronic phase CML based on the landmark study IR IS, while both second 
generation TKIs (nilotinib and dasatinib) were approved for sec ond line therapy in 
patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML-CP (
 O'Brien, Guilhot et al. 2003; 
Hochhaus, Kantarjian et al. 2007;  Kantarjian, Giles et al. 2007). However, recently and 
based on randomized phase III studies, both nilotinib and dasat inib have been approved 
for frontline therapy of patients diagnosed with chronic phase CML (Kantarjian, Shah et 
al. 2010; Saglio, Kim et al. 2010). In more advanced stages of CML (accelerated and 
blast phases), second generation TKIs have been more effective in achieving 
hematological and cytogenetic r emissions due to their improved potency (Cortes, 
Rousselot et al. 2007le Coutre, Ottmann et al. 2008).  Nilotinib (Kantarjian, Giles et al. 2006), a second generation TKI, has been tested as 
single agent in imatinib-failure patients diagnosed with CML-BC  with encouraging 
responses. Nilotinib has been appr oved for the treatment of CML  as first line therapy and 
after imatinib failure as second line therapy in CML-CP. Theref ore, a combination of 
chemotherapy regimen with nilotinib should be an effective stra tegy, better than 
chemotherapy alone, and may be s uperior to other combination (l ike imatinib and 
chemotherapy). Nilotinib is 20-50-fold more potent than imatini b in its ABL inhibition. It 
also is more effective than imatinib especially in the presence  of tyrosine kinase 
mutations (except for T315I), frequently seen in Ph+ALL. In addition, nilotinib concentration in cell lines and primary CD34+ CML cells is not mediated by active 
uptake or efflux by major drug transporters (a known mechanism for imatinib resistance). Most importantly, it has a synergistic activity with establishe d chemotherapeutic drugs in 
BCR-ABL positive cells. Additionall y, nilotinib does not increase stem cell 
transplantation toxicity in patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblast ic leukemia (Shimoni, 
Leiba et al. 2009). In a case report, nilotinib restored long-t erm full-donor chimerism in 
Ph+ ALL relapsed after allogene ic transplantation (Merante, Col ombo et al. 2009).

Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019  
We plan to study the clinical e fficacy of nilotinib in combinat ion with standard 
chemotherapy (7+3) in patients with Kit+AML as a frontline ther apy. We will assess 
their CR rates, survival outcome (DFS and OS) in addition to pr edictive factors for 
superior outcome. Cytarabine and daunorubicin regimen (7+3) is one of the well-
established and widely used chem otherapy regimens for the treat ment of adult AML. In 
addition, it has been successfully combined with other TKIs (im atinib, dasatinib) in the 
management of both newly diagnosed and relapsed AML. Cancer and  Leukemia Group B 
(CALGB) is currently studying co mbination dasatinib and 7+3 in a phase II study 
(CALGB 110801) for core binding factor positive AML patients. F inally imatinib has 
been combined with mitoxantrone , etoposide and cytarabine (MEC) in patients with 
relapsed/refractory c-Kit+ AML.  
 
2.0 Goals    
 
2.1 Primary 
 
2.11 To determine the complete  response rates of combination Ni lotinib, cytarabine, 
and daunorubicin in patients newl y diagnosed with AML and Kit overexpression 
 
2.2 Secondary 
 2.21 Determine the 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates.   
2.22 Determine the complete response duration in patients treat ed with this regimen. 
 
2.23 Assess the safety and toxic ity of this regimen based on NC I CTCAE version 4.0. 
 2.3 Correlative Research 
 
2.31 Assess the prognostic and predictive factors (Kit mutation /expression level, Flt3 
mutation) for patients treated with this regimen. 
 
2.32 Assess the patterns of molecular response and relapse for Kit

7.0 Protocol Treatment  
 
7.1 Treatment Schedule  
7.11 Induction (Cycle 1;  repeat for Cycle 2 for patients who requir e re-
induction): Patients eligible for the study based on screening tests will be 
enrolled on the study. During Cycle 1, patients will be assesse d for 
hypocellularity on Day 14.  If the patient has a decrease in bo ne marrow blasts, 
they will be assessed for response upon marrow recovery (End of  Cycle 1).   
Patients who achieve a CR/CRi w ill proceed to consolidation.  P atients who fail 
to achieve a significant decr ease in bone marrow blasts on Day 14 of Cycle 1 or 
fail to achieve a CR/CRi upon bone marrow recovery at the end o f Cycle 1will 
proceed to re-induction Cycle 2 (fo llow same treatment schedule  as Cycle 1).  
Treating physician could repeat other bone marrow(s) on day 21 (and later) if felt 
best for patient interest and if felt that blast reduction might still happen then.  These patients will get repeat bone marrow evaluation for hypoc ellularity on Day 
14 of Cycle 2 and will be assessed  for response upon marrow rec overy (End of 
Cycle 2). Patients who fail to achieve a decrease in bone marro w blasts on Day 
14 of Cycle 2 or fail to achieve a CR/CRi upon bone marrow reco very at the end 
of Cycle 2 will go to event monitoring.  Idarubicin (12mg/m2) instead of daunorubicin is allowed a substitute in cases of daunorubicin n ational shortages 
(Not a preferred first line anthracycline).

Section 7.13 for 8 cycles starting day +100 (after achieving he matological 
recovery as defined by CR, or after day +100 as deemed appropri ate per treating 
MD).  The SCT until the start of maintenance will be defined as  a separate cycle, 
where the stem cell transplant form will be used instead of the  
evaluation/treatment form for that cycle. Post-transplant maint enance will be 
allowed between day100-200.

2. Failure to achieve negative RT-PCR (CMR) for Kit at the end of consolidation 
therapy. 
3. Failure to achieve negative flow cytometry for persistent AML ( MRD) at the end 
of consolidation therapy. 
4. Failure to achieve CR at the end of cycle 1 of induction. 
 
NOTE: If nilotinib is dose escalated (e.g. from 300 mg b.i.d da ily to 400 mg

Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
 
Dose reduction for nilotinib is required in cases of grade 3 or  4 hematologic adverse events (AE) 
concerning white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT) (not con cerning hemoglobin level) 
during maintenance therapy, and in cases of grade 2, 3 or 4 non -hematologic AEs. The dose 
reduction schedule used in this study differs from the label recommendations, but has been 
successfully pioneered by the GIMEMA study group in a recently reported nilotinib trial (Rosti 
2008), which included similar patients treated with nilotinib for CML-CP.  
 
ALERT: ADR reporting may be required for some adverse events (See Section 10) 
 
• Omit = The current dose(s) for the specified drug(s) during a c ycle is skipped.  The patient does 
not make up the omitted dose(s) at a later time 
• Hold/Delay = The current dose(s) of all drugs during a cycle is  delayed.  The patient does make 
up the delayed dose(s) when the patient meets the protocol crit eria to restart drugs. 
• Discontinue = The specified drug(s) are totally stopped.

Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 4. Resume nilotinib within 2 weeks at  prior dose if QTc returns to < 450 msec and to 
within 20msec of baseline. 
5. If QTc is between 450msec and 480m sec after 2 weeks reduce the dose to 400mg  
daily 
6. If following a dose-reduction to 300mg  daily, the QTc returns to >480msec, nilotinib 
should be discontinued. 
7. An ECG should be repeated 7 days after any dose adjustment. 
 
8.5 Dose modification on chemotherapeutic agents 
Chemotherapeutic agents will be  given for Cycle 1 of induction (and also Cycle 2 if no 
CR is achieved after Cycle 1) regardless of the hematological p anel results (i.e. CBC 
results) because it is related to the underlying disease (acute  leukemia). If patient does not 
achieve CR by the end of Cycle 2  re-induction, the patient will discontinue treatment and 
go to event monitoring. Subsequent  cycles of consolidation are to be given after 
peripheral blood recovery. Peripheral blood recovery is defined  as ANC ≥1.0 x109/L, 
platelets ≥80 x109/L.  
Dose modification for chemothera peutic agents will be mainly ba sed on non-
hematological AEs as described be low. Dose adjustments will be re-evaluated at the 
beginning of each cycle, For exa mple, if a dose reduction was a pplied because of 
abnormal lab results on previous  cycle and the lab results norm alizes, then full dose will 
be given. Creatinine clearance w ill be calculated using Cockcro ft formula with total body 
weight and race adjustment.

9.0 Ancillary Treatment/Supportive Care 
9.1 Antiemetics may be used at the di scretion of the attending phys ician. 
 
9.2 Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as cli nically warranted and 
following institutional polic ies and recommendations.   
 
9.3 Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study.  This includes blood 
product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other n ewly diagnosed or 
concurrent medical conditions.  All blood products and concomit ant medications such 
as antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from  the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the 
medical records.  
9.4 Diarrhea:  This could be managed conservatively with lopera mide.  The recommended 
dose of loperamide is 4 mg at first onset, followed by 2 mg eve ry 2-4 hours until diarrhea 
free (maximum 16 mg/day). 
 
In the event of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive  measures are allowed:  
MC1284 41 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.   
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/o r associated with fever or 
severe neutropenia (grade 3 or 4), broad-spectrum antibiotics m ust be prescribed.  
Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospitalized  for intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte 
imbalances. 
 
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
Adverse events for this study will be collected while the patie nt is receiving protocol 
chemotherapy.   If the patient becomes eligible for Stem Cell T ransplant, neither the 
hospitalization nor prolonged hos pitalization for transplant wi ll be reported as an adverse 
event.  Adverse events related to the Stem Cell Transplant will not be collected.  At the time the patient returns to tr eatment with nilotinib, recording  of adverse events will 
resume. 
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (CTCAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE repor ting.  All appropriate treatme nt areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4. 0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site:  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm )    
 
10.11 Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of eve ry clinical trial.  
First, identify and grade the sev erity of the event using the C TCAE version 4.0.  
Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (se e Section 10.2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or  procedure (see 
Section 10.3).  With this information, determine whether the ev ent must be 
reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.4). Expedited r eports are to be 
completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specifie d in Sections 
10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be re ported via the 
routine data reporting mechanis ms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.52 
and 18.0). 
 10.12 Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representati on of a specific event 
used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a  single MedDRA 
Lowest Level Term (LLT).   
  
• NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by the above grading scale, is NOT  
the same as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section  10.4. 
 
10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
 
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agen t-specific 
information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
• Unexpected AEs are those not liste d in the agent-specific infor mation 
provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience  that is neither 
MC1284 42 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the inf ormation provided for IRB 
review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution 
 
When assigning attribution category, the attribution refers to the relationship to Cytarabine, 
Daunorubicin or Nilotinib (not Stem Cell Transplant). Adverse events are no t collected during 
Stem Cell Transplant. When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). 
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attrib uted to a 
medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causa l relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.   
 
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial  Agent(s) on 
the SAME Arm 
 
NOTE:  The combination of an investigat ional agent with a commercial agent is 
considered investigational.  
 
Routine Reporting  
 
• Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies u sing an 
investigational agent /intervention in combination with a comme rcial agent 
is stated in the protocol.  See Section 10.52.  
 
NOTE:   When a commercial agent(s) i s (are) used on the same 
treatment arm as the investiga tional agent/intervention (also, 
investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an  IND), the entire combination ( arm) is 
then considered an investigationa l intervention for reporting. 
 
Expedited Reporting 
 
• An AE that occurs on a combinat ion study must be assessed in ac cordance with 
the guidelines for CTEP investig ational agents/interventions in  Section 10.4, and 
where indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
 
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigationa l 
agent/intervention must be assesse d as specified in the protocol. In general, 
only Grade 4 and 5 AEs that are unexpected with at least possib le 
attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report .  Refer to 
Section 10.4 for specific AE re porting requirements or exceptions. 
 
MC1284 43 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 • Commercial agent expedited repor ts must be submitted by the Coo perative 
Group to the FDA via MedWatch. 
 
• An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expe cted AEs 
associated with a commercial a gent.  Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a h igher degree of severity, expe dited reporting 
is required.  The clinical inv estigator must determine severity . 
 
10.32 Special Situations for Expedited Reporting and submission of 
Notification Forms 
Exceptions to Expedited Reporting and Submission of Notificatio n Forms: 
EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events 1 
An expedited report or notification form may not be required fo r specific Serious 
Adverse Events where the AE is listed in Section 15.0 of the pr otocol as 
EXPECTED . Any protocol specific reporting procedures MUST BE 
SPECIFIED BELOW and will superced e the standard Expedited Adver se Event

results in hospitalization, then the standard expedited adverse  events reporting requirements must be 
followed. 
 
Specific protocol exceptions to expedited reporting should be r eported expeditiously by 
investigators ONLY  if they exceed the expect ed grade of the event. 
 
10.321  Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to c onduct normal life functions (for merly referred to 
as disabilities), congen ital abnormities or b irth defects, must  be reported 
immediately if they occur at any time following treatment with an agent under 
an IND/IDE since they are considered to be a serious AE and mus t be reported 
to the sponsor as specif ied in 21 CFR 312.64(b).

attributed to a CTCAE term  associated with Grade 5. 
 
• Sudden death NOS:  A sudden  (defined as instant or 
within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an 
unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed 
to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
 
• Death due to progressive d isease should be reported 
as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benigh, malignant and 
unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) – Other 
(Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class 
(SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death 
was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., 
radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) shoul d be submitted. 
 
10.323  Secondary Malignancy 
 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by treatment for a 
previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or  chemotherapy).  A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a m etastasis of the initial neopla sm. 
 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an IND/IDE be reported. Three options are available  to 
describe the event: 
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML]) 
 
MC1284 45 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
 
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outline d in each protocol.  
 
10.324  Second Malignancy 
 
• A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prio r 
malignancy (and is NOT a metasta sis from the initial malignancy ).  
Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting.

When possible, samples should be  obtained prior to the nilotini b dose. The exact time since the last dose 
should be documented. For the c orrelative studies, blood sample s should be collected at screening, pre-
treatment (day 4), day 8 day 14)  and upon marrow recovery. For the correlative studies, bone marrow 
aspirate samples should be collected at screening, day 14, and day upon marrow recovery. 
 
  14.2  Collection and Processing  
 
14.21 Serum Nilotinib level (PK study) 
 
For the determination of nilotin ib concentrations, 3 mL of whole blood will be 
drawn at each time point using a Serum Separator (SST) Vacutain erTM tube. 
The tube will be placed vertically  (avoiding prolonged contact with the rubber 
stopper) for about 30 minutes at room temperature and will then  be centrifuged at 
about 5 ºC for 10 minutes at approximately 1100 x g. This should be done within 60 minutes of drawing the sample. Immediately after centrifugat ion, the upper 
serum sample (about 1.5 mL) will be transferred into a 2-mL, ta pered, 
polypropylene screw-cap tube and stored frozen at ≤ -20 ºC unti l shipped (on 
dry-ice) to the analytical site for sample analyses. Document the time since last nilotinib dose on the sample tube.  
 
14.22    Correlative studies: Compare the pre-treatment with po st-treatment samples for 
the alteration of nilotinib’s direct and potential-indirect tar gets: 
             1) Manley et al (2010) demonstrated that nilotinib  has inhibitory effect 
on c-Kit, the direct measurement of c-Kit kinase activities by Western blot, will be performed, includi ng c-Kit phosphorylation, and i ts 
downstream effectors (e.g. AKT, ERK, STAT5); 
              2) Because the target pa tients are c-Kit overexpre ssion that critically 
drives leukemogenesis (Liu et al, 2010), the expression of c-Ki t mRNA 
and total protein will be examined by PCR and Western blot; 
              3) We demonstrated that c-Kit gene is regulated by Sp1 (Liu et al, 2010), 
therefore, Sp1 expression will be measured by PCR and Western b lot; 
 
             4) Since Sp1 is also a positive regulator of DNA m ethyltransferases 
(DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b), the expression of DNMTs will be 
investigated;  
 
             5) If the results from “4)” are positive, the global DNA methylation will 
be studied, since DNA methylati on is under control of DNMTs;

15.11 Background: Nilotinib is a protein tyrosi ne kinase (TK) inhibitor, which 
selectively inhibits the kinase activity of ABL and BCR-ABL, the sterile alpha 
motif and leucine zipper containing kinase (ZAK), the platelet- derived growth 
factor receptor (PDGFR), the stem cell factor receptor (KIT), t he colony 
stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R), the discoidin domain rece ptors (DDR) and 
of several ephrin receptors (e.g . EPHB4), and blocks the downst ream cellular 
events mediated by these enzymes. 
 
 Nilotinib is currently approved for the treatment of adult pat ients with 
Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia  (CML) in 
chronic phase (CP) and accelerated phase (AP) resistant to or intolerant to at least 
one prior therapy including imatinib and for the treatment of a dult patients with 
newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in CP. 
 
 Age is not expected to have an effect on the PK in the age ran ge of 15-85 years.  
In the pediatric population (age 1 to < 18 years), PK exposure in pediatric 
patients dosed at 230 mg/m
2 twice daily was comparable to the reference data for 
nilotinib 400 mg BID in adult Ph + CML patients.  No significant  effect of 
ethnicity and gender on dose-adjusted exposure of nilotinib was  observed.  
Following multiple oral doses of nilotinib, steady state concen trations were 
achieved as early as Cycle 1 Day 8 across the disease cohorts a nd age groups (2 
to 12 years, 12 to <18 years). The exposure of nilotinib after single dose/multiple 
doses was comparable across th e disease cohorts, within the respective age 
groups.  In addition, a flat expos ure-response relationship was  observed for 
efficacy (BCRABL/ABL% ratio and MMR) and incidence of adverse e vents 
(adverse events of special interest and/or hepatic abnormalitie s). This would 
suggest that the PK fluctuations at the dose of 230 mg/m2 bid in the age range of 
1-18 years would be too small to  affect response and, therefore , that dose and 
dosage regimen is appropriate. With regards to QT prolongation,  QTcF and 
QTcB prolongation potential was observed with increasing exposu re levels and at 
the median observed exposure for 230 mg/m2 bid. No significant exposure-
related changes were observed in the ECG parameters PR, QRS, an d heart rate. 
This is consistent with the already well known safety profile o f adult patients 
treated with nilotinib. 
 
15.12 Formulation: The drug product is formulated as an immediate release (IR) s olid 
oral dosage form (hard capsule). The HGCs contain the active dr ug substance 
nilotinib as the hydrochloride monohydrate salt at dosage stren gths of 50 mg, 150 
mg and 200 mg. The 150 mg and 200 mg  capsules strengths are cur rently 
MC1284 56 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 approved and marketed. Dosage strengths correspond to the free base. The 
inactive ingredients are collo idal silicon dioxide (silica, col loidal anhydrous), 
crospovidone, lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate, and polo xamer. 
 
15.13 Preparation and storage :  Do not store nilotinib capsules above 30°C (86°F).   
 15.14 Administration:   Nilotinib should be taken twice daily approximately 12 hours 
apart and must not be taken with food. The capsules should be s wallowed whole 
with water. For patients who are unable to swallow capsules, th e content of each 
capsule may be dispersed in one teaspoon of applesauce (pureed apple) and 
should be taken immediately.  Not  more than one teaspoon of applesauce and no 
food other than applesauce must be used. Food increases blood l evels of 
nilotinib. No food should be cons umed for 2 hours before the do se is taken and 
no food should be consumed for a t least one hour after the dose  is taken. Due to 
possible occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), correction o f clinically 
significant dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiating therapy with nilotinib. 
  15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
 a )   Absorption – The extent of nilotinib absorption following oral administra tion 
of drug was estimated to be a pproximately 30%.  The bioavailabi lity of nilotinib 
was increased when given with a meal. Compared to the fasted st ate, the 
systemic exposure (AUC) increased by 82% when the dose was give n 30 minutes 
after a high fat meal. 
 b )   Distribution:  The extent of nilotinib binding to human plasma was high 
(98% on average), and independent of concentration tested. 
 c )   Metabolism : Nilotinib is metabolized in the liver via oxidation and 
hydroxylation pathways, mediated primarily by CYP3A4. Nilotinib  was 
identified as the main circulating component in the serum, whil e none of the 
metabolites was found to contribute significantly to the pharma cological activity 
of nilotinib.  Hepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib.  A 
lower starting dose is recommended for patients with mild to se vere hepatic 
impairment (at baseline) and QT interval should be monitored cl osely. 
 d )   Excretion  – Primarily as metabolites: Feces (93%; 69% as unchanged drug) .  
The average elimination half-life of nilotinib is 17 hours.  St eady state conditions 
were achieved by Day 8.  
  15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :   
 Nilotinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 
and UGT1A1 in vitro, potentially increasing the concentrations of drugs 
eliminated by these enzymes. In vitro studies also suggest that  nilotinib may 
induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, and decrease the concentratio ns of 
drugs which are eliminated by these enzymes.  
 
Single-dose administration of nilotinib with midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) to healthy subjects increased midazolam exposure by 30%. Single-do se 
administration of nilotinib to healthy subjects did not change the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynami cs of warfarin (a CYP2C9 sub strate). The 
abilit
y of nilotinib to induce me tabolism has not been determin ed in vivo. 
Exercise caution when co-administ ering nilotinib with substrate s for these 
MC1284 57 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 enzymes that have a narrow therapeutic index. 
 
Nilotinib undergoes metabolism by  CYP3A4, and concomitant admin istration of 
strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 can increase or decrease nilotinib 
concentrations significantly. The  administration of nilotinib w ith agents that are 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. Concomitant use of nilotinib with 
medicinal products and herbal pre parations that are potent indu cers of CYP3A4 
is likely to reduce exposure to nilotinib to a clinically relev ant extent. Therefore, 
in patients receiving nilotinib, concomitant use of alternative  therapeutic agents 
with less potential for CYP3A4 induction should be selected. 
 
Nilotinib has pH-dependent solubility, with decreased solubilit y at higher pH. 
Drugs such as proton pump inhibitors that inhibit gastric acid secretion to elevate 
the gastric pH may decrease the solubility of nilotinib and reduce its 
bioavailability. Increasing the do se of nilotinib when co-administered with such 
agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Si nce proton pump 
inhibitors affect pH of the upper GI tract for an extended peri od, separation of 
doses may not eliminate the interaction. The concomitant use of  proton pump 
inhibitors with nilotinib is not recommended. When the concurrent use of a H2 
blocker is necessary, it may be administered approximately ten hours before and 
approximately two hours after the dose of nilotinib.  If necess ary, an antacid 
(aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/simethicone) may be adm inistered 
approximately two hours before or approximately two hours after the dose of 
nilotinib. 
 
Nilotinib inhibits human P-glycoprotein (P-gp).  If nilotinib i s administered with 
drugs that inhibit P-gp, increased  concentrations of nilotinib are likely, and 
caution should be exercised. 
 
The administration of nilotinib with agents that may prolong the QT interval, 
such as anti-arrhythmic medicines or serotonin receptor antagon ists, should be 
avoided. Data suggests nilotinib  has the potential to prolong c ardiac ventricular 
repolarization (QT interval). Thi s clinically meaningful prolongation of the QT 
interval may also occur when nilo tinib is inappropriately taken with food and/or 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  The  presence of hypokalemia and hypo magnesemia 
may place patients at risk of developing QT prolongation.  
The effects of nilotinib on the pharmacokinetics of valsartan were assessed in a 
healthy volunteer study [CAMN107A2132]. The results showed limi ted effects 
of nilotinib on valsartan PK which indicates that nilotinib doe s not inhibit 
OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1) uptake tra nsporter in a 
competitive and time-dependent manner.  There is an ongoing study to evaluate the effects of nilotinib on the 
pharmacokinetics of valsartan in healthy volunteers [CAMN107A21 32]. This 
study is intended to provide further clarification about possib le nilotinib-
mediated OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1) i nhibition. 
  Food Effect : The bioavailability of nilotin ib is increased with food. Nilotinib 
must not be taken with food. No food should be taken at least 2  hours before and 
at least one hour after the dose is taken. Grapefruit products and ot
her foods that 
MC1284 58 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 are known to inhibit CYP3A4 should be avoided.   
 
15.17 Known potential toxicities :  Consult the Investigator’s Brochure for the most 
current and complete information.  
 
Important Safety Information including Boxed WARNING: QT PROLONGATION AND SUDDEN DEATH S. Nilotinib prolongs the QT 
interval. Prior to nilotinib administration and periodically, m onitor for 
hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia a nd correct deficiencies. Obtain ECGs to 
monitor the QTc at baseline, seven days after initiation, and p eriodically 
thereafter, and follow any dose ad justments.  Sudden deaths hav e been 
reported in patients receiving nilotinib. Do not administer to patients with 
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome. Avoid use of 
concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval and strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors.  Patients should avoid food 2 hours before and 1 ho ur after 
taking dose.  
 
Patients should be tested for hepatitis B infection before init iating treatment with 
nilotinib, as reactivation of hepatitis B can occur in patients  who are chronic 
carriers of this virus and are receiving a BCR-ABL tyrosine kin ase inhibitor 
(TKI). Experts in liver should be  consulted before treatment is initiated in 
patients with positive hepatitis B serology (including those wi th active disease) 
and for patients who test positive for hepatitis B infection du ring treatment. 
Carriers of hepatitis B virus who require treatment with niloti nib should be 
closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active hepatitis B infection such as liver injury or progression of liv er injury throughout therapy and for several 
months following termination of therapy.

Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 complete their monthly treatmen t course.Lactation:  Excretion o f nilotinib in 
breast milk has not been studied in humans, but is excreted in animal breast milk. 
Women should not breast-feed while taking nilotinib, as a risk to the infant 
cannot be excluded. 
 Ischemic vascular or ischemic c ardiovascular events: Newly diag nosed or 
worsened Ischemic Vascular and Ischemic Cardiovascular Events s uch as 
Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Ischemic Cerebrovascular Event (I CVE) or 
Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAOD) have occurred in a relatively small 
number of CML chronic phase patients treated with nilotinib.  The majority of 
reported events were in patients with associated risks. 
 15.18 Drug procurement Drug will be provided free of charge to study participants by N ovartis 
Pharmaceuticals. 
 
15.19 Nursing Guidelines 
 
15.191  Patients should take nilotinib twice daily approximately 12 hou rs apart 
on an empty stomach (no food 2 hours prior or 1 hour after a do se) 
with water.  Capsules may be dispersed in one teaspoon of applesauce (pureed apple) and should be taken immediately. Do not use more  than 
one teaspoon of applesauce and no f ood other than applesauce mu st be 
used.  
 
15.192  Nilotinib is known to prolong the QT interval. Patients with a history 
of long QT syndrome should not receive nilotinib. Sudden death has 
been reported in patients r eceiving nilotinib. Assess patient’s  
concomitant medications,   for other medications that may prolo ng the 
QT interval. These medications s hould be avoided . Patients shou ld 
undergo a baseline and 7 days post initiation ECG to assess the  QTc 
and periodically thereafter.  
 15.193  Nilotinib is known to have significant drug-drug interactions w ith 
strong CYP3A4 inducers and should be avoided.  Additionally, ca ution 
should be used when administered with drugs that inhibit P-
glycoprotien as this can increas e the levels of nilotinib. Asse ss patients 
concomitant medications, over th e counter, and herbal supplemen ts, 
avoid those that may i nteract with nilotinib. 
 
15.194  Patients should avoid the use of protein pump inhibitors, if absolutely 
necessary, use with caution. If necessary to administer with an  H2 
blocker or antacid, doses should be separated from the nilotini b by at 
least 2 hours. 
 
15.195  May cause headache. Treat sympt omatically and monitor for 
effectiveness. 
 15.196  Rash and itching may occur. Instruct patients to report rash to  study 
team. Treat symptomatically and assess for effectiveness. 
 
MC1284 62 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 15.197  GI disturbances are common (na usea, constipation, diarrhea, 
vomiting).  Assess patients for need of premedication prior to nilotinib 
and/or treat symptomatically and monitor for effectiveness. 
 
15.198  Monitor electrolytes (especially potassium and magnesium).  Do not 
administer nilotinib to patients with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia. These electrolyte  disturbances should be correc ted 
prior to initiating therapy and monitored periodically. 
 
15.199a Monitor LFT’s. Patients with elevated LFT’s may need do se   
reductions.  
 
15.199b Monitor CBC. Cytopenias are common. Instruct patient to  report any 
signs or symptoms of infection, unusual bruising or bleeding to  the 
study team. 
 15.199c Instruct patient to report any rash to the study team.  
 15.199d Headache is commonly seen. Treat patient symptomaticall y and 
monitor for effectiveness. 
15.199e Monitor for eye disorder s (hemorrhage, periorbital edem a, itching, 
conjunctivitis and dryness). Instr uct patients to report these symptoms 
to study team. Refer to Ophthalmology as necessary.  
15.199f Hypertension can be seen. 
15.199g Patients shoul d undergo testing for Hepatitis B, as a r eactivation of 
Hepatitis B can occur.  
15.999h Tumor lysis syndrome can occur, correction of clinically signif icant 
dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels should occur  prior to 
initiation of therapy.  
 
15.2 Daunorubicin  
 
15.21 Background: Daunorubicin inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis by intercalation 
between DNA base pairs and by steric obstruction. Daunorubicin intercalates at 
points of local uncoiling of the  double helix. Although the exa ct mechanism is 
unclear, it appears that direct binding to DNA (intercalation) and inhibition of 
DNA repair (topoisomerase II inhi bition) result in blockade of DNA and RNA 
synthesis and fragmentation of DNA.

15.299 Inform patient that urine may be pink or red for up to 4 8 hours after 
administration. 
 15.3 Cytarabine (Cytosar, ARAC) 
 
15.31 Background: Cytarabine (cytosine arabinos ide) inhibits DNA synthesis. 
Cytosine gains entry into cells  by a carrier process, and then must be converted to 
its active compound, aracytidine triphosphate. Cytosine is a py rimidine analog 
and is incorporated into DNA; however, the primary action is in hibition of DNA 
polymerase resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair. Cytarabine is specific for the S phase of the cell cycle (blocks progression from the G
1 to the S 
phase). 
 
15.32 Formulation: Commercially available for injection, powder for reconstituti on: 
100 mg, 500 mg, 1 gram, 2 gram 
 15.33 Preparation, storage, and stability : Store intact vials of powder at room 
temperature 15ºC to 30ºC (59ºF to 86ºF). Reconstitute with bact eriostatic 
water for injection. Reconstitute d solutions are stable for up to 8 days at 
room temperature, although the manufacturer recommends use with in 48 
hours. Further dilution in 250-1000 mL of D5W or 0.9% NaCL is s table 
for 8 days at room temperature ( 25C). Note: Solutions containin g 
bacteriostatic agents should not be used for the preparation of  either high 
doses or intrathecal doses of cytarabine.  
15.34 Administration:   Refer to the drug treatment section of the protocol for speci fic 
administration directions and infusion rates.  
15.35   Pharmacokinetic information : 
Distribution:  V
d: Total body water; widely and rapidly since it enters the 
cells readily; crosses blood-brai n barrier with CSF levels of 4 0% to 50% of 
plasma level Metabolism:  Primarily hepatic; metabolized  by deoxycytidine kinase and 
other nucleotide kinases to aracytidine triphosphate (active); about 86% to 
96% of dose is metabolized to inactive uracil arabinoside. 
Half-life elimination: I.V.: Initial: 7-20 minutes; Terminal: 1-3 hours. Excretion : Urine (~80%) within 24 hours 
  15.36 Potential Drug Interactions :   
Decreased Effect: Cytarabine may decrease the effect of Flucytosine; cytarabine 
may decrease digoxin absorption.

 15.391 Can be a potent myelosupp ressive agent. Monitor CBC clos ely. Anemia, 
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are expected. Nadir within 5-7  days 
with recovery expected in 2-3 weeks. Hematological toxicity is more 
intense if ARA-C is given as a continuous IV infusion versus an  IV 
bolus. 
 15.392 Nausea and vomiting is dose -related, common, and often preventable 
with antiemetic drugs. Administer as ordered and assess for their effectiveness. 
 15.393 Instruct patient of possibility of metallic taste.  The use of sugarless hard 
candies may lessen this effect. 
 15.394 Stomatitis is possible.  Instruct patient not to swallow . 
 
15.395 May cause pancreatitis or peritonitis. Instruct patient to report any severe 
or worsening abdominal pain immediately. 
 
15.396 Monitor LFT’s-elevations of LFT’s may occur.

muscle pain, chest pain, fever, general weakness, reddened eyes , and 
skin rash. Report these to the MD, as patient may need to be tr eated with 
corticosteroids. 
 
16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview 
This is a phase II study of a combination of Nilotinib, cytarab ine, and daunorubicin in 
patients with newly diagnosed A ML with Kit overexpression.   Th is study will use a one-
stage design with an interim an alysis to assess the efficacy of  this combination.   
 
16.11 Endpoint:   The primary endpoint in this trial is the pro portion of complete 
responses during induction therap y.  A success is defined as a CR or CRi as the 
objective status during induction therapy.  Throughout Section 16.0, complete 
response will be considered synonymous with “success”, unless s pecified 
otherwise.  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who h ave signed a consent 
form and have begun treatment w ill be evaluable for response. 
 
16.2  Statistical Design: 
 
16.21 Decision Rule:    In a previous phase 3 randomized  study including 582 patients with previously 
untreated AML who were treated with induction therapy of daunor ubin combined 
with cytarabine, 64% of patients received a complete response ( Fernandez et al, 
2009).  More specifically, the complete response rate was 57% in 293 patients 
treated at the standard dose (45 mg/m2) of daunorubicin and 71%  in 289 patients 
treated at a higher dose (90 mg/m2) of daunorubicin.  This stud y will include 
patients with previously untreated AML who will be treated with  induction 
therapy of 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin combined with cytarabine and t he addition of 
nilotinib.  It is expected that a dose of 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin  combined with 
cytarabine will have a complete response rate similar to the hi gher dose group of 
the previous phase 3 study.  How ever, that study included only patients between 
17 and 60 years of age, while the  median age at diagnosis of AML is 
approximately 57 years.  This stud y will include patients of all ages and thus a 
MC1284 68 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 lower rate of complete response is expected.  Therefore, a comp lete response rate 
of 60% is a reasonable estimate for 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin combined with 
cytarabine in the population th at will be accrued to this study .  The addition of 
nilotinib to this combination is  anticipated to increase the co mplete response rate.   
 
This study will include only pa tients with Kit overexpression.  Studies looking at 
the effect of Kit overexpression on complete response rate have  not yet been 
conducted.  If there is any new e vidence showing an effect of Kit overexpression 
on complete response rate for previously untreated AML patients  treated with 
daunorubicin plus cytarabine, it will be taken into considerati on when evaluating 
the efficacy of this regimen.     The largest success proportion wher e the proposed treatment reg imen would be 
considered ineffective in this population is 60%, and the small est success 
proportion that would warrant sub sequent studies with the proposed regimen in 
this patient populatio n is 80%.  A one-stage  design with an int erim analysis based 
on a Simon optimum design uses 39 evaluable patients to test th e null hypothesis 
that the true complete response rate is at most 60%.   
 
16.211     Interim Analysis:  Enter 18 evaluable patients into the study.  If 11 or 
fewer successes are observed in t he first 18 evaluable patients , we will 
consider this regimen ineffective in this patient population an d 
terminate this study.  Otherwi se, if the number of successes is  at least 
12, we will continue accrual. 
 
16.212     Final Decision Rule:  If 27 or fewer successes are o bserved in the first 
39 evaluable patients, we will c onsider this regimen ineffective in this 
patient population. If 28 or more successes are observed in the first 39 
evaluable patients, we may recommend further testing of this re gimen 
in subsequent studies in this population. 
 16.213     Over Accrual: If more than the target number of pati ents are accrued, 
the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi ng rule or 
used in any decision making process.  Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.34. 
 
16.214     NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interim ana lysis to allow the 
first 18 patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is  
observed. Given the limited overa ll sample size and the inclusi on of an 
adverse events stopping rule, we feel it is ethical to not halt  accrual for 
the interim analysis. However, if accrual is extremely rapid, w e may 
temporarily suspend accrual in order to obtain safety data on t hese 
patients before re-opening accr ual to further patients. 
 
16.22 Sample Size:  This study is expected to require a minimum  of 18 and a maximum 
of 39 evaluable patients. We anticipate accruing 4 additional patients to account 
for ineligibility, cancellation , major treatment violation, or other reasons.  
Therefore, the study is expected to accrue a maximum of 43 pati ents overall. 
 16.23 Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual  rate is 1-2 evaluable 
patients per month.  Therefore, the accrual period is expected to be 2 years.  The 
MC1284 69 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 primary endpoint will be evaluat ed approximately 2.5 years after the trial opens, 
or after the last patient accrued has been observed for at least 2 months and data 
collection for the induction phase is complete.  The total stud y duration is 
expected to be approximately 4.5  years, or until all patients h ave completed all 
cycles of treatment.   
 
16.24 Power and Significance Level:  Assuming that the number o f successes is 
binomially distributed, the significance level is .08, i.e. the re is an 8% chance of 
finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The pro bability of declaring 
that this regimen warrants furth er study (i.e. statistical powe r) under various 
success proportions and the probability of stopping accrual aft er the interim 
analysis can be tabulated as a function of the true success pro portion as shown in 
the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further study is… 0.08 0.22 0.45 0.71 0.90 
and the probability of stopping after 
the interim analysis is … 0.63 0.45 0.28 0.14 0.05 
 
16.25 Other considerations:  Adv erse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scienti fic discoveries or 
changes in standard care will be taken into account in any deci sion to terminate 
the study 
 
16.3 Analysis Plan  
16.31 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
 
16.311 Definition:  The primary endpoint of this trial is the p roportion of 
complete responses to induction th erapy.  A success is defined as a CR or 
CRi as the objective status durin g induction therapy. All patie nts meeting 
the eligibility criteria who have  signed a consent form and hav e begun 
treatment will be evaluable for response.   
 
16.312 Estimation:  The proportion of successes will be estimat ed by the number 
of successes divided by the total  number of evaluable patients.  
Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duff y and Santner (Duffy D 1987). 
 
16.32 Secondary Outcome Analyses:  These analyses will include all patients meeting 
the eligibility criteria who have  signed a consent form and hav e begun treatment, 
including patients who fail to achieve a complete response afte r 2 cycles of 
treatment (unless noted otherwise). 
 
16.321 Overall survival time is  defined as the time from regist ration to death 
due to any cause. The distribution of survival time will be est imated 
using the method of Kaplan-Meie r(Kaplan E 1958).  In addition, the 
overall survival rate at 2 years after registration will be rep orted. 
 
MC1284 70 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 16.322   Disease free survival tim e is defined for all evaluabl e patients who have 
achieved a CR or CRi as the time from registration to relapse o r death 
due to any cause.  The distributio n of disease-free survival will be 
estimated using the method of Kap lan-Meier.  In addition, the d isease-
free survival rate at 2 years after registration will be report ed. 
 
16.323  Duration of complete response is defined for all evaluable patients who 
have achieved a CR or CRi as the date at which the patient’s ob jective 
status is first noted to be a CR or CRi to the earliest date re lapse is 
documented. The distribution of duration of complete response w ill be 
estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier 
 16.324 Adverse Events:  All eligible patients that have initiat ed treatment will be 
considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum 
grade for each type of adverse ev ent will be recorded for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be revie wed to determine patterns.  
Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. 
 
16.33  Correlative Analyses  
16.331  Prognostic and predictive factors including age, Kit mu tation/expression, 
Flt3 mutation and whether the patient received a transplant wil l be 
assessed.  These factors will be s ummarized and used to help 
characterize the types of patie nts accrued to this trial. In ad dition, we will 
explore differences in the distributions of these risk factors by clinical outcome (disease-free survival status at 2 years and whether th e patient 
remains in sustained CR). Nonpara metric quantitative comparison s by 
group will be made as appropriate (Fisher’s exact or Wilcoxon r ank 
sum).  Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank statistics will be use d to 
compare between groups for time-to-event measures.  Given the l imited 
number of patients, the difference in risk factor distribution by outcome 
will be largely exploratory. 
 
16.332  In patients who are Kit mutation positive at diagnosis and achieve a 
complete molecular remission (i.e. negative RT-PCR for Kit muta tion) to 
treatment, the Kit mutation status (positive vs. negative) will  be 
reassessed at time of relapse.   Due to the small number of patients that are expected to be in this subgr oup, this analysis will be prim arily 
descriptive in nature. 
 
16.333  MRD will be assessed by PCR or flow cytometry at the en d of each 
phase of treatment (induction, consolidation, and maintenance) and at 
time of relapse.  MRD status will be correlated with response u sing 
Fisher’s exact test.  In addition, the relationship between MRD  status 
(positive vs. negative) and di sease-free survival will be evalu ated using 
landmark analyses. 
 
16.34 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be u sed to evaluate the stopping r ule or used in any 
MC1284 71 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 decision making processes; however, they will be included in fi nal endpoint 
estimates and confidence intervals. 
 
16.4 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
 
16.41 The principle investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developing. The M ayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual an d safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided  by the MCCC 
Statistical Office. 
 
16.42 Adverse Event Stopping Rules:   The stopping rules specif ied below are based on 
the knowledge available at study development.  We note that the Adverse Event 
Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the st udy re-opening to 
accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the 
treatment(s) under investigati on.  The study team may choose to  suspend accrual 
because of unexpected adverse even t profiles that have not cros sed the specified 
rule below. 
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any t ime we observe 
events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
event with attribute specified as  “possible,” “probable,” or “definite”) that satisfy one of the following: 
 
• if 4 or more patients in the first 12 treated patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least possibly related to treatment 
excluding infections and hypophosphatamia, hypocalcemia, hypo- or 
hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia as these abnormal lab results tend to resolve 
quickly (≤7 days) without affecting or jeopardizing patient saf ety. 
 
• if after the first 12 patients have been treated, 30% of all pa tients experience 
a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least poss ibly related to 
treatment excluding infections a nd hypophosphatamia, hypocalcem ia, hypo- 
or hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia as these abnormal lab results te nd to resolve 
quickly (≤7 days) without affecting or jeopardizing patient saf ety.  
 
Grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities will be excluded only if the study PI has 
determined that they are not associated with any clinically sig nificant events. 
 Note:  Stem cell transplant will not be considered part of protocol treatment and 
attribution refers to the relationship to Cytarabine, Daunorubi cin or Nilotinib (not 
Stem Cell Transplant). Adverse events are not recorded during S tem Cell 
Transplant (see section 10.0).  We note that we will review grade  4 and 5 adverse events deemed  “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to mo nitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment-related adverse event.  
MC1284 72 Mayo Addendum 9 
Protocol Version Date:  February 7, 2019 16.5   Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activa tion, this study will have been 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary  and Secondary Endpoints 
along with other required information for this study will be reported on 
ClinicalTrials.gov. For purposes of timing of the Results Repor ting, the initial estimated 
completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 2.5 y ears after the study opens 
to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date ” (PECD) for this study 
is at the time the last patient registered has been followed fo r at least 2 months. 
 
16.6 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
 
16.61 This study will be availabl e to all eligible patients, re gardless of race, gender, or 
ethnic origin. 
 
16.62 There is no information currently available regarding dif ferential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender, or ethnicity, and t here is no reason to 
expect such differences to exis t. Therefore, although the plann ed analysis will, as 
always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racia l and gender 
groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power 
for subset analyses. 
 
16.63 The geographical region served by MCCC has a population w hich includes 
approximately 3% minorities.  Based on prior MCCC studies invol ving similar 
disease sites, we expect about 3-5% of patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 30% of patients  will be women. Expected sizes of  racial by 
gender subsets are shown in the following table:

 Study Design:  
This is a prospective, open- label, multicenter, single -dose study designed to develop a 
normative database of TUV
joint in HCs and to assess the feasibility of qualitative and 
quantitative SPECT/CT assessments in HCs and subjects with active RA  following Tc 
99m tilmanocept administration . 
Tilmanocept Uptake Value ( TUV ) is a quantitative imaging metric used to characterize 
Tc 99m tilmanocept uptake on planar imaging. Results from prior Phase 1 and 2 studies  have demonstrated that TUV is a sensitive and specific predictor of visually 
interrogated Tc 99m tilmanocept localization in joint regions with presumed inflammatory macrophage activity. A per -joint TUV (TUV
joint) relati ve ratio will be 
calculated for the each of the 22 DAS -28 joints located in the hands and wrists. A 
subject -level global TUV (TUV global) assessed across the 22 joints will be used as an 
indication of overall disease burden. TUV metrics are further describe d in the NAV3 -
35 Statistical Analysis Plan.  
This study is stratified into 2 arms . Arm 1 is compris ed of 120 HCs , and Arm 2 is 
comprised of 5 HCs and 10 clinically diagnosed RA subjects on stable treatment.

 Rationale for Sample Size:  
The study will enroll up to 135 evaluable subjects in Arms 1 and 2 allocated below, 
imaged at up to 8 study centers. Arm 1 will have N = 120 evaluable HC subjects, Arm 2 
will have N = 15 (5 HCs and 10 RA) evaluable subjects. A subject is considered 
evaluable if he/she me ets the criteria for the analysis population and has the data 
necessary for computing the primary endpoint.  
The sample size for Arm 1 was determined to provide acceptable precision for the 
estimated 5 and 95 percentiles. These percentiles will be estimated  with 95% 
nonparametric confidence intervals. Although the standard error formula for quantile 
estimators is known and quantile estimators obey a central limit theorem, relying on the asymptotic Normal distribution seems imprudent.  
The sample will be stratified 3:1, females  males to reflect RA incidence in the United 
States. The sex -specific samples will be further stratified by age to reflect the Census 
estimated US population in 2019. The target sample sizes are given below. 
Age Range  Male  Female  Total  
30 to 39 years  8 23 31 
40 to 49 years  7 21 28 
50 to 59 years  8 22 30 
60 to 69 years  7 21 28 
70 years and oldera 6 21 27 
Total  36 108 144 
a An effort will be made to target enrollment in this group to include 2 men and 8 women 80 years old and 
over.  
The existing data for HC subjects was used in a bootstrap procedure to evaluate the width of 95% confidence intervals for the 95 percentiles for various sample sizes. The sponsor 
has decided for its business purposes that knowing the percentile to within 0.05 of its 
true value is sufficient. A sample of size N = 144 HC results (this includes the subjects from Arm 1 of NAV3 -31) in 95% confidence inter vals with half -widths less than 0.05. 
The sample size for Arm 2 was determined to be sufficient for the business purposes of the sponsor. The sample size for Arm 2 will be 5 HCs and 10 RA subjects.

 Efficacy  Assessments:  
Primary Endpoint(s) 
ARM 1  
• The normal limits of TUV joint (on a per joint basis) in HC subjects, which are 
defined as the 5 and 95 percentiles of TUVjoint of bilateral  joints (i.e., bilateral 
wrists, m etacarpophalangeal joint [MCPs], p roximal interphalangeal [PIPs]). 
The normal range will be determined separately for each of the three blinded 
readers.  
 ARM 2  
• The qualitative evaluations of SPECT/CT in detecting localization within synovial spaces of the bilateral hands and wrists in HCs and RA subjects. 
 
Secondary Endpoints 
ARM 1  
• Applicability of the Normal (Gaussian) distribution to TUV joint data.  
 
 ARM 2  
• Quantitative evaluations of Tc 99m tilmanocept localization from SPECT/CT 
within synovial spaces of the bilateral hands and wrists in HCs and RA 
subjects.  
• Normative joint- specific standardized uptake value ( SUV). 
 
• Predictive value of planar scans for SPECT/CT scans.  
 
Statistical Methods:  
Primary Endpoint Arm 1  
The distribution of TUV joint in HC subjects will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics: mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum, and median per reader, 
joint, and view. The 5 and 95 percentiles will be estimated with quanti le regression fitting 
an intercept as a fixed term. The lower and upper limits of normal TUV joint will be 
determined using non- parametric confidence intervals and kernel density -based 
confidence intervals.  
Primary Endpoint Arm 2  
Localization of tilmanocept in the hands and wrists will be summarized with frequency 
counts and percentages by reader and joint.

 Secondary Endpoint Arm 1  
Normal quantile plots will be provided per joint and reader, along with the p- value for 
the Shapiro- Wilk test of Normality.  
Secondary Endpoint s Arm 2  
SUV will be calculated and summarized on both a per- joint and a total of all joints with 
summary statistics: mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum, and median. 
The predictive value of planar scans for SPECT/CT qualitative fin dings will be 
summarized per joint and reader with a crosstabulation and the uncertainty coefficients 
for row | column, column | row, and symmetric. The planar result will be deemed 
“positive” (i.e., inflamed) if TUV joint > 95 percentile of the reader resu lts for the same 
joint in Arm 1. Otherwise, the planar result will be deemed “negative”.  
Additional statistical methods are described in Section 9.5 and in the NAV3-35

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Worldwide, approximately 1 in 200 adults suffer from RA. In the US, 1.3 million adults are 
living with RA. Each year, about 130,000 Americans are newly diagnosed with RA. Persons 
with inadequately controlled RA have significantly shorter life expectancies and frequently become disabled, leading to reduced quality of life and severe adverse economic consequences  
[1-4]. 
It has been realized for many years that RA patients who are placed on DMARDs soon after they develop arthritis symptoms respond much more favorably to these therapies than do patients whose initiation of DMARD therapy is delayed [5]. Many more of thes e early RA 
patients placed on therapy achieve disease remission than is observed in RA patients who  do 
not initiate DMARD therapy until after they have been symptomatic for RA for 6 or more months. Furthermore, those early RA patients placed on timely therapy who do not achieve remission experience less severe disease [ 6-8]. Indeed , the early diagnosis of RA affords a 
“window of opportunity” for the greatest probability of effective RA therapy and the possibility of disease remission [ 9]. This window closes 3 to 6 months after patients become symptomatic 
with RA. The problem is that only a portion of patients first presenting with arthritis have RA and differentiating those patients who have RA from those who do not is challenging, leading frequently to delays in accurately identifying those patients with RA.  
The realization that early diagnosis of RA is critical for delivering the most effective RA 
treatment led to a collaboration between t he American College of Rheumatology and the 
European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) that resulted in 2010 in the publication of new criteria for diagnosi ng RA [10]. The intent of the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria was to 
improve the diagnosis of early RA. This intent was only partially realized. There have been numerous publications reporting the results of studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria for identifying early RA patients. In a meta -analysis of this  
literature [11], it was shown that the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria has a 73% sensitivity and a 
74% specificity for correctly identifying early RA. If the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria are used to decide who should receive DMARD therapy, this meta -analysis indicates that over a quarter 
of true early RA patients would not be provided with appropriate DMARD therapy during the critical window of opportunity for  an optimal response. Furthermore, a significant portion of 
arthritis patients who do not have RA would be prescribed DMARD therapies for which they would not receive benefit and would be exposed to possible adverse side effects of the drugs. Clearly there remains an unmet need for a more accurate means to identify early RA patients , 
to improve aggregate outcomes for early RA patients , and to reduce adverse drug effects and 
healthcare co sts associated with unproductive delivery of RA therapies to individuals who do 
not have RA.  
Basic research on the pathobiology of RA has revealed that the inflammation observed in RA 
is the consequence of a self -perpetuating pathological alteration in th e expression and 
downstream signaling of a network of cytokines  [12, 13]. Frequently, a t the center of this 
cytokine network is the overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)  [14-17].

 Recognition of the importance of disturbances in cytokine expression and especially that of 
TNF𝛼𝛼 formed the underlying rationale for the development of many antibody based bi ologic 
therapies intended to block signaling by TNF 𝛼𝛼 or one of the other various inflammatory 
cytokines involved in RA pathology [ 18-21] . Many of these cytokine -directed RA biologic 
therapies have been granted regulatory approval and are currently commercially available.  
While many RA patients have benefited from recent advances in RA therapies, problems and 
deficiencies remain. Among these problems and deficiencies are:  
• A significant portion of RA patients do not respond to RA therapies or respond 
insufficiently to RA therapies to achieve therapeutic goals [ 22, 23] , 
• All current RA therapies are associated with adverse effects, which can be common and/or severe [ 24],  
• Many cu rrent RA therapies, especially the biologic therapies , are exceedingly 
expensive, placing an imposing burden on healthcare costs [ 25] and affordability [ 26], 
and 
• Nearly all RA therapies lack an adequate defined diagnostic element that can facilitate  
choosing an individual patient’s therapeutic regimen  that provides the highest 
probability of an effective treatment response.  
 Quantitative assessment of CD206 positivity of inflamed synovia in RA patients is expected to remedy, at least partially, all 4 of these problems and deficiencies.  Tc 99m tilmanocept is a 
synthetic radiopharmaceutical imaging agent that was purposefully designed to be a high affinity ligand for CD206. CD206 is highly upregulated on phenotypically activated 
macrophages that contribute mechanistically to the underlying pathobiology of RA.  It has long 
been  recognized  that activated  macrophages  contribute significantly  to RA pathology
 [27-29]. 
Macrophages  are common  in inflamed  synovial tissues  when  patients  are first diagnosed with 
RA [30] and frequently become more  numerous as the disease progre sses. Activated  
macrophages  produce most of the TNFα  that, in a significant proportion of cases,  drives and 
perpetuates  the inflammatory  cycle in RA [14]. In the synovial sublining of a joint affected  by 
RA, activated  macrophages  are frequently the dominant cell type [31-33] . Activated  
macrophages  significantly  contribute to the destruction  of bone and cartilage through their 
secretion  of proteases  [34, 35]. Furthermore,  the densities  of synovial membrane macrophages 
measured  before  treatment,  and especially  the densities  of sublining macrophages,  have been  
reported  to predict  future  joint damage [36-39] . Not surprisingly, activated synovial 
mac
rophage numbers —but not the numbers of other immune cell types —correlate with 
radiographically determined joint destruction in RA [ 36, 37]. Thus, CD206 positivity of 
inflamed synovia in RA patients is expected to provide clinically significant prognostic information for RA patients . Another important finding is that activated macrophage numbers 
are reduced by effective RA therapy [ 38], but do not significantly change over the course of at 
least months if a patient w as given ineffective RA therapy  [40]. Also, importantly, reductions 
in activated synovial macrophages associated with effective RA therapy typically occur before treatment mediated changes  in the severity of clinical symptoms can be observed [41]. Thus, 
a change in activated synovial macrophage numbers is now recognized as a biomarker that provides an objective and early measure of responses to RA therapies [ 42, 43].  In fact, a 
change in activated synovial macrophage numbers is considered a more accurate measure of

 treatment response than clinical assessments, which are highly subjective in nature and prone 
to observer error [ 42, 44, 45]. Therefore, there is a possibility that future clinical studies may 
show that quantitative assessment of CD206 positivity of inflamed synovia in RA patients could be used to monitor the efficacy of RA therapies, providing physicians and patients  with 
earlier and more objective criteria to abandon ineffective therapies and adopt alternative therapies that may be more effective.  
In recent years, synovial biopsy- enabled studies have greatly increased our understanding of 
the pathological processes occurring within the inflamed joints of RA patients [ 39].  An 
important finding of these studies has  been that the inflammatory cell compositions of RA 
inflamed joints can vary between patients [ 46, 47]. The biopsy specimens obtained from 
different RA patients can have different numbers and densities of macrophages and monocytes, lymphocytes and lymphocyte containing structures, and fibroblast -like synoviocytes [48]. 
These differences in cellular composition suggest that RA inflammation can be divided into 3 pathotypes, referred to as diffuse m yeloid, lympho-myeloid, and fibroid respectively [ 49, 50] . 
Myeloid pathotype variants have  the highest density of macrophages, whereas  the fibroid 
pathotype is largely devoid of both macrophages and lymphoid cells. These  pathotypes are not 
fully discreet with some overlap occurring. However, they  provide a strong basis for temporal 
or cytological compartmentalization in RA disease natural history.  
Current studies utilizing IHC analyses of synovial biopsies are insufficie nt to determine the 
distribution of the various pathotypes in RA patients but suggest that the diffuse myeloid and 
lympho- myeloid  pathotypes are about equally frequent in RA patients with the fibroid  
pathotype being less common. There is growing evidence t hat patients with different RA 
pathotypes respond differently to various therapies, holding out the possibility that determining the RA pathotype of an individual patient’s RA can direct choice of the most effective therapy for that patient (i.e. , personal ized RA therapy) [ 50]. This is an area of ongoing active 
investigation in RA therapy research [ 51-53] . However, already there is significant evidence 
indicating that patients with a myeloid -driven  RA pathotype and/or with high densities of 
macrophages in their inflamed synovium respond best to anti -TNFα biologic therapy [50, 54], 
whereas patients wi th a f ibroid pathotype do not respond significantly to anti -TNFα therapy. 
Although these results need to be confirmed and elaborated upon in further studies, they 
suggest that determination of the density of activated macrophages in the inflamed synovial membranes of patients with RA could facilitate identification of those RA patients who  would 
most benefit from anti- TNFα therapy and/or those who would not receive benefit. Additional 
work in this field seeks to determine if similar associations between the efficacies of other treatments and synovial pathotypes can identify those treatme nts that are most effective in 
patients with lympho- myeloid and/or fibroid RA pathotypes. Such results, if attained, would 
provide a great benefit to RA patients by enabling personalized delivery of an optimal 
treatments to all RA patients.  
Previously generated results from clinical imaging studies conducted by Navidea and extensive 
peer reviewed scientific literature strongly indicate that Tc  99m tilmanocept can enable non -
invasive imaging of aggregates of CD206 expressing cells associated with various pa thologies 
using planar scintigraphy. While it  has been suggested that synovial biopsy and IHC 
evaluations might be translatable to common rheumatological clinical practice, there  are 5

 reasons why quantitative assessment of CD206 positivity enabled by Tc  99m tilmanocept 
imaging may be preferred to synovial biopsies for evaluations of RA patients. 
First, biopsy procedures usually sample a single joint. If variation exists between the 
pathotypes of different joints in the same patient, biopsy studies cannot detect or quantify this variation. Current RA therapies and new therapies in development are, by their designed targets, likely to be more effective against specific RA pathotypes. If pathotype variation occurs within individual RA patients, this could seve rely limit the ability of pathotype 
determination by biopsy to accurately predict treatment response. A key advantage of Tc 99m tilmanocept imaging over synovial biopsies is that Tc 99m
 tilmanocept imaging can provide a 
global quantitative assessment of all joints, providing Tc 99m tilmanocept imaging with the 
possibility of detecting pathotype variation without biopsies. Navidea’s proposed studies will directly assess RA inflammatory variation within individual patients and provide evidence relevant to det ermining the extent to which pathotype variation exists within individual RA 
patients and the ability of Tc 99m
 tilmanocept imaging to detect this variation.  
The second reason why Tc 99m tilmanocept imaging may be preferred to synovial biopsies for 
evaluations of RA patients is that synovial biopsies are only performed on patients with inflamed synovia that have expanded in volume beyond a certain grade, thereby enabling extraction of sufficient tissue to assess histologically. This could be a problem when evaluating 
patients in the early phase of symptomatic RA disease when high densities of activated macrophages have begun to aggregate into the inflamed synovial membrane but the synovial membrane may not yet have expanded (i.e. thickened) sufficiently to permit biopsy sampling. As discussed below, there is an urgent need to more accurately identify RA patients as early in the disease process as possible and place them on DMARD therapy immediately to provide these patients with their best possible therapy responses.  
The third reason why Tc 99m tilmanocept imaging may be preferred to synovial biopsies for 
evaluations of RA patients is that, although synovial biopsy procedures typically extract 6-14 samples of tissue from each biopsied joint, in about 5% to 10% of cases, they do not provide tissue of sufficient quantity or quality to enable adequate histological evaluations of the inflamed synovial tissue [ 31, 51]. It is expected that Tc 99m tilmanocept imaging would not 
fail to quantitatively assess the aggregation of macrophages in RA inflamed joints at this frequency.  
The fo urth reason is that  although more than 1 biopsy procedure can be performed on an 
individual joint, there are likely to be limitations on the number of times or how often a single 
joint can be biopsied. Furthermore, while not discussed in the literature, repeated biopsies may alter the inflammatory microenvironment in an inflamed synovial membrane and/or induce its own inflammation or wound healing response to trauma. In any event, Tc  99m tilmanocep t 
imaging, being non- invasive and non- traumatic, is likely to be more amenable to repeat 
examination and would not affect synovial inflammation through repeated biopsy related trauma. These issues may be most significant when considering evaluations of the  small joints 
of the hands where there is a limited quantity of inflammatory tissue.

 The fifth and final reason why Tc 99m tilmanocept imaging  will be preferred to synovial 
biopsies is that performing biopsies is challenging and requires extensive training [52]. 
Synovial biopsies have only been performed in research settings and until very recently, only 
in Europe where adequately trained and experienced investigators reside. Training and qualifying all physicians in the US who care for RA patients to perform synovial biopsies would be a significant barrier to adoption.  
Indeed, Tc 99m t ilmanocept quantitative imaging reliably assesses  all joints, is not dependent 
on synovial swelling, is non- invasive and non- traumatic , and does not require extensive 
practitioner training . Thus, for all these reasons, Tc 99m tilmanocept imaging is e xpected to  
provide clinically predictive  information about the inflammatory status of inflamed joints in 
RA patients that is not obtainable from  synovial biopsies or will be preferred over invasive and 
potentially risky synovial biopsies as a means to eval uate RA patients.  
In diagnostic radiology, quantitative imaging provides a layer of clinically meaningful 
information beyond that of qualitative interrogation. The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) defines quantitative imaging as “the extraction of quantifiable f eatures from 
medical images for the assessment of normal or the severity, degree of change, or status of a disease, injury, or chronic condition relative to normal. Quantitative imaging includes the development, standardization, and optimization of anatomical, functional, and molecular imaging acquisition protocols, data analyses, display methods, and reporting structures. These features permit the validation of accurately and precisely obtained image -derived metrics with 
anatomically and physiologically relevant parameters, including treatment response and outcome, and the use of such metrics in research and patient care.” [ 55] 
In nuclear medicine, the SUV (standard uptake value) is an established quantitative imaging metric for the assessment of disease -related activity across a variety of neurological, 
cardiovascular, oncological, and immunological conditions. For example, in 18F- labeled 
fluoro -2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (
18F- FDG PET ) imaging, SUV is used 
to measure the proliferative activity of malignant tumors in various cancers through the quantification of FDG uptake using the following parameters: r, the radioactivity activity concentration [kBq/mL] measured by the PET scanner within a region of interest (ROI), a’, the decay -corrected  amount of injected radiolabeled FDG [kBq], and w, the weight of the 
patient [g], such that such that SUV =  r
(a′/w). [56]   
Based on the clinical utility of SUV in 18F- FDG PET imaging, Navidea pursued the 
development of the TUV to quantify CD206 activity on planar gamma camera imaging. TUV considers the fundamental principles of SUV and introduces modifications to account for inter - 
and intra -patient variability and disease pathobiology. After the evaluation of several formula 
permutations, Navidea has established TUV as a metric for the measurement of joint -specific 
CD206 activity in RA through the quantification of Tc 99m tilmanocept uptake using the 
following parameters: 𝑥𝑥̅, the average pixel intensity of a n ROI, and B , the average pixel 
intensity of the whole hand and part of the forearm on the same view and side as the joint ROI 
(serving as an intra -patient reference region), such that TUV =x�
B. The overall purpose of this

 study will be to establish the mean and variance of healthy control joint uptake values for 
reference to be used to assess RA -inflamed joints in patients with RA.  
1.2 Previous Nonclinical Research and Clinical Trial Experience in Tc 
99m Tilmanocept  
A detailed evaluation of th e nonclinical evaluations from subcutaneous (SC) and IV routes of 
administration, clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), clinical efficacy, and clinical safety of Tc 99m 
tilmanocept can be found in the accompanying Investigator’s Brochure supplied by Navidea 
Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.   
1.2.1  Nonclinical Evaluations – Subcutaneous  Administration  
Nonclinical studies of Tc 99m  tilmanocept demonstrated that the drug selectively binds to its 
intended receptor (the CD206 mannose binding receptor), and is well tolerated by rats, rabbits, 
guinea pigs, and dogs. 
PK data obtained from nonclinical studies demonstrated rapid absorption into the plasma. 
Urinary excretion was a major pathway of elimination. Tc 99m tilmanocept  exhibited rapid 
clearance from the injection site, rapid uptake by the local lymph node, and low uptake by the 
remaining lymph nodes. Tilmanocept was well tolerated at all doses tested in nonclinical safety pharmacology studies and in single and repeated dose toxicology studies in rats, rabbits, and dogs. In some studies in rabbits and dogs, tilmanoce pt acted as a local irritant of the subcutis 
or skeletal muscle, and induced mild inflammation and tissue degeneration. The no-observed adverse -effect level (NOAEL) was 42μg/kg/day. Tilmanocept was not mutagenic or genotoxic 
in vitro or in vivo. No signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity were observed in a study in guinea pigs.  
1.2.2  Nonclinical Evaluations – IV Administration  
In preparation to initiate the IV route of administration, 11 preclinical tests were conducted to 
assess safety, toxicity, and interaction potential at doses hundreds to thousands of times the expected maximum human dose, as summarized in Table 1. The nonclinical evaluations 
yielded safety and pharmacokinetics profiles that were appropriate for initiation of IV dosing in clinical trials. Nonclinical study results can be found in the accompanying Investigator’s Brochure.

 1.2.3  Clinical Pharmacokinetics (IV) 
Clinical PK was evaluated in IV administered Tc 99m tilmanocept in the Phase 1 and 2 trial 
NAV3 -21 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In this  trial, 12 subjects (6 RA/6 HC) were administered the 
maximum dose of 400 mcg  tilmanocept radiolabeled with 10 mCi of Tc 99m  and urine and 
blood data were non -compartmentally modeled to assess potential differences in drug 
distribution and elimination by disease group (active RA vs. HC ). 
Subject -level whole blood PK parameters were assessed between HC subjects (n  = 6) and 
subjects with active RA (n  = 6) to evaluate potential differences between mean maximum 
concentration (C max), mean area under the concentration -time curve (AUC 0-t), mean area under 
the concentration -time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), mean clearance, mean half -life 
(t1/2), or mean elimination rate constant ( λz) across each disease group ( Table 2).  The geometric 
mean of whole blood clearance was 26.5 mL/min for HC subjects and 24.8 mL/min for RA patients.

1.2.4  Clinical Efficacy  
1.2.4.1  NAV3 -23 (SC)  
This was an open- label, multicenter study of Tc  99m tilmanocept by subcutaneous injection in 
patients with active RA and healthy controls.  Tilmanocept was administered SC at 1 of 2 mass 
doses: [1] 50 mcg (Cohorts 1 & 3), or [2] 200 mcg (Cohorts 2 & 4). Both mass doses were 
radiolabeled with 2 mCi of Tc 99m. A total of 18 subjects were enrolled and evaluated (9 active RA, 9 HC). Imaging was performed 60 ± 15 minutes post injection. The following performance conclusions were drawn  upon study completion:  
• Based on data from this study and parallel pathology studies, Tc 99m tilmanocept localizes to activated macrophage- infiltrated joints at doses of 50 µg and 200 µg 
radiolabeled wit h 2.0 mCi (74.0 MBq) by SC administration.  
• Across all combined RA subjects, swollen/tender joints demonstrating the highest proportions of localization include the wrists and knees.  
• Based on qualitative image evaluation, Tc 99m tilmanocept does not show differences 
in localization between 2  to 3 and 4 to  6-hour planar imaging within dosing groups.  
• Tc 99m tilmanocept demonstrates a greater frequency of localization to swollen/tender 
joints at 200 mcg /2.0 mCi than 50 mc g/2.0 mCi.  
• There is an overall lack of concordance between qualitative observation of Tc 99m 
tilmanocept localization to swollen/tender joints identified in DAS28 joint count

 assessment. Swollen/tender joints did not appear to be reliable predictors of presumed 
abnormal activated macrophage infiltration and overall disease progression when used as an isolated diagnostic system.  
• Increased tilmanocept mass dosing, increased Tc 99m specific activity, and other routes of administration may enhance localization and anatomic delineation in tilmano cept-
positive joints of RA patients.  
• The potential for using Tc 99m tilmanocept to delineate macrophage infiltration in RA -
affected joints may allow for earlier RA -specific treatment beyond the current standard 
of care ACR/EULAR criteria.  
 
1.2.4.2  NAV3 -21 (IV)  
This was an open -label, multicenter, dose -escalation safety with PK and dosimetry study of 
Tc 99m tilmanocept by IV injection in HCs and subjects  with active RA. Thirty -nine subjects 
were enrolled. A total of 27 subjects with active RA were enrolled to Groups 1 to 9 in the dose escalation phase. Group 10 consisted of 6 HCs (3 female and 3 male) and Group 11 consisted of 6 subjects with active RA (3 female and 3 male). Tilmanocept was administered IV at 1 of 3 mass doses: 50 mcg, 200 mcg, or 400 mcg.  Within each mass dose group, tilmanocept was radiolabeled with 1 of 3 Tc 99m doses: 1 mCi, 5 mCi, or 10 mCi.  Subjects in Groups 10 and 
11 received the maximum dose of 400 mcg/10 mCi. Imaging was performed 60 ± 15 minutes 
p.i. The following clinical efficacy concl usions were drawn upon study completion: 
• The TUV
brain(average) readout provides an objective means of quantification of Tc 99m 
tilmanocept localization when administered at the calculated optimal dose of 150 mcg/10 mCi and planar images are acquired 60 to 180 minutes after drug administration.  
• Joint- specific localization of activity and joint- specific clinical symptomology were not 
fully concordant. Within the spectrum of RA disease involvement, there may be a decoupling of the causal active immune process  and subsequent clinical sequelae. We 
surmise that imaging and quantification of Tc 99m tilmanocept uptake may provide a fuller and more accurate, responsive, and objective measure of RA disease activity than can be obtained from clinical assessments alone. Future studies will examine whether the approach to image acquisition and calculation of TUV can be further refined. 
1.2.4.3  NAV3 -31 (IV)  
This is an ongoing open- label, multi- center,  single and repeat-dose study designed to 
evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of TUV assessments in HCs and subjects with active RA. One -hundred and five evaluable subjects will be enrolled. Tilmanocept is administered 
IV at a dose of 150 mcg tilmanocept radiolabeled with 10 mCi Tc 99m. Clinical efficacy conclusions for this study are still in progress.

 1.2.5   Clinical Safety  
1.2.5.1  NAV3 -23 (SC)  
The NAV3 -23 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) safety evaluation included all trial subjects injected with Tc 
99m tilmanocept (N  = 18). The AE monitoring was performed from the time of dose 
administration until completion of onsite safety assessment. There was 1 AE that was possibly 
related to and 1 AE that was probably related to Tc 99m tilmanocept. However, there were no 
AEs that led to trial discontinuation , and no SAEs were observed. There were no deaths on 
trial. 
1.2.5.2  NAV3 -21 (IV)  
The primary safety endpoint of the NAV3 -21 study was evaluated by exa mining the incidence 
of AEs, changes over time in clinical laboratory tests,  physical exams, electrocardiogram 
(ECG ) parameters,  and vital signs.  The safety evaluation included all subjects who were 
enrolled in the study and administered Tc 99m tilmanocept (n = 39). There were no Tc 99m 
tilmanocept related AEs . There were no deaths during the trial; no SAEs; and no AEs that led 
to discontinuation from the trial.  In addition, radiation exposure was within regulatory and 
safety limits at the doses evaluated. Radiation exposure and pharmacokinetics do not appear to differ in subjects with RA and healthy control subjects. 
1.2.5.3  NAV3 -31 (IV)  
This is an ongoing open- label, multi- center,  single and repeat-dose study designed to 
evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of TUV assessments in HCs and subjects with active RA. One -hundred and five evaluable subjects will be enrolled. Tilmanocept is administered 
IV at a dose of 150 mcg tilmanocept radiolabeled with 10 mCi Tc 99m. Clinical safety conclusions for this study are still in progress.

 5 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
5.1 Description of Investigational Project 
Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept is a scintigraphic imaging radiotracer that  binds to CD206 
(mannose-binding receptor ) on the surface of macrophages and other inflammatory cells . It is 
comprised of  multiple units of DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) and mannose, each 
synthetically attached to a 10 kDa dextran backbone  (Figure  1). The mannose acts as a 
substrate for the receptor and the DTPA serves as a chelating  agent for labeling with Tc 99m . 
Tilmanocept  has a diameter of about 7 nm, which permits enhanced diffusion into lymph nodes 
and blood capillaries.  
Figure  1  Tc 99m tilmanocept and the Mannose Receptor  
 
 
5.2 Investigational Product Dosage and Administration 
Tc 99m tilmanocept will be administered  through an IV  route of injection. A 150- mcg dose 
containing 10 mCi of Tc 99m in 3 mL will be delivered using 1 syringe. The dose will be  
injected as a slow push into the IV catheter . At the completion of the injection, a 10- mL sterile 
normal saline flush will be administered.  The preferred site of IV placement will be between 
the left or right antecubital vein . 
The final administered dose will be ± 20% of the tilmanocept mass dose and radiolabel mCi 
dose.

 8 PROCEDURES AND VARIABLES  
8.1 Population Characteristics 
8.1.1  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
One-hundred and thirty -five (135) ev aluable subjects will be enrolled across the 2  study arms. 
Arm 1  will be  comprised of 120 male or female HC  subjects  who are clinically free of any 
inflammatory and/or joint disease. Arm 2 will be comprised of 15 subjects. Ten (10) s ubjects 
in Arm 2 will be male or female individuals with clinically diagnosed active RA  who are on 
stable anti -inflammatory and/or anti -rheumatic therapy. Five (5) subjects in Arm 2 will be male 
or female HCs who are clinically free of any inflammatory and/or joint disease. Enrolled HCs 
in either Arm will be categorized by age and sex to ens ure intended distributions are met for 
the normative database, as described in Section 9.4
. 
8.1.2  Medical , Rheumatological,  and Surgical History  
Relevant medical , rheumatological, and surgical histories will be obtained on all study 
subjects.  As part of the medical history, the date of the last spontaneous menstruation will be recorded if  childbearing potential is not excluded by surgical sterilization. Rheumatological 
history will include date of RA diagnosis as well as the  timing , dose, administration frequenc y, 
and administration route (when available)  of all RA -specific drugs  taken in the last 6 months. 
8.1.3  Prior and Concomitant Medication  
All prior non- RA medications used up to 30 days before the first screening examination 
through the follow -up safety visit will be documented . In addition to the summarization of 
prior R A-specific treatments, recent or concomitant treatments taken for RA in the last 6 
months must be collected . 
 
8.2 Tc 99m Tilmanocept Administration 
Tc 99m tilmanocept must  be ordered from the study-assigned radiopharmacy once the subject 
has been scheduled for IV administration and imaging. The preferred site of IV placement will 
be the left or right antecubital vein . The filled syringe will be connected to the c atheter  for a 
slow push injection. Immediately after the completion of the injection, a 10- mL sterile normal 
saline flush will be administered. Injection of Tc 99m tilmanocept will be at study time 0:00.  
8.3 Rheumatological Assessments 
8.3.1  2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria  
All subjects will be evaluated at screening using the 2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria as part of eligibility and inclusion  (Aletaha et . al 2010) . The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification 
criteria includes 4 components: number and site of involved joints, serologic abnormality, 
elevated acute -phase response and symptom duration. See Appendix 5 for details.  A total score

Confidential  Page 45 of 74 
 of 6 or higher (out of a possible 10) combined with clinical synovitis not better explained by 
another disease confirms a diagnosis of “definite RA”. 
8.3.2  DAS28  
RA s ubjects  in Arm 2 will receive the DAS28  evaluation ( Prevoo et . al 1995 ) at screening  as 
part of eligibility and inclusion . DAS28  is calculated from 4 components: tender joint count 
(TJC), swollen joint count ( SJC), visual analogue scale (VAS) of the subject’s global health, 
and the laboratory parameter erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) , such that: 
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 28= 0. 56�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 0. 28�𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 0.7 ln(𝐸𝐸𝐷𝐷𝐸𝐸) + 0. 014(𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷) 
A DAS28 score of higher than 5.1 is indi cative of high disease activity  whereas a DAS28 
below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A subject with a  DAS28 lower than 2.6 is considered 
to be  in remission . For consistent scoring, the following calculator should be utilized: 
https://qxmd.com/calculate/ .  See Appendix 3 for details.  
8.3.3  Other  
8.3.3.1  28-joint Count (SJC and TJC)  
The 28- joint count will be performed for swollen and/or tender joints in the following: 
shoulder, elbow, wrist, MCP and PIP, and knee. Joint swelling is defined as soft tissue swelling 
that is detectable along the joint margins. Joint tenderness is defined as the presence of pain in 
a joint at rest with pressure or on movement of the joint  [57]. This assessment will be  used as 
an input parameter for 2010 ACR/EULAR score and DAS28 score. 
8.3.3.2  Patient Assessment of Pain (VAS)  
Patient assessment of pain will be evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). Using a ruler, 
the score will be determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10- cm line between the 
‘no pain’ anchor and the patient’s mark, providing a range of scores from 0 to 100. This 
assessment will be  used as an input parameter for DAS28 score. 
8.3.3.3  Acute -phase Reactant  
ESR and CRP will be obtained in the RA- specific laboratory panel (see Table 7).  This 
assessment will be used as an input parameter for 2010 ACR/EULAR score and DAS28 
score.

 8.4 Imaging 
8.4.1  Image Acquisit ion 
8.4.1.1  Planar Scintigraphy  
Bilateral hand and wrist p lanar image acquisition occurs in Arm 1 and 2 subjects beginning 
60-75 minutes following Tc 99m tilmanocept injection . Refer to the NAV3 -35 Image 
Acquisition Guidelines for all required imaging technical specifications and acquisitions.  
8.4.1.2  SPECT/CT  
SPECT/CT is performed for Arm 2 subjects on the bilateral hands and wrists only following 
the planar scan . Refer to the NAV3 -35 Image Acquisition Guidelines for all required imaging 
technical specifications and acqui sitions.  SUV will be calculated for DAS28 joints of interest 
according to standard methods. See the NAV3- 35 Image Review Charter and Statistical 
Analysis Plan for more details.  
8.4.2  Tilmanocept Uptake Value ( TUV) 
TUV is a quantitative imaging metric used to cha racterize the amount of CD206 activity on 
planar imaging. Results from prior Phase 1 and 2 studies  have demonstrated that TUV is a 
sensitive and specific predictor of visually interrogated Tc  99m tilmanocept localization in 
joint regions with presumed inflammatory macrophage activity. A per -joint TUV (TUV joint) 
relative ratio will be calculated for the each of the 22 DAS -28 joints located in the hands and 
wrists. A subject -level global TUV (TUV global) assessed across the 22 joints will be used as an 
indicat ion of overall disease burden.  
For all subjects, delegated trained imaging scientists blinded to all clinical subject information 
will perform semi- automated ROI drawing on planar images of the bilateral hands and wrists 
to derive relevant count statistic s, which are input parameters for TUV joint and TUV global. TUV 
metrics are further described in the NAV3 -35 Statistical Analysis Plan.  
8.5 Adverse Events 
8.5.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
The definitions below follow International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) – Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (see also ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceuti cal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.

Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -35  17 March 2021  
   
 
Confidential  Page 47 of 74 
 Any clinically significant change in a condition (worsening) from screening that results in a 
change in subject management will be considered  an AE and will be recorded on the AE page 
of the CRF. 
By definition for this study, all untoward medical occurrences beginning on the Visit 2 (Day 
0) until the final visit (variable per arm)  are to be reported as AEs.  AEs continuing after study 
completio n will be followed to normalization or stabilization. Additionally, untoward medical 
events occurring prior to the day of Tc 99m tilmanocept administration will be collect ed and 
added to the subject’s medical history unless they are related to a study proc edure, in which 
case the event will be recorded as an AE . SAEs will be reported from the time of consent 
through the end of participation. 
8.5.2  Categories for Adverse Event Assessment  
The severity of an AE is classified according to the following categories, taking into account 
the possible range of the intensity of the event: 
• Mild   The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.  
• Moderate   The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject’s usual activities  
• Severe  T he adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject’s 
usual activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
 Specific drug treatment  
Any specific drug treatment will be documented.  
Causal relationship to investigational product The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of investigational product:  Definitely related:  Event can be fully explained by administration of the 
investigational product. 
Probably related:  Event is most likely to be explained by administration of the investigational product rather than the subject’s clinical state or other agents/therapies.  
Possibly related:  Event may be explained by administration of the investigational product or by the subject’s clinical state or other agents/therapies.  
Probably not related: Event is most likely to be explained by the subject’s clinical state or other agents/therapies, rather than the investigational product.

Confidential  Page 48 of 74 
 Definitely not related:  Event can be fully explained by the subject’s clinical state or other 
agents/therapies.  
For causality assessments, events meeting the categories of definitely, probably, or possibly related will be considered to be related to investigational product. 
Causal relationship to study procedure  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to  study procedure :  
Definitely related:  Event can be fully explained by the study procedure. 
Probably related:  Event is most likely to be explained by the study rather than the subject’s clinical state or other agents/therapies.  
Possibly related:  Event may be explained by the study procedure or by the subject’s clinical state or other agents/therapies.  
Probably not related: Event is most likely to be explained by the subject’s clinical state 
or other agents/therapies, rather than the study procedure. 
Definitely not related:  Event can be fully explained by the subject’s clinical state or other agents/therapies.  
For causality ass essments, events meeting the categories of definitely, probably, or possibly 
related will be considered to be related to study.  
8.5.3  Assessments and Documentation of Adverse Events  
Attention shall be paid to the occurrence of AEs for the duration of subject participation. Events occurring prior to Visit 2 ( Day 0 ) will be recorded in the subject’s medical history  unless 
related to study procedure, in which case the event will be recorded as an AE . Untoward 
medical events beginning on Visit 2 ( Day 0 ) until the final visit (variable per arm)  will be 
reported as adverse events.     
Any AE (observed, volunteered, or elicited) should be recorded in detail in the source 
documentation. 
The following information is required: 
• The date  and time of onset of any AE. 
• The duration (the entire duration of an event or symptom, calculated from date of onset 
to date of end, if not recorded directly). 
• The seriousness of the AE will be assessed by the investigator.  If the investigator deems that an AE qualifies as an SAE, a special form provided by the sponsor should be completed and the event must be immediately reported to the sponsor.  A definition of serious adverse events is provided in Section 8.5.5. 
Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -35  17 March 2021  
   
 
Confidential  Page 49 of 74 
 • The maximum intensity (mild, moderate, or severe). 
• Whether drug treatment was administered for the event, any specific drug treatment 
must be documented. 
• The relationship of the AE to the investigational product and to study conduct (for 
definitions, see above). 
• The outcome  of the AE (resolved, resolved with sequelae, not resolved, unknown, 
death).  
 AEs will be coded according to an internationally recognized dictionary (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]).  
8.5.4  Expected Adverse Events  
Investigational Product- Related Risks  
In all completed studies of Lymphoseek  (Tc 99m tilmanocept) , involving 553 subjects, only 3 
events (breast pain and injection site pain reported by subjects with breast cancer and injection site irritation reported by a subject with head and neck squamous cell cancer) were deemed definitely related to the administration of Lymphoseek by the investigator. The most common adverse reactions (incident <  1%) have been 
lack of effect (<  0.067%), injection site pain (<  
0.02%) and rash (<  0.02%) . Adverse events from the radioactive dose are not expected, since 
the applied radiation doses are far below doses that can cause acute effects in human tissues. Routes of administration included: subcutaneous, intradermal, and peritumoral. 
In addition to the Lymphoseek pre -approval clinical studies, post -marketing surveillance 
shows that Lymphoseek has been administered to more than 450,000 patients with not a single 
drug- related SAE. Routes of administration included: subcutaneous, intradermal, and 
peritu moral.  
The intended route of administration in this study is intravenous. There have been 
approximately 280 IV administrations of Tc 99m tilmanocept to date , and no SAEs or AEs 
related to the product have been reported to date.  
Risks of Imaging Procedures 
Radiation dose considerations from Tc 99m Tilmanocept planar and SPEC/CT scans  – Patients 
enrolled in this trial will have hand/wrist planar gamma camera scans following Tc 99m 
Tilmanocept injection, with subjects enrolled in Arm 2 also receiving one hand/wrist SPECT/CT scan.   
The average effective radiation dose per 10 mCi Tc 99m Tilmanocept injection is calculated 
to be 2.7 mSv (equivalent to about ten months of natural background radiation received in the US). Subjects enrolled in Arm 1 will receive o ne injection, equal to 2.7 mSv total; subjects 
enrolled in Arm 2 will receive one injection plus one SPECT/CT scan- with an estimated 
effective dose of 1 mSv for the CT portion- amounting to 3.7 mSv total. T herefore, t he 
maximum possible dose of ~ 3.7 mSv for any enrolled subject (no one will cross over into more

 than one study arm) is considered to be a minor to intermediate  risk level corresponding to the 
benefit to the patient [ category II b based on the International Commission on Radiological 
Protection 62 (ICRP62) ] and is balanced against the possible substantial societal benefit that 
can be gained from the trial (European Commission Radiation Protection 99, 1998 and ICRP 
62, 1992). For further reference, the effective dose from a standard CT abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast, is up to 20 mSv.  
Precautionary Measures  
Special precautionary measures are not considered necessary for this study.  In case of 
emergency, standard emergency procedures will be employed. 
Unexpected Adverse Events  
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an adverse reaction that in nature and severity is 
not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure).  Any adverse experience that is not listed in the current Investigator’s Br ochure or which is, with 
regard to the specificity or severity, not consistent with the risk information shall be regarded as unexpected.   
Examples would be (a) acute renal failure listed in the Investigator’s Brochure with a subsequent new report of inter stitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant 
hepatitis.  “Unexpected” as used in this definition refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed and included in the Investigator’s Brochure, rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the investigational product. 
8.5.5  Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
The following SAE definition is based on ICH guidelines and the final  rule issued by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and effective 06 Apr 1998.   
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death, or 
• is life threatening, or 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• is an important medical event (see paragraphs below).  
 
The term ‘life threatening’ in the definition refers  to an event in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -35  17 March 2021  
   
 
Confidential  Page 51 of 74 
 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is  appropriate to 
report an AE as serious also in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization.  
Actions and reporting obligations in case of serious adverse events 
The investigator should take appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures to minimize the 
risk to the subject.   
If any SAE occurs over the course of the study, investigators or other site personnel will inform 
Navidea Biopharmaceutical representatives within 1 day (i.e., within 24 hours) of becoming 
aware of the SAE. Written notification of the SAE will be emailed  to Navidea 
Biopharmaceuticals Pharmacovigilance at  safety@navidea.com . For fatal or life -threatening 
adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow -up is 
undertaken immediately. 
Pregnancy will have the same time reporting obligations to the sponsor as SAEs. Upon 
notification, Navidea will provide a form for collection of pregnancy information. 
All SAEs must also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRFs. Notification of the IRB(s) The sponsor and/or the investigator will notify the IRB(s) about all relevant events (e.g., 
serious adverse events [SAEs] and Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse Reactions 
[SUSARs]) according to all applicable regulations. 
Notification of the authorities  
The sponsor will process and report all relevant events (e.g., SAEs, SUSARs) to the authorities 
according to all applicable regulations. 
Sponsor’s notification of the investigators The sponsor will inform all investigators about reported relevant events (e.g., SAEs, SUSARs) 
according to all applicable regulations. 
8.6 Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will be conducted at screening  including height and weight 
assessments. A physical exam that has been  conducted as standard of care prior to signing 
informed consent may be used if it was  performed within 30 days of injection.

 Physical examinations will be performed for the following body systems: 
• General Appearance  
• Skin/dermatological 
• Eyes, ears, nose, throat 
• Head and neck (including thyroid) 
• Lungs 
• Heart  
• Abdomen (liver, kidney, spleen, gastrointestinal) 
• Lymph nodes 
• Musculoskeletal  
• Nervous system 
 
8.7 Vital Signs 
Vital signs comprise the measurement of body temperature, heart rate, respiration, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure. All measurements will be taken after the subject has been in a resting position for at lea st 1 minute. Vital signs will be measured at screening, within 30 minutes 
before investigational product injection, and within 30 minutes post injection. Any clinically 
significant change from screening (worsening) that results in a change in subject management will be considered an AE and will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.

 Only abnormal laboratory values that are evaluated as being clinically significant will be 
collected in the electronic database. Any change in a laboratory value, which results in a change in subject management (additional controls or treatment required), will be reported as a clinically significant change. Clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, which are not the result of laboratory error, are to be recorded as AEs.  
Any clinically significant changes in laboratory values are to be followed up with repeated tests at appropriate intervals (as determined by the investigator) until the values return to baseline level or until the abnormality is explained by the investiga tor. The expected amount 
of blood to be drawn is shown in Table 8.

 9 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
This is a prospective, open- label, multicenter study of the patterns of variation in planar 
imaging using IV injected  Tc 99m tilmanocept for the quantitative detection of disease activity  
in the  skeletal joints of HC  subjects and subjects with  active RA. In addition to quantitative 
assessments, this study will also include qualitative (i.e., visual) evaluations of SPECT/CT in  
detecting localization within synovial spaces of the bilateral hands and wrists.   
The study is stratified into 2 groups. Arm 1 consists of HC subjects. Arm  2 consists of  HC 
subjects  and RA subjects  on stable therapy. 
9.1 Randomization Methods 
This study is not randomized.  
9.2 Safety Variables  
The safety analysis variables are defined as follows:  
• Adverse events (AEs) 
• Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and RA  panel)  
• Vital signs 
 
9.3 Efficacy Variables 
The efficacy variables for this study are defined below:  
• Quantitative determination of TUV joint and TUV global  
• Qualitative (i.e., visual) dete rmination of tilmanocept localization in planar and 
SPECT/CT images of the bilateral hands and wrists; 
• Quantitative determination of tilmanocept localization in planar and SPECT/CT 
images of the bilateral hands and wrists. 
 It is presumed that the presence of radiotracer uptake for a joint indicates the presence of 
activated macrophages. The use of the term “localization” is synonymous with radiotracer uptake. 
The efficacy endpoints for this study, by arm, are as follows: 
Primary Endpoint(s) 
ARM 1  
• The normal limits of TUV joint (on a per joint basis) in HC subjects, which are defined 
as the 5 and 95 percentiles of TUV joint of bilateral  joints (i.e., bilateral wrists, 
metacarpophalangeal joint [MCPs], p roximal interphalangeal [PIPs]). The normal 
range will be determined separately for each of the three blinded readers.

• Normative joint- specific SUV.  
 
• Predictive value of planar scans for SPECT/CT scans.  
9.4 Sample Size Justification  
The study will enroll up to 135 evaluable subjects in Arms  1 and  2 allocated below, imaged at 
up to 8 study centers. Arm  1 will have N = 120 evaluable HC subjects, Arm 2 will have N = 
15 (5 HCs and 10 RA)  evaluable subjects.  A subject is considered evaluable if he/she meets 
the criteria for t he analysis population and has the data necessary for computing the primary 
endpoint.  
The sample size for Arm  1 was determined to provide acceptable precision for the  estimated 5 
and 95 percentiles. These percentiles will  be estimated with 95% nonparametric confidence intervals. Although the standard error formula for quantile estimators is known and quantile 
estimators obey a central limit theorem, relying  on the asymptotic Normal distribution seems imprudent. 
The sample will be stratified 3:1, females:males to reflect RA incidence in the United States 
[58, 59]. The sex -specific samples will be further stratified by age to reflect the Census 
estimated US population in 2019 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020 [60]). The target sample sizes are 
given below.

a An effort will be made to target enrollment in this group to include 2 men and 8 women 80 years old and over .  
The existing data for HC subjects was used in a bootstrap procedure to evaluate the width of 
95% confidence intervals for the 95 percentiles for various sample sizes. The sponsor has decided for its business purposes that knowing the percentile to within 0.05 of its true value is sufficient. A sample of size N = 144 HC results  (this includes the subjects from Arm 1 of 
NAV3 -31) in 95% confidence intervals with half-widths less than 0.05. 
The sample size fo r Arm  2 was determined to be sufficient for the business purposes of the 
sponsor. The sample si ze for Arm 2 will be 5 HCs and 10 RA subjects.  
9.5 Statistical Analyses 
9.5.1  Analysis Populations  
The following populations are defined for this study: 
Intent -to-Diagnos e (ITD) Population  – the ITD population includes all subjects who have 
been enrolled in the study, injected with Tc 99m tilmanocept, and received all imaging and 
evaluations necessary for the primary endpoint(s) appropriate to their respective arm . 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population  – the PP population consists of all ITD subjects without major 
protocol violations. 
Safety Population  – The safety population includes all subjects who have been enrolled in the 
study and injected with Tc 99m tilmanocept. 
9.5.2  Analysis of Baseline and Demographic Characteristics  
Baseline and demographic characteristics of the safety population will be summarized by 
subject status and overall.  Continuous variables (age, height, and weight ) will be summarized 
via mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and number of non- missing responses. 
Categorical variables (gender, race and ethnicity) will be summarized via counts and percentages.

 9.5.3  Analysis of Efficacy Variables  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted on both the ITD and PP populations . The ITD 
population will be the primary analysis set. 
9.5.3.1  Primary Endpoint Arm 1  
The distribution of TUV joint in HC subjects will be summarized with descriptive statistics: 
mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum, and median per reader, joint, and view. The 
5 and 95 percentiles will be estimated with quantile regression fitting an intercept as a fixed term.  The lower and upper limits of normal TUV
joint will be determined using non- parametric 
confidence intervals and kernel density- based confidence intervals . 
9.5.3.2  Primary Endpoint Arm 2  
Localization of tilmanocept in the hands and wrists will be summarized with frequency counts 
and percentages by reader and joint. 
9.5.3.3  Secondary Endpoint Arm 1  
Normal quantile plots will be provided per joint and reader, along with the p- value for the 
Shapiro- Wilk test of Normality.  
9.5.3.4  Secondary Endpoint s Arm 2  
SUV will be calculated and summarized on both a per -joint and a total of all joints with 
summary statistics: mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum, and median. 
The predictive value of planar scans for SPECT/CT qualitative findings will be summarized 
per joint and reader with a crosstabulation and the uncertainty coefficients for row | column, 
column | row, and symmetric. The planar result will be deemed “ positive” (i.e., inflamed)  if 
TUV joint > 95 percentile of the reader resu lts for the same joint in Arm 1. Otherwise, the planar 
result will be deemed “negative”.  
Additional efficacy analyses may be described in the NAV3 -35 Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).   
9.5.4  Analysis of Safety Variables  
All safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population. 
All AEs will be observed for each subject from the time of signing of informed consent until 
study completion. A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE whose start date is 
on or after the initial procedure date. If the proce dure date or the AE start date is missing, the 
AE will be considered treatment emergent.  
Prior to analysis all AEs will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary. Based on the coded terms, TEAEs will summarized by cohort and overall as follows:

 • By system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT);  
• By SOC and PT and relation to the study drug; 
• By SOC and PT and severity. 
 
Observed and change from baseline vital sign parameters and hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) for each Arm and overall at each time point.  
Other safety analyses may be described in the SAP for the study. 
9.5.5  Handling of Missing Values  
The analysis of the efficacy variables will be carried out on the observed data, i.e. a complete 
case analysis.  
9.5.6  Interim Analyses  
No interim analys es will be performed for this study.

 10 DATA HANDLING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Recording 
Data required according to this protocol is captured in the subject’s source documentation and 
are to be entered onto the electronic CRFs (provided by the sponsor) as soon as possible. 
10.1.1  CRF Design  
Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be used for collecting all data gene rated during the trial. CRF 
completion details will be documented in a separate document that will be provided by the sponsor 
and maintained in the TMF.  
10.2 Monitoring 
This study will be monitored regularly by a clinical research associate (CRA) from the spons or 
or a contract research organization (CRO).  Monitoring procedures include 1 or more visits 
designed to clarify all prerequisites before the study starts.  Interim monitoring visits will take 
place on a regular basis according to a schedule fixed by mutual agreement.  During these visits, the CRA will check for completion of the entries on the CRFs, their compliance with the protocol and with GCP, and will compare the CRF entries with the source data. 
All data recorded in the CRF will be captured in the s ource documentation. 
The CRA will verify the correct use of the investigational product.  The investigational product 
will not be supplied to the investigator site prior to a favorable opinion from the IRB and the regulatory authority and, if appropriate, from the radiation protection authorities.  In addition, 
the CRA will determine whether all AEs or SAEs have been appropriately reported (including adherence to the time periods required for SAEs).   
10.3 Data Processing 
Study data documentation will be maintained specifying all relevant aspects of data processing for the study (including data validation, cleaning, correcting, releasing).  This documentation will be stored in the TMF.  
For data coding (e.g., AEs, medication, medical/surgical history), internationa lly recognized 
and accepted dictionaries will be used.  These and the processes used for coding will be specified in the data management plan  
10.4 Auditing 
A member of the sponsor’s (or a designated CRO) quality assurance unit may arrange to visit the investigator in order to audit the performance of the study at the study site and the study documents originating there.  The auditor(s) will usually be accompanied by a CRA or the study team leader.  The investigator will be informed about the outcome of the audit.

 In addition, inspections by health authority representatives and IRB(s) are possible at any time.  
The investigator is to notify the sponsor of any such inspection immediately. 
10.5 Archiving 
Essential documents shall be archived safely and securely in such a way that ensures that they are readily available upon authorities’ request.  Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution, or private practice.  Where the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required by the sponsor, alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availability of the source documents for the required period. 
The investigator/institution notifies the spo nsor if the archival arrangements change 
(e.g., relocation or transfer of ownership). The investigator site file is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval. The investigator’s contract will contain all regulations relevant for the study center.  
Imaging data will be archived by the central imaging core lab according to the NAV3-35 
WorldCare Project Plan (WorldCare Clinical, Boston, MA).  
10.6 Premature Termination of the Study 
10.6.1  Termination by the Sponsor  
The Sponsor may terminate the study at any time for any of the following reasons: 
1. Failure to enroll subjects  
2. Protocol violations 
3. Inaccurate or incomplete data  
4. Unsafe or unethical practices  
5. Questionable safety of the investigational product 
6. Suspected lack of efficacy of the investigational product 
7. Administrative decision  
 
10.6.2  Termination by the Investigator  
If the Investigator terminates the study prematurely, the Investigator must do the following: 
• Return all unused investigational products and related study materials to the Sponsor. 
• Provide the IRB(s) and the sponsor with a written statement describing why the study 
was terminated prematurely.  Prompt compliance with this requirement is essential so that the sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations.

 11 ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS  
11.1 Ethical and Legal Conduct of the Study 
The planning and conduct of this clinical study are subject to national laws. Only when all of 
the requirements of the appropriate regulatory authority have been fulfilled will the study begin. The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH -GCP Guidelines of 17 Jan 1997. At the 
discretion of the investigator, the entire study may be canceled for medical reasons. In addition, the sponsor retains the right to end the study for medical -scientific or GCP -relevant reasons. 
In case of premature termination the investigators, IRB(s) and Regulatory Authorities will be informed by the Study Manager.  As required by local law, current safety -relevant information 
will be provided to the IRB(s) and the regulatory authorities by the sponsor. The sponsor will also inform all investigators about relevant safety events according to the applicable regulations. 
11.2 Subject Information and Consent 
All relevant info rmation on the study will be summarized in the subject consent form and 
additionally as required by the investigator’s institution in an integrated subject information and consent sheet. A sample informed consent form (ICF) is provided as a document separa te 
to this protocol. 
Based on this subject ICF, the investigator will explain all relevant aspects of the study to each 
subject, before entry into the study (i.e., before examinations and procedures associated with selection for the study are performed).  
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IRB has been obtained.  Each 
subject will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.  Following this informative discussion, the subject will be asked if he/she is willing to sign and personally date a statement of informed consent.  Only if the subject voluntarily agrees to sign the  ICF and has done so, may he/she enter the study.  
Additionally, the investigator or his/her designee will personally sign and date the form.  The subject will receive a duplicate of the signed and dated form.  
The investigator will record in the source documentation the consent process including the time and date of obtaining informed consent. In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are performed, the study record or subject's clinical record must clearly s how that informed consent was obtained prior to these procedures.
  
The ICF and any other written information provided to subjects will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there i s an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change to the content of the subject 
information and/or the written ICF. The investigator will inform the subject of changes in a timely manner and will ask the subject to confirm his/her participation in  the study by signing

 the revised ICF. Any revised written ICF and written information must receive the IRB’s 
approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. 
11.3 Financing/Financial Disclosure 
Each investigator (including principal and/or any subinvestigators; as well as their spouses and dependent children) who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects has to provide a financial disclosure according to all applicable legal requirements. All relevant documentation will be filed in t he sponsor trial master file and the investigator site file, as 
appropriate. 
11.4 Publication Policy 
The sponsor will be responsible for determining when any trial results should be published.  The sponsor will work jointly with the investigator(s) to publish information in a timely manner.  The investigator(s) shall not submit any information gleaned under the direct support or sponsorship of the sponsor to journals or professional societies without the prior written approval of the sponsor.  A “publication” is meant to include any abstract, letter, manuscript or public announcement in any form or length that contains information gleaned under the direct support or sponsorship of the sponsor. 
11.5 Subject Injury  
In general, if a subject is  injured as a direct result of the investigational product but not due to 
medical negligence on the part of the principal investigator or study staff, the sponsor will pay for reasonable and necessary medical treatment for the injury, to the extent the exp enses are 
not covered by the subject’s medical insurance, a government program, or other responsible third party.  If laws or regulations of the locality in which the study is taking place require additional payment of expenses, the sponsor shall comply with such law or regulation.  Where applicable, the sponsor has taken specific national insurance.

 Appendix 2 2010 ACR/EULAR Criteria 
 Score  
Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who   
1) Have at least 1 joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling)*   
2) With the synovitis not better explained by another disease†   
Classification criteria for RA (score -based algorithm: add score of categories A -D;  
A score of ≥ 6/10 is needed for classification of a patient as having definite RA)‡   
A. Joint involvement§   
1 large joint  0 
2 – 10 large joints  1 
1 – 3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)  2 
4- 10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)  3 
> 10 joints (at least 1 small joint)**  5 
B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)‡‡   
Negative RF and negative ACPA  0 
Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA  2 
High -positive RF or high-positive ACPA  3 
C. Acute -phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification) ‡‡   
Normal CRP and normal ESR  0 
Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR  1 
D. Duration of symptoms§§   
< 6 weeks  0 
≥ 6 weeks  1 
* The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In addition, patients with erosive disease 
typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment o f the 2010 criteria should 
be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria shoul d 
be classified as having RA.  
† Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations, but may include conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear about the relevant differential diagn oses 
to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consulted.  
‡ Although patients with a score of < 6/10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time.  
§ Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging 
evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal 
joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement.  
“Large joints” refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.  
 “Small joints” refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth 
metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists.

 ** In this category, at least 1 of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any 
combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., 
temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, etc.).  
†† Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory 
and assay; low -positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but ≤ 3times the ULN for the laborator y 
and assay; high- positive refers to IU values that are > 3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. Where 
rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as 
low-positive for RF. ACPA = anti- citrullinated protein antibody.  
‡‡ Normal/abnormal is determined by local laboratory standards. CRP = C -reactive protein; ESR = erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate.  
§§ Duration of symptoms refers to patient self -report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, 
swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment, regardless of treatment status.

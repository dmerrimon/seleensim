will be approximately 17 weeks .
Phase of Developm ent
Phase 1
Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary objective is to assess the effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of lemborexant after a single dose administration.
Secondary Objectives
•To evaluate the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of lemborexant metabolites M4, M9, and M10 .
•To evaluate the relationship betw een the PK parameters of lemborexant and its metabolites and the 
Child- Pugh Classification score, serum albumin, total bilirubin, and prothrombin time.
•To assess safety and tolerabil ity of lemborexant following a single dose administration in subjects with
mild and moderate hepatic impairment and in healthy subjects .
Exploratory Objectives
•To explore the relationship betw een the PK parameters of lemborexant and its metabolites and themodel 
of end stage liver disease (MELD) score.
Study Design
This is a multicenter, single dose, open -label, parallel -group study in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairm ent and matched (with regard to age [±10years], sex, and body mass index [BMI, ±20%]) healthy 
control subjects. The study will enroll a total of 24 subjects, including 16 subjects with impaired hepatic 
function; 8subjects each in Child- Pugh class A (mild) and B (mode rate).  Approximately 8 healthy subjects 
will be dosed as onecontrol group to match (1:1) to the subjects with hepatic impairment in each Child- Pugh 
class with regard to age, sex, and BMI . 
The study will consist of 2 phases: Prerandomization and Treatment.   The Prerandomization Phase will 
include 2 study periods; Screening and Baseline (Day -1). The subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility 
on Day -1, remain confined to the clinic until Day 8, and then return to the clinical facility for additional PK

Child Pugh Class A and B (Cohorts A and B ) and the matched controls (Cohort C) may be replaced.
On Day 1, the subjects will be adm inistered a single 10-mg dose of lemborexant with approxim ately 240mL 
of waterin the morning after an overnight fast.  The blood samples for PK assessments will be collected at 
prespecified intervals up to 312hours postdose administration.  The subjects will be discharged on Day 14 of 
the study.  In addition, the blood samples forplasma protein binding assessments of lemborexant will be 
collected from each subject at 2 time points; approximately 1 hour and 2
4hours postdose.
Adjudication Committee (revised per Amendment 01)
An independent Adjudication Committee will be employed at intervals to review, in a blinded manner, AEs 
that could potentially be considered cataplexy or seizure. A set of preferred terms constituting a customized 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query for cataplexy or seizure will be used to 
identify events for adjudication (including cataplexy, muscle fatigue, muscular weakness, muscle tone 
disorder, hypotonia, drop attacks, slurred speech, diplopia, falls, convulsions [standardized MedDRA query 
(SMQ) narrow  and broad], atypical migraine, loss of consciousness, decreased consciousness, myoclonus, 
syncope, transient global amnesia, lipothymia, [faintness] and transient ischemic attack) . To assist in the 
preparation of narratives about such events and to support the committee’s adjudication process, investigators 
and site staff will be instructed to query subjects who report any of the above events for supplemental 
information using a questionnaire for events potentially related to cataplexy and the serious adverse event 
(SAE) form for any of the above events considered serious.

Assessments
Efficacy Assessments
Not applicable.
Pharm acokinetic Assessments
Blood samples (4 mL each) for PK assessments of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) w ill be 
collected at predose (0 hour ),0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 216, 264 and 312 hours 
postdose.  In addition, blood samples (12 mL per time point) for protein binding of lemborexa nt and its 
metabolites (M4, M9 and M10 )will be collected at 1 and 24 hours postdose.
Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by monitoring and documenting adverse events (AEs), ECGs, vital signs, physical 
examinations, and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, hematology , and blood chemistry). Blood samples will 
be collected at Baseline and again if AEs of infection occur, for investigation of suspected infective pathogens.
Bioanalytical Methods
Total plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its main metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) will be m easured by 
validated liquid chrom atography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods.  The unbound 
concentrations of lemborexant and its main metabolites will also be measured using a similar validated 
LC-MS/MS method following equilibrium dialysis.
Statistical Methods
Study Endpoints
The endpoints include the follow ing PK param eters derived by non-compartmental analysis using the plasma 
concentration -time data of lemborexant and its metabolites:
Cmax Maxi mum plasma concentration
tmax Time to reach maximum plasma concentration
AUC (0-t) Area under plasma concentration vs. time curve from time = 0 
to time of last quantifiable concentration 
AUC (0-inf) Area under plasma concentration vs. time curve from time = 0 
to infinity

FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 9of 66based on AUCu (for lemborexant only)
The Cmax, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) of lemborexant will be the primary PK endpoints.  The rest of the 
parameters, including the PK parameters of the metabolites, will be secondary endpoints.
Analysis Sets
The Safety Analysis Set is the group of subjects who dosed with the test drug and had at least 1postdose 
safety assessment.
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set is the group of subjects who had sufficient PK data to derive at least 1PK 
parameter.
Efficacy Analyses
Not applicable.
Pharm acokinetic, Pharm acodynamic, Pharm acogenomic, and Other Biom arker Analyses
Pharm acokinetic Analyses
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for individual plasma concentration listings.  The PK Analysis Set will 
be used for summaries of plasma concentrations and for analyses, summaries, and listings of PK paramete rs.
The effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of lemborexant, the primary PK parameters based on total Cmax, 
AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) will be compared betw een the cohort of healthy normal controls and the cohorts of 
subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment as defined by Child- Pugh classes A or B.  A  g eneral 
linear model of logarithmically transformed values with hepatic function class as a fixed effect will be utilized 
to estimate the geometric mean ratio (and two-sided 90% confidence intervals) of subjects with mild/normal 
and moderate/normal hepatic function.  Similar statistical analyses will be conducted for the PK param eters of 
the metabolites and unbound lemborexant as secondary endpoints . Protein binding will be calculated for 
metabolites without any assessment of PK parameters .
Scatter plots of PK parameters of lemborexant and its metabolites versus Child- Pugh Score will be provided.  
The association betw een the primary PK param eters and Child- Pugh Score will be evaluated by regression 
analysis (the PK parameter as a dependent variable and Child -Pugh Score as an independent variable).  Similar 
analyses will be performed for MELD score, serum albumin, total bilirubin, and PT.  Additionally, association 
betw een the PK parameters and liver transaminase levels will be performed, if deemed necessary. 
Summary statistics will be generated for each of the PK parameters for each Child- Pugh class and healthy 
controls. 
Safety Analyses
An evaluation of safety will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set.  Safety data that will be evaluated 
include AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECGs.
Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized for each Child- Pugh class and healthy 
controls. Descriptive summary statistics (eg, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, maximum for 
continuous variables, and number and percent for categorical variables) including shift tables of the laboratory, 
vital signs, ECG param eters. Changes from Baseline for the clinical laboratory, vital signs and ECG 
parameters will be evaluated for each Child -Pugh class and healthy controls by time point.
Interim Analyses
Not applicable. 
Sample Size Rationale
A sample size of 8  s ubjects per each cohort of mild and moderate hepatic impairment ,as defined by 
Child- Pugh classes A or B,is based on the recommendations in regulatory guidelines for a minimum number 
of subjects to be enrolled for moderate liver impairment cohort (FDA, 2003) .  Additionally , from single -dose 
studies of the 10-mg tablet (E2006 -A001 -004, E2006 -A001 -005, and E2006- A001 -008), the pooled 
betw een-subject standard deviations of logarithmically transformed Cmaxand AUC (0-inf)of lemborexant were 
0.334 and 0.391 respectively. With a sample size of 8subjects in each 
Child- Pugh category and at least 8 
matched controls, a 2 -sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio for AUC (0-inf) will extend 0.322 from the 
observed mean difference on the log scale.

7.1 Indication
Lemborexant (E2006) is part of the dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) class of drugs 
and it is being developed as a treatment of insomnia disorder and forIrregul ar Sleep -Wake

Eisai
FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 18 of 66Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD).  Phase 1 and 2 studies in the lemborexant clinical program have 
provided evidence for pharmacological efficacy  at safe and well -tolerated doses. 
7.1.1 Lemborexant
The proposed study  is an open -label, parallel- group study  to evaluate thepharmacokinetics 
(PK) of lemborexant and its metabolites in subjects with normal hepatic function and 
subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment.
7.1.1.1 Therapeutic Pathway
Lemborexant (E2006), a dual orexin receptor antagonist, is an Eisai 
in-house discovered and 
developed small molecule which inhibits orexin by binding competitively  to two subty pes of 
orexin receptors (orexin receptor 1 and 2). In individuals with insomnia, it is possible that the 
orexin system, which regulates sleep and wakefulness, is not functioning normall y. During 
normal periods of sleep, orexin system activity  is suppressed, suggesting it is possible to 
purposefull y counteract inappropriate wakefulness and facilitate the initiation and 
maintenance of sleep b y interfe ring with orexin neurotransmission. 
7.1.1.2 Clinical Experience W ith Lemborexant
To date, a total of 9 Phase 1 studies have been completed, with health y subjects treated with 
either single or multiple once daily  doses for 14 days, and subjects with insomnia disorder 
who were administered single doses of lemborexant.  In addition, a Phase 2 dose-finding 
study  in adult and elderly  subjects with insomnia disorder demonstrated efficacy  and 
safet y 
over a dose range from 1 mg to 25 mg to enable lemborexant to proce ed into Phase 3 studies. 
Relevant to the currently  proposed study , the tolerability  data from the first human study  
suggest that single doses up to 200 mg have been generall y well tolerated in healthy  adult 
subjects.
Following single oral dose administrat ion, lemborexant generally  exhibited linear PK within 
the dose range studied (1 mg to 200 mg), but at doses of 50 mg and above, the increase in the 
maximum drug concentration (Cmax) was less than dose proportional.  Lemborexant exhibits 
approximate dose proportional (based on C maxand the area under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve [AUC]) PK at steady  state on Day 14 following multiple dose 
administrations between 2.5 mg and 75 mg of lemborexant administered once daily .  Oral 
absorption of lembore xant was rapid with peak plasma concentration around 1 to 3hours 
postdose. The terminal half-life was ~45 to 55 hours over a comparable dose range 
following single and multiple dose administration of lemborexant.  Accumulation of 
lemborexant following multiple dosing was lower than predicted by terminal half-life, with 
mean Cmax ranging from 1.21 to 2.39 and an area under the concentration -time curve from 
zero time to 96 hours postdose ( AUC [0-96h]) of 1.67 to 3.26 over the dose range. Based on the 
overal l drug accumulation, effective half-life of lemborexant ranged from 16.9 to 39.3 hours 
over the dose range.  Exposure (AUC [0-96h]) of the main inactive metabolites (M4, M9, M10) 
relative to lemborexant was 19.9% to 57.5% following multiple dosing at 25 mg for 14 day s.  
Additionally , lemborexant exposures were similar between health y volunteers administered 
lemborexant in the morning compared to otherwise health y subjects with primary  insomnia

Eisai
FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 19 of 66administered lemborexant in the evening, suggesting that the time of dosing does not affect 
the PK.
Based on in vitro data, lemborexant and its main metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) were 
metabolized via CYP3A as the primary  pathway. Coadministration of a single oral dose of 
lemborexant 10 mg  and oral itraconazole 200 mg administered once daily (QD) under stead y 
state conditions in healthy  volunteers resulted in a moderate interaction as evidenced by 
approximately  36
% and 3.7-fold increases in lemborexant Cmaxand area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity  (AUC [0-inf])
,respectivel y; the effect 
on lemborexant exposure during the 8 hours postdose was weak, as the with mean Cmax 
ranging from 1.21 to 2.39 and an area under the concentration -time curve from zero time to 
8hours postdose (AUC [0-8h])increased by approximately  1.75-fold.  The terminal half-life of 
lemborexant was extended from ~54 hours (lemborexant treatment only) to 118 hours 
following coadministration of itraconazole.  Exposure of the main metabolites of 
lemborexant, ie, M4, M9, and M10 decreased between 32 
-87% (Cmax) whereas AUC (0-inf)  
remained unchanged (M4), increased 2.4-f old (M9) and decreased by approximately  37% 
(M10) compared with the administration of lemborexant alone.  Terminal half-lives of the 
metabolites incre ased approximatel y 2-to 3-fold (terminal phase plasma half-life [t1/2]of 
~108 to 150 hours) compared to administration of lemborex antalone (t1/2~48 to 53 hours).  
Coadministration of a single 10-mgoral dose of lemborexant and oral rifampin 600 mg QD 
at stead y state resulted in decreases in lemborexant C max, and AUC (0-inf)by approximately 
92% and 97%, respectively , as compared with administration of lemborexant alone .
  In vitro 
data also showed lemborexant to exhibit some inhibitory  potential on CYP3A and CYP2B6.  
The effects of stead y state dosing of lemborexant (10 mg) on a combined single oral dose of 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate, 2 mg) and bupropion (a sensitive 2B6 substrate, 
75mg) in healthy  subjects showed no effect on the PK for midazolam but a weak effect on 
the PK of bupropion based on approximately  ~50% decreased exposure (Cmaxand AUC [0-inf]
for bupropion and the [S,S] -hydroxy lated metabolite of bupropion).  These findings showed 
that the observed PK for midazolam and bupropion 
in this study  were similar to reported 
values in literature ,which confirms that there were no apparent effects on the PK of either 
drug when coadministered (Heizmann, et al., 1983; Lai and Schroeder, 1983 )
.  In summary , 
these findings suggest that no clinically  meaningful interaction can be expected when 
lemborexant is administered concomitantl y with other sensitive CYP3A or CYP2B6 
substrates.  However, lemborexant exposure may considerably  increase or decrease when 
coadministered with either a strong CPY3A inhibitor or inducer respectively.
Regulatory  guidelines 
related to assessing PK in hepatic impaired subjects recommend that 
the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK ofthe drug and its main metabolites should be 
evaluated if hepatic metabolism accounts for at least 20% of elimination of the drug (FDA, 
2003).  In the case of lemborexant, the data from aradiolabeled 14C-human mass balance 
study  indicate that lemborexant is extensively  metabolized since only less than 13% of 
administered dose was recovered unchanged in feces only.  Urinary  excretion of unchanged 
lemborexant was not detectable indicating renal clearance is negligible.  The proposed 
metabolic pathway s of lemborexant involve primarily  oxidation of dimethy lpyrimidine 
moiety  of lemborexant to the M4, M9, and M10 metabolites. These metabolites accounted 
for 6.6%, 6.3%, and 12.5% of the total drug-related AUC (0-96h), respectively.  In vitro studies

FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 20 of 66also identifie d these human in vivo metabolites and indicated CYP3A -mediated metabolism
asthe predominant clearance pathway for lemborexant.  Overall, these results indicate that 
lemborexant meets regulatory  standards requiring assessment of the impact of hepatic 
impai rment on PK.
7.2 Stud y Rationale
This study  is being conducted to assess whether mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
influences the PK and metabolism of lemborexant, with the findings of this study  anticipated 
to guide future dosing recommendations in patients with various degrees of hepatic 
impairment.  Based on data from drug interaction with itraconazole as well as 
CYP3A -mediated metabolism being the predominant clearance pathway  for lemborexant, it 
is anticipated that a strong effect will be observed in severe hepatic impaired subjects, which 
will impact the PK of lemborexant, thus leading to contraindications in this subgroup of 
hepatic impairment subjects.  To mitigate the anticipated effect of hepatic function on 
lemborexant disposition, ongoing Phase 3 studies do not include subjects with severe hepatic 
disease, however, they do allow for enrollment of subjects with mild and moderate 
impairment, which likely reflects the anticipated insomnia patient population  Therefore, the 
proposed study  limits the population to mild and moderate impaired subjects only.  
Furthermore, a population PK analy sis applied to data from phase 2 and 3 studies will also be 
utilized to formulate a comprehensive dosing recommendation relevant to the mild and 
moderate hepatic -impaired subjects.
7.2.1 Study Design
The overall study  design proposed, including the dose, regimen, number of health y control 
subjects, endpoints, and analyses follows the recommendations from the latest guidelines by 
FDA and EMA on evaluation of PK in subjects with hepatic impairment (FDA, 2003; EMA, 
2005
). 
The proposed study  design includes the enrollment of patients with mild and moderate liver 
impairment (Child -Pugh class A and B respectively ).  Subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh class C) wil l be excluded from the study  as outlined above. 
The regulatory  guidelines include a provision for use of a reduced, sequential study  design, to 
evaluate the group of subjects with higher severity  of liver impairment first (such as 
moderate liver impairmen t), and if no effect on PK is demonstrated, then these results could 
be extrapolated to the subjects with liver impairment of lesser severit y.  In the case of 
lemborexant, the reduced study  design is considered to be unsuitable since a large effect in 
the moderate hepatic impaired subjects is expected based on the current disposition profile 
for lemborexant.  This design would require subsequent investigation in mild hepatic 
impaired subjects to ensure clarity  regarding lemborexant labeling.   
The proposed study  design includes 8 subjects per cohort of mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment and 8 matched control subjects, and will utilize an estimation -based approach to 
calculate the ratios of the geometric means rather than powering the study  to test for a

Clinical Study Protocol
(Per Amendment 01)E2006- A001 -104
Eisai
FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 21 of 66specific difference in exposure between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy 
controls.  In addition, 90% CIs for the slope parameter of the relationship between 
Child -Pugh score and apparent clearance of lemborexant may provide additional indication
of any effect (or lack of) on lemborexant PK.  This analysis will take into account all 
subjects’ data (N=24), thereb y increasing the possibility  to detect a relationship between 
severit y of liver impairment and lemborexant PK. 
7.2.2 Assessment of Severity of Liver Impairment 
As proposed for the study , both guidelines (FDA, 2003; EMA, 2005) recommend use of 
Child -Pugh Classification Score as a marker of degree of liver impairment.  The EU 
guidelines also recommend obtaining the adequate range of decreases in serum albumin and 
increases in bilirubin and prothrombin times.  Unlike serum creatinine or creatinine 
clearance, which have been used to assess the degree of renal impairment, there is no single 
measure or group of measures that has gained widespread clinical use to estimate the degree 
of liver impairment.  As the Child -Pugh classification system is based on laboratory -based 
parameters (serum albumin, bilirubin and prothrombin time) and also 2 clinical features 
(encephalopath y and ascites), the total score relies on the subjective assessments of these 
features ,and hence is associated with variability  in estimation of the degree of impairment.  
Among other models that have been increasingl y used as a measure of liver impairment ,the 
model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score, relies only  on the laboratory  parameters ,and 
thus, is more likely  to be consistent between different clinical centers for grading a particular 
patient for degree of liver impairment.  In addition, published reports have 
indicated a good 
correlation between the MEL D scores and Child -Pugh Scores (Albarmawi et al 2013).  
Therefore, as per the regulatory  guidelines, although the proposed study  will use the Child -
Pugh Classification as a primary  approach for characterizing degree of liver impairment, an 
exploratory  assessment of the correlation between the lemborexant PK and the MELD score 
will be included to aid clinical guidance.  Nonetheless, in agreement with the guidelines, the 
overall conclusions and dosing recommendations will be based on analysis using the Child -
Pugh Scores and their relationship with lemborexant PK.
7.2.3 Choice of Dose, Regimen, and PK Assessments 
A single -dose study  design is proposed based on the following PK characteristics of 
lemborexant and is in agreement with regulatory  guidelines
.  Following single -dose 
administration in healthy volunteers, lemborexant was safe and well tolerated up to 200mg 
and demonstrated approximate dose-proportional PK up to 75 mg with no time-dependency  
in plasma exposures upon multiple dosing.  The main metabolites, including M4, M9, and 
M10, are pharmacologically  active in vitro but are also P
-glycoprotein (P-gp)substrates; 
therefore the likelihood to penetrate into the central nervous system (CNS ) would be low.  
The half-lives of the M4, M9, and M10 metabolites were similar to lemborexant accounting 
for 6.3%, 6.6%, and 12.5% of the total plasma exposure (AUC 0-96h.  In addition, the AUC 
metabolite to parent ratios at steady  state was approximately  19.9% to 57.5% for a 2.5-fold 
higher dose (ie, 25mg) than the current planned dose level of 10 mg lemborexant.  Taken 
together, these findings support the conclusion that using a single dose of lemborexant is 
appropriate and translatable to the effect at stead y state.

FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 22 of 66The choice of the 10-mg dose is based on the fact that it is the highest dose being studied in 
the ongoing Phase 3 studies ,andisalso likely to be the selected dose for final registration.  
Taking into consideration the safety  and tolerability  of lemborexant in healthy  volunteers 
from single ascending doses up to 200 mg, the predicted exposure and safet y margins for 
lemborexant at 10 mg in the hepatic impaired subjects are well covered. 
With lemborexant as the only  pharmacologicall y active moiety , the primary PK endpoints for 
the study  will be the total Cmaxand AUC parameters for lemborexant, whereas the PK 
comparisons for the metabolites will be secondary  endpoints.  In order to account for 
potential prolongation of the half-life of lemborexant or metabolites in subjects with liver 
impairment, the PK sample s will be collected up to Day 14 after dosing.  One of the key 
assessments stipulated in all regulatory  guidelines for special population studies (ie, renal and 
hepatic impairment) is the evaluation of any change in the unbound fraction of the 
pharmacologi cally  active moieties in vivo and assessment of the relationship between the 
unbound plasma exposures (AUC u) and apparent clearance with measures of liver 
impairment, where binding of the drug to plasma proteins is high (eg, >90%).  With 
lemborexant and its main metabolites ( M4, M9, and M10), plasma protein binding based on 
in vitro studies is approximately  88%, 74%, 86%, and 92% bound to human plasma, 
respectivel y,and linear over the clinically  observed concentrations.  Due to the marginall y 
high plasma protein binding of lemborexant and its metabolites in the current study , 2 blood 
samples will be collected, oneat the maximum plasma exposure time and one at trough level.  
The respective unbound PK parameters for lemborexant will be derived by applying the 
unbound ratio to the PK parameters calculated using total plasma concentrations of 
lemborexant.  Plasma protein binding of metabolites will be assessed to compare these results 
to in vitro data and assess any difference between hepatic impaired subjects and healthy  
volunteers 
that is currently  not anticipated.  The analy sis of the unbound PK parameters 
(lemborexant only) between subjects with liver impairment and normal controls will be 
considered as secondary  PK parameter endpoints only .

9INVESTIGA TIONAL PLA N
9.1 Overall Study  Design and Plan
E2006- A001 -104 isa multicenter, single dose, open -label, parallel -group study  in subjects 
with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and matched (with regard to age [±10years], 
sex, and body  mass index [BMI , ±20%]) health y control subjects. The study  will enroll a 
total of 24 subjects, including 16 subjects with impaired hepatic function; 8subjects each in 
Child -Pugh class A (mild) and B (moderate).  At least 8healthy  subjects will be dosed as one 
control cohort to match (1:1) to the subjects with hepatic impairment in each Child -Pugh 
class with regard to age, sex, and BMI. 
The study  will consist of 2 phases:Prerandomization and Treatment.  The Prerandomization
Phase will include 2study  periods; Screening and Baseline (Day  -1).  The subjects will be 
admitted to the clinical facility  on Day  -1, remain co nfine d to the clinic until Day  8, and then 
return to the clinical facility  for additional PK sampling as outpatients until Day 14.  In the 
event of early discontinuation of the subjects, the subjects with Child Pugh Class A and B 
(Cohorts A and B) and the match ed controls (Cohort C) may  be replaced.
On Day 1, the subjects will be administered a single 10-mg dose of lemborexant with 
approximately  240 mL of water in the morning after an overnight fast.  The blood samples 
for PK assessments will be collected at prespecified intervals up to 312 hours postdose
administration.  The subjects will be discharged on Day 14 of the study .  In addition, the 
blood samples forplasma protein binding assessments of lemborexant will be collected from 
each subject at 2 time po ints; approximately  1 hour and 
24hours postdose .
The end of the stud y will be the date of the last st udy visit for the last subject.
9.1.1 Prerandomization Phase
The Prerandomization Phase will include a Screening Period and a Baseline Period.

The purpose of the Screening Period is to obtain informed consent and to establish protocol 
eligibility .  Procedures to be followed when obtaining informed consent are detailed in 
Section 5.3.  Screening period assessments and timing thereof are shown in Section 9.5.2.
9.1.1.2 Baseline Period
The purpose of the Baseline Period is to confirm protocol eligibility and to obtain baseline 
data for assessment .  Subjects who complete the Baseline Period and meet the criteria for 
inclusion/exclusion (Section 9.3.1 and Section 9.3.2
) will begin the Treatment Phase.   
Baseline assessments and timing thereof are shown in Section 9.5.2. 
9.1.2 Treatment Phase
The Treatment Phase will consist of 1 study  period of 14days.  The Treatment Phase
assessments and timing thereof are shown in Section
9.5.2.
9.2 Discussion of Study  Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
This single dose, 
parallel- group study  aims to investigate the effects of mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment on thePK of lemborexant and its main metabolites (M4, M9, and M10)
.
At least 24subjects will be enrolled, and 16of these subjects will have impaired (mild or 
moderate) hepatic function .  The other approximately 8subjects will be health y and will 
serve as thecontrol group .  Health y subjects will be matched (1:1) with the8subjects with
mild hepatic impairment and the8subjects with moderate hepatic impairment according to
age (± 10years), sex, and BMI (± 20%) .  
The data from this study  willhelp guide specific dosing recommendations in insomnia 
disorder and/or ISWRD patients with impaired hepatic function and establish labeling 
recommendations for this new chemical entity .
Adjudication Committee ( revised per Amendment 01)
An independent Adjudication Committee will be employ ed at intervals to review, in a
blinded manner, AEs that could potentially  be considered cataplex y or seizure. A set of
preferred terms constituting a customized Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities
(MedDRA) query for cataplex y or seizure will be used to identify  events for adjudication
(including cataplex y, muscle fatigue, muscular weakness, muscle tone disorder, hypotonia,
drop attacks, slurred speech, diplopia, falls, convulsions [standardized MedDRA query
(SMQ) narrow and broad], atypical migraine, loss of consciousness, decreased
consciousness, myoclonus, syncope, transient global amnesia, lipothy mia, [faintness] and
transient ischemic attack). To assist in the preparation of narratives about such events and to
support the committee’s adjudication process, investigators and site staff will be instructed to
query  subjects who report any of the above events for supplemental information using a
questionnaire for events potentially  related to cataplex y and the serious adverse event (SAE)
form for an y of the above events considered serious.

9.5.1.4.2 PHARMACODYNAMIC , PHARM ACOGENO MIC,AND OTHER BIOMARKER ASSESSMENTS
Not applicable.
9.5.1.5 Safety Assessments
Safety  assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs and SAEs; regular 
monitoring of hematology , blood chemistry , and urine values; periodic measurement of vital 
signs and ECGs; and performance of phy sical examinations as detailed in Table 4.
9.5.1.5.1 ADVERSE EVENTS
An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study , the study drug islemborexant . 
The criteria for identify ing AEs in this study  are:
•Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product . Note:  Every  sign or 
symptom should not be listed as a separat e AE if the applicable disease (diagno sis) is 
being reported as an AE
•Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease 
•Any deterioration in non-protocol required measurements of a laboratory  value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study  drug
•Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)
•An abnormal laboratory  test result should be consid ered an AE if the identified laboratory  
abnormality  leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study  drug, or withholding 
of study  drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not.
All AEs observed during the study  will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of 
relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the 
subject signs the study  ICF through the last visit in the Treatment Phase and for 28days after 
the subject’s last dose.  Serious AEs will also be collected for 28 days after the last dose 
(or5times the half-life, whichever is longer).

Clinical Study Protocol
(Per Amendment 01)E2006- A001 -104
Eisai
FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 37 of 66Abnormal laboratory  values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility  of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory  abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF.
All AEs must be followed for 28 days (or 5the half-life, whichever is longer) after the 
subject’s last dose, or until resolution, whichever comes first.  All SAEs must be followed to 
resolution or, if resolution is unlikely , to stabilization.
Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.
Assessing Severit y of A dverse Events
AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the CRF.  The definitions are as follows:
Mild Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily  activity
Moderate Discomfort su fficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y
Severe Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily  activity
The criteria for assessing severity  are different than those used for seriousness (see
Section 9.5.1.5.2 for the definition of an SAE).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are:
•Temporal relationship of t he onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment
•The course of the event, especially  the effect of discontinuation of study  treatment or 
reintroduction of stud y treatment, as applicable
•Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments
•The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the 
occurrence of the 
event
•The presence of nonstudy , treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the eve nt
Classification of Causality
The relationship of each AE to the study  drug will be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question:

Eisai
FINAL (v2.0):  28 Feb2018Confidential Page 38 of 66Is there a reasonable possibility  that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (related) A causal relationship between the study  drug and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility .
No (not related) A causal relationship between the study  drug and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility .
9.5.1.5.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH S PECIAL SITUATIONS
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
•Results in death
•Is life-threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was al lowed to continue, might have caused death)
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
•Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study  drug)
Other important medical events that may not be immediately  life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, events associ ated with special situations include pregnancy  or 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study  drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medication error.  These events associated with special situations are to be 
captured using the SAE p rocedures but are to be considered as SAEs onl y if they  meet one of 
the above criteria.  All AEs associated with special situations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they
 meet the criteria for SAEs.   
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely , to stabilization.
The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” ( ie, there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization:
•Hospitalizations for respite ca re 
•Planned hospitalizations required b y the protocol
•Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed post study  drug administration)

of study  drug
•Hospitalization for routine maintenance of a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was in 
place before stud y entry
If possible, a blood sample for PK analy sis should be drawn at the first report of an SA E or a 
severe unexpected AE and at its resolution.
9.5.1.5.3 LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS
Clinical laboratory  tests to be performed, including hematology , chemistry , and urinaly sis, 
are summarized inTable 3.  Subjects should be in a seated or supine position during blood 
collection and are to be fasting for at least 4 hours before blood is drawn for clinical

protocol (seeSection 9.5.1.5.1) and the CRF Completion Guidelines.  In these instances, the 
AE corresponding to the laboratory  abnormality  will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.
9.5.1.5.4 VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS
Vital sign measurements ( ie, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [ BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respiratory  rate [per minute], body  temperature [in centigrade]), and weight (kg) 
will be obtained as designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 4) by a 
validated method.  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been in 
supine position for 5 minutes.  All BP measu rements should be performed on the same arm, 
preferabl y by the same person.
When vital signs are to be obtained concurrentl y with PK or other blood samples, the vital 
sign measurements will be performed prior to drawing blood samples in order to maximize 
the accuracy  of blood sampling times while minimizing the potent ial effects of blood 
drawing on recordings obtained during safet y assessments.
9.5.1.5.5 PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS
Comprehensive and abbreviated 
physical examinations will be performed as designated in
the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 4).  Documentation of the physical 
examination will be included in the source documentation at the site.  Significant findings at 
the Screening Visit will be recorded on theMedical History  and Current Medical Conditions 
CRF.  Changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an 
AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.
Comprehensive Physical Examination
A comprehensive physical examination will include evaluation sof the head, ey es, ears, nose, 
throat, neck, chest (including heart and lungs) ,abdomen, limbs , skin, and a complete 
neurological examination .  The subject will be queried regarding physical status and 
subject ive sy mptoms as well. 
Abbreviated /Routine Physical Examination
Health status will be assessed by brief evaluation of the chest (including heart and lungs), 
abdomen and limbs ,and other physical conditions of note.  The subject must be queried 
regarding c hanges in ph ysical status since the last examination.

be reported on a completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no later than 
24hours from the date the investigator becomes aware of the event (revised per Amendment 
01).
SAEs, regardless of causality  assessment, must be collected through the last visit in the 
Treatment Phase and for 28 days after the subject’s last dose .  All SAEs must be followed to 
resolution or, if resolution is unlikely , to stabilization.  Any SAE judged by the investigator 
to be related to the study treatment or any protocol- required procedure should be reported to 
the sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed since study  completion.
The detai led contact information for reporting of SAEs is provided in the Investigator 
Study File.
For urgent safety issues call:   (24/7 number). 
For urgent safety issues, please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to the 
subject and contact the appropriate study  team member listed in the I nvestigator Study  File.
It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completel y as possible at the 
time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality .
Any follow -up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24hours of its 
receipt. (revised per Amendment 01)  If the follow -up information changes the investigator’s 
assessment of causality , this should also be noted on the follow -up SAE form.
Preliminary  SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including copies of hospital case reports, autops y reports, and other documents requested by 
the sponsor.

9.5.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding
Any pregnancy  in a female subject in which the estimated date of conception is either before 
the last visit or within 28 days of last study  treatment or any exposure to study  drug through 
breastfeeding during study  treatment or within 28days of last study  treatment must be 
reported .
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy  is suspected to be related to study  drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment.
A congenital anomal y, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same time frame and in 
the same format as all other SA Es (seeSection 9.5.4.1 ).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must be reported by fax or 
email as soon as possible but no later than 1 business dayfrom the date the investigator 
becomes aware of the pregnancy . The contact information for the reporting of pregnancies 
and exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding is provided in the Investigator Study  File.  
The Pregnancy  Report Form must be used for reporting.  All pregnancies must be followed to 
outcome.  Theoutcome of the pregnancy  must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 1 business day from the date the investigator becomes aware of the outcome.
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the study.

9.5.4.3.1 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE ,
MISUSE, A BUSE, OR MEDICATION ERROR
AEs associated with study  drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer to AEs 
associated with uses of the study  drug outside of that specified by the protocol.  Overdose, 
misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study  drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol -defined dose
Misuse Intentional and inappropriate use of study  drug not in accordance with 
the protocol
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intentional excessive use of study  drug 
accompanied b y harmful physical or ps ychological effects

drug use or subject harm while the study  drug is in the control of site 
personnel or the subject.
All AEs associated with overdose ,misuse, abuse, or medication error should be captured on 
the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Section 9.5.4.1
even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  Abuse is alway s to be captured as an AE.  If the 
AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error does not meet serious 
criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should 
be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.
9.5.4.4 Expedited Reporting
The sponsor must inform investigator and regulatory  authorities of reportable events, in 
compliance with applicable regulatory  requirements, on an expedited basis ( ie, within 
specific time frames).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE 
information in the manner described above.
9.5.4.5 Breaking the Blind
Not applicable
9.5.4.6 Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events
AEs will be reported by the sponsor or a third party acting on behalf of the sponsor to 
regulatory  authorities in compliance with local and regional law and established guidance.  
The format of these reports will be dictated by local and regional requirements.
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects
The investigator may withdraw the subject from the study  at any time for safet y or 
administra tive reasons.  A subject may elect to discontinue the study  at any time for any 
reason.  All subjects who discontinue the study  are to complete the study ’s early 
discontinuation procedures indicated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 4).
The investigator will promptly  explain to the subject involved that the study  will be 
discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary 
measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by  
mail, phone, or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the 
status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs 
and sy mptoms.
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for 1 of these primary 
reasons: AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, withdrawal of consent, pregnancy , study  
terminated by  sponsor, or other.  In addition to t he primary  reason, the subject may  indicate 1 
or more of secondary  reasons for discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be 
collected on the Subject Disposition CRF.

9.5.6 Confirmation of Medical Care by Another Physician (for Hepatic Impairment 
Subjects):
The investigator will instruct subjects to inform site personnel when they are planning to 
receive medical care by another phy sician.  A t each visit, the investigator will ask the subject 
whether he/she has received medical care by another physician since the last visit or is 
planning to do so in the future.  When the subject is going to receive medical care by  another 
physician, the inves tigator, with the consent of the subject, will inform the other physician 
that the subject is participating in the clinical study .
9.6 Data Quality  Assurance
This study  will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, 
SOPs, working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines.  Site audits 
may be made periodically  by the sponsor’s or the CRO’s qualified compliance auditing team, 
which is an independent function from the stud y team responsible for conduct of the study .  
9.6.1 Data Collection
Data required by the protocol will be collected on the CRFs and entered into a validated data 
management system that is compliant with all regulatory  requirements.  As defined by ICH 
guidelines, the CRF is a printed, optical, or electron ic document designed to record all of the 
protocol -required information to be reported to the sponsor on each study  subject.
Data collection on the CRF must follow the instructions described in the CRF Completion 
Guidelines.  The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all 
clinical data entered on the CRF.  The investigator or designee as identified on Form FDA 
1572 must sign the completed CRF to attest to its accuracy , authent icity, and completeness.

Analy sis Set will be used for summaries of plasma concentrations and for analyses, 
summaries, and listings of PK parameters.
The effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of lemborexant, the primary  PK parameters 
based on total Cmax, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf)will be compared between the cohort of healthy  
normal controls and the cohorts of subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment as 
defined by Child-Pugh classes A or B. A general linear model of logarithmicall y 
transformed values with hepatic function class as a fixed effect will be utilized to estimate 
the geometric mean ratio (and two-sided 90% confidence intervals) of subjects with 
mild/normal and moderate/normal hepatic function.  Similar statistical analyses will be 
conducted for the PK parameters of the metabolites andunbound lemborexant as secondary 
endpoints. Protein binding will be calculated for metabolites without any assessment of PK

9.7.1.8.1 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE
All subjects enrolled in the study  will receive a single 10-mg dose (1 ×10 mg lemborexant 
tablet) in the morning after an overnight fast.
9.7.1.8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology  using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulat ory Activities 
(MedDRA).  AEswill be coded to the MedDRA (Version 20.1 or higher) lower level term 
(LLT) closest to the verbatim 
term.  The linked MedDRA preferred term (PT) and primary 
system organ class (SOC) are also captured in the database.
A treatme nt-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during 
treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or 
•Reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped 
before treatment, or 
•Worsens in severity  during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is 
continuous.

9.7.1.8.3 LABORATORY VALUES
Laboratory  results will be summarized using S ystème International (SI) units, as appropriate.  
For all quantitative parameters listed in Section 9.5.1.5.3, the actual value and the change 
from baseline to each postbaseline visit and to the end of treatment (defined as the last 
on-treatment value) will be summarized by visit and group using descriptive statistics.  
Qualitative parameters listed in Section 9.5.1.5.3 will be summarized using frequencies 
(number and percentage of subjects), and changes from baseline to each postbaseline visit 
and to end of treatment will be reported using shift tables.  Percentages will be based on the

PROCEDURES)
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specificall y 
affecting the safety  of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientif ic quality  of the 
study  require additional approval by  the applicable I RBs/IECs.  These requirements should in 
no way  prevent any  immediate action from being taken by  the investigator, or by  the sponsor, 
in the interest of preserving the safety  of all subj ects included in the study .  If the investigator 
determines that an immediate change to or deviation from the protocol is necessary  for safety  
reasons to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical monitor and 
the IRB/IEC for the s ite must be notified immediately .  The sponsor must notify  the health or 
regulatory  authorit y as required per local regulations.
Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not require 
submission to health or regulatory  authority  or the IRB/IEC, but the health or regulatory  
authority  and IRB/IEC should be kept informed of such changes as required by local 
regulations.  In these cases, the sponsor may be required to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and 
the Competent Authorities d etailing such changes.
11.1 Adherence to the Protocol
The investigator will conduct the study  in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to ICH 
E6, Section 4.5).
11.2 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the investigator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visits.  Monitoring visits to each site will be 
conducted by the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator will 
allow the CRA to inspect the clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy  facilities to assure 
compliance with GCP and local regulatory  requirements.  The CRFs and subject’s 
corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully available for 
review by the sponsor’s representatives at regular intervals. These reviews verify  adherence 
to study  protocol and data accuracy  in accordance with local regulations.  All records at the 
site are subject to inspection by  the local auditing agency  and IRB/IEC review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to 
the following:
•Clinic, office, or hospital charts
•Copies or transcribed health care provider notes which have been certified for accuracy  
after production
•Recorded data from automated instruments such as IxRS, x-rays, and other imaging

•Correspondence regarding a study  subject’s treatment between physicians or memoranda 
sent to the I RBs/IECs
•CRF components ( eg, questionnaires) that are completed directly  by subjects and serve as 
their own source
11.3 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be completed for each subject by qualified and authorized 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a section of the CRF itself is used as source document.  Any c orrection to entries made 
on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction is dated, the 
individual making the correct is identified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original data are not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the 
study  should be collected.
The investigator must sign each CRF.  The investigator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a cop y of the CRFs.
11.4 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents .
11.5 Retention of Records
The circumstances of completion or termination of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator is responsible for retaining all study  documents, including but not limited to the 
protocol, copies of CRFs, the Investigator's Brochure, and regulatory  agency  registration 
documents (eg, Form FDA 1572, ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence).  The site should plan 
to retain study  documents, as directed by the sponsor, for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 3 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.

11.6 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Quality  Assurance 
department conducts audits of clinical research activities in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance with the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local 
regulations. If a government regulatory  authority  requests an inspection during the study  or 
after its completion, the investigator must inform the sponsor immediately .
11.7 Handling of Study  Drug
All study  drug will be supplied to the principal investigator (or a designated pharmacist) by 
the sponsor or designee .  Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriat e secure area (eg,
locked cabinet) and stored according to the conditions specified on the drug labels.  The 
investigator (or a designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment 
and dispensing of the study  drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy of which must be 
given to the sponsor at the end of the study .  An accurate record of the date and amount of 
study  drug dispensed to each subject must be available for inspection at any time.  The CRA 
will visit the site and review these documents along with all other study  conduct documents 
at appropriate intervals once study  drug has been received by  the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug labels or any partly  used or unused 
drug supply  before approval to do so by the sponsor.  At the conclusion of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the investigator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy  of the completed drug disposition form 
to the sponsor’s CRA or designee ,when approval is given by  the sponsor, 
the investigator (or 
a designated pharmacist) will destroy  supplies and containers at the site.

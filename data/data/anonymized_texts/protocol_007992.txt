Phase of Development  Phase 3  
Background and Rationale  Combined administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen has been shown 
to provide superior analgesia over administration of comparable doses of 
either component alone or placebo, when given  as an intravenous 
formulation or as a solid oral tablet in the postoperative setting. This has  
been demonstrated in three Phase 2/3 clinical trials in patients following 
third molar removal or arthroscopic knee surgery using oral tablets of 
Maxigesic® (acetaminophen 500 mg + ibuprofen 150 mg), in one Phase 3 
clinical study in dental surgery patient s with Combogesic® (acetaminophen 
325 mg + ibuprofen 97.5 mg) and in one Phase 3 trial in bunionectomy 
patients using Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + ibuprofen 3 
mg/ml in 100 ml solution for infusion).  
 
The superior efficacy of the combination does not appear to come at the 
expense of tolerability. In the Phase 3 study of Maxigesic® IV in 
bunionectomy patients, there were no differences between patients treated 
with Maxigesic® IV and those treated with intravenous acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen or placebo in the rate of discontinuations due to adverse events 
(AEs), the overall incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) or the 
severity of TEAEs. The incidence of most common TEAEs (affecting ≥ 10% 
of the study population), including gastroin testinal disorders, nervous 
system disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, and 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was not significantly different 
between treatment groups. Some differences were observed between

Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 5 of 37 
treatment groups  in the incidence of specific AEs, such as vomiting and 
administration site pain, however these were attributable to the individual 
components, acetaminophen and ibuprofen respectively.  
 
All safety data obtained for Maxigesic® IV to date has come from pat ients 
exposed to single doses of the study drug (n=60) or six hourly doses for up 
to 48 hours (n=75). This study aims to determine the tolerability of repeated 
doses of Maxigesic® IV over an extended period of exposure.  
Objectives  To determine the incide nce of treatment -emergent adverse events, and 
changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory values associated with prolonged 
exposure to Maxigesic® IV  
Study Design  Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, single arm, multiple dose study to evaluate 
the safety o f Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + ibuprofen 3 mg/ml 
in 100 ml solution for infusion)  
Number of Participants  225 (including 50 participants with at least 5 days exposure)  
Main Inclusion Criteria  - Male or female ≥ 18 years of age  
- Requirement of multiple doses of parenterally administered 
nonopioid analgesics over multiple days as a result of surgery (non -
laparoscopic general, plastic or orthopedic surgery)  
- Expected stay  in facility  ≥ 48 hours  
Study Drugs & Treatment  Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + ibuprofen 3 mg/ml in 100 ml 
solution for infusion)  
Study Drug Administration  All study drugs will be administered by injection into a dedicated indwelling 
venous cannula, infused over 15 minutes. The study drugs will be 
administe red every 6 hours (q6h) for a minimum of 48 hours (8 doses).  
Duration of Treatment  The estimated duration of the study for each subject is approximately 42 
days, which includes a screening period of up to 30 days, a treatment period 
of at least 2 days (with up to 50 participants treated for at least 5 days), and 
a post treatment follow -up visit 7  ± 2 days after the last dose. The first dose 
is to be administe red in the immediate postoperative period, as soon as the 
patient is stable following surgery.  
Study Endpoints  - Incidence of TEAEs  at any time during the treatment period  
- The time course of TEAEs  
- Incidence of treatment -related adverse events  
- Incidence of TEAEs of interest : 
- cardiovascular thrombotic events  
- gastrointestinal events  
- renal conditions  
- hepatic conditions  
- administration site conditions  
- bleeding related to surgical procedures  
- Changes in vital sign measurements  
- Changes in clinical laboratory values  
- Patient’s global evaluation of study drug  
Statistical Methods Summary  All subjects who receive at least one dose of the study drug will be included 
in the safety population. The safety population will be used for all summaries 
of study e ndpoints. Early withdrawals for any reason will be tabulated.

of concomitant medications (e.g. opioids) , vitals and laboratory results  will 
be summarized as means, medians, standard deviations, ranges and 
frequencies and percentages as approp riate. 
 
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as events first occurring or 
worsening during the course of the study, regardless of their relationship to 
the study drug. Treatment -emergent adverse events will be coded to 
MedDRA System Organ Class Code and Preferred Term and tabulated as 
frequencies and percentages  in the following time periods: At any timepoint 
during the observational period ; at any timepoint during the treatment 
period ; on Day 1 ; Day 2 ; Day 3 ; Day 4 ; Day 5 ; Day 6+ ; and duri ng follow -
up. Clinically significant changes from baseline in vital sign measurements 
or laboratory test results will be classified as adverse events.  
  
The proportion of TEAEs that are considered by the Investigator to be 
“probably ” or “definitely” relate d to study medication  (treatment -related 
AEs, TRAEs ) will be summarized .  
 
All cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, administration site 
conditions and bleeding -related AEs will be summarized and the proportion 
of these that are considered trea tment -related will be tabulated.  
 
The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by gender, race, age (<65, 65 -
75, >75 years), duration of exposure (≤ 48 hours, 48 hours – 4 days, ≥ 5 
days) and indication (surgery type). This analysis is subject to recruitment 
of sufficient participants within each subgroup . 
 
Vital sign measurements and clinical laboratory values at each scheduled 
timepoint will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics , including 
means, standard deviations and ranges . Summary shift tables will be 
produced  overall and by duration of treatment ( ≤ 48 hours, 48 hours – 4 days, 
≥ 5 days ) of the number of cases with normal baseline laboratory tests 
changed to abnormal at the end of the treatment period , and abnormal 
baseline  laboratory tests worsened at the end of the treatment period , with 
the severity of changes summari zed as proportional effects.  
 
The use of concomitant medications following study drug administration 
will be summarized as frequencies and percentages  within  ATC -coded drug 
groups .   
 
The frequency and percentage of subjects rating the study drug as ‘poor’, 
‘fair’, ‘good’, ‘very good’ and ‘excellent’ will be summarized.  
Sample Size Calculation  In total, 225 participants will be enrolled in this study, with a t least 50 
participants exposed to the study drug for at least 5 days. The sample size 
for this safety study is not based on formal statistical power calculations but 
will ensure with 95% probability that any TEAEs present in approximately 
2% or more of th e target population will be identified in this study.

Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 11 of 37 
1 INTRODUCTION  
This protocol describes a Phase 3 safety study designed to examine the safety of a combination of intravenous 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Maxigesic® IV). 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
Multimod al analgesia with a variety of analgesics (systemic pharmacological therapies with local, regional 
and neuraxial anesthetics) is strongly recommended for the treatment of postoperative pain (1). In terms of 
systemic treatments, nonopioid oral or parenteral acetaminophen and/or nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) generally form the basis of treatment, in conjunction with opioids of increasing strength as required. 
Combined treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen has been shown to provide superior analgesia over 
administration of comparable  doses of either component alone or placebo, when administered as an intravenous 
formulation or as a solid oral tablet in the postoperative setting.  
AFT Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has sponsored several Phase 2/3 studies which have demonstrated that Maxigesic® 
tablets (acetaminophen 500 mg + ibuprofen 150 mg, 2 tablets per dose) and Combogesic® tablets 
(acetaminophen 325 mg + ibuprofen 97.5 mg, 3 tablets per dose) provide superior pain following third molar 
removal or arthroscopic knee surgery than either drug al one or placebo (2–4).   
1.2 DRUG NAME  
To extend the therapeutic advantage of Maxigesic®/Combogesic® to patients who may not be able to take oral 
analgesics, due to patient intubation, sedation, postoperative nausea and vomiting and reduced gastric motility, 
AFT Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ha s developed a fixed -dose combination containing  acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + 
ibuprofen 3 mg/ml in 100 ml solution for infusion (Maxigesic® IV). Maxigesic® IV is intended for the relief 
of mild to moderate pain and the reduction of fever, when administration by  intravenous route is clinically 
justified by an urgent need to treat pain or hyperthermia and/or when other routes of administration are not 
possible.  
1.2.1 Clinical Studies  
Maxigesic® IV has been evaluated in two Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies and one Phase 3 efficacy and safety 
study.  
The first study, AFT -MXIV -01, was a single -dose, open -label, 5 -period crossover pharmacokinetic study in 
30 healthy volunteers. This study found that pharmacokinetic parameters for acetaminophen and ibuprofen 
were very similar for the combination and monotherapy intravenous preparations; ratios of C max, AUC t, and 
AUC 0-∞ values fell within the 80 -125% acceptable bioequivalence range. Precise dose proport ionality for both 
compounds was also determined for the half dose of the intravenous formulation compared with the full dose. 
The relative bioavailability of acetaminophen (93.78%) and ibuprofen (96.45%) confirmed the 
pharmacokinetic equivalence between th e oral (Maxigesic®) and intravenous formulations of the fixed dose 
combination (5). 
A second pharmacokinetic study, AFT -MXIV -06, was conducted to compare Maxigesic® IV with brands of

Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 12 of 37 
intravenous acetaminophen and ibuprofen that have been approved in the United States, as well as 
Combogesic® tablets (acetaminophen 325 mg + ibuprofen 97.5 mg, 3 tablets per dose). The study was a single -
dose, open -label, 4 -period crossover pharmacokinetic study in 30 healthy volunteers. Similar to AFT -MXIV -
01, ratios of C max, AUC t, and AUC 0-∞ for Max igesic® IV to OfirmevTM and CaldolorTM fell within the 80 -125% 
acceptable bioequivalence range. The relative bioavailability of acetaminophen (83%) and ibuprofen (85%) 
re-confirmed the pharmacokinetic equivalence between the oral (Combogesic®) and intraven ous formulations.  
A Phase 3 efficacy and safety study demonstrated the superior analgesic effect of Maxigesic® IV in 276 
participants reporting moderate to severe postoperative pain following distal, first metatarsal bunionectomy 
(6). Patients were treated with six hourly doses of Maxigesic® IV, acetaminophen IV (1000 mg), ibuprofen IV 
(300 mg) or placebo for 48 hours. The study found that Maxigesic® IV provided superior pain relief to  
comparable doses of either monocomponent or placebo and reduced the requirement for opioid rescue 
medication.  
Importantly, the superior efficacy of the combination does not appear to come at the expense of tolerability. In 
the Phase 3 study of Maxigesic® IV in bunionectomy patients, there were no differences between patients 
treated with Maxigesic® IV and those treated with acetaminophen IV, ibuprofen IV or placebo in the rate of 
discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs), the overall incidence of treatm ent-emergent AEs (TEAEs) or 
the severity of TEAEs. The incidence of most common TEAEs (affecting ≥ 10% of the study population), 
including gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, general disorders and administration site 
conditions, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was not significantly different between treatment 
groups. Some differences were observed between treatment groups in the incidence of specific AEs, such as 
vomiting and administration site pain, however these were attribut able to  the individual components, 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen respectively.  
All safety data obtained for Maxigesic® IV to date has come from patients exposed to single doses of the study 
drug (n=60) or six hourly doses for up to 48 hours (n=75). The pres ent study aims to determine the tolerability 
of repeated doses of Maxigesic® IV over an extended period of exposure in a larger population.  
1.2.2 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
All drugs and all clinical studies have risks. However, these are likely to be minimal in the present study 
because both acetaminophen and ibuprofen have been used extensively for many years at these dose levels.  
The dose ranges in this study fall well wi thin the range that has been used worldwide for over 15 years. 
Previous studies have indicated that there is no change in the safety profile of either drug when administered 
as a fixed -dose combination. The potential benefit of this study lies in its poten tial to provide superior analgesia 
to participants requiring acute pain relief following surgery.

2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
2.1 STUDY HYPOTHESIS  
The study hypothesis is that Maxigesic® IV (intravenous acetaminophen 1000 mg + intravenous ibuprofen 300 
mg/ 100 ml solution for infusion) is well tolerated over a treatment period of 5 days, and that the safety profile 
does not markedly change with extended exposure of 5 days.  
2.2 OBEJECTIVES AND  ENDPOINTS  
2.2.1 Primary Objective and Endpoint  
The primary objective is to summarize  the safety profile of Maxigesic® IV in patients exposed for ≥ 48 hours.  
The primary endpoint is the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events  associated with exposure to 
Maxigesic® IV.  
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives and Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed:  
- The time course of treatment -emergent adverse events  
- Treatment -related adverse events  
- Treatment -emergent adverse events of interest (cardiovascular, gast rointestinal, renal, hepatic , 
administration site conditions and bleeding -related events)  
- Changes in vital sign measurements  
- Changes in clinical laboratory values  
- Patient’s global evaluation of the study drug  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, single arm, multiple dose study to evaluate the safety of 
Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/mL + ibuprofen 3 mg/mL in 100 mL solution for infusion). A flow 
chart providing a schematic rep resentation of the study design is provided in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Schematic of Trial Design  
 
The study drug, Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + ibuprofen 3 mg/ml in 100 ml solution for 
infusion), will be administered by injection into a dedicated indwelling venous cannula, infused over 15 
minutes. The study drug will be administered every 6 hours (q6h) for a  minimum of 48 hours (8 doses), with 
some patients treated for at least 5 days (≥ 20 doses).  
The study is open -label and single arm. All eligible participants will be assigned to the same study drug, and 
all patients and study staff will know the treatment being administered.  
3.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN  
The study is designed to investigate the saf ety and tolerability of Maxigesic® IV in a larger study population 
over an extended period of time. As Maxigesic® IV may be used for longer than 48 hours in clinical practice, 
the study aims to determine if prolonged exposure to Maxigesic® IV results in an y changes to the safety profile.  
The study is designed as a descriptive investigation of the safety profile of Maxigesic® IV in a larger sample 
size than has previously been evaluated. The study aims is to determine  the safety profile and the temporal 
nature of the safety profile after extended  exposure to Maxigesic® IV for ≥ 48 hours.

4.4 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA  
All participants have the right to withdraw at any point during the study without prejudice. Investigators can 
discontinue any participant at any time. Whether participant withdra wal is the decision of the participant, or 
an Investigator, the following situations may occur:  
1. The participant is withdrawn from study medication and the participant withdraws consent to release 
follow -up information.  
2. The participant is withdrawn from st udy medication,  but all follow -up information can still be collected.  
3. The participant is withdrawn from study medication temporarily, but then recommences, and all follow -
up information is collected.  
If one of these circumstances should occur, the manageme nt of the participant will be at the clinical discretion 
of his or her treating physician.  
It is important to obtain complete follow -up safety data for as many participants as possible whether or not 
they receive their assigned treatment or have discontinu ed the study drug. Every attempt will therefore be made 
to collect follow -up information except for from those participants who specifically withdraw consent to 
release of such information.   
It will be documented whether or not each participant completed the clinical study. If for any reason the study 
treatment or observations were discontinued, the reason will be recorded,  and the Sponsor will be notified 
promptly.

Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 23 of 37 
7.3 FOLLOW -UP 
A follow -up visit will be conducted 7  ± 2 days after the last dose of study drug. At this follow -up, any additional 
adverse event and concomitant medication data will be collected. Additionally, a physical examination 
including an assessment of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate) will be 
conducted.  
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Participants experiencing adverse event s will be followed clinically until their health has returned to baseline 
status or until all abnormal values have returned to normal or have otherwise been explained. The Investigators 
will provide or arrange appropriate supportive care for the participan t if necessary.  
Adverse events common to acetaminophen and ibuprofen are listed in Appendix 2.  
8.1 DEFINITIONS  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is defined as any unintended, unfavorable clinical sign or symptom, any new illness or 
disease or deterioration of existing illness or disease, or any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory 
variables (e.g., hematological, biochemical, hormon al) or other clinical tests (e.g., ECG), whether or not 
considered treatment related.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) are defined as event s that emerge during treatment , having been 
absent pre -treatment, or that worsen relative to the pre -treatme nt status (ICH E9) . 
Treatment -emergent adverse events that are considered by the Investigator to be  “probably” or “definitely” are 
treatment -related adverse events  (TRAEs).  
Note that the definition could include accidents and the reasons for changes in med icine (drug and/or dose), 
medical, nursing and/or pharmacy consultation, and admission to hospital or surgical operations.  
Normal postoperative sequelae, including pain, itching, bruising, numbness, bleeding, burning, tingling, and 
edema at the surgical si te, will not be recorded as AEs unless they are of greater severity and/or intensity than 
would be expected in the surgeon/Investigator’s opinion.  
Planned hospital admissions and/or surgical operations for an illness or disease which existed before the dru g 
was given or the participant was enrolled in the clinical study will not be considered adverse events.  
The severity of an adverse event and the relationship to study medication will be assessed by the Investigator 
(see Appendix 1).  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an AE (at any dose of study drug) that:  
- results in death;  
- is life -threatening (i.e., the participant was, in the opinion of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; this does not include an even t that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
Confidential -Proprietary Information    
 
Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 24 of 37 
might have caused death);  
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
- requires in -participant hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization;  
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
- is another me dically significant event that, on the basis of appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g. allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse).  
An adverse event fulfilling any one or more of these criteria must be reported as a serious adver se event. The 
circumstances surrounding the occurrence of the event must be gathered, however the event itself must be 
reported, irrespective of the circumstances.  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe adverse events. Severity is an esti mate or measure 
of the intensity of an adverse event, while the criteria for serious are indications of adverse participant 
outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe adverse event need not necessarily be considered serious 
and a serious adverse event need not be considered severe. For example, nausea that persists for several hours 
may be considered severe nausea, but not a serious adverse event. On the other hand, a myocardial infarction 
that may be considered minor could also be a serious adver se event if it prolonged hospitalization, for example.  
8.2 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING PERIOD  
Adverse event data will be collected from the time of enrollment through to the follow -up visit , 7 ± 2 days 
after administration of the last dose.  
8.3 PROCEDURE FOR ADVERS E EVENT REPORTING  
All adverse events (non -serious and serious) spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to 
an open question from the study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded. All adverse events (non -serious and serious) must be recorded on the 
source documents and case report forms provided by the Sponsor.  
8.4 PROCEDURE FOR SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENT REPO RTING TO THE SPONSOR  
8.4.1 Reporting to the Sponsor  
In addition to entering eac h serious adverse event irrespective of causality on the appropriate page of the CRF, 
the Investigator must complete a Serious Adverse Event Report (SAER) for each serious adverse event 
regardless of causality to study drug. The SAER must be faxed to the D rug Safety Officer at AFT 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd (+64 9  488 0234) within 24 hours from the point in time when the SAE is realized. The 
Drug Safety Officer will contact the Investigator should it be necessary to clarify any of the event information. 
The Invest igator should provide any additional follow -up information regarding the event to AFT 
Confidential -Proprietary Information    
 
Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 25 of 37 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd as soon as it becomes available and up to the point the event has been resolved. This 
reporting requirement is applicable to serious adverse events th at occur during the designated study period. If 
the Investigator is notified of a serious event after the study period that he or she determines to be causally 
related to study medication, the event should also be reported through this process.  
8.4.2 Reporting t o Local Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
All adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting shall be compliant to applicable local IRB/IEC requirements. The 
Sponsor shall take the responsibility to continually monitor the safety of its clinical develop ment program and 
advise local ethics committee in a prompt manner if the updated safety information impacts the continued 
ethical acceptability of the trial which indicates the need for a change in the trial protocol or participant 
information statement.  
8.4.3 Reporting to Regulatory Agencies  
8.4.3.1  Fatal or Life -Threatening Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An ADR is considered “fatal or life threatening” if, in the review of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the participants at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or adverse 
drug reaction that, had it occurred  in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Fatal or life -threatening, unexpected ADRs occurring in clinical investigations is subject to expedited 
reporting. Regulatory agencies should be notified (e.g., by telephone, facsimile transmission, or in w riting) as 
soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after first knowledge by the Sponsor that a case qualifies, 
followed by as complete a report as possible within 8 additional calendar days. This report must include an 
assessment of the importan ce and implication of the findings, including relevant previous experience with the 
same or similar medicinal products (CPMP/ICH/377/95).  
8.4.3.2  All Other Serious, Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  
Serious, unexpected ADRs that are not fatal or life -threatening m ust be filed as soon as possible but no later 
than 15 calendar days after first knowledge by the Sponsor that the case meets the minimum criteria for 
expedited reporting (CPMP/ICH/377/95).  
It is recommended to use the CIOMS form, which contains the informa tion as listed in the attachment 1 of 
ICH E2A Clinical Safety Data Management Guideline.

situations in which the protection, safety, and well -being of the participant requires immediate intervention, 
based on the judgment of the Investigator (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional designa ted by 
the Investigator). In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or 
mistake, the Investigator or designee must contact the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s agent, at the earliest possible 
time by telephone. This w ill allow an early joint decision regarding the best way to proceed with the study 
(note the ITT protocol – it is expected that all consenting participants will continue to be followed up for 
adverse events). The Investigator and the Sponsor will document this decision. The Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) will be informed of all protocol changes by the Investigator in accordance 
with the IRB or EC established procedure. No significant planned or deliberate deviations from the proto col 
of any type will be made without the Sponsor’s agreement and complying with all the IRB or EC established 
procedures.  
10 STATISTICAL PLAN  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, single arm, multiple dose study to evaluate the safety of Maxigesic® 
IV. As a single arm  study, the study is descriptive in nature, however  summaries of safety endpoints will be 
generated within specific time intervals and by pre -specified subgroups.  
10.1 SAMPLE SIZE  
In total, 225 participants will be enrolled in this study, with at  least 50 participants exposed to the study drug 
for at least 5 days. The sample size for this safety study is not based on formal statistical power calculations 
but will ensure with 95% probability that any TEAEs present in approximately 2% or more of the  target 
population will be identified in this study.  
10.2 DEFINITIONS  
10.2.1  Patient Population  
The safety analysis will be on all participants who are administered at least one dose of study medication with 
treatment allocation for analysis based on the actual treatm ent the participant received.  
10.2.2  Observational Period  
The observational period is from administration of the first dose of the study drug  to the follow -up visit, 7  ± 2 
days after administration of the last dose.  The t reatment period is from  administration of the first dose of the 
study drug to approximately 6 hours after the last dose , and prior to discharge .  
10.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
10.3.1  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of the study popu lation including age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, indication (type of surgery) , vitals, laboratory values and concomitant medications, will be 
summarized as means, medians, standard deviations, ranges and frequencies and percentages as appropriate.

be included in a list of protocol deviations. The potential effect of such deviations on the resulting clinical 
evaluations will be dis cussed in the study report.  
10.3.3  Exposure  
To evaluate the extent of drug exposure during the trial, tabular summaries of study drug usage (number of 
doses, duration of exposure, mean interval between doses ) will be presented. Early withdrawals for any reason 
will be tabulated.  
10.3.4  Primary Analyses  
The primary endpoint is the incidence of TEAEs associated with exposure to Maxigesic® IV. TEAEs  occurring 
at any timepoint during the treatment period  will be coded to MedDRA System Organ Class Code and 
Preferred Term and tabulated as frequencies and percentages.  
10.3.5  Secondary Analyses  
10.3.5.1  Time Course of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
TEAEs will be tabulated as frequencies and percentages during the following time periods:

- On each day during the t reatment period : 
o Day 1  
o Day 2  
o Day 3  
o Day 4  
o Day 5  
o Day 6+  
- During f ollow -up 
Days will be defined as 24 -hour intervals after the first dose of study drug.  
10.3.5.2  Treatment -Related Adverse Events  
TEAEs considered by the investigator to be  “probably” or “definitely” are treatment -related AEs; TRAEs. 
TRAEs will be summarized in the same manner as TEAEs.  
10.3.5.3  Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events of Interest  
All cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, administration site conditions and bleed ing-related TEAEs 
will be summarized as frequencies and percentages, and the proportion of these that are considered treatment -
related will be tabulated.

Vital sign measurements at each scheduled timepoint will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics.  
10.3.5.5  Changes in Clinical Laboratory Values  
Clinically significant changes  from baseline in laboratory test results will be classified as adverse events and 
included in all analyses of adverse events.  
Clinical laboratory values at each scheduled timepoint will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics. 
Summary shift ta bles will be produced overall and by duration of treatment ( ≤ 48 hours, 48 hours – 4 days, ≥ 
5 days ), of the number of cases with normal baseline laboratory tests changed to abnormal at the end of the 
treatment period , and abnormal baseline laboratory test s worsened at the end of the treatment period , with the 
severity of changes summarized as proportional effects.  
10.3.5.6  Patient’s Global Evaluation of the Study Drug  
The patient’s global evaluation of the study drug will be summarized by the number and percentage  of subjects 
within each category.

- race 
- age (patients aged <65 years, 65 -75 years, >75 years)  
- duration of exposure (dosed for ≤ 48 hours, dosed for 48 hours – 4 days, dosed for ≥ 5 days)  
- indication (type of surgery)  
Subgroup analyses are subject to recruitment of sufficient participants in each  group.  
10.3.7  Other Safety Analyses  
10.3.7.1  Severity and Relationship of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  to the Study Drug  
In addition to the primary and secondary analyses of the incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs occurring at any 
timepoint during the treatment period will be coded to MedDRA System Organ Class Code and Preferred 
Term and tabulated as frequencies and percentages  by severity class and relationship to the study drug . 
10.3.7.2  Concomitant medication  
The use of concomitant medications following study drug administrat ion will be summarized as frequencies 
and percentages within ATC -coded drug groups.

5 days), of the number of cases with normal baseline ECGs  changed to abnormal at 48 hours and /or the end of 
the treatment period , and abnormal baseline ECGs  worsened at 48 hours and /or the end of the treatment period .  
10.4 MISSING DATA  
As the study is focused on safety and tolerability, and is conducted within the trial clinics, it is expected that 
all adverse event data will be collected , even if some partic ipants withdraw from the study medication.  
10.5 PROCEDURE FOR AMENDM ENTS TO STATISTICAL PLAN  
It is intended that all statistical analyses specified in this protocol will be performed. However, it is conceivable 
that some scheduled analyses may not be performed. In addition, study observations or analysis results may 
suggest the need for additional statistical analyses of the collected study data. In either case, deviations 
(subtractions or additions) from the planned statistical analysis will be fully described in the final clinical study 
report.  
10.6 DATA COLLECTION  
The CRF will be used to collect all participant data assessments that will be used for evaluation of specified 
analyses. The CRF should be completed in a timely fashion.  
11 RECORDS RETENTION  
As thi s study will be conducted under International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP guidelines, these 
guidelines require all investigators participating in clinical drug trials to maintain detailed clinical data for one 
of the following periods:  
- A period o f at least 2 years following the date after the last approval of a marketing application in an 
ICH region and until there are not any pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region.  
- A period of at least 2 years after the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product.  
Should countries participating in this study have other guidelines for record retention, the period of record 
retention should follow the strictest guidelines, for example, New Zealand  guidelines require documents to be 
retained for 10 years and Australian guidelines for 15 years.  
It is agreed that the Investigator and the Sponsor will share in the responsibility to maintain these records. Each 
will maintain a complete set. Neither the Investigator no r the Sponsor will dispose of any records relevant to 
this study without either written permission from the other and from the relevant authorities. The Investigator 
and Sponsor shall both be responsible for maintaining adequate and accurate  hard copy source documents of 
all observations and data generated during this study, including any data clarification forms (DCFs) received 
from the Sponsor. Such documentation is subject to inspection by the Sponsor or its agents, and/or regulatory 
agenc ies. The Investigator may work with the Sponsor to ensure that archiving facilities are provided during 
the archiving period.

APPENDIX 2: ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS OF TH E INVESTIGATIONAL PR ODUCT  
 
Known adverse drug reactions of acetaminophen alone:  
Impaired liver function or a history of liver disease:  
Acetaminophen should be administered with caution to participants with impaired hepatic function because of 
the possibility of delayed elimination or increased serum concentrations.  
 
Impaired Renal Function : 
Acetaminophen should be administered with cautio n to participants with impaired renal function because of 
the possibility of delayed elimination or increased serum concentrations.  
 
Known adverse drug reactions of Ibuprofen alone:  
Asthma:  
Caution is required if ibuprofen is administered to participants suffering from, or with a previous history of, 
bronchial asthma since ibuprofen has been reported to cause bronchospasm in such participants.  
 
Ophthalmological Monitoring:  
Adverse ophthalmological effects have been observed with NSAIDs; accord ingly, participants who develop 
visual disturbances during treatment with ibuprofen should have an ophthalmological examination.  
 
Impaired Liver Function or a History of Liver Disease:  
Participants with impaired liver function or a history of liver disease  who are on long term ibuprofen therapy 
should have hepatic function monitored at regular intervals. Ibuprofen has been reported to have a minor and 
transient effect on liver enzymes.  
Severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and cases of fatal hepatiti s, though rare, have been reported with 
ibuprofen as with other NSAIDs. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, etc.),  
ibuprofen should be discontinued.  
 
Impaired Renal Function:  
Caution should be used when initiating treatment with ibuprofen in participants with considerable dehydration.  
The two major metabolites of ibuprofen are excreted mainly in the urine and impairm ent of renal function may 
result in their accumulation. The significance of this is unknown. NSAIDs have been reported to cause 
nephrotoxicity in various forms; interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. In participants with 
renal, cardi ac or hepatic impairment, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors and the elderly, caution is 
required since the use of NSAIDs may result in deterioration of renal function. The dose should be kept as low 
as possible and renal function should be monitore d in these participants.  
 
Cardiovascular Effects:  
Fluid retention and edema have been reported in association with ibuprofen, therefore, the drug should be used 
with caution in participants with a history of heart failure or hypertension.  
 
Aseptic Meningitis:  
Aseptic meningitis has been reported only rarely, usually but not always in participants with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) or other connective tissue disorders.  
 
Hematological Monitoring:  
Blood dyscrasias have been rarely reported. Partic ipants on long -term therapy with ibuprofen should have 
regular hematological monitoring.  
 
Coagulation Defects:  
Like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen can inhibit platelet aggregation. Ibuprofen has been shown to prolong bleeding 
time (but within the normal range), i n normal participants. Because this prolonged bleeding effect may be 
Confidential -Proprietary Information    
 
Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 36 of 37 
exaggerated in participants with underlying hemostatic defects, ibuprofen should be used with caution in 
persons with intrinsic coagulation defects and those on anti -coagulation therapy.  
 
Masking Signs of Infection:  
As with other drugs of the NSAID class, ibuprofen may mask the usual signs of infection.  
 
Special Precautions:  
In order to avoid exacerbation of disease or adrenal insufficiency, participants who have been on prolonged 
corticos teroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly rather than discontinued abruptly when 
ibuprofen is added to the treatment program.

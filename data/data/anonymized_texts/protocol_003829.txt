Title of Study:  
A Phase III Randomised, Double -masked , Parallel Group, Multicentre  Study to Compare the Efficacy, 
Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity between SB11 (proposed ranibizumab biosimilar) and 
Lucentis® in Subject s with Neovascular Age-related M acular Degeneration  
Protocol No:  SB11 -G31-AMD  Phase:  III 
Indication:  Neovascular Age-related M acular Degeneration  (AMD)  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
• To demonstrate the equivalence of efficacy of SB11 to Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular 
age-related macular degeneration  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the safety of SB11 and Lucentis® 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of SB11 and Lucentis® 
• To evaluate the systemic exposure of SB11 and Lucentis® in subjects participating in 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) evaluation   
Study Design:  
This is a randomised, double -masked , parallel group, multicentre  study to evaluate the efficacy , safety , 
pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of SB 11 compared to Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular  
AMD . Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB11 or Lucentis® (administered via 
intravitreal ( ITV) 0.5 mg every 4 weeks ). Investigational P roducts  (IP) (SB11 or Lucentis®) will be 
admin istered up to Week 48, and the last assessment will be done at Week 52.  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately a total of 704 subjects are planned to be randomised into this study.  
Target Population:  Subjects with neovascular AMD  
Eligibility Criteria:  
Only one eye will be designated as the study eye. For subjects who meet eligibility criteria in both eyes, 
the eye with the worse Visual A cuity ( VA) will be selected as the study eye. If both eye s have equal 
VA, the eye with better visual prognosis  (e.g., clear er lens and ocular media and l ess amount  of 
subfoveal scar or geographic atrophy ) will be selected  at the Investigator’s discretion . If there is no 
objective basis for selecting the study eye, factor such as ocular dominance, other ocular pathology and subject preference should be considered by the Investigator in making the selection.

Statistical Methods  
Efficacy analysis  
For US FDA , Korea  MFDS or o ther regulatory agency submissions for those who are in favour of the 
VA, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the Full A nalysis  Set (FAS) with the change 
from baseline of BCVA at Week 8  using an analysis of covariance model  with the baselin e BCVA as a 
covariate and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as factors . The FAS will consist of all 
randomised subjects. The subjects will be analysed based on the treatment they were randomised to by 
intention -to-treat principle. However, sub jects who do not qualify for randomisation and are 
inadvertently randomised into the study will be excluded from the FAS, provided these subjects do not 
receive any IP during the study period. The e quivalence  in BCVA  will be declared if the two -sided 90 % 
Confidence Interval (CI) of the difference of BCVA  Least Squares mean (LS mean) change s from 
baseline at Week 8  between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within the pre -defined equivalence margin of [−3 
letters, 3 letters ].

parameter, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the per -protocol set (PPS -CST)  with the 
change from baseline of CST at Week 4 using an analysis of covariance model with baseline CST as a 
covariate  and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as factors . The PPS -CST consists of all 
FAS subjects who have the first  IP injection at Week 0  (Day 1)  and complete procedures at Week 4  
without any major protocol deviations that have impact on the  CST assessment. The equivalence in 
CST will be declared if the two -sided 95% CI of the difference of CST LS mean change s from baseline 
at Week 4 between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within the pre -defined equivalence margin  of [−36 μm, 36 
μm]. 
There is no form al adjustment of type I error rates.  
For the primary analysis with the FAS for BCVA, missing data will be imputed for subjects who drop 
out for the study prior to the primary analysis time -point. A missing -at-random approach will assume 
that subjects who withdraw from a study had missing values similar to similar subjects who completed 
the study in that treatment group. This approach ensures that evidence of lack of equivalence is not diluted when there are missing data. For the components of BCVA, the missing letter will be imputed by multiple imputation method with the assumption of monotone missing pattern and regression method. For the sensitivity analyses, available case analysis and last observation carried forward 
analysis will be performed. All othe r efficacy measurements will be summarised descriptively by 
treatment group and visit.  
Safety analyses  
All reported terms for AEs (ocular or systemic) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). AEs  including ocular AEs in the study eye and/or fellow eye as 
well as systemic AEs  will be summarised descriptively by treatment group.  
Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters  will be summarised descriptively by treatment 
group and visit. All other safety varia bles will be summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit 
unless specified otherwise, and all safety variables will be listed.  
Pharmacokinetic analyses  
Blood sampling for PK  will be collected in approximately 40 subjects participating in PK evalua tion 
(20 subjects per treatment group). Formal PK analysis will not be performed. The systemic exposure 
will be summarised descriptively by treatment group  and visit.   
Immunogenicity analyses  
The number and proportion  of subjects with ADA and NAb results ( e.g., “positive” or “negative”) will 
be summarised by treatment group and visit.

Subscale scores (general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision -
specific social functioning, vision -specific men tal health, vision -specific role difficulties, vision -
specific dependency, driving, colo ur vision, and peripheral vision) and the composite score, which 
represent overall visual function, will be  calculated, and the change from baseline will be  summarised 
by treatment group and visit.  
Sample size calculation  
For the calculation of the equivalence margin  for BCVA , the mean change s in VA were referred from 
two studies of Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, the mean change of 
VA at Week 24  (Standard D eviation  [SD]) were − 6.6 (13.31) letters and 6.5 (12.00) letters for placebo 
and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups, respectively. In FOCUS study, the mean change (SD) of VA at 
Week 24 were −5.0 (16.14) letters and 4.0 (14.41) letters for pl acebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment 
groups , respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta -analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in VA of 12.41 
letters with a 95% CI [10.34  letters , 14.48  letters ]. The derived equivalence limit from meta -analysis is 
4.9 letters at Week 24, but by the agency recommendation the equivalence limit at Week 8 will be 3 
letters for the comparison with the 90% CI of mean difference between treatment groups.  
With the given equivalence margin of [−3 letters, 3 letters], 334 subjects  per treatment group  was 
calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0.5 letters and pooled SD of 12.5 letters at the 
overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 5% loss from randomi sed subjects  after 8 weeks , a sample 
size of 352 subjects  per treatment group  (overall sample size of 704) will give 334 completers per 
treatment group  after 8 weeks , which is estimated to give 80% power to detect the equivalence of 
change from baseline in BCVA  within the margin of  3 letters.  
For the calculation of the equivalence margin for CST, the mean changes in CST were referred from two studies of Lucentis
® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, the mean change of 
CST at Week 4 (SD) was 8.1 (58.1)  μm and −106 (122.5) μm for placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® 
treatment groups, respectively. In PIER study, the mean change (SD) of CST at Week 4 were 15 (94.9) μm and −90 (140.9) μm for placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis
® treatment groups, respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta -analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in CST of 
109.6 μm with a 95% CI [ −146.45 μm; −72.65 μm]. The derived equivalence limit from meta- analysis 
is 36 μm at Week 4.  
With the given equivalence margin of [ −36 μm, 36 μm], 290 subjects per treatment group was 
calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0 between treatment groups, common SD of 
133.3 μm at the overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 10% loss from FAS, a sample size of 323 per 
arm (overall sample size of 646) will give 80% power to detect the equivalence within the pre- defined 
margin.

Therefore, the sample size of 704 allows enough power to detect the equivalence between treatment

2. Demographic data includes the date of birth  (or year of birth), gender, race and ethnicity.  
3. Physical examination will be performed at Screening and Week 52 ( EOS visit) or ET visit. The physical examination will include  an assessment of the subject’s general 
appearance, skin, head, neck, throat, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, neurological, thyroid, musculoskeletal/extremities , respiratory systems and the subject’s abdomen. 
Body weight will be measured and recorded at Screening and Week 52 ( EOS  visit)  or ET visit , but height will be measured and recorded only at Screening . 
4. All subjects ’ eligibility should be  confirmed by the central reading  centre  and Investigator .  
5. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse rate and body temperature. Vital signs will be assessed at Screening and prior to ITV i njection of IP at each visit until Week 48. 
Vital signs will also be assessed at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
6. Visual acuity will be assessed in both the study eye and fellow  (non-study)  eye at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP  at each visit until Week 48. Visual acuity 
will also be assessed at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  Subject must use either original series ETDRS chart s or 2702 series Number chart s 
(at a starting distance of 4 me ters) consistently from Screening to Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Visual acuity  testing must be performed before dilation of pupils  and 
FP/FA  and OCT assessment . A decrease in visual acuity of ≥ 15 letters from the last assessment of VA should be reported as AEs/ Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) as 
appropriate. If there is a decrease in VA of ≥ 30 letters from the last assessment of VA or if there is a decrease in VA to the level of Light Perception  or worse , it should 
be reported as SAE.  
7. Investigator must  confirm that the subject can read  between 34 letters to  73 letters  using original series ETDRS chart s or 2702 series Number chart s at Week 0 (Day1)  
prior to randomi sation   
8. Visit at Week 8 is the most critical as the visit is for the primary endpoint assessment for US FDA , Korea MFDS or other regulatory agency submissions for those who 
are in favour of the VA. Thus, every effort should be made to adhere to the visit schedule for the subjects.  
9. OCT  will be performed on the study eye  at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP at each visit  until Week 48 .  OCT will also be performed at any time during the 
visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Site staffs who will perform OCT scans in this study must be certified by the central reading centre before study starts.  OCT 
devices registered in an Investigational site should be all from the same manufacture and meet the minimum software requirement, The subject  should use the OCT 
device registered by the central reading centre from Screening to Week 52 (EOS visit)  or ET visit. OCT images will be sent to the central reading centre . 
10. Visit at Week 4 is the most critical as the visit is for the primary endpoint  assessment for EMA  or other regulatory agency subm ission s for those who are in favour of the 
anatomical parameter . Thus, every effort should be made to adhere to the visit schedule for the subjects.  
11. FP/FA  will be performed on the both eyes at Screening  and those images taken from the both eyes will be sen t to the central reading centre. FP/FA will also be 
performed on the study eye  prior to ITV injection of IP at Week 24  and at any time during the visit at  Week 52  (EOS visit) or ET visit. Those images taken from the 
study eye will be sent to the central re ading centre. Site staffs who will perform FA/FP in this study must be certified by the central reading centre before study starts. 
Only FP/FA  device certified by central reading centre is allowed to be used in this study. If one or more FP/FA  devices are certified in a n Investigational  site, a subject 
must use  the same FP/FA  device consistently from Screening to Week 52  (EOS visit)  or ET visit. If any significant change in the posterior pole (i.e. , subretinal 
haemorrhage, macular hole, vitreous ha emorrhage  or opacity, retinal detachment, etc. ) is detected with fundus examination, additional FP and/or FA can be performed at 
the Investigat or’s discretion , but the images will not be sent to the central reading centre.

Page 15 of 137 12. Indirect ophthalmoscopy using a standard w ay (i.e., usually using a head -mounted light source and a 20- 30 lens) will be performed on  the study eye at Screening and  
prior to ITV injection o f IP and within 15 minutes after ITV injection of IP  at each visit  until Week 48. Indirect ophthalmoscopy will  also be performed  at any time 
during the visit at  Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit . 
13. Slit lamp examination will be performed in both the study eye and fellow eye  (non- study eye)  at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP  at each visit until Week 48. 
Slit lamp examination will also be performed at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
14. Intraocular Pressure ( IOP) will be measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry. The same method of IOP measurement must be used in each subject from 
Screening to Week 52 (EOS visit)  or ET visit . IOP will be measured on  the study eye at Screening and  prior to ITV injection of IP and 30- 60 minutes after ITV injection 
of IP at each visit until Week 48. When IOP is measured prior to ITV injection of IP, IOP should be measured after OCT and FP/FA are completed  to avoid corneal 
erosion . IOP will also be measured at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
15. NEI VFQ- 25 should be performed at Week 0 (Day1) after randomisation. Then,  NEI VF Q-25 should be performed  before  dilation of pupil at Week 0 (Day 1), Week 24  
and Week 52  (EOS visit) or ET visit. 
16. Blood and urine sampling for clinical laboratory test will be collected at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP  at Week 12, Week 24, and  Week 36 . Blood and urine 
sampling for clinical laboratory test will also be collected at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Urine samples must be collected  before 
performing FA to avoid false elevations in urine protein values . 
• Haematology: haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, white blood cell count (total and differential)  
• Chemistry: sodium, potassium, creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate am inotransferas e, alkaline 
phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase  
• Urinalysis  (dipstick) :  protein, blood, leucocytes, nitrite, glucose, ketone, pH, specific gravity, bilirubin, urobilinogen  
Blood samples will be analysed in central laboratory and urine samples will be tested in each Investigational site by using a dipstick which will be provided by Sponsor.  
17. Blood sampling for immunogenicity will be collected  prior to ITV injection of IP at Week 0  (Day 1) , Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, and Week 36 . Blood 
sampling for imm unogenicity will  also be collected at any time during the visit at Week 1 and Week 52 (EOS visit)  or ET visit. 
18. Blood sampling for PK will be collected in  approximately 40 subjects participating in PK evaluation  (20 subjects  per treatment group). Blood samp ling for PK will 
be collected  prior to ITV injection of IP (C trough) and 24-72 hours after ITV injection  of IP (close to C max) on Week 0  (Day 1) , Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, and 
Week 36 . Blood samples for PK will also be collected at any time during the visit at Week 1 and Week 52 (EOS visit).  
19. For women  of childbearing potential , serum pregnancy test must be performed at Screening . The serum samples taken  at Screening will be analysed in central 
laboratory. Additional serum or urine pregnancy test can be performed in each Investigational site  during the study period , if necessary.  
20. Subjects will be administered SB11 or Lucentis® 0.5 mg via ITV into the study eye every 4 weeks up to Week 48. Dosing visits will be allowed within ± 7 days of the 
scheduled  dosing visit date  (except Week 0 (Day 1), visit window not allowed) . If a dose of IP is not given within 7 days of the scheduled dosing visit date, the IP should 
be given within 20 days of the scheduled dosing visit date, but the case will be captured as protocol deviation. Dosing skip is defined when a subject does not receive the 
IP within 20 days after scheduled dosing visit  date. Next scheduled dosing visit date and visit window should not be altered even though previous dosing is not 
performed on the exact scheduled dosing visit date (but, the interval between two doses injected into the study eye should be at least 14 days ) or previous dosing is 
skipped.

with a proper reason .  
22. Ocular AEs  in the study eye and/or fellow eye  as well as systemic  AEs will be recorded after the written informed consent is obtained from the subject  until Week 5 2 
(EOS visit ) or ET visit. 
23. Any medications including prescription drug, non -prescription drugs  or any therapy (except dietary supplements vitamins , minerals ) received locally (in the study eye 
and/or fellow eye) or systemically within 180 days prior to Scr eening until Week 52 (EOS visit)  or ET visit will be recorded . 
24. End of Treatment (EOT) v isit is defined as the visit for the last ITV injection of SB11 or Lucentis® during the study period after randomisation . The Sponsor will not 
provide IP (SB11 or Lucent is®) to subjects after they complete the EOT visit. 
25. End of Study (EOS) visit or Early Termination (ET) visit is defined as 4 weeks (± 7 days) after the last ITV injection of SB11 or Lucentis®.

1.1. Backg round  
Age-related  Macular  Degeneration  (AMD) , left untreated, is a leading cause of adult blindness 
in the developed world. Most of severe visual loss of AMD occurs from Choroidal 
Neovascularisation ( CNV) or the neovascular form of AMD. Choroidal neovascul arisation  
can be associated with fibrous replacement of the  retinal photoreceptors and Retinal Pigment 
Epithelium (RPE), as well as atrophy of these portions of the retina in the macula, leading to 
severe visual decline with loss of reading vision, driving vision, and the ability to recognise 
faces. Vascular Endothelial Growth F actor  (VEGF) , a protein growth factor that both 
stimulates angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability, is a major pathogenic factor in 
CNV due to AMD. Counteracting these effec ts of VEGF  can provide significant therapeutic 
benefit to subjects suffering from this disorder. 
In developed countries, AMD is a leading cause of severe visual loss in people 65 years of age 
and older in the US, an estimated 6% of individuals aged 65 to 74, and 20% of those older than 75 are affected with some stage of AMD. Also, among white people aged 40 years and older, AMD is the number one cause of visual impairment and blindness in the US. The pathogenesis of AMD is poorly understood. It is character ised by development of focal 
deposits of long –spacing collagen and phospholipid vesicles within and beneath the basement membrane of the RPE, called “drusen” which can be accompanied by gradual degeneration of photoreceptors and RPE (atrophy), which often results in slow deterioration of central Visual 
Acuity  (VA) . This thickening and degeneration of Bruch’s membrane can predispose to 
abnormal growth of blood vessels from the choriocapillaris, termed choroidal neovascularization. The occurrence of CNV hera lds the onset of neovascular AMD. Leakage 
from the CNV can cause macular oedema with collection of fluid and blood beneath and within the macula, resulting in loss of vision. Growth of the lesions with accompanying fibrovascular or fibroglial tissue furthe r destroys retinal tissue. Overtime, the CNV promotes 
scarring that damages photoreceptors and the RPE, resulting in permanent vision loss. Neovascular or “wet” AMD accounts for only 10% of cases of AMD yet results in 90% of the severe vision loss. Epidemi ological studies suggest that “wet” AMD will develop in almost 1 
million persons in the US within the next 5 years [ Wu EW  et al., 2014, Macular 
Photocoagulation Study Group. 1991 ]. 
1.2. Lucent is
®: Ranibizumab Reference Product 
Lucentis® is approved for indications including neovascular (wet) AMD, visual impairment 
due to D iabetic Macular Oedema (DME) and visual impairment due to macular oedema 
secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO) by both the US FDA and 
EMA. In addition, the FDA approved Lucentis® for the treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy 
(DR) in subjects with DME and the EMA approved Lucentis® for the treatment of visual

Information. 2016, Lucentis® Summary of Product Characteristics. 2016 ] 
Mechanism of Action  
Ranibizumab binds to the receptor bindi ng site of active forms of VEGF -A, including the 
biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110. VEGF -A has been shown to 
cause neovascularisation  and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion 
and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, macular oedema 
following RVO, DR and DME. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF- A prevents the 
interaction of VEGF -A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of 
endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation  [Lucentis® Summary of Product Characteristics. 2016 ]. 
Pharmacodynamics  
Increased retinal thickness (i.e., Centre  Point Thickness [CPT]  or C entral Foveal Thickness 
[CFT]), as assessed by OCT is associated with the activity of  neovascular AMD, macular 
oedema following RVO, and DME. Leakage from CNV  as assessed by FA is also associated 
with the activity of neovascular AMD . 
Microvascular retinal changes  and 
neovascularisation , as assessed by colo ur FP, are associated with diabetic retinopathy 
[Lucentis® Prescribing Information. 2016].  
Pharmacokinetics  
Following monthly ITV administration of Lucentis® to pat ients with neovascular AMD, serum 
concentrations of ranibizumab were generally low, with maximum levels (C max) generally 
below the ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 
50% (11- 27 ng/ml, as assessed in an in vitr o cellular proliferation assay). C max was dose 
proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 1.0 mg/eye. Serum concentrations in a limited 
number of DME patients indicate that a slightly higher systemic exposure cannot be excluded compared to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. Serum ranibizumab concentrations 
in RVO patients were similar or slightly higher compared to those observed in neovascular 
AMD patients. 
Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics and disappearance of ranibizumab from 
serum for patients with neovascular AMD treated with the 0.5 mg dose, the average vitreous elimination half -life of ranibizumab is approximately 9 days. Upon monthly ITV 
administration of Lucentis
® 0.5 mg/eye, serum ranibizumab C max, attained approximately 1 
day after dosing, is predicted to generally range between 0.79 and 2.90 ng/ml. Serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold lower than vitreal ranibizumab concentrations [ Lucent is® Summary of Product Characteristics. 2016 ].

1.3. SB11 : Proposed Ranibizumab Biosimilar  
Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd . (Incheon, Republic of Korea) has developed SB11, a proposed 
biosimilar of the  ranibizumab reference product. SB11 is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in Escherichia coli cells. Extensive characterisation studies including intact mass, 
N- and C-terminal sequencing, peptide mapping, icIEF, CE-SDS (reduced, non-reduced), SE-
HPLC , amino acid composition, disulfide bond, VEGF binding, VEGF neutralisation , and 
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells ( HUVEC ) anti-proliferation were  performed using 
state-of-the- art techniques. Assays such as CEX -HPLC, UV absorption spectra, free thiol 
group quantification, SEC- MALS, SV -AUC, CD, DSC and FT -IR were  performed for both 
non-clinical and clinical materials.  
After extensive quality similarity studies, a series of in vitro non-clinical studies including 
VEGF binding assay and cell- based assays (HUVEC anti -proliferation assay and VEGF 
neutralizing assay)  were  performed to demonstrate similarity in in vivo  behavio ur between 
SB11 and Lucentis®.  
1.4. Rationale for the Study  
A biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that is highly similar to an alre ady authorised 
original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal product) in terms of quality, 
tolerability, and efficacy based on a comprehensive comparability exercise 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, EMEA/CHMP/437/04 , U. S. Food and Drug 
Administration . 2015] . The EMA  and the US FDA have developed specific guidelines for a 
biologic drug to be approved as a biosimilar [ EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, U. S. Food 
and Drug Administration. 2015, EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012] . These guidelines 
recommend a stepwise approach in develop ing a biosimilar starting with extensive 
physicochemical and biological characterisation before initiating clinical studies for the 
comparison of the efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties, and immunogenicity of the biosimilar.  The purpose of t his study is to demonstrate the equivalence of efficacy of SB11

Page 31 of 137 to Lucentis® and to evaluate the safety  and immunogenicity in subjects with neovascular 
AMD. In addition, systemic exposure of SB11 to Lucentis® will also be evaluated  in subjects 
participatin g in PK evaluation. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1. Primary Objective  
• To demonstrate the equivalence of efficacy of SB11 to Lucentis® in subjects with 
neovascular AMD  
2.2. Secondary Objective  
• To evaluate the safety of SB11 and Lucentis® 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of  SB11 and Lucentis® 
•       To evaluate the systemic exposure of SB11 and Lucentis® in subjects participating  in 
PK evaluation  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Overview of Study Design 
This is a randomised, double -masked , parallel group, multi centre study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of SB11 compared to Lucentis® in 
subjects with neovascular AMD. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
SB11 or Lucentis® 0.5 mg via ITV into the study eye every 4 weeks.  
The screening  period is 21 days . IP (SB11 or Lucentis®) will be given  until 48 weeks and the 
last assessment will be done at Week 52.  
3.2. Rationale for  the Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of clinical efficacy of Lucentis® 
and SB11 i n subjects  with neovascular AMD.  
Although a Phase I comparative PK study comparing the proposed biosimilar product to reference product is a fundamental component in supporting a demonstration of biosimilarity 
[U. S. Fo od and Drug Administration. 2015 ], a Phase I comparative PK study has not been 
necessary to support a demonstration of biosimilarity due to negligible systemic exposure 
following ITV injection of ranibizumab. However, for supporting the assessment of over all 
systemic safety of SB11 relative to Lucentis
®, systemic exposures will be collected and 
compared in the subgroup population (approximately 40 subjects, 20 subjects per treatment 
group) in Phase III comparative efficacy study.

Page 32 of 137 Lucentis® is approved for indications including neovascular AMD, visual impairment due to 
DME and visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO by both the US FDA 
and EMA. In addition, the US FDA approved Lucentis® for the treatment of DR in subjects 
with DME and the EM A approved Lucentis® for the treatment of visual impairment due to 
CNV secondary to PM, respectively.  
Improvements of VA have been reported in the pivotal studies of the various indications. For 
example, at Month 12, the average benefit associated with Lucentis® over that of sham 
injection or PDT was approximately 13.1 to 20.8 letters, 5.9 or 11.7 letters and 6.2 or 6.6 
letters in subjects with AMD, DME and RVO, respectively . The overall difference in Best 
Corrected Visual Acuity (BC VA) between Lucentis® treated and control group was the largest 
in subjects with AMD, which indicates that neovascular AMD is the most sensitive indication 
compared to DME  or RVO to show a difference between the treatments [ Lee H , 2014].  In 
addition, neovascular AMD has homogeneous disease progress with fewer compounding 
factors than DME or RVO. For instance, it results in severe visual impairment with an average 
loss of around 4 lines of VA within 2 years of disease onset [ Chakravarthy U  et al. 2010]. 
Although this neovascular form accounts for only approximately 10% to 20% of the AMD cases, it is responsible for 80% to 90% of AMD -associated vision loss [Ferris FL 3rd  et al. 
1984] . Therefore, Subjects with neovascular AMD are the most appropriate target population 
to evaluate the product- related difference between Lucentis
® and SB11 in this study. 
This study has two different endpoints, depending on regulato ry agency’s requirements for 
assessing equivalence in efficacy between SB11 and Lucentis®. 
For US FDA, Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ( MFDS ) or other regulatory agency 
submissions for those who are in favour of the VA, the primary endpoint is the m ean change 
from baseline in BCVA at Week 8. In the pivotal studies for Lucentis®, the proportion of 
subjects losing < 15 letters was used as primary endpoint to compare the efficacy between Lucentis
® treatment group and control group. The endpoi nt indicate s the preventive effect of 
the loss of VA, but it includes variability in individual disease progression as well as drug -
induced effect. For example, approximately 90% of the subjects who received Lucentis® lost 
VA less than 15 letters but 60% of the subje cts who received sham injection (or 
PDT/verteporfin) also lost VA less than 15 letters. Thus, the proportion of subjects losing < 15 letters could not be a sensitive primary endpoint to detect product- related effect between a 
proposed biosimilar product and reference product. On the other hand, change from baseline in VA, gain of letters, can reflect any change (improvement or deterioration) in the disease status , thus  is more sensitive in detecting a difference between the two treatments. To increase 
sensi tivity, evaluation of equivalence will be  conducted at Week 8  before the efficacy plateau 
is reached , as requested by US FDA.  
For EMA  or other regulatory agency submission for those who are in favour of the anatomical 
parameter, the primary objective is t o demonstrate the equivalence of SB11 to Lucentis
®, in 
terms of the mean change from baseline in CST at Week 4. The evaluation of CST is 
important as it addresses the pharmacodynamics aspects of ranibizumab. Ranibizumab binds

Page 33 of 137 with high affinity to all acti ve VEGF -A isoforms (e.g. , VEGF110, VEGF121 and VEGF165) 
on the surface of endothelial cells, thereby preventing binding of VEGF- A to its receptors and 
reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation 
which result in  reduction of CST [Lucentis® Prescribing Information 2016, Lucentis® 
Summary of Product Characteristics . 2016]. It indicates that the reduction of CST represents a 
direct effect of ranibizumab based on the M echanism of Action (MoA). Furthermore, it has 
been reported that CST measurements and clinical outcome has a correlation. In OCT -guided, 
variable-dosing study conducted in neovascular AMD subjects, a statisticall y significant 
correlation between the decrease in CST at one month and the subsequent improvement in VA  
seen at two months and three months [ Fung A  et al. 2007] . Similarly in PrONTO study, the 
results indicated that t he initial OCT response is predictor of future VA improvements 
although the strength of the correlation is affected by the fluctuations in macular fluid and the fact that OCT changes are detected before VA is affected. In addition, visual recovery after 
resolution of macular fluid in neovascular AMD likely depends on many variables including 
chronicity of disease, viability of photoreceptors and the RPE, progression of the underlying 
dry AMD (geographic atrophy), as well as the presence of epiretinal membranes, RPE tears, and fibrosis. Despite all these variables, the initial response to ranibizumab characterised by 
resolution of fluid in the macula as assessed by OCT seems to correlate with future VA improvement and may serve as a useful predictor of treatment efficacy  [Lalwani G  et al. 2009 ].   
The study design was consulted and agreed with both EMA and FDA prior to start of this study. 
4. STUDY POPULATION  
Eligibility for participation in this study will be based on the  inclusion/exclusion criteria. Only 
one eye will be designated as the study eye. For subjects who meet eligibility criteria in both 
eyes, the eye with the worse VA will be selected as the study eye. If both eyes have equal VA, the eye with better visual pr ognosis (e.g., clearer lens and ocular media and less amount of 
subfoveal scar or geographic atrophy) will be selected at the Investigator’s discretion . If there 
is no objective basis for selecting the study eye, factor such as ocular dominance, other ocul ar 
pathology and subject preference should be considered by the Investigator in making the 
selection.

reason  
- If the main reaso n for  consent withdrawal is considered  related to the study, the 
Investigator may select appropriate reason among the reasons listed below other 
than consent withdrawa l 
• Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  or full -thickness macular hole in the study eye 
• Any n ewly developed or aggravated ophthalmic abnormality other than AMD in the 
study eye which could interfere with evaluation of efficacy or safety of IP including 
but not limited to retinal vascular abnormality 
• Any AEs in the study eye (e.g., intraocular inflammation, VA  loss, increased IOP , 
subretinal haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, local or systemic infection etc.) 
which in the opinion of the Investigator and/or subject would require IP discontinuation 
• Intraocular surgery in the study eye (e.g. , cataract operation, vitrectomy, glaucoma 
surgery, etc.) which in the opinion of the Investigator would require IP discontinuation 
• Protocol deviations which  may adversely affect the subject’s safety and/or integrity of 
data as agreed by the Investigator and/or upon request from the Sponsor 
• IP non- compliance  
- A subject  misses any of first two doses (ITV injection of IP at Week 0 (Day 1) 
and Week 4) after randomisation 
- A subject misses two consecutive doses during the study period after 
randomisation

neovascular AMD in the study  eye 
• Decision by the Sponsor that IP  discontinuation is in the subject’s best med ical 
interest or administrative decision for a reason (e.g., a suspicion of fraud, the subject 
enrolling in multiple clinical studies, lack of compliance, etc.) other than that of an AE 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Unmasking (except unmasking for the purpose of regulatory reporting)

Page 39 of 137 • Pregnancy  
• Death of any cause  
Any significant change in the posterior pole (e.g., subretinal haemorrhage, macular hole, 
vitreous haemorrhage or opacity, retinal detachment, etc.) that is detected with fundus 
examination should be confirmed and documented with FP and/or FA. Investigator should 
decide IP discontinuation based on the FP and/or FA.  The images taken at unscheduled visits 
will not be sent to the central reading centre.  
If a subject is prematurely discontinued from IP due to any of the above described reasons 
excluding death, the subject will complete the ET procedures (except for PK sampling) after 4 weeks from the last ITV injection of IP and will be asked to provide continued follow-up and further data collection subsequent to hi s or her ET visit.  
If a subject agrees to continue follow -up for associated clinical outcome information  until 
Week 52 irrespective of IP injection status  (as long as an  additional ICF e.g., withdrawal form 
is signed by the subject for this limited participation in the study), the subject’s clinical 
outcome information such as BCVA, CST, AE and concomitant medication will be collected  
through non- invasive chart review , if available. 
If a subject does not agree to continue follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, 
the subject will be terminated from the study accordingly. The data and blood samples 
collected on the subject up to ET visit remains in the study database and no further data will be collected.  
In all cases, the reason for IP discontinuation must be recorded in the electronic Case Report 
Form ( eCRF ) and in the subject’s medical record. 
4.4. Replacement  
Subjects who are discontinued  from IP after randomisation will not be replaced.  
5. TREATMENT AND INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
5.1. Treatment of the Subjects 
5.1.1.  Dosing and Treatment Schedule  
Subjects will be administer ed SB11 or Lucentis® 0.5 mg via ITV into the study eye every 4 
weeks up to Week 48 (a total of 13 administrations of IP) unless they are early discontinued 
from IP.  
IP injection will be performed by the Investigator according to delegation of study personnel 
for this study .

Samsung Bioepis – Confidential  
Page 40 of 137 Dosing visits will be allowed within  ± 7 days  of the scheduled dosing visit date (except Week 
0 (Day 1) , visit window not allowed) . If a dose of IP is not given within 7 days of the 
scheduled dosing visit date, the IP  should be given within 20 days of the scheduled dosing 
visit date,  but the case will be captured as protocol deviation. Dosing skip is defined when a 
subject does not receive the IP within 20 days after scheduled dosing visit date.  
Next s cheduled dosing visit  date and visit window should not be altered even though previous 
dosing is not performed on the exact scheduled dosing visit d ate (but, the interval between two 
doses injected into the study eye should be at least 14 days) or previous dosing is skipped.  
5.1.2.  Withholding Investigational Products  
If a subject  experiences an AE in the study eye  and the subject’s safety or well -being could be 
compromised by ITV injection of IP at  the Investigator’s discretion , IPs should be withheld 
until the event has resolved . Such events in the study eye include, but are not limited to:  
• A decrease in BCVA  of ≥30 letters compared with the last assessment of VA;  
• An IOP of ≥30 mmHg;  
• A retinal break;  
Any significant change in the posterior pole (e.g., subretinal haemorrhage, macular hole, 
vitreous haemorrhage or opacity, retinal detachment, etc.) that is detected with fundus 
examination should be confirmed and documented with FP and/or FA. Investigator should 
decide IP withholding based on the FP and/or FA. The images taken at unscheduled visits will 
not be sent to the central reading centre.  
NOTE: If a subject misses any of first t wo dose s or two consecutive doses during the study 
period after randomisation, the subject must be discontinued from IPs according to Section 4.3 .

Using aseptic technique, all of the SB11 and Lucentis® vial contents are withdrawn through a 
blunt filter needle attached to a 1 -cc syringe. The filter needle should be discarded after 
withdrawal of the vial contents and should not be used for ITV injection. The filter needle 
should be replaced with a sterile 30 -gauge x 1/2-inch needle for the ITV injection  of IP . The 
contents should be expelled until the plunger tip is aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL 
on the syringe.  
The ITV injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions in 
accordance with local practice.  
Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye.  
5.3. Prohibited  Medication or Therapy   
Prohibited medication and therapy during the study period are presented in Table 8. 
Any other medications that are considered necessary for the subject’s welfare, and that are not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the IP may be given at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Details of a ny medications including both pr escription , non-prescription drugs or any therapy 
(except dietary supplements, vitamins or minerals) received locally (in the study eye and/or

The Investigator  will check any laboratory values which have potential significance in 
subject’s safety  during the study  period. The Investigator will also evaluate any change in 
laboratory values. Each out of range result should be assessed  as not clinically significant or 
clinically significant by Investigator . All lab oratory abnormalities that require intervention 
(e.g., IP withholding, IP discontinuation, concomitant medication) should be assessed  as 
clinically significant and the clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as  AEs .  
Clinical l aboratory tes t including haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis  can be 
repeated during the study period at the Investigator’s discretion .  
Deleted  laboratory test results with technical problems, such as handling error, sampling error, 
or tube breakage, should be followed by re- test. Result of re- test will be considered as that of 
an initial.  
6.3.3.  Pregnancy Test  
For women of childbearing potential , serum pregnancy test must be performed at Screening.

6.3.4.  Physical Examination 
Physical examination will be performed  at Screening and Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit . 
The physical e xamination will include an assessment of the subject’s general appearance, skin, 
head, neck, throat, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, neurological, thyroid, musculoskeletal/extremities, respiratory systems and the subject’s abdomen. Abnormal 
findings will be d ocumented on the source document , and a ny clinically significant 
abnormality or worsening of a previously noted abnormality should be recorded as an AE. 
Body weight will be recorded at Screening and Week 52 (EOS  visit ) or ET visit, but height 
will be measu red only at Screening.  
6.3.5.  Vital Signs 
Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Vital signs will be 
assessed at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. Vital signs 
will also be assessed at any time du ring the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit ( Table 1).  
The Investigator should assess all vital signs and any clinically significant abnormalities 
should be reported as AE. 
6.4. Ophthalmic Assessments  
6.4.1.  Full Ophtha lmic Examinations 
The full ophthalmic examination will consist of an external examination of the eye and adnexa 
routine screening for eyelid/pupil responsiveness (including but not limited to blepharoptosis, 
abnormal pupil shape, unequal pupils, abnormal reaction to light, and afferent pupillary defect), slit lamp biomicroscopy, IOP measurements and indirect ophthalmoscopy . 
The posterior segment should be examined with the slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Careful evaluation of the macula, optic nerve, retinal vessels, peripheral retina and vitreous should be included.  
Grading scales for slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy are provided in Appendix A , B and C .

Page 50 of 137 Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
The slit lamp examination (cornea, lens, iris, aqueous rea ction [cells and flare]) will be 
performed in both the study eye and fellow eye at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP at 
each visit until Week 48 , irrespective of whether or not the fellow eye has AMD . Slit lamp 
examination will also be performed at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET 
visit.  If the fellow eye is not diagnosed with AMD, it will be followed to determine whether or 
not AMD develops.  
Both the anterior segment and posterior segment will be assessed with the slit lamp.  
The posterior segment will be examined  after dilation of pupil with 2 -3 drops of 
phenylephrine-tropicamid (or any other mydriatic drug) applied topically to the eye.  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement  
IOP will be measured on the study eye at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP and 30-60 
minutes after ITV injection of IP  at each visit until Week 48. When IOP is measured before 
ITV injection of I P, IOP should be measured after OCT and FP/FA are completed to avoid 
corneal erosion. IOP will also be measured at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) 
or ET visit.  
IOP should be measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry. Th e same method o f IOP 
measurement must be used in each subject from Screening to Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
Indirect ophthalmoscopy  
Indirect ophthalmoscopy using in a standard way (i.e., usually using a head-mounted light 
source and a 20- 30 dpt lens) will be perform ed on the study eye  (including evaluation of 
posterior segment abnormalities of the vitreous, optic nerve, peripheral retina and retinal 
vasculature, as well as retinal pigment epithelium detachment, ischemic events including 
cotton wool spots and microane urysms)  at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP and 0-15 
min after ITV injection of IP  at each visit until Week 48. Indirect ophthalmoscopy will also be 
performed at any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.   
6.4.2.  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) 
OCT will be performed on the study eye at Screening and prior to ITV injection of IP at each 
study visit  until Week 48. OCT will also be performed at any time during the visit at Week 52 
(EOS visit) or ET visit.  
Site staffs who will perform O CT scans in this study must be certified by the central reading 
centre before study starts.

meet the minimum software requirement. The subject should use the OCT device s registered 
by central reading centre during the study period.  
All original OCT images will be kept in the Investigational site and copies will be sent to the 
central reading centre for analysis and archiving. A detailed protocol for OCT image 
acqu isition and transmission will be provided in the Image Handbook. 
6.4.3.  Fundus Photography  (FP) and Fluorescein Angiography (FA)  
FP/FA will be performed on the both  eyes at Screening and those images taken from the both 
eyes will be sent to the central reading centre.   
FP/FA will also be performed on the study eye prior to ITV injection of IP at Week 24  and at 
any time during the visit at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit . Those images taken from the 
study eye will be sent to the central reading centre.  
Site staffs who will perform FA/FP  in this study must be certified by the central reading centre 
before study starts.  
Only FP/FA device certified by central reading centre is allowed to be used in this study. If 
one or more FP/FA  devices are certified in an Investiga tional s ite, a subject must use the same  
FP/FA device consistently from Screening to Week 52  (EOS visit)  or ET visit .  
All original FP/FA images will be kept in the  Investigational  site and copies will be sent to the 
central reading centre for analysis and  archiving.  A detailed protocol for FP/FA  image 
acquisition and transmission will be provided in the Image Handbook. 
If any significant change in the posterior pole ( e.g., subretinal haemorrhage, macular hole, 
vitreous haemorrhage or opacity, retinal detac hment, etc .) is detected with fundus examination, 
additional FP and/or FA can be performed at the Investigat or’s discretion , but the images will 
not be sent to the central reading centre.  
6.5. Pharmacokinetic  Assessment  
Blood sampling for PK will be collected in approximately 40 subjects (20 subjects per 
treatment group) participating in PK evaluation.  The Investigational sites which are interested in taking part in PK sub -study and are also fully 
equipped as per study requirement (e.g.,  - 70 °C deep freezer for PK  sample storage and 
temperature controlled centrifuge) will be selected before the study starts. The selected 
Investigational sites will be defined as PK Investigational sites which are registered in the 
IWRS.

Page 52 of 137 Subjects screened at PK Investigational  sites will be asked to participate in PK sub -study. If 
subject  consents to the PK blood sampling, the subject will be enrolled in this study. Subjects 
enrolled  at PK Investigational sites will be “PK subjects” participating in  PK evaluation  until 
the expe cted number of PK subjects is reached. Once the expected number of PK subjects is 
reached, the following  subjects enrolled at  PK Investigational sites will be “non -PK subjects” 
for whom blood sampling for PK will not be performed.  
Blood sampling for PK wi ll be collected  prior to ITV injection of IP (C trough) and 24-72 hours 
after ITV injection of IP (close to C max) at Week 0  (Day 1) , Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 
24, and Week 36. Blood sampling for PK will also be collected  at any time during the visit at 
Week 1 and Week 52 (EOS  visit)  (Table 2).  
The exact date and time of sample collection must  be recorded in the source documentation 
and the eCRF. A detailed process for PK  sampling, handling, storage and shipping will be 
provided in the Central Laboratory Manual for PK and Immunogenicity.   
6.6. Immunogenicity  Assessment  
Blood sampling for immunogenicity will be collected  in all randomis ed subjects.  
Blood sampling for immunogenicity  will be collected  prior to ITV inject ion of IP at Week 0  
(Day 1) , Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, and Week 36. Blood sampling for 
immunogenicity will also be collected  at any time during the visit at Week 1 and Week 52 
(EOS visit) or ET visit ( Table 2). 
The exact date and time of sample collection must be recorded in the source documentation 
and the eCRF.  A detailed process for immunogenicity sampling, handling, storage and 
shipping will be provided in the Central Laboratory Manual for PK and Immunogenicity . 
If a subject has an unresolved adverse event that is possibly related to ADA formation, he or 
she could be asked to return for immunogenicity blood sampling after Week 52 ( EOS  visit)  or 
ET visit until the antibody titres return to baseline or stabilise at a level acceptable to the 
Investigator and Sponsor . 
6.7. NEI VFQ -25 
Vision -related QOL will be assessed using NEI VFQ -25. NEI VFQ -25 should be performed at 
Week 0 (Day 1) after randomisation. Then, NEI VFQ-25 should be performed before dilation of pupil at Week 0 (Day1), Week 24  and Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
All questionnaires will be administered in the local language. Investigator or delegated site 
staff will conduct a questionnaire survey with the subject in a quiet room. The results of the 
questionnaire will be recorded in a paper questionnaire and then entered into the eCRF.

During this study, efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments will be 
performed. All results should be recorded in the source documents along with the date and 
time the procedures were performed . Such assessments must be performed at the times 
outlined in Table 1. 
7.1. Visit 1 (Screening, D -21 to D -1) 
Screening should be performed within 21 days before randomisation excluding the day of 
randomisation.  
• Written i nformed consent 
Investigator must  discuss the study with the subject and obtain written informed consent  from 
the subject prior to any study related procedures. If the subject is not randomi sed within 21 
days after Screening, the subject should be screen failed . Once the subject is screen failed , he 
or she should not be re -screened.  
The following procedures should be performed: 
• Demographic data  
• Medical & ophthalmic history 
• Physical examinatio n (including body weight and height) 
• Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and pulse rate)  
• Pregnancy test  for women of childbearing potential ( serum ) 
• Blood and urine sampling for clinical laboratory tests  
- Urine samples must be collected before performing FA to avoid false elevation in 
urine protein values 
• Ocular assessments:  
• BCVA examination using original series ETDRS chart s or 2702 series Number 
chart s (before dilation of the pupils and FP/FA and OCT assessment ) 
- Subject must use the same chart consist ently from Screening to Week 52 (EOS 
visit) or ET visit  
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy 
• Indirect ophthalmoscopy

• Adverse event monitoring 
• Concomitant and previous medication or therapy 
• Evaluate subject compliance with all inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Investigators are advised to send OCT and FP/ FA images to central reading centre as soon as 
possible for review as this could take more time than the other procedures, in order to avoid 
exceeding the allowed 21 days. If the subject is screen failed due to any reasons before the 
Investigator send OCT and/or FP/FA images to central reading centre, the Investigator does 
not have to send the subject’s OCT and/or FP/FA images to central reading centre.  
Central reading centre will send central review results confirming  the subject’s eligibility to 
the Investigational site. If a subject is confirmed as ineligible from  centra l reading centre due 
to poor quality of images, but the investigator still considers the subject eligible for the study, 
the Investigator may be allowed to send a second set of images to the central reading centre. In this case, only FP/FA  or OCT  (and not all other screening procedures) have to be repeated 
within screening period of 21 days and the subject will retain the subject number initially 
assigned . 
Once the subject is confirmed eligible for the study, the subject will be advised on study restriction s such as contraception, prohibited medications and other study requirements if any. 
NOTE  
 The most critical assessment will be at Week 4 and Week 8 as these are the visits 
for primary endpoint assessment. Thus, every effort should be made to adhere 
to the visit schedule for the subjects.    
 A decrease in VA of ≥ 15 letters (compared with the last assessment of 
VA) should be reported as AEs/SAEs as appropriate.  
 Intraocular inflammation should be recorded based on the location  of 
inflammation (e.g., “iritis”, “vitritis” or “iridocyclitis” rather than “uveitis”) 
 Grading scales for slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy are 
provided in Appendix A, B and C.

responsible for informing Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) of the early termination of 
the study. 
8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal (investigational) pr oduct or other protocol-imposed intervention and 
which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment or 
intervention. An AE can therefore be an unfavourable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), sympt om, or disease temporally associated with the use of any 
dose of a medicinal (investigational) product or other protocol-imposed intervention, 
regardless of attribution.  
All AEs including ocular AEs in the study eye and/or fellow eye as well as systemic A Es will 
be collected from the written informed consent is obtained from the subject  until Week 52 
(EOS visit) or ET visit.  If the AMD is diagnosed in the fellow eye during the study period, the 
event should be also reported as an AE.  
Pre-existing conditions and any abnormal findings from assessments at the time of Screening 
which are not related to protocol-imposed intervention should not be reported as AEs, however pre- existing conditions which worsen (i.e., change in severity) that meets the 
definition of an AE during the study period are to be reported as AEs. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be report ed if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.  
The AE that emerge during the treatment with an IP (i.e., T reatment -Emergent Adverse Event 
[TEAE] ) will be analysed for the purposes of safety analyses.  
8.1.2.  Period of Observation for Adverse Events  
All AEs (ocular or systemic) will be recorded from the written informed consent is obtained 
from the subject  until Week 52  (EOS visit) or ET visit.

Page 71 of 137 SAEs  that occurred at or before Week 52 ( EOS visit) or ET  visit must be reported to Sponsor 
or its designated representative via eCRF SAE report form  at least within 24 h ours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the event.  
SAEs that are considered to be related to the IP can be collected regardless of the study 
period. SAEs that occurred after Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit and that are considered to 
be related to the IP must be reported to Sponsor or i ts designated representative using the 
paper SAE report form at least within 24 h ours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
event (see Section 8.2.2.).   
Date and time (wherever possible) of Investigator becoming aware of the SAE will be 
recorded in the SAE form and source document properly. 
Unresolved AEs should be followed up until the Week 52 ( EOS  visit) or ET visit and 
follow-up information will be recorded in the eCRF. The I nvestigator should provide prop er 
monitoring of subject’s status and related AEs for appropriate medical care of the subject  
until AE resolution or stabilisation.  
Unresolved  SAE at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit will be followed until event resolution or 
stabilisation (see Section  8.2.2.).   
8.1.3.  Reporting Adverse Events 
AEs are to be reported and reviewed by Investigator. When reporting an AE, a diagnosis 
(when possible and appropriate) rather than each individual signs and symptom s should be 
reported. 
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria of an SAE (see Section  8.2. for 
SAE definition). If an AE is classed as an SAE, it must be reported to Sponsor, or its 
designated representa tive, promptly according to the timeline specified in Section  8.2.2.  
For a n SAE, a diagnosis with a description of signs and symptoms as well as other supporting 
information that led to the diagnosis should be described in the SAE report form and reported 
to the Sponsor, or its designated representative, according to the procedures described in Section  8.2.2.  
8.1.4.  Severity Assessment  
Investigator is responsible for assessi ng and reporting the severity of AEs. The following 
classification should be used to classify AEs:  
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and  
may interfere with daily activities.

SB11 -G31-AMD  
Amendment 1, Sep 01, 2017  
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential  
Page 72 of 137 • Severe events interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity.  
8.1.5.  Causality Assessment  
Investigator is responsible for assigning a causal relationship to each AE. The causal 
relationship between the IP and  the AE should be defined as not related (no) or related (yes).  
Events should be classified as “related” if there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the AE. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationshi p. 
Events should be classified as “not related” if there is no reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the AE.  
8.1.6.  Emergency Unmasking for Safety Reasons  
Unmasking  should be considered only when knowledge of the treatment group assigned to 
subject  is deemed essential for the subject’s safety by Investigator. Emergency unmasking 
may be performed by Investigator through IWRS system if deemed necessary during the study period after randomisation.  
If the treatment group assigned to subject is unmasked , Investigat or should promptly 
document and explain to the Sponsor about any premature unmasking (e.g., accidental 
unmasking, unmasking due to a serious adverse event) of the investigational product(s) which is treated to the subject .  
Pertinent information regarding the circumstances of unmasking of a subject’s treatment 
group must be documented in the subject’s source documents. This includes who performed 
the unmasking, the subject(s) affected, the reason for the unmasking , the date of the 
unmasking  and the relevant IP information.  
After unma sking (except unmasking  for the purpose of pre-planned regulatory reporting in 
Section 5.2.4.), subjects will be discontinued from the IP (Refer to Section  4.3.).  
8.1.7.  Expectedness Assessment  
Expectedness of AEs will be assessed by referring to the safety information in the 
Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) of the relevant safety section. More detailed information on 
expectedness assessment will be explained in the IB. The latest SmPC of Lucentis
®, Annex I 
of EPAR Product Information posted on EMA website, will be used to assess the 
expectedness for the AEs.

Page 73 of 137 8.1.8.  Withdrawal due to Adverse Events  
Subject withdrawal from the IP due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to 
personal reasons. Subjects withdrawn due to an AE will be followed up until the time point 
specified in the protocol  (refer to Section  4.3.). If s ubjects cannot be followed, the reasons will 
be documented by the I nvestigator (e.g. , lost to follow -up, refusal to be followed up). When a 
subject withdraws from the IP due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported and followed in 
accordance with the requirements outlined in Section 8.2.2.  
Subjects who are discontinue d from  IPs because of serious or significant safety issues should 
be followed closely until the events are fully and permanently resolved or stabilised.  
8.2. Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Definition o f Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death   
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defects  
• Is medically important  
Life-threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to  an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Hospitalisation  
AEs reported from clinical studies associated with hospitalisation or prolongation of existing 
hospitalisation are considered serious. 
Any admission to a healthc are facility more than 24 hours meets these criteria. Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., from the medical 
floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). Staying at the observation unit in the emergency room for more than 24 hours qualifies for hospitalisation.

SB11 -G31-AMD  
Amendment 1, Sep 01, 2017  
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential  
Page 74 of 137 Any events leading to a subsequent emergency ro om visit or inpatient hospitalis ation for less 
than 24 hours may be regarded as medically important for its seriousness criteria, at the 
discretion of the Investigator based on medical judgement. 
Hospitalis ation or prolongation of existing hospitalis ation in the absence of an AE is not in 
itself an SAE. Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a pre- existing (prior to ICF signed) condition not 
associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the pre- existing 
condition 
• Diagnostic admission (e.g., for work-up of persistent pre- treatment laboratory 
abnormality) 
• Social admission (e.g., study subject has no place to sleep)  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for a regular check -up) 
• Protocol-specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by 
the study protocol) 
• Elective admission not associated with an AE (e.g., for elective cosmetic surgery)  
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures  
: Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the relevant source 
document for the individual subject.  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expe dited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation. However, if it is determined 
that the event may jeopardise the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. 
In addition, sight -threatening ocular adverse event will be reported as SAE if it meets one or 
more of the following criteria:

• A decrease in VA to the level of Ligh t Perception or worse  
• Requirement of surgical intervention (e.g., conventional surgery, vitreous tap or 
biopsy with ITV injection of anti-biotics , laser  treatment, ITV gas injection,  or retinal 
cryopexy) to prevent permanent loss of vision  
• Severe intraocu lar inflammation ( e.g., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 4+ vitritis).  
• In the investigator’s opinion, medical  intervention may be required to prevent 
permanent loss of vision. 
8.2.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs  that occurred at or before Week 52 ( EOS visit) or ET visit must be reported to Sponsor 
or its designated representative via eCRF SAE report form  at least within 24 h ours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the event.  
SAEs that occurred after Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit and that are considered to be related 
to the IP must be reported to Sponsor or its designated representative using the paper SAE 
report form at least within 24 h ours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  
Date and time (wherever possible) of Investigator becoming aware of the SAE will be 
recorded in the SAE form and source document  properly. 
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, Sponsor must be notified immediately, 
irrespective of the extent of available SAE information. This timeframe also appli es to 
additional (follow -up) information that becomes available on previously forwarded SAE 
reports. Sponsor will then follow expedited reporting procedures according to local and 
international regulations as appropriate. 
The Investigator is obligated to p ursue and provide information to Sponsor on all SAEs in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition , Investigator may be 
requested by Sponsor to obtain specific additional follow- up information in an expedited 
fashion. In general, this will include a description of the SAE, which should be provided in 
sufficient detail so as to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Sponsor or its designated representative.  
All SAEs will be followed until event resolution or stabilisation (for chronic events), if possible, even when a subject is discontinued from IP. For chronic events that does not fully 
resolve until years later, the outcome should be reported as “resolved with sequelae” as soon

Page 76 of 137 as the event has stabilised or returned to baseline. Follow -up information for the SAE should 
be actively sought and submitted as the information becomes available.  
8.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following AEs in  the study eye will be class ified as  Adverse Events of Special Interests 
(AESIs ) in this study:  
• Any case of new onset IOP of > 21 mm Hg that does not respond to treatment, except 
the transient pressure rise observed within an hour  after ITV injection  of IP  
• Any case of IOP ≥ 35 mmHg , at any time, that required treatment 
• Any case of intraocular infection such as endophthalmitis 
• Any case of intraocular inflammation  such as iritis, vitritis and iridocyclitis  
• Iatrogenic traumatic cataract  
• Arterial thromboembolic events defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown as cause) 
8.4. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy, including those of female partners of male subjects treated with the IP, should 
be reported to the Sponsor. If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, a written 
informed consent must be obtained from the female partner before collecting any pregnancy-
related data. All pregnancies associated with the subject, from the time the subject receives the 
first ITV injection of IP  until either Week 52 (EOS visit)  or ET visit, should be reported to the 
Sponsor. Pregnancy reports should be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours  from when  
the Investigator became aware of the pregnancy , using the Pregnancy Report Form. 
Although pregnancy is not an AE, all pregnancies must be followed up every 2 months until 
6-8 weeks after the outcome of the pregnancy becomes available,  unless the subject is lost to 
follow-up. The pregnancy outcome should be notified to the Sponsor by submitting a follow-
up Pregnancy Report Form. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the SAE criteria then the Investigator should report this case according to the SAE reporting process ( Section  8.2.2. ). 
8.5. Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent D ata and Safety Monitoring B oard (DSMB) will be assigned for this study. 
The DSMB will consist of external experts (e.g., physician, clinical pharmacologists or 
biostatisticians) and will revie w the safety and tolerability data from the study at pre- specified 
intervals. The details of the safety data and time points for review will be described in the 
DSMB Charter and in the DSMB Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
Further information on the statistical methods to be used in this study will be provided in the 
SAP, which will be finalised prior to the database lock for reporting the main  CSR . 
Statistical analysis and reporting will be performed as follows:  
• Interim safety analysis for independent DSMB  meeting:  
A DSMB SAP, describing the methodol ogy and presentation of results and access to 
results will be prepared as a separate document  and included in the DSMB Charter . The 
safety reports for the DSMB data review meetings will be prepared according to the 
DSMB SAP.  
The statistical analysis will be performed by an independent statistical reporting team and 
the results will be communicated to the DSMB directly by an independent unmasked 
statistician.  
• Main CSR:  
The main  analysis will take place once all  subjects complete the procedures at Week 24, 
or its corresponding visit . Available efficacy and safety data, pharmacokinetics, and 
immunogenicity data  will be analysed and reported . 
At the time of this reporting,  a limited number of identified individuals of the Sponsor or 
CRO  will be un masked for rep orting purpose. However, s ubjects, I nvestigators, and 
other study personnel will remain masked  throughout the entire study period. 
• Final CSR:  
The final analysis will take place after the last subject completes the procedures at Week 
52 or the corresponding  visit. All study data will be analysed and reported for final CSR. 
9.1. Analysis Sets 
The following sets will be used for the analyses performed in the study: 
• Randomised S et (RAN) consists of all subjects who receive a randomisation number 
at the randomis ation  visit .  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects who are randomi sed at the 
randomis ation visit. Following the intent- to-treat principle, subjects will be analysed

subjects who do not qualify for randomisation and are inadvertently randomis ed into 
the study will be excluded from the FAS, provided these subjects do not receive IP 
during the study period. The FAS will be the primary analysis set for BCVA  
• Per-Protocol S et for BCVA (PPS- BCVA) consists of all FAS subjects who have first 
two IP injections and complete the procedures at Week 8 without any major protocol 
deviations that have impact on the BCVA assessment. Major protocol deviations that will lead to exclusion from this set will be pre -defined prior to unmasking the 
treatment group assignment for analyses. 
• Per-Protocol S et for CST (PPS- CST) consists of all FAS subjects who have the first  
IP injection at Week 0 (Day 1 ) and complete the procedures at Week 4 without a ny 
major protocol deviations that have impact on the CST  assessment. This PPS -CST 
will be the primary analysis set for CST. Major protocol deviations that will lead to 
exclusion from this set will be pre-defined prior to unmasking the treatment codes for 
analyses . 
• Safety Set (SAF) consist s of all subjects who receive at least one IP during the study 
period after randomisation. Subjects will be analysed according to the IP received . 
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis S et (PKS)  consist s of all subjects in the SAF who 
participate  in PK  evaluation  at PK Investigational sites (PK subjects) and have at least 
one PK  sample analysed .  
9.2. Statistical Methods and Analytical Plan  
9.2.1.  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will be sum marised by treatment group for 
the RAN and PKS. Continuous variables (e.g., age, weight, height) will be summarised with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum)  and c ategorical variables 
(e.g., gender, race, ethnicity) will be summarised with frequency and percentage.  
Comparison between  treatment groups in baseline characteristics will be performed using the 
chi-square test or F -test as appropriate. The results of these tests will be provided including 
the p- value only for descriptiv e purposes and will not be used as a formal basis to determine 
the factors to be included in primary or secondary efficacy analysis models. If baseline 
imbalances are detected for any of the factors, additional analyses may be performed to adjust for these  baseline differences.  
Relevant medical history will be summarised by treatment group for the RAN.

Page 79 of 137 Duration of exposure to IP and number of injections will be summarised by treatment group 
with descriptive statistics for the SAF. Prior and concomitant medications and significant non-
drug therapies will be summarised by treatment group with frequency and percentage.  
9.2.2.  Efficacy  
For US FDA, Korea MFDS or other regulatory agency submissions for those who are in 
favour of the VA, t he primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the FAS with the 
change from baseline of BCVA at Week 8 using an analysis of covariance model with the 
baseline BCVA as a covariate and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as factors. 
The equivalence in BCVA will be declared if  the two -sided 90 % Confidence I nterval (CI) of 
the difference in terms of  BCVA Least Squares mean ( LS mean ) changes from baseline at 
Week 8 between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within the pre -defined equivalence margin of [− 3 
letters, 3 letters].  
For EMA or other regulatory agency submissions for those who are in favour of the 
anatomical parameter, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the per -protocol set 
(PPS- CST)  with the change from baseline of  CST at Week  4 using an analysis of covariance 
model with baseline CST as a covariate and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as 
factors . The equivalence in CST will be declared if the two -sided 95% CI of the difference of 
the CST LS mean changes from basel ine in Week 4 between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within 
the pre -defined equivalence margin of [−36 μm, 36 μm]. 
No formal adjustment of Type I error rates will be performed. 
For the primary analysis with the FAS for BCVA, missing data will be imputed for subjects 
who drop out for the study prior to the primary analysis time-point. A missing- at-random 
approach will assume that subjects who withdraw from a study had missing values similar to similar subjects who completed the study in that treatment group. This approach ensures that evidence of lack of equivalence is not diluted when there are missing d ata. For the 
components of BCVA, the missing letter will be imputed by multiple imputation method with 
the assumption of monotone missing pattern and regression method. For the sensitivity 
analyses, available case analysis and last observation carried forward analysis will be performed.  
All other secondary efficacy measurements will be summarised descriptively by treatment 
group and visit, and analysed using analysis of covariance model for continuous outcomes or 
Cochran- Mentel -Haenszel method for categori cal outcomes unless otherwise specified . 
9.2.3.  Safety 
All reported terms for AEs (ocular and systemic) will be coded using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA
®). For all AE and SAE tables, subjects will be counted once 
for each preferred term an d each system organ class.

Page 80 of 137 A TEAE will be defined as any AE with an onset date on or after the date of the first ITV 
injection of  IP. AEs which are already present before the first ITV injection of  IP and increase 
in severity after the first ITV injection  of IP will be considered as TEAEs. Pre- existing AEs 
before the first ITV injection of  IP with no increase in severity after the first ITV injection of 
IP will not be considered as TEAEs.  
All TEAEs and SAEs will be summarised  respectively for study eye (o cular TEAE), fellow 
eye (ocular TEAE) and others (systemic TEAE) by the frequency and percentage of subjects 
experiencing events by system organ class, preferred term and treatment group. SAEs leading 
to IP discontinuation and TEAEs by causality and severi ty will be summarised similarly. All 
AEs including those pre- existing before the first ITV injection of IP  will be listed by subject.   
In addition, systemic TEAEs will also be summarised without subjects who received 
Lucentis® in the  fellow eye due to AMD during the study  period after randomisation.  
Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters will be summarised descriptively by 
treatment group and visit . Other safety variables will be summarised unless otherwise 
specified, and all safety vari ables will be listed.  
All safety analyses will be performed using the SAF.  
9.2.4.  Pharmacokinetics  
Blood sampling for PK will be collected in approximately 40 subjects participating in PK 
evaluation ( 20 subjects per treatment group). The systemic exposure will be summarised 
descriptively by treatment group and visit.  
If fellow eye received Lucentis® due to AMD during the study period after randomisation, the 
concentration measured after treatment for the fellow eye will be listed, but excluded from the 
summary statistics.  
9.2.5.  Immunogenicity  
The number and proportion of subjects with ADA and NAb results (e.g., “positive” or 
“negative”) will be summarised by treatment group and visit.  
If fellow eye received Lucentis® due to AMD during the study period after randomisat ion, the 
ADA and NAb results obtained after treatment for the fellow eye will be listed, but excluded 
from the summary statistics.

without subjects who received Lucentis® in the fellow eye due to AMD during the study 
period a fter randomisation. 
9.3. Determination of Sample Size  
For the calculation of the equivalence margin  for BCVA, the mean changes in VA were 
referred from two studies of Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, 
the mean change of VA at Week 24 (SD) were −6.6 (13.31) letters and 6.5 (12.00) letters for 
placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups, respectively. In FOCUS study, the mean 
change (SD) of VA at Week 24 were −5.0 (16.14) letters and 4.0 (14.41) letters for placebo 
and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups , respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta- analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in 
VA of 12.41 letters with a 95% CI [10.34 letters; 14.48 letters]. The derived equivalence limit 
from meta -analysis is 4.9 letters at Week 24, but by the agency recommendation the 
equivalence limit at Week 8 will be 3 letters for the comparison with the 90% CI of mean 
difference between treatment groups.  
With the given equivalence margin of [− 3 letters, 3 letters], 334 subjects per treatment groups 
was calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0.5 letters and pooled standard deviation (SD)  of 12.5 letters at the overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 5% loss from 
randomised subjects after  8 weeks , a sample size of 352 subjects per treatment groups (overall 
sample size of 704) will give 334 completers per treatment group after 8 weeks, which is 
estimated to give 80% power to detect the equivalence within the margin of 3 letter s. 
For the calculation of the equivalence margin  for CST, the mean changes in CST were 
referred from two studies of Lucentis
® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, 
the mean change of CST  at Week 4 (SD) was 8.1 (58.1) μm and −106 (122.5) μm for placebo 
and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups, respectively. In PIER study, the mean change (SD) of 
CST at Week 4 were 15 (94.9) μm and −90 (140.9) μm for placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® 
treatment groups , respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta- analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in 
CST of −109.6 μm with a 95% CI [−146.45 μm; −72.65 μm]. The derived equivalence limit 
from meta -analysis is 36 μm at Week 4. 
With the given equivalence margin of [−36 μm, 36 μm], 290 subjects per treatment group was 
calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0 between treatment groups, common SD  of 133.3 μm at the overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 10% loss from

Amendment 1, Sep 01, 2017  
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential  
Page 82 of 137 FAS, a sample size of 323 per arm (overall sam ple size of 646) will give 80% power to detect 
the equivalence within the pre -defined margin. 
Therefore, the sample size of 704 allows enough power to detect the equivalence between 
treatment groups in both situations.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Data C onfidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential. Subject identification information will be labelled with a code number, and will not include the subject’s name or other 
information that could identify them. A list linking the cod e and the subject’s name will be 
kept in the Investigational site files as required by International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) to protect the subject’s confidentiality.  
The coded information will be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) who will analyse it and report the study results both to regulatory and ethical authorities. The Sponsor may also place data 
on public websites or publish journal articles based upon these results. Subject names or other directly identifiable information will not appear on any reports, publications, or other 
disclosures of clinical study outcomes. Care will be taken to prevent subjects being identified through these publications. In addition, data may be shared with other companies or 
researchers to aid further research into AMD . Such data sharing practices will be covered by 
confidentiality agreements. No -one outside the Investigat ional site will have access to subject -
identifiable information. 
10.2. Monitoring  
The Sponsor has engaged the services of a CRO to perform all monitoring functions within 
this clinical study. The monitors will work in accordance with the CRO Standard Operation Procedures ( SOPs) and have the same rights and responsibilities as monitors from the Sponsor 
organisation. Monitors will establish and maintain regular contact between the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Monitors will evaluate the competence of each Investigational site and inform the Sponsor 
about any problems relating to facilities, technical equipment or m edical staff. During the 
study period, monitors will check that written informed consent has been obtained correctly 
from all subjects and that data are recorded correctly and completely. Monitors will also perform source data verification by comparing ent ries in the eCRF with corresponding source 
data and informing the Investigator of any errors or omissions. Monitors will verify adherence to the protocol at the Investigational site. All protocol deviations will be reported to the 
Sponsor via the Monitoring Visit Reports. Monitors will arrange for the supply of IP and ensure appropriate storage conditions are maintained.

Page 83 of 137 Monitoring visits will be conducted at regular intervals according to  ICH  GCP. The monitor 
will provide written reports to the Sponsor on each occasion they make contact with the 
Investigator regardless of whether it is by phone or in person. 
Further details on the monitoring processes and the level of source data verification to be 
performed will be outlined in the monitoring plan. 
10.3. Data Han dling and Record Keeping  
The Investigator must maintain essential study documents including protocol and protocol 
amendments, completed eCRFs, signed written ICFs  and its revisions/updates, completed 
eCRFs, other  relevant correspondence according to ICH GCP and other relevant study 
requirements (if applicable) until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years af ter the formal termination of clinical 
development of the IP or 15 years from completion of the study , or whichever longer 
according to the relevant local laws and/or regulations. These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or the Investigational 
site, institution or private practice in which the study is being conducted. Subject identification codes (subject names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained for the 
same period of time. These documents may be transferred to another responsible party, 
deemed acceptable by the Sponsor, and who agrees to abide by the retention policies. Written 
notification of transfer must be submitted to the Sponsor. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor prior to disposing of any study records and obtain written permission to do so. 
10.4. Database Management and Coding 
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of the 
data management of the Sponsor (or an appropriate company designated by the Sponsor to perform these activities). The study eCRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study. Subject data will be captured in an eCRF and reviewed by the monitor in order to check 
adherence to the protocol and to detect any data inconsistency or discrepancy  from source 
document. 
The Investigator must ensure that the clinical data required by the study protocol are carefully 
reported in the eCRF. He/she must also check that the data reported in the eCRF correspo nd to 
those in the medical records. The investigator will sign all collected data in eCRF.  
Forms should be available during periodic visits by study monitors to enable review for completeness and acceptability. Any correction to the data entered into the eCRF must be carried out by the Investigator or a designated member of staff. These changes may be made either on the initiative of the Investigational site staff or in response to monitoring or data 
queries. Any changes to written data must be made using I CH GCP corrections and any 
change to electronic data should be made in a system which can provide an audit trail.

queries to the investigational staff for resolution. Co rrections will be recorded in an audit trail 
that records the old information, the new information, and identification of the person making the changes, date of correction made and reason for change. The Investigator must sign and 
date the eCRF pages as in dicated. 
Medical/surgical history and underlying diseases and AEs will be coded using MedDRA
®. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organi sation -Drug Dictionary 
Enhanced (WHO- DDE). The versions of coding dictionaries used will be st ated in the clinical 
study report.  
10.5. Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
During the conduct of the study, Sponsor or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits 
to ensure that the protocol and ICH GCP are being followed. The monitors may review sourc e 
documents to confirm that the data recorded on the eCRFs are accurate. The Investigator and 
institution will allow the domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, sponsor’s monitors and 
auditors’ direct access to source documents to perform this verific ation. The Investigational 
site may be subject to review by the IEC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Sponsor, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that 
Investigator s and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and 
possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

Grading Scale for Anterior Chamber Flare  
Flare   
0 No protein is visible in the anterior chamber when viewed by an experienced 
observer using slit lamp biomicroscopy; a small, bright, focal slit-beam of 
white light; and high magnification.  
Trace  Trace amount of protein detectable in the anterior chamber. This protein is 
visible only with careful scrutiny by an experienced observer using slit lamp 
biomicroscopy; a small, bright, focal slit-beam of white light; and high 
magnification. 
1+ Mild amount of protein det ectable in the anterior chamber. The presence of 
protein in the anterior chamber is immediately apparent to an experienced observer using slit lamp biomicroscopy and high magnification, but such protein is detected only with careful observation with the na ked eye and a 
small, bright, focal slit-beam of white light. 
2-3+ Moderate amount of protein detectable in the anterior chamber. These grades 
are similar to 1+ but the opacity would be readily visible to the naked eye of an observer using any source of a focused beam of white light, This is a 
continuum of moderate opacification, with 2+ being less apparent than 3+. 
4+ A large (severe) amount of protein is detectable in the anterior chamber. 
Similar to 3+, but the density of the protein approaches that of the lens. 
Additionally, frank fibrin deposition is frequently seen in acute circumstances.  
It needs to be noted that because fibrin may persist for a period of time after 
partial or complete restoration of the blood- aqueous barrier, it is possible to 
have  resorbing fibrin present with lower numeric assignations for flare (e.g., 
1+ flare with fibrin).

8.2.1. Definition of 
Serious Adverse Event  Not applicable  Life-threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Hospitalisation 
AEs reported from clinical studies associated with hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation are con sidered serious.  
Any admission to a healthcare facility more than 24 hours meets these criteria. Admission also includes 
transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive Clarification for “Life -
threatening” and “Hospitalisation”

care unit (e.g., from the medical floor to a coronary 
care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). 
Staying at the observation unit in the emergency 
room for more than 24 hours qualifies for 
hospitalisation.  
Any events leading to a subsequent emergency room 
visit or inpatient hospitalisation for less than 24 hours may be regarded  as medically important for 
its seriousness criteria, at the discretion of 
Investigator based on medical judgement.  
Hospitalisation or prolongation of existing 
hospitalisation in the absence of an AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a pre- existing (prior to 
ICF signed) condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the 
pre-existing condition  
• Diagnostic admission (e.g., for work -up of 
persistent pre- treatment laboratory abnormality)  
• Social admission (e.g., study subject has no place to sleep)  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for a regular check -up) 
• Protocol -specified admission during a clinical 
study (e.g., for a procedure required by the study protocol)  
• Elective admission not associated with an AE (e.g., 
for elective cosmetic surgery) • Pre -planned treatments or surgical procedures  
: Pre -planned treatments or surgical procedures 
should be noted in the relevant source document for

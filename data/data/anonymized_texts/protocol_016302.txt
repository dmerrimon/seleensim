Study Title: Improved behavioral outcome in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients by 
reducing caregiver distress: Behavioral and physiological evidence 
Principal Investigator: Mark Laudenslager, Ph. D. 
COMIRB No: 13-2639Version Date: July 20, 2015Version No: Caregiver – 9
You are being asked to participate in a research study.  This form provides you with information about 
the study. A member of the research team will describe this study to you and answer all of your questions. Please read the information below and ask questions about anything you don’t understand before deciding whether or not to take part. 
Why is this study being done?
Caregivers in general as well as their patients are a stressed group.  Caregivers of allogeneic 
(receiving a transplant of other than their own blood components) blood or marrow transplant (BMT) (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)) recipients are a particularly distressed group, since caregiver support for the transplant patient is required 24 hours a day 7 days a week for at least the first 100 days following transplantation.  This study’s goals are to learn more about the impact of scheduled stress management training on both the caregiver and their patient.  This will be compared to voluntary participation in available support programs for caregivers of HSCT recipients.  We will measure stress hormones (chemicals) in your hair that change in response to chronic stress.  We will also collect blood samples in order to perform laboratory tests of various aspects of your body’s defenses against illness as well as information contained in your DNA relevant to aging.  These are experimental tests and have no clinical value at this time.  We may save left over cells or fluid after the tests are performed for any new test that might be relevant to stress, health, and/or the caregiving experience.  
You are being asked to be in this research study because you are between the ages of 18 - 85 and a 
caregiver of an allogeneic BMT patient. 
Up to 450 local caregivers such as yourself as well as the person they will be taking care of will be 
contacted or enrolled in this research study. 
What happens if I join this study?
If you join the study, you will
 be assigned to one of two groups: either receiving voluntary support 
services group provided at your patient’s clinic or scheduled individualized training program provided at the clinic as well. To decide which group you will be in, we will use the method of chance.  This method is like flipping a coin.  Although you will know which group you are in, the study scientists will not. This information needs to be kept secret and not shared with others in the clinic who might be assigned to the other condition so that the study is based on scientific results, not on peoples’ opinions.

Initials: _______If you are placed into the voluntary support services group you will be asked to do the following 
things: 
1) You will be asked to provide hair samples prior to your patient’s transplant and again at 12 weeks 
and 6 months following the transplant. We will collect about 50 strands of hair at the scalp from the back of your head. The hair is not plucked but carefully cut.  The site is covered by hair from the crown of your head and, thus, is not visible following the haircut.
These hair samples will be used to measure the levels of cortisol, a stress-related chemical in your 
body. Cortisol is naturally released in response to both physical and emotional stressors.
2) You will be asked to provide about 3 tablespoons of blood .  We will get blood by putting a 
needle into one of your veins and letting the blood flow into a glass tube.  You may feel some pain when the needle goes into your vein.  A day or two later, you may have a small bruise where the needle went under the skin.   We ask that you provide blood before your patient’s transplant and again at 12 weeks, and 6 months following the transplant. A second sample may be requested only in the unlikely event that a laboratory procedure does not function properly.  This occurs rarely.  The samples will be used to assess cells in your blood as well as chemicals that sometimes change with stress and for collecting DNA.    
3) You will be asked to fill out some questionnaires  about your mood (depression or anxiety) 
symptoms of stress you may be experiencing, how being a caregiver has affected your life, and your general physical and mental well-being.  These questionnaires will take about 20-30 minutes to complete.  You will fill out these questionnaires prior to your patient’s transplant and again at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months following the transplant. Your responses to these questions will tell us about how you are doing psychologically.
If you are randomized into the scheduled individualized training sessions you will be asked to do 
everything above as well as :
1) You will be asked to attend ten scheduled individualized training sessions . The scheduling will 
be around your specific availability.  Each session will last about 60-75 minutes.  Individual sessions will begin the week that your patient receives their transplant (before if possible) and will continue weekly for four sessions followed by about every other week for four  more sessions with two additional sessions between 4-6 months post-transplant.  There may be several occasions when you cannot make a session with the therapist and we will set up a video chat for your convenience instead (see Smartphone below). Each individual training session will be devoted to a separate topic.  Some of these topics will include: what to expect from the caregiving experience, how to cope with stress, relaxation and breathing exercises, identifying the needs of your patient, stress management skills, managing relationships with others and the patient, communication skills, and other topics related to caregiving.  You may be asked to sign an additional consent for use of video recordings made during the sessions with the therapist for a training DVD or scientific conferences.
2) You will be asked to do practice a form of relaxation  using a FDA approved device called  
emWave2 (Heartmath, Inc) .  The emWave2 is a small hand-held electronic device about the size of a 
smartphone.  To use it you place your index finger on a special sensor (or you can use a simple sensor that attaches to your ear) your pulse will be monitored.  You will see a line of blue lights that give you visual feedback for controlling relaxation (generally accomplished by slowing your respiration).  The emWave2 can help you develop a slower breathing rate.  It is thought this will help

Initials: _______reduce stress and anxiety. During your first individual session you will receive an emWave2 
(Heartmath, Inc).  You will receive an explanation of how to use the device.  After training to use the emWave2, we ask that you practice with the device daily as well as when you feel distressed during the 12 weeks of the individual sessions. We also encourage you to continue using the emWave2 after the training sessions are completed.
3) You will be asked to use a  Smartphone . If you do not have a Smartphone, we will provide one for 
you at no cost.  The Smartphone will be used for sessions when you are unable to come to the transplant center. You will receive training in the use of the Smartphone calendar app for scheduling patient’s appointments as well as your own scheduled sessions. Reminders for scheduled session appointments will be sent by text message to the Smartphone.  If you choose, we will upload any selected apps to your Smartphone that could send you brief statements each day that are positive and reinforcing. 
Study participation will last for 6 months. You may withdraw at any time during the study.  If at any 
time the patient should withdraw from the study for any reason, we would like for you to continue your participation in the study.  However you are free to withdraw at anytime.   
What are the possible discomforts or risks?
While in the study you may find out that you have a psychiatric condition that you did not know about before starting the study. We will provide appropriate resources and referrals as needed if you choose to utilize these services you would be responsible for any associated costs. 
Discomforts you may experience while in this study include emotional distress or embarrassment 
when asked to think about your feelings related to your experience as a caregiver of your patient. You will be provided with references for community providers if you experience emotional distress or embarrassment if you request or it is believed to be helpf ul to you by our staff. If you choose to utilize 
these services you would be responsible for any associated costs. 
Some participants may feel burdened by filling out the questionnaires.  You are encouraged to 
participate only if you feel that filling out these questionnaires will not be a burden.
You may experience slight uneasiness while having hair collected.   Risk of Blood Draw
In this study we will need to get about 3 tablespoons of blood from you.  We will get blood by putting a needle into one of your veins and letting the blood flow into a glass tube.  You may feel some pain when the needle goes into your vein.  A day or two later, you may have a small bruise where the needle when under the skin.  
The study may include risks that are unknown at this time.What are the possible benefits of the study?
This study is designed for the researcher to learn more about a treatment for the stress of caregiving, 
specifically for BMT patients.  This study is not designed to treat any illness or to improve your health.  Also there are risks as mentioned in the Discomforts and Risk Section.

Mark Laudenslager, Ph.D. would like to keep some of the blood that is taken during the study but is 
left over from other tests. If you agree, the blood samples will be kept and may be used in future research to learn more about stress disorders. The research that is done with your blood samples is not designed to specifically help you. It might help people who have stress disorders and other diseases in the future.  Reports about research done with your samples will not be given to you or your doctor. These reports will not be put in your health records. The research using your blood samples will not affect your care.
The choice to let Mark Laudenslager, Ph.D. keep the blood samples for future research is up to you. 
No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect the care that you or your patient will receive as part of the study. If you decide now that your blood samples can be kept for research, you can change your mind at any time and contact your study doctor to let him or her know that you do not want Mark Laudenslager, Ph.D. to use your blood samples any longer, and they will no longer be used for research. Otherwise, they may be kept until they are used up, or until Mark Laudenslager, Ph.D. decides to destroy them. 
When your blood samples are given to other researchers in the future, Mark Laudenslager, Ph.D. will 
not give them your name, address, phone number or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are. 
Sometimes blood samples are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in 
families). Even if your blood samples are used for this kind of research, the results will not be told to you and will not be put in your health records. Your blood samples will only be used for research and will not be sold. The research done with your samples may help to develop new products in the future, but there is no plan for you to be paid.
The possible benefits of research from your blood samples include learning more about what causes 
stress disorders and other diseases, how to prevent them and how to treat them. The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records.  Mark Laudenslager, Ph.D. will protect your records so that your name, address and phone number will be kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. There will be no cost to you for any blood collected and stored by Mark Laudenslager, Ph.D.

Study Title: Improved behavioral outcome in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients by 
reducing caregiver distress: Behavioral and physiological evidence
Principal Investigator: Mark Laudenslager, Ph. D. 
COMIRB No:  13-2639
Version Date: July 22, 2015Version No: Patient - 7
You are being asked to be in a research study.  This form provides you with information about the 
study. A member of the research team will describe this study to you and answer all of your questions. Please read the information below and ask questions about anything you don’t understand before deciding whether or not to take part. 
Why is this study being done?
Caregivers in general as well as the loved one for whom they care are a stressed group.  Caregivers 
of allogeneic (receiving a transplant of other than their own blood components) blood or marrow transplant (BMT) (also referred to as hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)) recipients are a particularly distressed group, since caregiver support is required 24 hours a day 7 days a week for at least the first 100 days following transplantation.  This is an equally difficult time for the patient as 
well.  This study’s goals are to learn more about the impact of scheduled stress management training on both the caregiver and their patient.  This will be compared to voluntary participation in available support programs for caregivers of BMT recipients such as yourself.  We will measure your stress by a hormone (chemicals) present in your hair that changes in response to chronic stress.  These are experimental tests and have no clinical value at this time.
You are being asked to be in this research study because you are between the ages of 18 – 85 and 
are receiving an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient and your caregiver is also agreeing to participate in this study. 
Other people in this study
Up to 450 local allogeneic HSCT patients and their caregivers who will be taking care of them will be 
contacted or enrolled in this research study. 
What happens if I join this study?
If you join the study, you will be asked to do the following. 1) You will be asked to provide hair samples prior to your transplant and again at 6 months following 
the transplant. We will collect a small amount of hair (less than 50 single strands of hair) from the

thus, is not visible after collection. We can show you a video of this process if you wish.  
These hair samples will be used to measure the levels of cortisol, a stress-related chemical in your 
body. Cortisol is naturally released in response to both physical and emotional stressors.
2) You will be asked to fill out some questionnaires  about symptoms of stress you may be 
experiencing, your quality of life, and your general physical and mental well-being.  These questionnaires will take less than30 minutes to complete.  We are asking that you complete this questionnaire prior to your transplant and again at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months post-transplant. Your caregiver will be completing these questionnaires at the same time as yourself.  Additionally your caregiver will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment groups.  
3) You will also give permission for a qualified individual (physician or highly trained medical 
professional) to review your medical records  pertaining to the blood or marrow transplant during 
your course of treatment. 
Study participation will last for 6 months. You may withdraw at any time during the study. What are the possible discomforts or risks?
The study may include risks that are unknown at this time. Discomforts you may experience while in this study include  emotional distress or embarrassment 
when asked to think about your general health. 
Some participants may feel burdened by filling out questionnaires. You are encouraged to participate 
only if you feel that filling out the questionnaires will not be a burden.  
You may experience slight uneasiness while having your haircut.  
What are the possible benefits of the study?
This study is designed for the researcher to learn more about an intervention designed to help reduce 
the stress that caregivers of BMT patients’ experience.  This study is not designed to treat any illness or to improve your health.  Also there are risks as mentioned in the Discomforts and Risk Section.
Who is paying for this study? 
This research is being funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.
Will I be paid for being in the study?  
You will be paid $10.00 for providing a hair sample and $15.00 for completing questionnaires. A 
subject providing one hair sample and completing the questionnaire packets could receive up to a total of $80.00. If you leave the study early, or if we take you out of the study early, you will be paid only for the sample collections completed.  It is important to know that payments for participation in a study are taxable income. You will not be paid to be in the study.

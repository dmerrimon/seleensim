Noninvasive Neuromodulation to Reverse Diastolic Dysfunction
(NERDD)
Principal Investigator: Stavros Stavrakis, MD, PhD
This is  a clinical trial  (a type of research study). Clinical  trials include only  patients who 
choose to take part in  them. Please  take your time  to make your decision.  Discuss this  
with your family and  friends.
Why Have I  Been Asked  To Participate  In This Study?
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been  diagnosed as having 
diastolic dysfunction (stiffness of the heart muscle).
Why Is This Study Being Done?
The purpose  of this  study is to find out whether low-level, electrical stimulation of the 
ear, using a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device,  can improve heart 
function. This  is assessed  by using  an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) and an 
electrocardiogram (EKG). 
We will explain how a TENS unit works below:
The TENS unit is  a small, portable, battery-powered device.  It sends low-level,  electrical 
pulses to the nerves under  the skin of your  ear through an ear clip attached  to the ear.
What is the Status  of the  Device Involved  in This  Study?
A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device is used for  the purpose of 
ear stimulation in this study. The  device  is not approved for  this use by the US Food and 
Drug Administration,  and is being  used in this study as an  investigational  device.  This  
device has been studied in another  heart condition called atrial fibrillation  and was found 
to be safe and well  tolerated at the pulse levels  used in this  study.
How Many People  Will Take Part  In The Study?
About 26 people will take part in this study all at this location.
What Is  Involved In  The  Study?
You will receive  two separate, one hour  sessions,  at least one day  apart, of active and 
inactive TENS  stimulation.  The sequence of the sessions will be  randomized  
(active/inactive or inactive/active). Randomization means that you are put in  a group by 
chance, like the flip of a  coin. A computer program  at the study site will make  this 
random assignment.  You will  not know what group you are assigned to.  The  stimulation 
will be accomplished  by using a  TENS device  with a  special  ear clip electrode  which can 
attach easily to the  ear. During each visit, you will have an  echocardiogram and a  series 
of four, five-minute EKG  recordings that will be obtained every 15 minutes of

one hour to perform the  echocardiogram and  the series of EKG  recordings.   
How Long Will I Be In The Study?
Participation will last for two one-hour  sessions, at least one day apart.  
What Are The Risks of The Study? 
Use of the TENS device  for electrical  ear stimulation therapy may involve risks that are 
currently unforeseeable.  
TENS therapy  is very safe and  well tolerated when  used correctly. You  could experience 
some numbness, tingling or mild skin irritation at  the site of  application  on your ear.  
More significant  side effects like heart arrhythmias  are extremely  rare. 
Are There Benefits to  Taking Part in The Study?
If you agree  to take part in this study, there may or may not  be direct medical  benefit to 
you. We hope that the information  learned from this study will benefit other patients  with  
this disease  in the future.
What Other Options  Are There? 
You may choose  not to participate in the study.

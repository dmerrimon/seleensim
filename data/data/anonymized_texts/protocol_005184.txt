5.3.4  Overview of the investigational protocol  
The investigational protocol describes a study  designed to compare ultra -high resolution 
transrectal micro -ultrasound ( micro -US), and multi -parametric MRI (mpMRI).  These modalities 
are both used clinically to identify targets for prostate biopsy, however little data is available to compare their sens itivity.  While mpMRI is used clinically to identify targets for biopsy, it is not 
used for real -time biopsy guidance due to challenges performing the biopsy procedure within the 
MRI gantry.  Instead, targets identified on mpMRI are sampled during transrec tal ultrasound 
guided biopsy as part of the prostate biopsy procedure, often using software assisted fusion 
products.  For this investigation, the biopsy procedure will be guided by transrectal micro -US 
(current standard of care at Urology San Antonio), an d will include systematic (standard, random, 
extended sextant) plus image -guided prostate biopsies among men with clinical suspicion of 
prostate  cancer and an indication for prostate biopsy.  The FusionVu software -assisted fusion 
feature will be used to sample mpMRI targets .   
 This investigation furthers two cohort studies which demonstrate similar or superior sensitivity for 
micro -US over mpMRI from two centers in Europe.
1,2  This study will provide the first prospective 
blinded confirmation of these results.  
 
The ExactVu device in particular, and micro -US in general have been studied in a number of other 
investigations, including a pilot study perform ed at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 
in which differences between Ultra High Resolution (UHR) using ExactVu’s predecessor 
(ImagistxProstate) and Low Resolution (LR) transrectal ultrasound in their ability to detect 
cancerous foci in 25 patients were compared, along with safety and efficacy of this technology.3  
Two other previous studies have be en approved through WIRB, including protocol 20131849 
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 38 which provided the first randomized clinical trial on micro -US and WIRB protocol 20162036 which 
provided a small initial case series comparison of mpMRI and micro -ultrasound in the active 
surveillance p opulation.  Results from both studies were positive and have recently been 
presented.4,5 
 
Details about objectives of the investigation are described provided in section 5.7.1.  The 
investigational protocol was develo ped by Exact Imaging, in consultation with D r. Talley and Dr. 
White (Urology San Antonio),  and will be followed by the investigative team.  Exact Imaging  is 
responsible for the contents of the investigational protocol, and for monitoring the investigation.

5.4.2  Purpose of the device in the conte xt of the investigation  
For this investigation, ExactVu  will be used to perform the following tasks:  
• Using the high-resolution transducer , image the prostate and g uide a biopsy needle to 
physician -selected areas of the prostate  
• Using the FusionVu software feature to provide software -assisted fusion of mpMRI images 
to guide a biopsy needle to physician -selected areas of the prostate  
• Store images of the location where biopsy samples were taken  
• Provide tools to identify and measure regions of  interest  
 
It will be used for procedures with men between 40 and 79 years of age who are scheduled for a 
prostate biopsy.  
5.4.3  Materials that contact the patient  
The components of ExactVu  that will be in contact with tissues or body fluids include the sterile 
biopsy needle guide, and the biopsy needle.  
 
During use, the transducer will be covered in a conductive coupling gel and covered by a sterile 
transducer sheath , and therefore will not be in direct contact with the patient.  If the sheath were 
to be comprom ised during the procedure, then the transducer , biopsy needle guide and biopsy 
needle could contact tissues or body fluids.  
5.4.3.1  EV29L Transducer construction materials  
The materials used in the construction of the ExactVu  transducer are:  
• Rexolite by C -LEC Pla stics – a polystyrene microwave plastic used for the transducer lens  
• Epotek 301 – an epoxy used for gluing the housing sides together, and for gluing the lens 
to the housing  
• PEEK LSG provided by Quadrant – a life sciences grade plastic used to construct th e 
housing  
Each material has been tested on its own to meet applicable criteria of ISO 10993 -1 – Biological 
evaluation of medical devices . 
 
The transducer may contact tissues or body fluids only if the sterile transducer sheath  is 
compromised.   
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 38 5.4.3.2  Biopsy needle guide construction materials  
The biopsy needle guide for use with EV29L is manufactured for Exact Imaging by CIVCO .  CIVCO 
is responsibl e for the selection of materials for this needle guide and for ensuring that the guide 
complies with the applicable criteria of ISO 10993 – Biological evaluation of medical devices . 
 
CIVCO is also responsible for completing sterilization and packaging validation.  
5.4.3.3  Biopsy needle construction materials  
The biopsy needle will be an off -the-shelf product of gauge size 18, and selected by the 
investigator who will use it.  
5.4.3.4  Qualified Gels  
Exact Imaging  follows Health Canada and FDA’s recommendations for the use of sterile gels for 
invasive procedures that pass a device through tissue (i.e., in biopsy procedures).  
 
ExactVu  is designed to introduce no increased risk when compared to conventional ultrasound, 
and as such, Exact Imaging  accepts Urology San Antonio  may have approved institutional 
protocols that call for the use of non -sterile gel for transrectal biopsy procedures.   
 Where non -sterile ultrasound gel is used, investigators must take steps to ensure that the 
product being used is not contaminated, and the container must be sealed appropriately when not 
in use.  Gels whose packaging indicates that they are to be used for external procedures only 
must not be used.  Where non -sterile ultras ound gel is used, Exact Imaging  recommends the use 
of single -dose gels.  
5.4.3.5  Sterile t ransducer sheath  
Sterile transducer sheaths  will be used for imaging procedures .  For biopsy procedures using the 
EV29L transducer, off-the-shelf sterile transducer sheaths  will be supplied by Exact Imaging . 
5.4.3.6  Transducer reprocessing  
Investigators will be provided with instructions for cleaning the ExactVu  system and the high -level 
disinfection of applicable components.  These instructions meet the applicable  criteria of FDA 
guidance documents regarding diagnostic ultrasound marketing/licensing . 
 
The instructions can be found in the document : 
• Care, Cleaning  and Use Guide for EV29L™ High Resolution Transrectal Side -fire Transducer  
5.4.4  Instructions for use  
Instructions for use for ExactVu  and its accessories are provided in ExactVu labeling, as identified 
in section 5.8.4.2.  
 
Information describing the workflow for this this clinical investigation can be found in th is CIP, 
which will be provided to investigators.  
5.4.5  Training requirements  
ExactVu  is intended for  use by qualified physicians and radiologists .  Its use does not require any 
additional training in medical procedures or principles of ultrasound technology.

received training in the PI -RADS v2 protocol.  Evidence of this training is to be provided by 
Urology San Antonio and their radiology partners.  
5.4.6  Medical procedures  
Medical procedures to be performed in the study consist of subject preparatio n, imaging and 
prostate biopsy . The procedure will be the same for all subjects.  
 
Prior to consent and biopsy, the subject will have been imaged using mpMRI according to the PI -
RADS v2 protocol, per the inclusion criteria  and standard of care .  The radiologist ’s report must 
be completed before the biopsy procedure.  
 The detailed procedure is as follows:  
1. Screening and consent visit  
2. Biopsy visit:  
a. Operator 1 (blinded to mpMRI images and report)  
i. Administer IV sedation per site standard of care  
ii. Scan with EV29L micro -ultrasound transducer (ExactVu system)  
iii. Save sweep of prostate  
iv. Record any suspicious regions (PRI -MUS 3+)  
v. Measure prostate volume ( optional)  
vi. Targeted biopsy samples (from micro -ultrasound)  
1. Samples from each target ed lesion will be placed in a separate 
labeled jar to ensure they can be independently discussed on the 
pathology report  
vii. Systematic biopsy samples (fill in up to 12 samples)  
b. Operator 2 (unblinded to mpMRI images and report)  
i. Align labeled mpMRI sequences wi th ultrasound using FusionVu software  
ii. Save a full sagittal sweep through the prostate with mpMRI guidance active  
for retrospective evaluation  
iii. Targeted biopsy samples ( using  mpMRI  guidance ) 
1. Samples from each targeted lesion will be placed in a separate 
labeled jar to ensure they can be independently discussed on the 
pathology report

The biopsy  procedure takes approximately 30 minutes. The subject  is not required to come for 
additional clini c visits in the context of the study.   
 
Biopsy results will be provided to the subject’s  physician as per standard of care.  Further 
healthcare decisions and follow -up are outside the scope of this study.  The subject’s  participation 
in the study is completed following the prostate biopsy.  
5.5 Justification for the Design  
Conventional -ultrasound  guided prostate biopsies are the most common clinical procedure used 
for detection of prostate cancer.   This technique involves sampling each sextant area of the 
prostate with one or more needles, with attention to sampling any suspicious hypoechoic lesions 
in these or other areas of the prostate.  
 However, conventional -ultrasound  does not reliably image cancerous lesions within the prostate, 
and at least 75% of the time identifies no abnormalities consistent with cancer even in men known t o have prostate cancer.  Instead, conventional -ultrasound  is generally simply used to 
identify the prostate and help guide systematic 12 -core biopsies for the detection of prostate 
cancer and for the monitoring of prostate cancer in men on active surveilla nce. The inability to 
accurately image prostate cancer results in numerous unnecessary biopsies which have 
associated patient morbidity and increased health care costs
6.   
 Improvements in prostate cancer imaging are clearly needed.  
 mpMRI has been suggested as a means to improve prostate cancer imaging, however this 
modality may not p rovide adequate visualization of small lesions  due to the poor resolution of 
mpMRI .  Further, a specialized radiologist is required to interpret the imaging and real -time 
image -guidance is not possible.  For these reasons, an office -based real -time imaging  solution 
would be preferred.  
 
micro -US uses high frequencies (2 9 MHz) to improve resolution of prostate ultrasound images , 
and provides a protocol for assessing risk in these images known as PRI-MUS
TM (Prostate Risk 
Identification using Micro-Ultrasound)7. Using this technology, the predecessor  of ExactVu  was 
recently demonstrated by a team at Johns Hopkins  Medical to have improved ability to image 
cancerous foci over conventional -ultrasound , and to have potential improved efficacy in 
identifying higher grade tumors3.  More recent studies have extended these findings, by providing 
further evidence of the superiority of micro -US to conventional -ultrasound4 and preliminary 
evidence that micro -US may provide similar improvements to mpMRI.1,2,5 
 
The proposed study will allow direct imaging comparison within the same patient between mpMRI 
and micro -US to directly compare the sensitivities of these two modalities to prostate cancer . 
5.5.1  Evaluation of pre -clinical data  
Exact Imaging  has not performed pre -clinical testing using animals using the current version of 
ExactVu .  Tests using animals were performed prior to the pilot study described in section 
5.5.2.1, using previous generations of the technology used in ExactVu, however these studies 
were not conducted by Exact Imaging .   
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 38 5.5.2  Clinical evaluation  
5.5.2.1  Previous clinical experience :  Johns Hopkins Pilot Study  
Johns Hopkins Urology  conducted a small scale clinical tri al in 2011/2012 using the previous 
generation  of the technology used to design and manufacture ExactVu.  This trial was conducted 
to compare the differences between Ultra High Resolution (UHR) and Low Resolution (LR) 
transrectal ultrasound in their ability to detect cancerous foci in 20 patients.  
 
Patients were imaged pre -operatively with both micro -US and LR -TRUS. Areas of altered 
echogenicity ≥ 5mm on sagittal views were identified by a radiologist with an expertise in 
ultrasound blinded to pathology results. Actual areas of prostate cancer ≥5mm i dentified at 
sagittally-sectioned RP specimen were correlated to abnormal foci on both imaging modalities. 
Sensitivity and specificity analysis were performed for each imaging modality. A total of 56 
cancerous foci were pathologically identified. micro -US was superior to LR -TRUS in the 
identification of these foci (p = 0.01).  
 The results of this pilot trial showed significant increases in Sensitivity (56.5%), Specificity 
(21.1%) and PPV (predictive positive value) (42.0%) with ExactVu  versus conventional low 
resolution ultrasound.  
 Results of the study were published in Urologic Oncology
3. 
5.5.2.2  Previous clinical experience:  Multi -Center trial of high -resolution 
transrectal ultrasound versus standard low -resolution transrectal 
ultrasound for the identification of clinically significant prostate cancer 
(2013- UHR-002)  
Exact Imaging recently conduct ed a large scale c linical trial (beginning in 2013, 2000 patients , 
under WIRB Protocol 20131849) to demonstrate that micro -US is superior to conventional LR -
TRUS in guiding prostate biopsies (systematic and targeted) among men without known prostate 
cancer and with an indic ation for prostate biopsy . 
 
Results from this trial have been analyzed and support the value of micro -US and the PRI -MUS 
protcol4.  Number and grade of  adverse events  between the micro -US and conventional 
ultrasound arms of the trial were identical (3 each) .  2 of the three events in the micro -US arm 
were cases of post -biopsy bacte remia, suggesting a rate of 0.4% which is well within published 
rates for this procedure.  The third adverse event in the ExactVu arm was a patient who 
presented at the emergency room complaining of fever.  No fever was detected on admission, no 
elevation in white blood cell count or growth in culture was found.  The patient was discharged 
the following day with a prolonged course of antibiotics despite the lack of evidence of infection.  
All adverse events were anticipated events . 
 
5.5.2.3  Previous clinical experi ence: Urology of Virginia Case Series (UHR -
2016- 001)  
A small 9 -subject case series was performed under WIRB protocol 20162036  to provide guidance 
to clinical users on the appearance of mpMRI lesions visualized with micro -ultrasound.  Results 
from this stud y were first presented at the EAU 2018 meeting and have recently been accepted 
for publication in the Canadian Urological Association Journal.5,8 
 
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 38 This small series demonstrated superior sensitivity by micro -US (89% vs  56% for mpMRI) , 
particularly against relatively inexperienced mpMRI reviewers  and for small Gleason Sum 7 
lesions .  Both micro -US and mpMRI provided superior targeting sensitivity compared to 
conventional ultrasound (p=0.02).  mpMRI lesions were retrospec tively visible under micro -US, 
making it easier to perform accurate targeted biopsy.  
5.5.2.4  Previous clinical experience: Reports in the literature from cohort 
studies  
Cohort studies are available from two European centers demonstrating promising detection rates 
and sensitivity relative to mpMRI.  Astobieta et al.1 reported on 41 consecutive subjects biopsied 
using the ExactVu micro -ultrasound system with available mpMRI studies for comparison and 
targeted biopsy.  mpMRI correctly predicted 28/41 subjects with clinically significant prostate cancer (68% sensitivity)  while micro -ultrasound predicted 40/41 (98% sensitivity).  This 
improvement in sensitivity was significant with p<0.001.  
 Similarly, Lughezzani et al
2 reported on their first 60 subjects with both mpMRI targets and 
micro -ultrasound guided biopsy as part of their prospectively maintained pro state biopsy 
database.  In this dataset, in which all subjects had positive mpMRI, sensitivity and negative 
predictive value of micro -ultrasound were 83% and 80% respectively, while the sensitivity of 
mpMRI was similar at 85%.  
5.5.2.5  Literature review  
A critical literature review was performed to establishing incidence, prevalence and cancer 
detection rate s, as further justification for the design of the proposed investigation.  The 
conclusions for the evaluation are presented in section 5.20.  (Note that bibliographic references 
specific to the literature review are also presented in section 5.20.) 
5.6 Risks and Benefits  
5.6.1  Device risk analysis and management  
The Risk Management Plan for ExactVu  and the related hazard analysis was conducted in 
accordance with ISO 14971 and with reference to Exact Imaging ’s quality system procedures.   
5.6.2  Risks associated with participation in the clinical investigation  
There are no known risks in the use of ultrasound as it will be used in this investigation.  There 
may be slight discomfort caused by the ultrasound probe inserted in a subject’s  rectum, as in a 
standard biopsy procedure.  
 
There are some known risks and di scomforts associated with a biopsy procedure, however no new 
risks are introduced by participating in this trial, nor by the use of ExactVu , and known risks are 
not increased.  
 
Known risks and discomforts associated with biopsy of the prostate include:  
• Pain in the biopsy area (rectum area)  
• Sudden , complete inability to urinate  
• Dysuria (difficulty with urination)  
• Urinary tract infection (UTI)  
• Prostatitis (infection of the prostate)  
• Sepsis (severe whole body infection)  
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 38 • Hematospermia (blood in the semen or eja culation fluid)  
• Hematuria (blood in the urine)  
• Hematochezia (blood in the stool)  
• Allergic reaction to lidocaine  
 
There are also known risks and discomforts associated with the MRI procedure, however no new 
risks are introduced by participating in this trial, and these known risks are not increased.   The 
subjects included in the research will have already received mpMRI as standard of care before 
enrollment.  Known risks and discomforts associated with mpMRI include:  
• Allergic reaction to contrast agent ( gadolinium chelate)  
• Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis due to contrast agent (gadolinium chelate)  
• Anxiety due to the confined space  
• Tissue burns or damage due to undisclosed presence of metallic implant  
5.6.3  Possible interactions with concomitant medical treatments  
No new interactions with concomitant medical treatments are anticipated related to the use of 
ExactVu .  ExactVu  is already intended and cleared by FDA to perform the prostate biopsy 
procedure clinically .  ExactVu is designed to introduce no increased risk when compared to 
conventional ultrasound .  An enrolled study subject has already been scheduled for prostate 
biopsy by his physician.  
5.7 Objectives and Hypothesis  
5.7.1  Objectives  
Primary Outcome: Comparison of subject -level detection rate of clinically significant cancer 
(csPCa, defined as ISUP 2 or higher) between micro -ultrasound targeted biopsy  and mpMRI 
targeted biopsy .  
 
Secondary (unpowered) Outcomes:   
• Compare lesion size and shape between mpMRI and micro -ultrasound (follow -up with 
detailed whole -mount pathology when available)  
• Compare detailed pathological findings (cribiform structure, density of cancer, subtype of 
cancer) with imaging findings in both modalities  
• Identify percentage of micro -ultrasound lesions (with positive biopsy result) that ca n be 
identified retrospectively using mpMRI (requires retrospective re -reading of mpMRI 
sequences given list of micro -ultrasound targets)  
• Identify percentage of mpMRI lesions (with positive biopsy result) that can be identified 
retrospectively using micro -ultrasound (requires retrospective re -reading of micro -
ultrasound sweeps given list of mpMRI targets)  
5.7.2  Hypothesis  
Primary Hypothesis : Micro -ultrasound provides non -inferior (10% margin) sensitivity to detect 
csPCa using targeted samples compared to mpMRI.  
 
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 38 5.7.3  Claims  
There are no claims related to the intended performance of the system that are to be verified in 
the analysis related to this investigation, aside from those related to the objectives . 
5.7.4  Risks  
There are no risks or for eseeable adverse  device effects t hat are to be assessed  in the 
investigation . 
5.8 Design of the Clinical Investigation  
All subjects will receive standard routine care (i.e., prostate biopsy) per standard indications, 
using transrectal ultrasound guidance. Micro -US can reliably image the perip heral zone of the 
prostate.  This is done in a transr ectal approach, as is conventional ultrasound .  
5.8.1  General  
5.8.1.1  Type of clinical investigation  
The investigation  is a study where all subjects have  an indication for prostate biopsy.  This will 
allow the most general assessment of the study’s main objective which is comparing the imaging 
quality of micro -US with mpMRI .  Each subject will act as their own control in order to make the 
resulting images a s comparable as possible.  This multiple -imaging design also reduces the 
number of subjects needed without substantially increasing risk, subject discomfort, or procedure 
time.  
5.8.1.2  Avoiding bias  
The mpMRI report will be blinded from Operator 1 performing the m icro-ultrasound targeted and 
systematic biopsies, to avoid biasing identification of suspicious regions on micro -US.  Operator 2 
will have full knowledge of the mpMRI report and images, but will not observe the micro -
ultrasound targeting portion of the pro cedure or see the resulting target locations.  Separate 
operators will complete the two phases of the procedure to avoid bias from the micro -ultrasound 
targets interfering with biopsy site selection for mpMRI targets.  
5.8.1.3  Endpoints  
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in each 
subject .  The per -subject presence of cancer will be determined based on a positive biopsy from 
any sample, targeted or systematic.  Patient -level sensitivity for a given imaging modality will be 
determined through systematic biopsy results plus targeted samples taken using only that 
modality. In this way we approximate clinical reality of using a given modality for systematic plus 
targeted biopsy.  
 
Secondary endpoint s 
Sensitivity of targeted -only samples for each modality will also be calculated  in order to 
determine the effectiveness of a targeted only biopsy technique in each case.  Presence of cancer 
per-target will also be assessed, along with detailed pathological findings, and targeting modality 
identifying the lesion.  Size and shape of lesions will also be recorded from recorded images.  
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 38 5.8.1.4  Variables  
The sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve for accurate identification of clinically 
significant prostate cancer for each modality will be determined, along with the corresponding 
credible intervals . Summary statistics will be provided for all modalities.  
 Biopsy results may fall into 4 categories based on pathology review:  
 
1. Clinically significant cancer (GS > 6 )  
2. Clinically insignificant cancer (GS = 6 ) 
3. Cancer precursors (HGPIN, Atypia)  
4. Benign (including findings of Prostatitis)  
 
Distribution of findings for all categories, and comparison of these distributions between 
modalities will also be reported.  
5.8.1.5  Assessing variables 
The analysis to be performed on data collected during the investigation will be done on software customized and validated by Exact Imaging.  This software will be maintained as per Exact 
Imaging’s internal operating procedures .  The software will not be ‘calibrated’ other than if there 
are instances where the software does not perform as required against unusual or exceptional data. 
 
A third -party statistician will be contracted to independently confirm all results.  
5.8.1.6  Replacing subjects  
Case data for all enrolled study subjects will be included in the analyses.  Because a subject’s 
involvement ends following his biopsy procedure, and because it is not expected that a subject 
will drop -out after his biopsy procedure, the  need to replace subjects is expected to be unlikely.  
 
If a subject needs to be replaced, he will be consented as per processes described for all study 
subjects.  
5.8.2  Medical  devices and comparators  
The ExactVu micro -ultrasound system with high -frequency EV29L transducer will be used.  The 
FusionVu software package will be used for software assistance during mpMRI -US fusion.  This 
device, including all software and hardware components are cleared by FDA for the prostate 
biopsy and mpMRI fusion biopsy procedure in the United States.  
5.8.3  Subjects  
5.8.3.1  Inclusion criteria for subject selection 
Subjects will be recruited to participate in the investigation as follows:  
1. Men presenting for prostate biopsy due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer  
2. 40-75 years old  
3. Available mpMRI images and report, performed according to the PI -RADS v2 standard  
 
Patients who choose not to particip ate will be offered a standard of care  prosta te biopsy.  No 
patient will be denied appropriate medical care based on their willingness to participate in this 
trial.

Exact Imaging  to assess compliance  with the CIP and required procedures.  
 
For cases in which the Study Monitor observe s biopsy procedures during a site visit , the Study 
Monitor shall neither perform medical procedures nor contact the study subject, but will provide 
support through instruct ion where required.  
5.8.6  Case Report Forms  
The case report form to be used in this investigation is designed to collect information about the 
location of the prostate where biopsy samples were taken, to provide  a summary of findings from 
the pathology report entered locally, along with other notes from investigators.  
 Source data will be recorded on case report forms (CRFs) as follows:  
• For each of the 12 systematic biopsy sample s, investigators  will indicate the PRI-MUS 
score  for micro -US.  (For every biopsy sample, an image of the biopsy location will be 
saved on ExactVu  as well .) 
• For each additional targeted biopsy sample, investigator will indicate the location and the 
PRI-MUS score  for micro -US.  (For every b iopsy sample, an image of the biopsy location 
will be saved on ExactVu.) 
• Pathology report will be entered on the CRF and a copy attached to the CRF.  This is 
checked for accuracy by the Principal Investigator . 
• mpMRI report will be entered on the CRF and a copy attached to the CRF.  This is checked 
for accuracy by the Principal Investigator.  
 
Note that the PRI -MUS protocol used here is derived from Ghai et al.
7.  This protocol for assessing 
risk in the micro -US images is investigational and has not been evaluated by the FDA.   
  
Along with the data accuracy checks listed above, Exact Imaging  will also check data prior to and 
during analysis  as follows:  
• Check pathology reports against what is entered on the CRF  
• Logic checks on data, and follow -up on unusual data.  (For example, if there is a case in 
which biopsy samples from targeted needles don't indicate cancer and sample s from 
systematic  needles do show cancer, an investigation would follow.)  
 
Analysis of data is described in the subsections of section 5.9. 
 
The case report form to be used in this investigation is controlled as per Exact Imaging ’s standard 
operating procedures .    
5.8.7  Identity of study subjects  
At all times throughout the clinical investigation confidentiality shall be observed by all parties 
involved. A ll data shall be secured against unauthorized access.  Privacy and confidentiality of 
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 38 information about each subject shall be preserved in the reports and any publication of the 
clinical investigation data.   
 
It is the responsibility of the Study Coordinator to maintain the privacy of the subject in the 
throughout the investigation.  The Study Coordinator will make a subject’s personal information 
available to the Study Monitor appointed by Exact Imaging , shoul d it be required for monitoring, 
auditing or inspection by Western IRB  if applicable.  
 
It is the responsibility of the Study Coordinator (or designate) to de-identify subjects, and provide 
the resulting subject identifier to those involved with the analysis of the case data.   This subject 
identifier will be recorded on CRFs, on ExactVu , and on pathology records.  Lists of subjects' 
names and identifying info rmation will be maintained separately from case report forms , and will 
be accessible to the Study Coordinator (or Urology San Antonio  designate) . 
 
Similar de -identification will be applied to any DICOM imaging files that may exist for a subject 
and that may be used by to analyze case data.

will be identified alphanumerically and sequentially, using USA-EV-
0001, USA-EV-0002, etc.  
 
5.9 Statistical considerations  
5.9.1  Statistical design, method and analytical procedures  
Case data will be analyzed by an independent third -party biostatistician  using a statistical 
modeling software tool (PASS or MATLAB) .  
 
The primary endpoint is the relative detection rate (sensitivity) between mpMRI and micro -
ultrasound for significant prostate cancer at a subject level.  Power is based on the sensitivity of 
the test.  Prevalence is assumed to be 60%. 
H0: Sensitivity of micro -ultrasound/Sensitivity of mpMRI ≤ δ = 0.76 
H1: Sensitivity of micro -ultrasound/Sensitivity of mpMRI > δ = 0.76 
where δ was based on results of comparing mpMRI to TRUS as noted below.  
Specificity wi ll be similarly tested.  That is:  
H0: Specificity of micro -ultrasound/ Specificity of mpMRI ≤ δ = 0.67 
H1: Specificity of micro -ultrasound/ Specificity of mpMRI > δ = 0.67 
These analyses will be conducted at the subject level.  
 
Non-inferiority Margin, δ 
In the PROMIS study11, the most recent confirmatory study of mpMRI to TRUS, mpMRI showed 
improvement in sensitivity of MP -MRI to TRUS from 0.93 to 0.48, respectively,  with a test ratio of 
0.52 (95% CI: 0.45- 0.60) using McNemar’s test. In order to preserve the effect of mpMRI versus 
TRUS as seen in this study, the non -inferiority margin for the test ratio of 0. 76 (24%) was chosen 
as being equal to 50% of the effect from  the point estimate of 0.52  to a ratio of unity (equal 
sensitivity).  Then, the lower bound of the test ratio must not exceed 0. 76 in order for non -
inferiority to be declared in the current trial, thus preserving at least 50% of the effect of mpMRI 
versus TRUS.  McNemar’s test will be used to establish the (1 -α) confidence interval for the test 
ratio.  
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 38 Specificity from the same study was lower on mpMRI than TRUS with a test ratio of 2.34 (2. 08–
2.68).  In the prostate biopsy procedure, since sampling is required regardless of imaging 
outcome (systematic sampling), specificity is less important.  Still, we would like to preserve a 
reasonable specificity similar to mpMRI, therefore we select a non -inferiority margin of 0.67, or 
not more than 50% worse than the existing difference between mpMRI and TRUS  (2.34*1.5 ratio 
to TRUS, 1/1.5=0.67 ratio to mpMRI) .   
 Details of the design are presented in section 5.8.1.   
5.9.2  Sample size  
The trial will include  120 subjects.  It is not anticipated that additional subjects will be required , 
however if a subject drops out before the biopsy procedure they may be replaced as described in 
section 5.8.1.6.  
5.9.3  Level of significance and power of the clinical investigation  
Assuming a  micro ultrasound sensitivity of 0.85 and mpMRI performs at a n expected 0. 90 
sensitivity, then 120 subjects would be required to provide 80% p ower to reject the null 
hypothesis, assuming 80% agreement between the methods.   
 PASS and MATLAB software w ere used for sample size calculations.   
5.9.4  Expected drop-out rates  
Factors affecting possible drop -out rates include the option to withdraw participation at any time .  
 
It is anticipated that a subject’s inclination to withdraw at procedure -time will be minimal, as 
prostate biopsy is indicated regardless of the assigned imaging modality.  
 
5.9.5  Pass/fail criteria  
The primary outcome of the study will fail if micro -ultrasound targeted biopsy fails to identify 
cancer in significantly more subjects than mpMRI  targeted biopsy .  This will be quantified by 
testing against the lower one -sided 95% confidence interval bound  of the ratio of the two 
sensitivities , which must not be less than 76%. 
5.9.6  Provision for an interim analysis  
There are no plans for interim analysis during this clinical trial . 
5.9.6  Criteria for the termination of the clinical investigation  
There are no pla ns to stop the investigation early due to either e arly success or early futility . 
 
The investigation will be terminated if Exact Imaging  withdraws financial support for this study.  
In this case, Exact Imaging  shall promptly inform the Principal Investigator of the termination or 
suspension and the reason(s) for this.  
 If the investigation is terminated early, no follow -up with subjects is required, since the standard 
of care for patients anticipating prostate biopsy is not affected by early termination.

Where the a nalysis of case data does not handle unexpected data, Exact Imaging  will establish a 
strategy to modify the analysis algorithm and apply it  to all data.  Such modifications will include 
validation of the algorithm prior to its acceptance for use.  
 
These modifications  will be updated and described in the CIP, and/or as in the final report (as 
appropriate)  along with justification for the m. 
5.9.8  Specification of subgroups for analysis  
All analyses will be conducted on all enrolled and completed subjects.  These analyses will also be 
repeated on the “As Intended” population, which includes only subjects for which there were no 
major protocol deviat ions. 
 
A low risk sub -population is pre -specified for analysis.  This population includes men meeting all 
of the following criteria:  
1. PSA < 20ng/ml  
2. PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cc  
3. Negative DRE  
 
5.9.9  Procedures that take into account all data  
Statistical analyses around st udy endpoints will not include data for subjects who are withdrawn 
(before or after their biopsy) or for whom the collected study data is incomplete.  
5.9.10  Treatment of missing, unused data  
If a study subject withdraws from the main trial prior to having his biopsy, his consent form will 
be retained, and the reason for exclusion of the data will be handwritten on the form as 
“withdrawn prior to biopsy”.  Similarly, if a study subject withdraws from the main trial following 
his biopsy, his consent form and CRF w ill be retained, and both will be marked “withdrawn 
following biopsy”.  
 
This will allow data to be collected about the number of patients that withdrew from the 
investigation prior to the biopsy procedure, and the number that withdrew after the procedure.  
 The same process will be applied to any circumstance of incomplete or incorrect data, with an 
indicator handwritten on his consent form and CRF to provide information about why the record is 
not used for analysis.  
5.9.11  Exclusion of data  
Conditions that would result in the exclusion of data would be if any data verification  activity 
showed that data was recorded on the CRF incorrectly, or if the pathology report showed any 
inconsistency with information on the CRF.  
 
If such incorrect data was discovered, data f or this subject will not be included in any analysis, 
and the CRF for the subject will be marked to indicate that the data is excluded.

5.20  Critical Literature Review  
(Literature reviewed June 2 6 2018) 
 
Introduction  
The current standard of care for detection and monitoring of prostate cancer is the transrectal 
ultrasound -guided biopsy (TRUS)12. This procedure is typically performed with a standard low -
resolution ultrasound system (LR -TRUS), which does not reliably image cancerous lesions within 
the prostate.  62%  of the time, no abnormalities are found using LR -TRUS imaging even in men 
with biopsy -confirmed prostate cancer3. This large percentage of lesions which are not visible 
during traditional LR -TRUS procedures require most protocols to use the modality only to 
visualize the prostate and guide systematic 12 -core biopsies, although biopsies are targeted when 
a lesion is visible.  Current research suggests that a large number of cancers are missed due to 
this mostly non -targeted, systematic approach13,14. Improving visualization of cancerous lesions 
during biopsy would improve detection rates, reduce the need for repeat biopsy, and potentially allow active surveillance pr otocols to follow tumors visually, rather than with periodic biopsy.  
 Ultra-high resolution TRUS ( micro -US) utilizes higher frequencies (21MHz) tha n LR-TRUS in order 
to improve the resolution of prostate images.  This has been demonstrated to improve sensitivity 
to detect cance r during the biopsy procedure
1–4,7,8.  A recent study by our group demonstrated an 
improvement over LR -TRUS in the ability to image cancerous foci, particularly for higher grade 
tumors3.  These results have been supported by additional work in a screening population, 
leading to the development of the PRI -MUS risk identifi cation protocol7.  This study will attempt to 
further these results by providing a blinded comparison of micro -US and mpMR I in men 
undergoing prostate biopsy .  The ability to visualize the cancerous foci in these subjects would be 
of significant value to increase confidence in the event of a negative biopsy result and help guide 
selection of therapy in the event of insignificant or localized disease . 
 
Methodology  
General  
The PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar databases will be used to identify relevant literature.  Further literature will be identified from the references in these studies. Search terms will include:  
 
Prostate C ancer, Clinically Significant, Epstein Criteria, Confirmatory  Biopsy, Serial Biospy, Active 
Surveillance Biopsy , Neoplasm Grading, Adenocarcinoma/Classification, Prostatic 
Neoplasms/Classification, High Grade, Ultra High Resolution Ultrasound, High Frequency 
Ultrasound, High Resolution Ultrasound  
 
Objective  
This review will attempt to cover the pre -clinical and clinical support for further clinical study of 
the micro -US technique, as well as provide justification for study enrollment numbers.  Study 
risks will also be discussed.  
 
Selection criteria for documents  
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 38 All relevant data from studies with similar procedure, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
included.  Studies involving similar ultra -high resolution ultrasound devices will be included, as 
well as those using standard low resolution ultrasound.  Wher e the results are still relevant to the 
review, deviations in procedure or inclusion will be discussed for each study or group of studies.    
 
Critical evaluation of literature  
Device description  
The micro -US device is the next generation of the one  used d uring our group’s previous study2.  
This new commercial version of the device has received marketing clearance in the United States 
from the FDA.  The intended use of the device is to visualize the prostate in order to guide the 
TRUS biopsy.  Other than th e higher resolution, this is equivalent to a standard ultrasound device 
of the type commonly used to guide TRUS procedures and that represents the current standard of care.   
 
The micro -US device provides a high -resolution image of the prostate, with a fie ld of view that 
includes the entire prostate (subject to the size constraints in the screening  exclusion criteria).  
More detail on the device itself and safety tests conducted in order to comply with IEC medical 
device standards is identified in this CIP.  
 
Analysis of selected literature  
There is significant literature demonstrating the use of high -frequency ultrasound for in vivo 
visualization of both healthy and cancerous tissue.  Much of this literature is in the form of pre -
clinical animal models
5, but the device was also used in a previous clinical trial at Johns Hopkins 
University2.  This previous clinical trial from our group demonstrated improved visualization of 
cancerous foci by micro -US compared to LR -TRUS with superiority in both sensitivity and  
specificity when compared to pathological findings on radical prostatectomy2.  This work has been 
published in a highly regarded international peer -reviewed journal. Another clinical trial has 
recently completed , run by our group ( WIRB Protocol 20131849) .  Data from the first half of this 
trial was used to develop the PRI -MUS risk identification protocol7.  This large, randomized clinical 
trial was designed to demonstrate improved cancer detection rates in men without a known 
history of prostate cancer (a screening population of 2000 men). The results of this trial are now 
available, and suggest significan tly improved sensitivity over conventional ultrasound.4  Safety 
information, including from this previous trial, is reported elsewhere in this CIP.  Th e proposed 
study aims to compare  the micro -US technology with another imaging technology that has been 
demonstrated to provide high sensitivity to prostate cancer . 
 
Enrollment numbers for the micro -US study were calculated by the sponsor  based on the 
following review of the literature.  Factors affecting required enrollment include the ability of 
mpMRI  and micro -US to target prostate cancer, and the number of subjects  with cancer in this 
population.  
 Two recent studies were found that investigated rates of successfully targeting prostate ca ncer 
with greyscale LR -TRUS using biopsy as the reference standard, all other studies were pre -1990 
and are considered less relevant due to substantial improvements in imaging technology.  These 
studies vary considerably in the aggressiveness of their targ eting, with Barish et al.
15 
demonstrating a se nsitivity of 40% (specificity 80%, N=544) and Nelson et al.16 a sensitivity of 
only 26% (specificity 89%, N=137).  Weighted average sensitivity and specificity are 37.2% and 
81.8% respectively.  This sensitivity value  is very close to that found during our pilot study3 
against the more accurate radical prostatectomy (RP)  reference (37.7%), however the specificity 
value in that study was much lower (65.4%).  This may be due to the low N=25 of that study, or the greater accuracy of the RP reference.  If micro -US provides a more accurate biopsy reference 
(closer to RP), we m ay expect a specificity between 81.8% and 65.4%.   The PROMIS trial
17 did 
not test targeted biopsy on LR -TRUS, but did report the sensitivity of systematic biopsy using LR -
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- 001  Revision 1.2 
Exact Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 38 TRUS to detect prostate cancer.  This value is reported as 48%, which demonstrates the value o f 
the additional systematic biopsy cores due to the poor sensitivity of targeted only sampling using 
this modality. This higher value will be used to define the non- inferiority threshold, in order to be 
as rigorous as possible.  
 
The PROMIS trial17,18 provides the highest quality evidence of prevalence in this population, using 
template mapping biopsy to demonstrate clinically significant cancer in 308/572 subjects (54%).   
This is a reasonable value given other meta -analyses demonstrating detection rates from 24% -
87% in the literature19–21. 
 Sensitivity of mpMRI has varied widely in the literature as demonstrated by numerous meta -
analyses
19,21,22, showing detection rates ranging from 24% -87%.  The PROMIS trial17 found a 
sensitivity of 88% for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer, but did not perform targeted 
biops y.  Therefore, this value could be seen as a maximum possible when perfect targeting and 
histopathology is assumed.  In cases with targeted biopsy, such as the PRECISION trial23, mpMRI 
detected significant cancer in 38% of the arm vs. 26% in th e systematic biopsy arm.  Assuming a 
similar 54% incidence this amounts to sensitivities of 70% and 48% respectively which compare 
well with our own feasibility cohorts demonstrating sensitivities of 56 -85% for mpMRI1,2,8 and 
previously discussed sensitivity data for systematic biopsy.  
 
Sensitivity data on micro- US is available from 2 cohort studies and 1 rando mized trial.  These 
three datasets suggest sensitivities of 83% (N=60)2, 98% (N=79)1, and 61% (N=286)4 for a 
weighted average of 71%.  While this average is biased towards the earlier data from the 
randomized trial, this study was conducted on an early version of the device with little training on 
the PRI -MUS ris k identification protocol, therefore we expect this to underestimate the true 
sensitivity of the micro -US modality.  
 Given an incidence of approximately 50% with sensitivities of mpMRI and Micro -US of 
approximately 66% and 75% respectively, 108 subjects a re required to provide 80% confidence 
of achieving non -inferiority within 20%.  This non -inferiority bound was chosen to maintain at 
least 50% of the benefit of mpMRI over conventional systematic biopsy providing a sensitivity of 
approximately 48%.  
 
Evalua tion of hazards, risks and safety measures  
The risks associated with the TRUS biopsy procedure are well captured in the literature, and 
represent the normal standard -of-care for subjects with the inclusion criteria of this study
6,24– 27.  
Data from our previous study , and preliminary data from our ongoing clinical trial,  suggest that 
these risks are not significantly altered due to the micro -US probe3.  Risk minimization will follow 
the same standard -of-care procedures as LR -TRUS, including antibiotic prophylaxis and 
management of bleeding risk6,24– 27. 
Risks associated with study data collection will be managed by the Study Monitor, as described in this CIP.  
 Statistical and weighting methods  
All clinical studies were weighted based on enrollment numbers, unless otherwise stated or 
specifically excluded for differences in protocol or enrollment. Care was taken to identify studies with patients drawn from the same population which would not be i ndependent.  
 
Conclusions  
micro -US is a promising modality for visualizing cancer in TRUS -guided biopsy procedures. A 
multiple -imaging case series  allows for direct comparison between modalities  and maintains 
standard -of-care for all patients with little or no additional risk.  Enrolment numbers are 
reasonable and  consistent with other human studies in this area.

STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    1. Introduction  and Purpose  
1.1 Purpose  
This single -center,  clinical  trial consists  of a one autologous  fat grafting  treatment  followed  by 3-
month  and 6-month  post-treatment  visits  in order  to assess  the efficacy  of fat grafting  when  used 
by men and women  with facial  acne scars.  
 
1.2 Primary  Objectives  
Objective  1:  To assess  the efficacy  and tolerability  of the autologous  fat grafting  when  used on 
men and women  with acne scars  on the face.   Overall  assessment  of clinical  outcome  and safety  
will be based  on clinic  visits,  Mirapex  imaging,  VISIA  measurements,  and clinical  evaluation  of 
pre- and post-treatment  photos.   The subject’s  assessment  of satisfaction  will also be verbally  
evaluated  at each follow -up period.   Finally,  both the clinician’s  and subject’s  assessment  will be 
characterized  using  a clinician  assessme nt scale  at the 3-month s and 6-month  post-treatment  
visits.   
  
Standard, close -up, 3D, cross -polarized, and/or UV light photography will be utilized for 
evaluation for improvement in skin tone, texture, pore size, actinic sun damage, porphyrins, and/or 
skin age.  High -resolution ultrasound (HRUS) will be utilized for assessment of skin thickness and 
density. Transepidermal water loss measurements will be used to evaluate barrier function of the 
skin epidermal layer to determine progress of epidermal healing after treatment. Optical coherence 
tomography will be used to noninvasively gather topographical and histologic images of pre - and 
post-treated skin. The BTC 2000 will be used to measure skin laxity, viscoelastic deformation, 
stiffness, energy absorption, elasticity, and deformation values of skin. Microscopic biopsies will 
also be collected pre - and post - treatment to correlated changes between skin measurements and 
histological changes and gene expression. The relationship between these modalities will pr ovide 
a multifaceted assessment to gauge improvement in skin tone, texture, and pore size.   
 
1. Background  
Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory condition that can result in permanent scarring.  There 
are a number of modalities currently in use or under inv estigation for the treatment of atrophic 
acne scars.  Microneedling has been used for at least the past 2 decades, and has been shown to 
result in scar improvement, as assessed by blinded evaluators using a quantitative scale (1).  
Histologically, collagen  types I, III, and VIII, as well as total elastin levels were found to be 
increased when analyzing biopsy samples (2).  Additionally, microneedling has been combined 
with platelet -rich plasma for the treatment of acne scars.  Laser resurfacing has also bee n found to 
be an effective treatment for both active acne and acne scarring.  A variety of lasers have been 
utilized, including both CO2 and Erbium:YAG lasers.  Chemical peels using active ingredients 
such as tretinoin, glycolic acid, and trichloroacetic a cid, have been investigated for the treatment 
of several conditions, including acne and acne scarring.  The theory behind these treatments is that 
these agents destroy the epidermis and/or dermis, leading to skin exfoliation and remodeling (3).  
Finally, d ermal fillers are used in increase volume in depressed scars.  Options include human 
collagen derivatives, hyaluronic acid, and autologous fat (3).   Autologous fat has gained increasing 
popularity, as there is no risk of allergic reaction, since the fat is  derived directly from the patient.  
 
 
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    This is a single -site, pilot study at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas in the Department 
of Plastic Surgery assessing the clinical effects of autologous fat grafting for the treatment of facial 
acne scarring. T he Principal Investigator has been selected based on his expertise, qualifications 
(credentials, training, and medical specialty), subject access, previous clinical research, facilities, 
and interest in this particular field of research.    
 
2. Concise Summar y of Project:  
3.1 Objective  
This investigation, pilot study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous fat grafting for 
the treatment of acne scarring.  Overall assessment of clinical outcome and safety will be based 
clinic visits and evaluation o f pre - and post - procedural photos. In conjunction with standard and 
close -up photography, we will also be using 3D imaging, cross -polarized imaging, UV imaging, 
high-resolution ultrasonography, optical coherence tomography, transepidermal water loss 
measu rements, and/or BTC 2000 measurements. Additionally, we will be utilizing 0.33 mm skin 
biopsies to assess histological and genetic changes that occur below the skin surface as a result of 
this treatment.  The subject’s assessment of satisfaction will be ch aracterized using a non -
parametric assessment scale at each follow -up period.    
 
3.2 Clinical Study  
Autologous Fat Grafting to the Face for the Treatment of Acne Scars  
This is a single -site, non-randomized,  non-controlled  study  designed  to follow  at least fifteen  (15) 
qualified  and consenting  subjects  receiving  1 treatment  of autologous  fat grafting  to acne scars  
present  on the face.   The sample  size determination  of this study  is based  on the fact that this is a 
pilot study,  as well as the Principal  Invest igator’s  experience  with previous  studies.   These  patients  
will receive  one treatment,  followed  by two follow -up visits  at 3-month s and 6-months  post-
treatment.   The acute  effects  of autologous  fat grafting  will be determined  by subjective  and 
objective  analysis  using  standard,  close -up, 3D, cross -polarized,  and UV photography,  high 
resolution  ultrasound,  optical  coherence  tomography,  transepidermal  water  loss measurements,  
BTC  2000  measurements,  and/or  skin biopsies .  Additionally,  the effects  of this treatment  will be 
analyzed  at 3-month s and 6-month s post-treatment  through  clinician  and subject  assessments.  
 
This is a single -site study  at UT Southwestern  Medical  Center  at Dallas  in the Department  of 
Plastic  Surgery.  The Principal  Investigator  has been  selected  based  on his expertise,  qualifications  
(credentials,  training,  and medical  specialty),  subject  access , previous  clinical  research,  facilities,  
and interest  in this particular  field of research.    Subjects  will be identified  from  Dr. Jeffrey  
Kenkel’s  clinical  practice  at the University  of Texas  Southwestern  Medical  Center.   Subjects  will 
be numbered  sequen tially  in the order  in which  they qualify  for entry  into the study.  
 
At each follow -up visit, the treated areas will be clinically evaluated and photographed. Miravex 
3D photography may be used to take a 3D image of the skin .  The study will utilize the VISIA 
Skin Analysis  system to obtain standard, cross -polarized, and UV images to analyze skin tone, 
texture, pore size, actinic sun damage, porphyrins, and/or skin age; the standard time for VISIA 
imaging should take approximate 5 -10 minutes per subject.  High resolution ultrasound will be 
used to assess skin thickness and density ; the standard  time for use of high -resolution  ultrasound 
should take approximately  5 minutes.   Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements will be 
used to evaluate barrier functio n of the skin epidermal layer to determine progress of epidermal 
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    healing after treatment. The standard time for TEWL measurements should take approximately 5 
minutes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to noninvasively gather topographical 
and histologic images of pre - and post -treated skin. The standard time for OCT should take 
approximately 5 -10 minutes. The BTC 2000 will be used to measure skin laxity, viscoelastic 
deformation, stiffness, energy absorption, elasticity, and deformation values  of skin. The standard 
time for BTC 200 should take approximately 5 minutes.  
 
Biopsies will be taken using 0.33mm WellTech Rapid  Core 0.33mm Biopsy Punch. Biopsies will 
allow investigators to correlate changes seen in skin measurements with histology and g ene 
expression. Time for two biopsies will take approximately five minutes.  
 
Finally, the subject’s global aesthetic improvement assessment will be completed at the two 
follow -up visits, as well as b linded evaluations of pre - and post -treatment standard photographs  
and the Clinician’s Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (CGAIS).  
 
Follow -up for any identified adverse events will be reported to the IRB .

5.2 Pre-Study  Procedures  
1. Prior  to the start of the study,  potential  subjects  will be screened  for eligibility  
requirements  by telephone  or e-mail.    
2. Prospective  subjects  will be informed  of the study  visit instructions,  as detailed  in 4.4.   
3. An appointment  time to visit the clinic  will also be scheduled.  
 
5.3 Screening:  Visit 1 (-14 to 0 day[s])  
1. Candidate  subjects  will be given  an IRB-approved  Informed  Consent  Form  (ICF),  as 
detailed  in section  4.1, with adequate  time for review.  The Investigator  and/or  his designee  
will address  questions  and concerns  raised  by the subject.   If the subject  agrees,  they will 
sign one copy  of the ICF.  They  will receive  a copy,  and the original  will be kept in the 
study  file. 
 
2. Candidate  subjects  will be screened  to ensure  that they meet  all of the study  criteria.   A 
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    brief  medical  history  will be taken,  and the subject  will be questioned  about  the inclusion  
and exclusion  criteria.  
 
3. If the subject  is of child -bearing  potential,  a pregnancy  test will be performed.  
 
4. Candidate  subjects  that sign the initial  paperwork  will be assigned  a screening  number.  
 
5. The treatment  area will be assessed  by a member  of the research  team.  
 
This visit will take 30-45 minutes.   This visit may be conducted  at the same  time as Visit  2, the 
first treatment.  
 
5.4 Treatment  Visit:  Visits  2 (Day  1) 
 
1. A clinician  will record  concomitant  medications  and will ask subjects  if they have  
experienced  any change s in their health  since  the previous  visit.  If an adverse  event  (AE)  
is reported  then the Investigator  will be informed  and an AE form  will be completed.   
 
2. Subjects  will acclimate  to ambient  temperature  and humidity  conditions  for 15 minutes.   
To ensure  compliance  in acclimation  period,  the time will be noted  in the CRF  by research  
staff.  
 
3. After  acclimation,  subjects  will participate  in photography  procedures  as described  in 
section  6.2.  Additionally,  subjects  will have  measurements  taken  using  the Miravex  3D 
Imaging  and VISIA  Complexion  Analysis  as described  in section  6.2.  Additionally,  
TEWL,  OCT,  high frequency  ultrasound,  and BTC -2000  measurements  will be obtained.  
 
4. Patients will undergo two 0.33mm biopsies using WellTech Rapid -Core 0.33mm Biopsy 
Punch  pre-treatment. The biopsy site will be chosen by the PI and marked in the patient’s 
file, to keep consistency at the follow -up visits. One biopsy will be used for histological 
studies and the other for gene expression studies.  
 
5. The procedure will be perfo rmed in clinic under a local anesthetic.   
a. The harvest site will be anesthetized using a local numbing agent, 1/4% xylocaine 
with epinephrine.  We will inject the acne scar sites with a local anesthetic as well, 
½-1% xylocaine with epinephrine.   
b. After 10 minutes the donor site will be prepped and draped, and the fat will be 
harvested with standard fat harvesting techniques.  The area where fat is harvested 
will require a small access site to remove the fat.  This will be closed with an 
absorbable suture.   
c. The fat will be prepared by spinning using a centrifuge at 3000 rpm for two minutes. 
The serum and oil will be separated, and each cc of injectable aspirate will contain 
0.9cc of fat and 0.1cc of oil.   
d. The face will be prepped and then the fat injected u sing 25 and 22 G needles.  
 
6. Before  leaving,  the research  team  will review  post-treatment  expectations  and 
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    management  with the subject.  
 
These  visits  will take approximately  2 hours.  
 
In the weeks  following  treatment,  the subject  will return  up to 2 times  in order  to assess  their 
face and the harvest  sites.   These  standard  of care visits  will take no longer  than 30 minutes  and 
are simply  to assure  the subjects  are healing  well.  
 
5.5 Post-Treatment  Visits:  Visit 3 (3-Month s Post-Treatment)  and Visit 4 (6-Months  Post-
Treatment)  
1. A clinician  will record  concomitant  medications  and will ask subjects  if they have  
experienced  any changes  in their health  since  the previous  visit.  If an adverse  event  (AE)  
is reported  then the Investigator  will be informed  and an AE form  will be completed.   
 
2. A clinician  will perform  a physical  examination  to ensure  that the wound  sites are still 
healing  properly.  
 
3. After  a 15-minute  acclimation  to ambient  temperature  and humidity  conditions,  subjects  
will participate  in the following  procedures:   
 
 Photography  procedures  as described  in section  6.2. 
 Subject’s  self-assessment  on improvement  as described  in section  6.1. 
 TEWL,  OCT,  high frequency  ultrasound,  DUB  measurements  
 Two 0.33mm  microbiopsies  at the same  site as those  obtained  pre-treatment  
 
These  visits  will take about  45 minutes.  
 
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov     
 
 
5.6 Event Follow -up Visits (Investigator or designee)  
If a potential adverse event is reported by the subject or identified during examination, the Investigator 
will contact the subject to schedule an Event Follow -up Visit.  At this visit the Investiga tor or their 
designee will:  
 
a.  Obtain a complete history of the event in question as well as conduct an examination of 
the subject and determine if the reported event qualifies as an Adverse Event.  If the event 
is determined to be an Adverse Event, an A dverse Event (AE) case report form and Event 
Follow -up (EF) Visit case report form must be completed.  One AE case report form 
should be used to track the history of an individual AE throughout the period of the study.   
b. Collect an updated medical and s urgical history along with recording of concomitant 
medications or treatments.  
c. Take photographs of the subject with attention to the area in question.  
d. Render treatment for the event, if any, as determined by the medical judgment of the 
investigator.

6.2 Photography Procedures  
Prior to photography procedures, clinic personnel will ensure that subjects have a clean face and 
neck with no makeup as described in the study procedures. Subjects will remove any jewelry from 
the area(s) to be photographed and equilibrate for at least 15  minutes to ambient conditions within 
the clinic before any photographs are taken. Subjects will be provided with a black or gray matte 
headband to keep hair away from the face and instructed on proper headband placement.   
 
1. NIKON D7200  
Standard  and close -up photography  will be taken  in the Department  of Plastic  Surgery’s  
clinical  photography  studio.   These  photos  will be utilized  for evaluation  of the fat 
grafting  treatment  for acne scarring.  These  photographs  will be taken  utilizing  the 
Nikon  D7200  at baseline,  3-month  post-treatment,  and 6-months  post-treatment.  
 
2. VISIA  Complexion  Analysis  
Digital  images  will be taken  using  the VISIA  Complexion  Analysis  System  at 
baseline,  3-month s post-treatment,  and 6 months  post-treatment.   Subjects  will be 
instructed  to adopt  neutral,  non-smiling  expressions  with their eyes gently  closed  for 
VISIA.  Subjects  will be carefully  positioned  for each photograph,  directly  facing  the 
camera  for the center  view  and turned  at a 45° angle  for the right  and left side views.   
The scan will objectively  measure  spots,  wrinkles,  texture,  pores,  UV spots,  brown  
spots,  red areas  and porphyrins.

Cross -polarized : UV-NF 
 
3.        Miravex  3D Imaging  
Miravex  3D Imaging  will be performed  in the Department  of Plastic  Surgery  clinic  to 
assess  changes  in volume  of the subjects’  facial  acne scars.   Images  will be taken  at 
baseline,  3 months,  and 6 months  post-treatment.   Image  acquisition  and analysis  take 
less than 90 seconds.  
 
 
6.3 Blinded  Evaluation  
Two trained  blinded  raters  will be asked  to presented  randomized  photos  of subjects  taken  prior  
to treatment  (day 1) and 6 months  post-treatment.   They  will be asked  to record which  order  they 
believe  the photos  are in, before  then after or after then before.  After  the blinded  assessment  has 
been  completed,  the two raters  will be unblinded  to the prior  to treatment  photo  for CGAIS.  
Raters  will assess  the photos  on a local  computer  and record  answers  on a worksheet  distributed  
by the research  team.  
 
7. Sources  of Research  Material  
Medical  history  (age,  sex, skin type,  recent  sun exposure,  allergies,  current  medications,  major  
illnesses),  standard  photography,  VISIA  images,  Miravex  images,  OCT  images,  high frequency  
ultrasound  images,  TEWL  measurements,  BTC  2000  measurements,  biopsies,  evaluations,  
responses  to questionnaires,  adverse  events  and treatment.  
 
8. Recruitment  Methods  and Consenting  Process  
Subjects  will be recrui ted from  the existing  practice  of the Investigators,  Campus  News  postings,  
and flyers  placed  at UT Southwestern  Plastic  Surgery  Clinics.  Subjects  who present  for treatment  
with fat grafting  will have  the study  explained  to them,  will be asked  about  their willingness  to be 
involved  in the study,  and their willingness  to sign an informed  consent  form.   Included  in this 
interview  will be questioning  from  the investigator  or staff member  about  any privacy  concerns  
the individual  may have.  
 
Prior  to any study  procedures  each Subject  will read and sign a Consent  Form,  explaining  the 
purpose,  design,  risks  and duration  of the study.   This consent  will include  a photography  release  
that allows  the investigator  or his designee  to take recognizabl e and non- recognizable  photographs  
of the subject.   If the subjects  decline  permission  to be photographed,  they may not participate  in 
the study  since  the photographic  documentation  of treatment  outcome  is an important  measure  of 
evaluation.   
 
Subjects  will also be paid $25 per research  visit,  and $35 for research  visits  with a biopsy.   
Subjects  will receive  $130  if all four research  visits  are completed.   Additionally,  subjects  will be 
compensated  $5 for each wound  check  for which  they return , for an additional  compensation  of 
up to $10.  A Clincard  will be used for payment.  
 
9. Potential  Risks  
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    Bruising  and Infection:  (Rare  < 1%)  
As with any superficial  wound,  there  is a risk of infection.   This risk will be minimized  by using  
sterile  technique  and performing  proper  wound  care.   Furthermore,  obtaining  a detailed  patient  
history  prior  to treatment  will guide  patient  care.  
 
Transient  edema  and/or  erythema : (Occasionally  < 3%) 
Swelling  is the most  common  complication  of fat injection  and can last up to 2 weeks.   Head  
elevation  and ice packs  on the grafted  areas  may alleviate  these  symptoms.  
 
Undercorrection/overcorrection/contour  Irregularities:  (Rare  < 1%) 
Injecting  inadequate  or excessive  amount  of fat can lead to undercorrection  or overcorrection  of 
depressed  areas,  respectively.   The treatment  will be performed  by the PI, who has extensive  
experience  with fat grafting.  
 
Scarring:  (Rare  < 1%) 
There is a small risk of scarring. However, this is minimized by proper technique and wound care.  
 
Allergic Rea ction: (Rare < 1%)  
There is a possibility of an allergic or toxic reaction to anesthesia used to numb the areas. Subjects 
will be questioned with regard to any history of allergies and carefully monitored for signs of 
allergic reaction.  
 
Biopsy  
Risks  associated  with biopsy  include:  1) scarring  - a small  risk of scarring,  which  can be 
minimized  by proper  technique  and wound  care;  2) allergic  reaction  - there  is a possibility  of an 
allergic  or toxic  reaction  to anesthesia  used to numb  the areas.  Subjects  will be questioned  with 
regard  to any history  of allergies  and carefully  monitored  for signs  of allergic  reaction . 
 
Photography  
Subjects could be slightly uncomfortable during the photographic sessions when asked to 
position her body to take the pho tograph of th eir face . The subject may be uncomfortable with 
standing still for an extended period of time or from turning her head in various positions. 
Subjects may be sensitive to the bright and repeating flashes from the camera, which can 
sometimes cau se headaches, irritation of the eyes, discomfort, after effects such as seeing spots, 
and in rare cases, could stimulate a migraine headache or epileptic seizure.  
 
Photographs include a risk of identification. Privacy will be protected to the greatest exte nt 
possible. Photos will only be identified by a unique subject identification number that contains 
no personal identifying information. For research purposes photos may be used in scientific 
publications  
 
 10. Adverse  Events  
 10.1 Definition  of an Adverse  Event  
 An adverse  event  (AE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a clinical  investigation  where  a 
subject  is administered  a pharmaceutical  product/biologic  (at any dose),  OTC,  cosmetic  product  
or medical  device  and which  does not necessarily  require  a causal  relationship  with a test article.  
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  
finding,  for example),  symptom  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a medicinal  
product  whether  or not consider ed related  to the medicinal  product.  The AEs will be recorded  on 
the appropriate  case report  forms  and source  documents.   The Investigator  or medical  staff will 
evaluate  all AEs as to their severity  and relation  to the test article.  
 
The severity  of an AE will be graded  as follows:  
 Mild:  Awareness  of a sign or symptom  but easily  tolerated  
 Moderate:  Discomfort  sufficient  to cause  interference  with usual  activity  or to affect   
  clinical  status  
 Severe:  Incapacitating  with inability  to do usual  activity  or to significantly  affect   
  clinical  status  
 
The relationship  of an AE to the use of the study  article  will be assessed  using  the following  
guidelines,  based  upon  available  information:  
Unlikely  No temporal  association,  or the cause  of the event  has been  identified,  or the  
 test article  cannot  be implicated  
Possible  Temporal  association,  but other  etiologies  are likely  to be the cause;   
 however,  involvement  of the test article  cannot  be excluded  
Probable  Temporal  association,  other  etiologies  are possible,  but not likely  
Definite  Clear -cut temporal  association  
Unknown  
 
 10.2 Definition  of a Serious  Adverse  Event   
A serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  is any experience  or reaction  occurring  at any dose that results  in 
any of the following  outcomes:  
 death,  
 is life threatening,  
 inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of hospitalization,  
 a persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity,  or 
 a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect.  
 
Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death,  be life-threatening,  or require  
hospitalization  may be considered  a serious  adverse  event  when,  based  upon  appropriate  medical  
judgment,  they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition.  [Note:   The term “life-
threatening”  refers  to an event  in which  the subject  was at risk of death  at the time of event;  it 
does not refer  to an event  that hypothetically  might  have  caused  death  if it was more  severe.]  
 
Hospitalization  solely  for the purpose  of diagnostic  tests,  even  if related  to an AE, elective  
hospitalization  for an intervention  which  was already  planned  before  the inclusion  of the subject  
in the study,  and admission  to a day-care facility  may not themselves  constitute  sufficient  
grounds  to be considered  a SAE.  Hospitalization  is defined  as being  admitted  to a hospital  as an 
in-patient  for greater  than 24 hours.  
 
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    10.3 Procedures  for Reporting  Adverse  Events  
At each visit,  the Investigator  or designee  will question  the subject  about  adverse  events  using  an 
open  question  and taking  care not to influence  the subject’s  answer  (e.g. “Have  you noticed  any 
change  in your health  since  the last visit?”).  
 
Directed  questioning  and examination  will be performed  when  appropriate.  All reported  AEs 
will be documented  on the appropriate  forms  without  omitting  any requested  and known  
information.  Every  time a concomitant  therapy  is reported  during  the study,  an AE form  will be 
completed  if appropriate  and the reason  for the treatment  noted.  
 
When  an AE persis ts at the end of the study,  the Investigator  will ensure  a follow -up of the 
subject  until the event  is satisfactorily  resolved.  
 
Photographs  will be taken  to document  any AEs if possible.  
 
 10.4 Medical  Treatment  for Adverse  Events  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
For the duration  of the study,  medical  assistance  will be provided  to the subject  for study  related  
problems  at no expense,  if in the opinion  of the Principal  Investigator,  the reaction  was caused  by 
the use of the study  device.  UT Southwestern  will make  all medical  arrangements  and will 
provide  appropriately  selected  doctors.  
 
Should  a subject  choose  to see their own doctor,  or seek any post-study  medical  treatment  
(except  for any study -related  treatment  that is due to the negligence  of UT Southwest ern) 
reimbursement  will be offered.  
 
 10.5 Unanticipated  Adverse  Reactions  
Unanticipated  adverse  reactions  are defined  as any adverse  reactions  not listed  as one of the 
anticipated  reactions  listed  in the protocol  and was not previously  identified  in natur e, severity,  
or degree  of incidence.  
 
 10.6 Anticipated  Reactions  
Expected  side effects:   After  the procedure,  the skin will be red and swollen  in appearance.   The 
patient  many  also experience  skin tightness  and mild sensitivity  to touch  on certain  areas.   This 
will diminish  significantly  within  a few hours  following  the procedure.   Swelling  and bruising  
may should  resolve  within  one to two weeks  post-treatment.    
 
Symptoms  of mild irritation,  including  the redness,  bruising,  and swelling  listed  above,  will not 
be treated  as adverse  reactions  if they are mild in nature.  These  conditions  may or may not 
resolve  over time.  Symptoms  that are persistent  and moderate  to severe  in nature,  or that involve  
elevation  (e.g. edema,  papules,  vesicles,  spreading)  will be considered  AEs.  
 
Unanticipated  Reactions:   In rare cases,  it is possible  for a subject  to develop  allergic  reactions  to 
the test material(s).  Rare  allergic  reactions  can consist  of severe  contact  dermatitis,  granuloma(s)  
or systemic  hypersensitivity.  This risk is increased  for individuals  with a history  of allergies,  and 
individuals  with asthma  and/or  a history  of hives  may also be affected.  Subjects  will be 
instructed  to notify  the clinic  immediately  if they experience  an allergic  reaction  including  rash,  
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    hives,  and itchin g. Also,  hyperpigmentation,  hypertrophic  skin scarring,  and scarring  is a rare 
potential.  
 
The Investigator  will have  the final authorization  to determine  if a reaction  will be considered  an 
AE. 
 
 11. Attrition  
Clinical  studies  may experience  attrition.  Subjects  will be made  aware  that they are free to 
withdraw  from  the study  at any time for any reason,  without  prejudice.  Otherwise,  every  effort  
will be made  to have  subjects  complete  the study  as stated  in this protocol,  ensuring  subject  
safety  and followin g the provisions  of the informed  consent  form.  Reasons  for subject  
withdrawal  may include  an adverse  event,  subject’s  request,  protocol  violation,  lost to follow -up, 
or other  reasons.  Subjects  lost from  the study  will be documented  on a screening/enrollmen t log. 
 
If a subject  fails to return  for a scheduled  examination,  a representative  of UT Southwestern  will 
attempt  to contact  the subject  and determine  whether  the subject  has continued  to follow  study  
instructions  and intends  to continue  participation  in the study.  If so, then the subject  will be 
processed  as soon  as possible  (± 3 days for rescheduled  visit).  Changes  to the study  schedule  
under  these  circumstances  will be noted  in the Screening  and Enrollment  Log. If a subject  is 
unable  to reschedule  the visit within  the appropriate  window  as indicated  above,  they will be 
dropped  from  study  participation.  
 
12. Procedures  to Maintain  Confidentiality:  
This study  will follow  all applicable  guidelines  for the protection  of human  subjects  for research  
as outline d in 21 CFR  50, in accordance  with the accepted  standards  for Good  Clinical  Practice  
(GCP),  International  Conference  on Harmonization  (ICH),  and the standard  practices  of UT 
Southwestern.  
 
All study  records  and information  will be identified  by the subject  number.  All subject  identifiers  
will be removed  from  all documents.  The link between  subject  name  and study  ID number  will be 
kept in separate  password -protected  files.  Documents  containing  identifying  information  will be 
kept in locked  files in the resea rch staffs’  locked  office.  All electronic  study  data will be password  
protected  with access  limited  to members  of the research  team.   No direct  identifying  information  
will be shared  with any outside  entities.   Electronic  data (electronic  data entry  - Case  Report  
Forms)  will be password  protected.    
 
Photographs  of subject's faces  will be taken at enrollment, treatment and f ollow -up visits. These 
photographs will be identified by subject numbers and will not include any identifying marks 
[such as tattoos].   Subject confidentiality will be protected to the greatest extent possible.  
 
This study will be performed in accordance with  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act.  These guidelines will be followed specifically with regard to the privacy an d confidentiality 
of patient care and study records.  Personnel associated with Investigator’s office, the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the governing Institutional Review Board, have the right to 
review the data, including photographs, colle cted during this study.    
 
 
STU2020 -0310,  ct.gov    14. Biostatistics:   
This initial  study  will include  descriptive  statistics  from  baseline  analysis.  
 
Mean  change  from  baseline  will be used to calculate  data obtained  from  transepidermal  water  
loss, high resolution  ultrasonograph y, 3D photography,  optical  coherence  tomography,  and/or  
BTC  2000  measurements,  and biopsies.  
 
The primary  outcome  measure  of effectiveness  will be a paired  comparison  of baseline  to 
immediate,  3-month,  and 6-month  follow -up ratings  for improvement  in skin tone,  texture,  and 
pore size using  VISIA,  depression  using  Miravex  3D imaging,  as well as data obtained  from  high 
resolution  ultrasonography,  3D photography,  optical  coherence  tomography,  and/or  BTC  2000  
measurements,  and biopsy.   The “downtime”  will be measured  by a trans -epidermal  water  loss 
assessment  of re-epithelialization.  Safety  will be defined  as an absence  of adverse  events  related  
to the procedure.   Photographs  of treated  skin at follow -up visits  will be compared  to baseline  to 
document  the healin g time course  and may be used for blinded  scoring  evaluations  of skin tone,  
skin texture  and pore size, as well as for subject  self-assessment.

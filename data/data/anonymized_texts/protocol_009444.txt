1.   INTRODUCTION 
This document describes the statistical methods and data presentations to be used in the summary 
and analysis of data from Protocol MAP -7189.  Background information is provided for the overall 
study design and objectives.  The reader is referred to the st udy protocol and electronic case report 
forms ( eCRFs) for details of study conduct and data collection.  
1.1.   Study Overview  
Clinical protocol MAP -7189 is a  Randomized, Multi -Center, Double -blind, Placebo Controlled, 
Parallel Group Trial to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Mayne Pharma’s Ivermectin 0.5% Lotion 
Compared to Sklice® Ivermectin 0.5% Lotion in the Treatment of Head Lice.  The primary 
objective of t he study is to establish the efficacy of a single application of Ivermectin 0.5% lotion 
in the treatment of head lice under at -home use conditions compared with Sklice® 0.5% lotion, 
and to demonstrate that both active lotions have superior efficacy compared to Placebo.  
The study also assesses co mparative safety of Ivermectin  0.5% Lotion (Mayne Pharma, LLC ) and 
Sklice® Ivermectin 0.5% Lotion  and local tolerability of  Ivermectin  0.5% Lotion.  
The subject population includes healthy male and female subjects aged 6 months to 18 years who are infested with Pediculus humanus capitis. The youngest infested household member will be considered the index subject.  Household members, up to a maximum of 3 members, infested with an active head lice infestation defined as at least 1 live louse (adult and/or nymph) present on the scalp and/or hair, as determined by a trained evaluator will receive treatment with an over -the-
counter head lice treatment product at baseline.  
The study is comprised of three phases:  Screening , Treatment, and Follow -Up.  The duration of 
this study is 15 days (+/ - 3). The Screening Phase is Day - 1-0.  The Treatment Phase is Day 1.  
Preferably, screening and treatment will occur on the same day. The Final Study Visit is on day 
15 (+/ - 3 days) fol lowing administration of the study product.   
Potential subjects will be screened and the index subject will be eligible for enrollment into the 
study. During the baseline visit (Day 1), which can occur on the same day as screening (Day 0), the Investigato r will record subject’s demographics, medical history, review concomitant 
medication, identifying any prohibited therapies the subject may receive, perform physical examination, collect vital signs and perform urine pregnancy test.   
Eligible subjects will  be randomized in a ratio of 3:3:1 to receive either the Mayne Pharma’s 
Ivermectin 0.5% lotion, Sklice® 0.5% lotion, or placebo lotion treatment and will be trained on the application of the study drug and subject’s diary completion. Infested household mem bers, up 
to 3 members per household, will be treated with an over -the-counter head lice treatment product 
on-site. 
The study drug will be applied as a single, at -home dose.  Subjects will be instructed to apply a 
full tube amount (4 oz.) of Ivermectin 0.5%  lotion to fully coat dry hair and scalp, avoiding the

eyes and mucus membranes. The lotion will be left on the hair and scalp for 10 minutes, then 
rinsed off with warm water.  The tube is intended for a single use; all used tubes should be returned at the  second visit (first follow -up visit) to the clinical site for product accountability.  In addition 
to receiving the study drug, the index subjects and household members will be instructed on an overall lice management program, which includes:  
• Wash (in hot  water) or dry -clean all recently worn clothing, hats, used bedding and 
towels.  
• Wash (in hot water) personal care items such as combs, brushes and hair clips.  
• A fine -tooth comb or special nit comb may be used to remove dead lice and nits after 
treatment.  
Index subjects will return for post -baseline visits assessments at Days 2, 8, and 15, returning used 
tubes of the study drug at Day 2, which will be accounted for along with diary cards, which will 
be reviewed by the site personnel for completeness. The In vestigator will perform a visual 
assessment for the presence or absence of head lice, record local application site reactions, and 
perform an ocular irritation assessment. The site will provide a Subject Self -Assessment worksheet 
to record tolerability of treatment. Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at the Screening Visit 
and the Final Study Visit, with interim visits confirming pregnancy has not occurred through 
questioning of the index subject.  
Final efficacy, safety and tolerability assessmen ts will occur at visit 5 (Day 15±3). Subjects will 
be encouraged to report any complications or adverse effects during their participation.

2.  OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of  this study is:  
• To establish the efficacy of a single application of Ivermectin 0.5% lotion in the treatment 
of head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) under at -home conditions compared with Sklice® 
0.5% lotion 
• To demonstrate that both active lotions have superior efficacy compared to Placebo  
The secondary objective of this study is:  
• To demonstrate comparative safety  and local tolerability  of Ivermectin 0.5% lotion (Mayne 
Pharma, LLC ) vs Sklice® 0.5% lotion . 
3.   GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
3.1.   Sample Size Estimation  
Under the assumption that the Test and Reference treatments are equally efficacious with a true 
cure rate of at least 67%, and that the placebo has a true cure rate no greater than 27%, computer simulations were performed to determine the probability (power) of study success for different 
sample sizes.  Study success in a simulated trial was defined as having the 90% continuity -
corrected confidence interval in the PP population for the Test -to-Reference difference in cure 
proportions b e contained in the bioequivalence interval [ -0.20, +0.20] at the same time that both 
active treatments were demonstrated in the mITT population to have cure rates that were greater than, and statistically different (p<0.05) from, that of the placebo.  It w as assumed that 
approximately 90% of the mITT subjects would qualify as PP ones.  
It was determined that for at least an 80% probability of study success, 280 mITT index subjects would be needed (120:120:40; Test: Reference: Placebo) to obtain 252 PP ones ( 108:108:36; Test: 
Reference: Placebo).   
3.2.   Randomization  
This is a double -blind study, thus all site staff, study monitor, and subjects will be blinded to the 
randomization scheme except for the Unblinded Site Personnel/ designee and Unblinded 
Monitor. Furthermore, the randomization scheme will be retained by the Drug Depot and will only be shared with Unblinded Site Personnel or designee.  
The actual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a computerized block 
randomization scheme prepared by an independent third party.  The independent third party will  
prepare the randomization list and  hold it throughout the conduct of the study.  Subjects are 
randomized on a 3:3 :1 basis (test drug: active comparator : placebo ) and stratified by clinical site.

MAP -7189   
Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1  
 
After  signing  the Informed  Consent,  each subject  will be assigned  a unique  subject  number.   Subjects 
are identified using subject initials, subject number , and date of birth. The  subject  numbers will be 
generated by the EDC and assigned sequentially in the order in which subjects are consented at 
each center.  
If a subject discontinues from the study, the subject number and randomization number are not to 
be reused, and the subject is not allowed to re -enter the study.  
The randomization scheme for treatment allocation  will be used for statistical and reporting 
purposes. A  copy of the randomization assignment  will be retained at each clinical site by 
unblinded personnel and will be available to FDA or  other regulatory agency investigators at the 
time of site inspection to allow for verification of the treatment identity of each subject.  
3.3.   Blinding and Procedures for Unblinding  the Study  
This is a double -blind study, thus Sponsor, CRO, assessor site  staff, study monitors, and subjects 
will be blinded to the randomization scheme. The packaging of the study drug products will be 
similar in appearance to make difference in treatment less obvious to the subjects. Blank, opaque diaper labels will be applied to each study tube for maintenance of study blinding. Each tube will be packaged in individualized cartons. Neither the Investigator nor the subject should be able to identify the received treatment. The dispensed investigational product will NOT be ope ned by the 
index subject and their family members at the study center.  
The blinding code must not be broken except in emergency situations for which the identification of the study treatment of a subject is required by the Investigator to complete a seriou s adverse 
event report. In such situations, the Medical Monitor or the Investigator will use the Unblinded Treatment List in order to unblind the treatment for the individual subject. Unblinded information will be held by designated individual(s), and the date and reason for breaking the blind must be 
recorded.  
The Medical Monitor must be contacted by telephone prior to unblinding but no later than 24 hours after unblinding. As the study is blinded, the Investigator should promptly document and explain to the Sponsor any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to a serious 
adverse event) of the investigational product(s).  Every effort should be made to avoid unblinding 
extra study personnel.

3.4.   Handling of D ata 
3.4.1.   Examination of Subject Subsets  
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized separately using descriptive 
statistics by treatment group and study day, where appropriate. No formal statistical testing will be utilized.   
3.4.2.   Missing Data   
Every effort will be made to obtain required data at each scheduled evaluation from all subjects who have been randomized. In situations where it is not possible to obtain all safety data, 
imputation of missing data will not be conducted.  A Last -Observation- Carried -Forward 
imputation method for missing efficacy data will be used for the mITT population.   
3.4.3.   Definitions and Terminology  
Treatment Day 1 (Baseline)  
Treatment Day 1 is the day that study treatment is first initiated.  
Study  Day  
Study Day is defined relative to study treatment initiation (Study Day 1). Thus, the study day of an event is calculated as:  
Study Day = event date – date of Study Day 1 +1.  
Days on Study 
Days on Study is the number of days from Study Day 1 to the da te of study completion or early 
termination as recorded on the study termination eCRF.  
End of Treatment  
For efficacy assessments, end of treatment is defined as the last non -missing assessment taken 
prior to discontinuation of study treatment.  
Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications are those medications taken  on or after the initiation of study treatment.  
This definition includes prescription and all over -the-counter (OTC)  medications and all dietary 
supplements.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 30 November  2017 
Mayne P harma , LLC  
MAP -7189   
Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1  
Previous Medications  
Previous medications are those medications taken within the 30 days and stopped prior to the 
initiation of study therapy.  
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event   
A treatment- emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event occurring on or after the 
initiat ion of study treatment.  For the purpose of defining treatment -emergent adverse events, it is 
assumed that an adverse event which was reported to have started on Treatment Day 1 without an 
associated onset time may have occurred after the initiation of stu dy treatment.  Hence, adverse 
events occurring on Treatment Day 1 are assumed to be treatment -emergent.  
3.5.  P lanned Analyses  
A final analysis is planned after the last subject completes or discontinues the study, and the resulting clinical database has been cleaned, quality checked, and locked.  
4.   ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The populations defined for analysis will include the modified intent -to-treat (mITT), per- protocol 
(PP), and the safety population.  
Safety Population
 includes all subjects who were randomized and dispensed treatment.  This is the 
population that will be used for the safety assessments.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) P opulation  includes all Index subjects who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized, dispensed treatment, and had at least one post -
treatment efficacy evaluation.  This is the primary population for determination of the superiority 
of the active treatments over placebo.  
Per-Protocol (PP) P opulation  includes all mITT subjects wh o applied their dispensed treatment, 
had no protocol deviations which could have interfered with the accurate assessment of treatment efficacy, and returned for the Day 15 visit within the allowed window. This is the primary population for the efficacy com parisons between the two active treatment groups.  
Subjects whose condition worsens and require alternate or supplemental therapy for the treatment of head lice during the study will be discontinued, included in both the mITT and PP population analyses as treatment failures. Subjects who discontinue early for reasons other than treatment 
failure will be excluded from the PP population, but included in the mITT population . Last 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)  will be used to impute any missing endpoints . 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on both the per -protocol population and the mITT population. 
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety population as defined.

5.   STATISTICAL METHODS  
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize t he data from this study, with confidence  
intervals calculated for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.   The term “descriptive 
statistics” refers to number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and 
maximum for continuous data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data.  The term “treatment group” refers to randomized treatment assignment: active -test, active- reference, and 
placebo .  All data collected during the study will be included in data listings.  The data will be 
sorted first by subject number, and then by date within each subject number. Unless specified otherwise,  all statistical testing will be two -sided and will be performed using a  significance 
(alpha) level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS
® System, version 9.4  or higher  within a 
validated statistical computing environment.  
5.1.  S ubject  Disposition, Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Subject disposition, including the number of subjects who completed the study, discontinued from 
the study, reasons for early discontinuation, and the number of days on study will also be provided 
and presented for all subjects randomized. Subject disposition will be summarized by treatment 
group . 
 Demographic data and baseline characteristics including age, ethnicity, race, gender, severity of 
itching and stinging/ burning sensations , and skin/scalp irritation assessment will be summarized 
using  appropriate  descriptive statistics by treatment group for the mITT and PP populations. 
Descriptive statistics will be generated for continuous variables (e.g. age).  The number and 
percentage of sub jects in each class of categorical demographic and Baseline variables (e.g. 
gender, ethnicity, race, severity of itching and stinging/ burning sensation; skin/scalp irritation 
assessment ) will be tabulated by treatment group and population (mI TT and PP) for  Baseline (Visit 
1).  Individual subject demographic and Baseline characteristics data will be listed. No inferential 
testing will be performed.    
5.2.  Efficacy Analyses  
5.2.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of index subjects who are lice free (defined as no 
live lice, adults or nymphs) 14 days (Day 15) after treatment.   
Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, number of subjects cured, and proportion of cured) for 
the primary efficacy variable will be tabulated by treatment group and population (mITT and PP).   
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 30 November  2017 
Mayne P harma , LLC  
MAP -7189   
Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1  
5.2.2.  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Bioequivalence assessment will be evaluated by comparing proportions of patients successfully 
cured in the test and the reference treatment groups. Bioequivalence between the test and the reference product will be established if the continuity -corrected 90% confidence interval for the 
difference in cure proportions between test and reference treatment is contained between the 
equivalence limits [ -0.20, +0.20].  The hypothesis testing for the two, one-sided tests will be 
conduct ed using a 5% level of significance.  
In this case, the compound two, one-sided tests hypothesis is:  
H
0: pT – pR < -0.20 or p T – pR > 0.20  (meaning test product is not bioequivalent to the 
reference);  
HA: -0.20 ≤ p T –pR ≤ 0.20 (supporting bioequivalence);  
where p T = cure rate of test treatment,  p R = cure rate of reference treatment.  
Let n T = sample size of test treatment group, n R = sample size of reference treatment group and 
se = (𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇 �(1−𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇 �)𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇+ ⁄𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅 �(1−𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅 �)𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅) ⁄1
2. 
The 90% confidence interval will be e stimated as follows, using Yates correction:  
L = (𝑝𝑝̂𝑇𝑇−𝑝𝑝̂𝑅𝑅)−1.645 × 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−(1
𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇+ 1
𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅)2⁄ 
U = (𝑝𝑝̂𝑇𝑇−𝑝𝑝̂𝑅𝑅)+1.645 × 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠+(1
𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇+ 1
𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅)2⁄ 
H0 is rejected if L ≥ -0.20 and U ≤ 0.20 resulting in accepting H A and concluding bioequivalence 
of the two products.  
The primary endp oint is the evaluation at Day 15 . The bioequivalence results in the PP population 
will be considered definitive, with those in the mITT population as supportive.   
The following SAS code will be used for testing bioequivalence:  
proc freq data = dataset;  
weight count;  
tables treat*outcome/ riskdiffc (equiv);  
run; 
 
The efficacy  assessments for each active treatment vs. the Placebo will be conducted using two -
sided, continuity corrected Z -tests based on the following hypotheses:  
 Ho: π T = π P  
 Ha: πT ≠ π P  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 30 November  2017 
Mayne P harma , LLC  
MAP -7189   
Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1  
 where,  
 πT, πR, and π P = the true cure proportions for Test, Reference, and Placebo treatments, 
respectively.  
If both null hypotheses are rejected (p<0.05) and the observed cure proportions for the Test and 
Reference treatments are greater than  that for the Placebo, then Superiority will be considered to 
have been demonstrated.   
The superiority  results in the mITT population will be considered definitive, with those in the PP 
population considered supportive.  
 
5.2.3.   Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the number and percentage of all index subjects who are lice-
free at Day 2.   Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, number of subjects cured, and proportion 
cured) for the secondary efficacy variable will b e tabulated by treatment group and population 
(mITT and PP).   
 
5.2.4.   Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
As a secondary endpoint evaluation, patients’ clinical progress at Visit 4 (Day 14) will be assessed 
and proportion of cured patients in treatment arms wil l be compared using the procedure s 
described in the analysis of the primary effic acy endpoint . 
 
5.3.  T olerability Assessment  
Subjects’ self -assessment of itching and stinging/ burning sensations during screening and 
treatment periods (Visits 2 through 5), skin/scalp irritation assessment by clinical site personnel 
(Visits 2 through 5), and ocular irritation  assessment (Visits 3 through 5)  by clinical site personnel 
will used to assess tolerability to the study tr eatments.  Itching is defined as intense, distracting 
irritation or tickling sensation in the last 24 hours and is evaluated on a scale from 0 (No Itching) 
to 3 (Severe Itch ).  Stin ging/ burning is defined as sensation of the skin is painfully hot or 
noticeable tingling sensation in the last 24 hours and is evaluated on a scale from 0 (Absent) to 3 
(Severe).  Skin/Scalp irritation is evaluated on a scale from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe) for four types 
of irritation including Pruritus= Itching,  Erythema= Red ness of the scalp , Excoriation= Breaking 
of the skin, usually caused by scratching, Pyoderma= Sores filled with clear fluid, pus or crusting .  
Each type of irritation is evaluated separately and its total score is recorded.  Ocular irritation is 
evaluated for the presence of eye irritation, Conjunctivitis, and Ocular Hyperemia on a scale from 
0 (No) to 1 (Yes).

Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1  
Descriptive statistics using categorical methods will be used to compare tolerability  measures 
between the test and reference treatment  groups and v arious study days  (e.g. Baseline (Visit 2), 
Visit 3 , Visit 4, and Visit 5) .  Tolerability analyses will be presented for mITT and PP populations.    
5.4.   Safety  Assessment  
The reporting of safety data is descriptive, and will include all subjects in the Safety population. 
The variables for safety endpoints are AEs. AEs will be summarized based on their frequency and their severity. All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and summarized by treatment group. Data wil l be summarized using preferred term 
and primary system organ class.  
If a subject experiences multiple events that map to a single preferred term, the greatest severity 
and strongest Investigator assessment of relation to study drug will be assigned to the  preferred 
term for the appropriate summaries. Should an event have a missing severity or relationship, it will be classified as having the highest severity and/or strongest relationship to study drug.  
Summaries of treatment -emergent AEs will include any AEs reported beginning with the first dose 
of study drug on Day 1. The occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized 
by treatment group using preferred terms, system organ classifications, and severity. Separate summaries of treatment -emergent serious adverse events, treatment -emergent adverse events 
related to study drug, and events leading to the discontinuation of study drug will be generated. All adverse events reported will be listed for individual subjects showing both verbatim an d 
preferred terms.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) drug 
dictionary. These data will be summarized by treatment group. Previous and concomitant medications will be presented in a data listing.  
5.4.1.  Adverse Events  
Analysis  of adverse events as safety  variables  will be based  on all adverse event  (AE)  capture  
measuring  severity and frequency utilizing MedDRA terminology for consistency. AEs will be 
mapped to a MedDRA -preferred term  and system organ classification.  If a subject experiences 
multiple events that map to a single preferred term, the greatest severity and strongest Investigator 
assessment of relation to study drug will be assigned to the preferred term for the appropriat e 
summaries. Should an event have a missing severity or relationship, it will be classified as having 
the highest severity and/or strongest relationship to study drug.  
Summaries of treatment -emergent AEs will include any AEs reported beginning with the first dose 
of study drug on Day 1. The occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized 
by treatment group using preferred terms, system organ classifications, and severity.  Separate summaries of treatment -emergent serious adverse events  (SAEs) , treatment -emergent adverse 
events related to study drug, and events leading to the discontinuation of study drug will be 
generated.

Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1  
All AEs will be listed for individual subjects showing both verbatim and preferred terms.   
5.4.2.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be collected at the Screening visit; on the Baseline, and at V isit 5 (or upon 
subject discontinuation). Vital signs will include body temperature (oral), heart rate and blood 
pressure (systolic and diastolic). Any abnormal characteristics w ill be evaluated by the 
Investigator based on their clinical significance. Abnormal vital signs will be considered AEs if 
they require therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be AEs due to the clinical judgement.  
5.4.3.  Previous  and Concomitant Medications  
All medications (both prescription and nonprescription, and including vitamins, herbals, topical, 
inhaled, and intranasal) taken within 30 days prior to the start of the Study Drug and through the final study visit will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF (using their generic and brand names, if known) with the corresponding indication, start and stop dates. At each study visit, subjects will be asked whether they have started or discontinued any medication since the ir previous study visit. 
This includes single use or PRN (as needed) medication use.  
Previous treatment of head lice must be recorded irrespective of the term it was given. Corresponding condition shall be captured in the subject’s Medical History.  
 
6.   CHANGES IN THE PLANNED ANALYSES  
No deviations in the conduct of the study or the planned analysis are anticipated.  Should any 
deviations from the analyses specified in the authorized statistical analysis plan arise, such deviations will be documented in t he final clinical study report.  
7.  PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS  
Statistical programs will be de veloped using SAS® version 9.4 or higher.  Programs will be 
documented, produced, and validat ed.  Additionally, the following conventions should be 
incorporated:  
• Page orientation, margins, and fonts
: Summary tables, listings, and figures will appear in 
landscape orientation.  There should be a minimum of a 1.25” boundary on the upper (bound) edge, and a minimum of a 1.0” boundary on the remaining three edges.  Output should be printed in Courier New with a point size of at least 8.  Titles may be printed using a larger font (e.g., Arial point size 10).

Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1  
• Identification of analysis population : Every summary table and figure should clearly specify 
the analysis population b eing summarized.  Listings will be prepared for all subjects.  
• Group headers:  In the summary tables, the group headers will identify the treatment group and 
the within -group sample size for the indicated analysis population.  Of note, the header’s 
sample si ze does not necessarily equal the number of subjects summarized  within any given 
summary module; some subjects in the analysis population may have missing values and, thus, 
may not be summarized.  
• Suppression of percentages corresponding to null categories:  When count data  are presented 
as category frequencies and corresponding percentages, the percent should be suppressed when the count is zero in order to draw attention to the non -zero counts.  
• Presentation of sample sizes:  Summary modules should indicate, in one way or another, the 
number of subjects contributing  to the summary statistics presented in any given summary 
module.  As mentioned above, this may be less than the number of subjects in the analysis population.  
♦ In the quantitative modules describing  continuous variables (and thus presenting sample 
size, means, and standard deviations), the sample size should be the number of non -missing 
observations.  
♦ For categorical variables that are presented in frequency tables, the module should present the total count in addition to the count in each category.  Percentages should be calculated using this total as the denominator, and the percentage corresponding t o the sum itself (that 
is, 100%) should be presented to  indicate clearly to a reviewer the method of calculation. 
Missing data will not contribute to the calculation of percentages.  
• Sorting: 
Listings will be sorted by treatment group,  subject identificatio n number and date, if 
applicable.  If a listing is sorted in a different manner, a footnote will indicate as such.  
• General formatting rules: Rounding for all variables will occur only as the last step, 
immediately prior to presentation in listings, tables , and figures.  No intermediate rounding 
will be performed on derived variables.  The standard rounding practice of rounding numbers ending in 0 -4 down and numbers ending in 5- 9 up will be employed.   
• The presentation of numerical values will adhere to the following guidelines:  
♦ Raw measurements will be reported to the number of significant digits as captured 
electronically on the eCRFs.   
♦ Standard deviations will be reported to one decimal place beyond the number of decimal places the original parameter is  presented.  
♦ Means will be reported to the same number of significant digits as the parameter, unless the parameter is an integer, then 1 decimal place will be reported.  
♦ Calculated percentages will be reported with no decimals.

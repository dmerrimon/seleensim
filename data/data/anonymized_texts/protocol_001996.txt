Version 11/05/2021  Page 3 of 65 Abstract  
Title A phase 2 study of ibrutinib as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with 
localized prostate cancer  
Patient population  Prostate cancer patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy (RP)  
Rationale for Study  30-40% of patients who undergo RP with curative intent for their localized 
prostate cancer experience relapse of their disease. Thus, improved 
therapeutic approaches are needed in this patient population. Enhancing 
the patient’s anti -tumor immune response prior to surgery may improve 
long- term outcomes following RP.  
 Tumor -infiltrating B cells are increased in prostate cancer tissue, and high 
intra-tumoral density of B cells correlate with higher stage of disease and 
greater potential for recurrence or progression (Woo JR et al, 2014) . 
Unpublished data from UCSF’s  laboratory have shown that T cells within 
the prostate that are associated with B cell aggregates lack T cell activation 
markers. Recently, preclinical studies showed that ibrutinib, a potent 
inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) but also an inhibitor of 
interleukin -2 inducible T -cell kinase (ITK) enhances T -cell mediated 
antitumor immunity when combined with PD- L1 blockade (Sagiv -Barfi I et 
al, 2015).  
 
Btk has also been found to be overexpressed in prostate cancer cells, 
which correlates with cancer grade, and the knockdown of Btk expression inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro (Guo W et al, 2014) . 
Therefore, inhibition of Btk may also have direct anti -
tumor activity in 
prostate cancer. In this study, the immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effects of ibrutinib will be studied in patients with localized prostate cancer in the 
neoadjuvant setting.  
Primary Objective  • To assess safety in patients with localized prostate cancer.  
• To characterize B and T cell infiltration within prostate tissue of men 
with localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant ibrutinib, and 
to compare B and T cell infiltration to a reference population of 
untreated patients who underwent RP.  
Secondary Objectives  • To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating B 
and T cells induced by neoadjuvant ibrutinib in patients with localized 
prostate cancer.  
• To determine the cytotoxic effect and clinical benefit (pathologic T0 at time of RP)  of neoadjuvant ibrutinib in  men with localized prostate 
cancer.  
Exploratory Objectives  • To examine Btk expression in prostate tumor cells and tumor -
infiltrating B cells.  
• To determine the impact of neoadjuvant ibrutinib on PD -L1 expression 
in prostate cancer cells and tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  
• To determine the effects of neoadjuvant ibrutinib on T and B cell 
repertoire within the tumor and blood.  
 
    
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 4 of 65 Study Design  This is a p hase 2 study  of neoadjuvant ibrutinib in men with localized 
prostate cancer undergoing RP as their initial locally directed therapy with 
curative intent. In the safety lead- in phase, a cohort of 6 patients will be 
treated with ibrutinib  840 mg/d x 4 weeks  to assess safety and adverse  
events (AEs). If no more than 2 out of 6 patients experience dose limiting 
toxicities (DLT), the study will continue accruing. DLTs will be assessed 
during the safety lead-in phase only, during treatment with ibrutinib and the 
period prior to RP .  To assess the immune response following neoadjuvant 
treatment, tissue from RP specimen will be compared to tissue from core biopsy specimen obtained prior to treatment, with each subject serving as his own control. Immune infiltration will also be compared to a reference 
cohort of 12 patients who had undergone RP, matched to the study 
population using the UCSF CAPRA -S score.  
Number of patients  Three patients were enrolled at UCSF in an 840 mg/d x 2 weeks cohort; 
no DLTs occurred.  At WUSM, a  safety lead- in of 6 patients will be accrued 
at the 840 mg/d x 4 week dose level. In the event that no DLTs are 
encountered, an additional 18 patients will be enrolled for a total of 24 
patients at the 840 mg/d x 4 week dose level . A full safety a ssessment will 
be carried out after the first 10 patients have completed the phase 2 study  
(6 in the safety lead- in + 4), and accrual will be suspended if 3 or more of 
these 10 patients  experience grade 3 or 4 treatment -related toxicity.  
 
If RP is delayed over 12 days after the last dose of ibrutinib therapy (i.e. 
from scheduling delay of RP), a replacement patient will be accrued. The 
maximum number of allowed replacement patients is 4 (see Section 12.4). 
Duration of Therapy  All patients will receive ibrutinib for 4 weeks prior to RP. RP will be 
performed 7 to 12 days after the last dose of ibrutinib.  
Duration of Follow up  All patients will be followed for 4 weeks after RP.  
Duration of study  The study will conclude when the last  patient ha s completed  his 4–week  
follow -up after RP. The anticipated duration of study is 18- 24 months. All 
treatment related adverse events will be fo llowed until resolution or 
stabilization to grade <2. 
Study Drugs  Ibrutinib, also known as PCI -32765 and marketed under the name 
Imbruvica, is a small molecule irreversible Btk inhibitor that has shown clinical efficacy in B cell malignancies by blocking BCR signaling. Btk 
inhibitors may prove to be efficacious for other cancers where B cells and 
BTK signaling contribute necessary mechanisms for tumor growth, 
including immunomodulatory mechanisms.  The dose of 840 mg x 4 weeks 
has been established as safe in solid tumors.  
 The dose level for the phase 2 study  is 840 mg/d  x 4 weeks. In the event 
that DLTs are encountered in 2 or more of the initial 6 patients, dose de -
escalation with cohort of 6 per dose level are as follows:  
Level -1: 840mg x 2 weeks  
Level -2: 560mg x 2 weeks  
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 5 of 65 Safety Assessments  Safety will be assessed by reviewing adverse events (AEs), laboratory 
evaluations, and by physical examination. The NCI CTCAE v4.03 will be 
used. All AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) that occur on study drug or within 
30 days after the last dose of study drug, will be recorded on case report forms (CRFs) from enrollment through 4 weeks post -surgery.  
 
The study will be halted if 4 of the first 4, or 5 of the first 9, or 6 of the first 14, or 7 of the first 18, or 8 of the first 23, or if the 9th non- hematological 
toxicity is observed before the last patient has completed the trial. Accrual will be stopped and the event will be reviewed by the Data Safety and 
Monitoring Board if a grade 5 non -hematological toxicity is observe d. 
Efficacy Assessments  For the primary endpoint s, toxicities will be assessed according to NCI 
CTCAE v.4.03  and changes in B cell infiltration within prostate tissue 
between core biopsy and RP specimen will be quantified using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). A positive result is considered to be >2 fold 
decrease in the number of B cell infiltration.  
 For the secondary endpoints, immune subsets including B and T cells will be analyzed in the blood via flow cytometry, and in the core biopsy and RP 
specimens via IHC.  
Unique Aspects of this 
Study  This is the first study to evaluate the safety of ibrutinib and its effect on  B 
cell infiltration in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with localized prostate 
cancer. The secondary and exploratory objectives will enhance our 
understanding of the immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effects of Btk 
inhibition in prostate cancer. Findings may justify further exploration of ibrutinib in prostate cancer, including combinational therapy in advanced 
prostate cancer.

Version 11/05/2021  Page 12 of 65 1 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background on Indication 
 
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer -
related death in men in Western countries. In the United States, 233,000 new cases were 
diagnosed and nearly 30,000 men died from prostate cancer in 2014 (Sieg el R et al, 2014). 
While surgery and radiotherapy are potentially curative treatments in patients with localized prostate cancer, treatment failure rates reach 35-40% (Han M et al, 2001; Kuban 
DA et al, 2003). Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with 
surgery or radiation have been investigated to reduce treatment failure rates (Goldenberg 
SL et al, 1996; Van Poppel H et al, 1995) . While these studies have shown that 
neoadjuvant ADT decreases the proportion of patients with positive margins at surgery, neoadjuvant ADT has not translated into significant benefit in meaningful clinical endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (Scolieri MJ et al, 2000) . 
Neoadjuvant therapy thus remains an investigational approach. 
 
The clinical efficacy of immunotherapies in the treatment of advanced human malignancies, and the positive impact on survival of sipuleucel -T (Sip -T) in men with 
advanced prostate cancer  (Kantoff PW et al, 2010)  has led to the investigation of the role 
of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. In a recently completed phase II study of 
neoadjuvant Sip-T for localized prostate cancer (Fong L et al, 2014) , patients received 3 
infusions of Sip-T at 2 week intervals beginning 6-7 weeks prior to RP. Neoadjuvant Sip-
T was safe and tolerable, and did not impact surgery.  Importantly, significant increases in 
CD3+ and CD4+ T cells were observed in the prostatectomy specimens, suggesti ng that 
a tumor -specific immune response can be induced via this approach.  
 
While cancer immunotherapies have largely been focused at inducing T cell mediated 
anti-cancer immune response, with strategies including cancer vaccines and immune 
checkpoint blockade, B cells have recently been increasingly appreciated to play an 
inhibitory role on antitumor immune responses. B regulatory cells (Bregs) secrete the anti -
inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. In addition, 
a significant role for B cells as promoters of tumorigenesis is their ability to inhibit T
H1 and 
cytotoxic CD8+ T cell mediated anti -tumor immunity (Gunderson AJ et al, 2013) . Targeting 
B cells in cancers in which B cells contribute necessary mechanisms for tumor growth may 
therefore prove to be a tractable strategy. 
 
1.2 Ibrutinib  
 
Ibrutinib is a first-in -class, orally administered, potent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase 
(BTK), a mediator of critical B -cell signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of 
B-cell malignancies. Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA®) is approved for the treatment of (1) mantle 
cell lymphoma (MCL) in patients who have received at least one prior therapy, (2) chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who have received at least one prior therapy, (3) 
CLL in patients with 17p deletion, (4) Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, (5) marginal 
zone lymphoma (MZL) in patients who required systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti -CD20 -based therapy, and (6) adult patients with chronic GVHD after 
failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. Ibrutinib covalently binds to the cysteine-481 amino acid of BTK and inhibits various processes, including ERK signaling, NF-κB 
DNA binding, cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) -mediated CLL-cell proliferation, and 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 13 of 65 tumor -cell migration. At concentrations relevant to exposure levels in patients, ibrutinib 
demonstrates remarkable selectivity in the inhibition of BCR signaling over TCR signaling. 
 
1.2.1 Nonclinical studies: Ibrutinib  
 
1.2.1.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
 
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 420 to 840 
mg/day, exposure to ibrutinib increased proportionally with substantial intersubject variability. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life (t
1/2) 
of ibrutinib ranged from 4 to 6 hours, with a median time to maximum 
plasma concentration (T max) of 1 to 2 hours. Despite the doubling in mean 
systemic exposure when dosed with food, the favorable safety profile of ibrutinib allows dosing with or without food. Ibrutinib is extensively metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolic pathways. The on-target effects of metabolite PCI-45227 are not 
considered clinically relevant. Steady-state exposure of ibrutinib and PCI-
45227 was less than 2-fold of first dose exposure implying non-clinically 
relevant accumulation. About 8% of ibrutinib is excreted in the urine. Ibrutinib exposure is not altered in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 30 mL/min. Patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis 
have not been studied. Following single dose administration, the AUC of ibruti nib increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8 -fold in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh 
class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function. A 
higher proportion of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in patients with B-cell malignancies (CLL, MCL and WM) with mild hepatic 
impairment based on NCI organ dysfunction working group (NCI-ODWG) 
criteria for hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic 
function.   
 For the most up to date and comprehensive pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
product metabolism information regarding ibrutinib, please refer to the 
current IB. 
 
1.2.1.2 Toxicology 
 
In safety pharmacology assessments, no treatment-related effects were 
observed in the central nervous system or respiratory system in rats at any 
dose tested. Further, no treatment-related corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation effect was observed at any tested dose in a cardiovascular study using telemetry -monitored dogs.  
 Based on data from rat and dog including general toxicity studies up to 13 
weeks duration, the greatest potential for human toxicity with ibrutinib is 
predicted to be in lymphoid tissues (lymphoid depletion) and the gastrointestinal tract (soft feces/diarrhea with or without inflammation). Additional toxicity findings seen in only one species with no observed human correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic acinar cell 
atrophy (rat), minimally decreased trabecular and cortical bone (rat) and 
corneal dystrophy (dog).  
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 14 of 65  
In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies showed that ibrutinib is not 
genotoxic. In a rat embryo-fetal toxicity study ibrutinib administration was 
associated with fetal loss and malformations (teratogenicity) at ibrutinib doses that result in approximately 6 times and 14 times the exposure 
(AUC) in patients administered the dose of 560 mg daily, respectively.
  
 
1.2.1.3 Pharmacology 
 
Ibrutinib was evaluated in vitro for its ability to inhibit purified BTK and selected members of the closely related Tec and Src/Ab1 family kinases. The concentration that inhibits kinase activity by 50% (IC50) for BTK and other kinases are listed in Table 1.2.1. With only a few exceptions, a 10-fold or greater selectivity was demonstrated for BTK relative to the off-target kinases.

*Kinases labeled with an asterisk (*) have a cysteine in the active site 
representing a possible target for covalent binding with ibrutinib.   A cellular signal transduction assay conducted to investigate ibrutinib inhibition of BCR signaling showed concentration-dependent inhibition of autophosphorylation of BTK by ibrutinib (IC
50 = 11nM), phosphorylation of 
the physiological substrate of BTK, PLCγ (IC 50 = 29nM), and 
phosphorylation of a further downstream kinase, ERK (IC 50 = 13nM). The 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 15 of 65 phosphorylation of Syk, which functions upstream or in parallel to BTK, was 
not affected (Honigberg et al, 2010) .  
 Ibrutinib inhibited the proliferation of DLBCL patient derived cell lines with a median effective concentration (EC
50) of 1 or 2nM. Ibrutinib reduced 
proliferation of primary CLL cells at concentrations of 500nM and 1000nM. Nonclinical primary pharmacodynamics studies have shown that orally administered ibrutinib inhibits tumor growth in human tumor xenograft 
murine models. Maximum ibrutinib growth inhibition of OCI-Ly10 xenograft 
tumors (81% to 140%) occurred with a once-daily oral gavage dose of 12mg/kg/day.  
 Based on preclinical data, the blockade of BCR signaling pathway by 
ibrutinib in CLL has 2 major effects: (1) direct induction of apoptosis and 
(2) inhibition of cell homing and migration to chemokines and subsequent adhesion to cellular substrates (Herman et al, 2011; de Rooij et al, 2012) . 
In preclinical models, ibrutinib caused a transient early lymphocytosis and profoundly inhibited CLL progression, as assessed by weight, development 
of hepatomegaly, and survival. Similarly, in human subjects with CLL, 
ibrutinib clinical activity (resolution of lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly) was accompanied by a transient increase in lymphocyte counts, which presumably is due to an egress of tissue-resident CLL cells into the blood.  
No treatment-related effects were observed in rat in vivo central nervous 
system (CNS) and respiratory safety pharmacology studies. No treatment-related QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) prolongation effect was 
observed in a cardiovascular study in telemetry -monitored dogs. However, 
oral administration of ibrutinib in dogs at dose levels of 24mg/kg or more 
was associated with increased PR interval, lowered heart rate and QTc 
shortening, with a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 24 mg/kg/day.  
 
1.2.2 Clinical studies: Ibrutinib  
 In healthy subjects and in patients with B-cell malignancies, ibrutinib is readily 
absorbed, with a median time to maximum concentration (T
max) of 1 to 2 hours and 
half-life of 4 to 6 hours. Exposure increases proportionally with dose. Ibrutinib is 
primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450, CYP3A. Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A, as well as strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided (See Section 7.6 for restricted medications). Ibrutinib is rapidly cleared mainly in the 
form of metabolites, and is eliminated primarily via feces with ~80% recovered mostly within 2 days.   In the current clinical development program, ibrutinib is being evaluated in over 26 ongoing and 9 completed company -sponsored clinical studies in healthy 
volunteers and in subjects with recurrent B -cell lymphomas, including chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle cell  
lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). As of data cutoff date of April 6, 2014, safety data 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 16 of 65 from nonrandomized studies  are available for 1,204 subjects treated with single 
agent ibrutinib (1,061 subjects plus 143 healthy volunteers) and for 136 subjects 
treated with ibrutinib combinations with immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy. In 
addition, one randomized comparator -controlled phase 3 study of ibrutinib 
monotherapy in subjects with CLL/SLL has undergone primary analysis in which 195 subjects received ibrutinib and 191 subjects received ofatumumab. Seven additional phase 3 trials (1115, CLL3001, CLL3002, MCL3001, MCL3002, DBL3001 and FLR3001) in subjects with CLL/SLL or non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL) are ongoing.  
 The clinical benefit of ibrutinib was first demonstrated in a phase 1 dose- escalation 
study of ibrutinib in subjects with recurrent B -cell lymphomas with overall res ponse 
rates (ORRs) ranging from 85.7% in subjects with CLL/SLL and MCL to 33.3% in 
subjects with DLBCL. These findings were further demonstrated in subsequent 
phase 2 studies in subjects with previously treated MCL or CLL/SLL, and a randomized, comparator -controlled phase 3 pivotal study in subjects with 
previously treated CLL/SLL. Activity was also demonstrated in other histologies (FL, DLBCL, WM, FL, MZL, MM) and with combination therapy (fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide, rituximab; bendamustine + rituximab; and ofatumumab). 
 
In pooled safety data for subjects treated with ibrutinib monotherapy in 11 nonrandomized studies (1102, 1117, 1112 [crossover only], 1104, MCL2001, MCL4001, 1106, 1111, FLR2002, 04753, and JPN -101) with a median duration of 
treatment of 5.1 months (range 0.0 to 30.3 months), the most frequently reported 
treatment-emergent adverse events in >10% of subjects were diarrhea (35.9%), fatigue (28.6%), nausea (20.2%), cough (17.5%), and anemia (15.2%). The most frequently reported treatment-eme rgent adverse events related to ibrutinib in >5% 
of subjects were diarrhea (25.5%), fatigue (16.0%), nausea (11.7%), neutropenia (9.1%), and thrombocytopenia (8.2%). The most common treatment-emergent 
grade 3 or 4 AEs in >2% of subjects were neutropenia (10.7%), thrombocytopenia 
(6.2%), pneumonia (5.7%), anemia (5.5%), fatigue (2.9%), hypertension (2.7%) and atrial fibrillation (2.6%). Among the 1,061 subjects in the pooled analysis of monotherapy studies, 9.4% discontinued ibrutinib therapy due to an adverse event. The most frequently reported AEs leading to treatment discontinuation included infection (e.g., pneumonia [0.9%] and septic shock [0.4%]), disease progression 
(0.6%), acute renal failure (0.4%), respiratory failure (0.4%), and 
thrombocytopenia (0.4%). No subjects discontinued ibrutinib treatment due to diarrhea. Fatal AEs were reported in 9.9% of subjects. The most frequently reported fatal AEs included progressive disease, pneumonia (1.2%), sepsis (0.6%), respiratory failure (0.5%), cardiac arres t (0.4%), and plasma cell myeloma 
(0.4%).  Safety data are available for one phase 3 randomized comparator controlled (ibrutinib vs. ofatumumab) study of ibrutinib monotherapy in subjects with CLL/SLL (ibrutinib: 195 subjects, ofatumumab: 191 subjects). As  of Nov 6, 2013 data cutoff, 
the median exposure of ibrutinib was 8.6 months (range: 0.2 to 16.1). The most 
frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in >10% subjects were diarrhea 
(47.7%), fatigue (27.7%), nausea (26.2%), pyrexia (23.6%), anemia (22.6%), and 
neutropenia (21.5%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in >5% subjects were diarrhea (32.8%), nausea (15.9%), neutropenia (13.3%), arthralgia (11.3%), petechiae (11.3%), and fatigue (9.7%). The most common 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 17 of 65 treatment-emergent grade 3 or  4 AEs in >2% subjects were neutropenia (16.4%), 
pneumonia (6.7%), thrombocytopenia (5.6%), and anemia (4.6%). In this study, 
8.2% of subjects receiving ibrutinib discontinued study treatment due to an adverse 
event. The most frequently reported AE leading to study discontinuation in the 
ibrutinib arm was pneumonia. Fatal AEs were reported for 6.2% of subjects receiving ibrutinib. The most common AEs leading to death were pneumonia (1.5%), CLL disease progression (1.0%), and sepsis (1.0%).  
 
In pooled safety data for 143 healthy subjects receiving ibrutinib monotherapy in 7 
clinical studies (CLL1001, CLL1002, CLL 1004, CLL 1006, CLL 1008, CLL 1010, and CLL 10113), treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 26.6% of subjects. The most frequently reported AEs by preferred term were headache (8.4%), diarrhea (6.3%), and abdominal pain (3.5%). No treatment-emergent 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events, SAEs, or fatal AEs were reported in healthy subjects. 
No healthy subjects discontinued study treatment due to AEs . 
 Based on currently available data, ibrutinib has an acceptable safety profile as monotherapy and when combined with chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy. 
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the first- in-human (FIH) study 
(04753) using intermittent dosing cohorts up to 12.5mg/kg/day and continuous 
dosing of 560mg or with combination therapies (up to 560mg). Data from the randomized, comparator -controlled phase 3 pivotal study also demonstrated the 
safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in subjects  with previously treated CLL/SLL when 
compared with ofatumumab.  
 
Based on positive early phase 1 and 2 data, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to ibrutinib as monotherapy for previously treated MCL, for WM and for CLL/SLL. In June 2014, ibrutinib (Imbruvica) was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with MCL, and those with CLL, who 
have received at least 1 prior therapy.  
 
A full list of completed and ongoing clinical studies with ibrutinib as well as investigator sponsored trial studies with ibrutinib can be found in the investigator’s brochure (IB).   
Integrated safety data from a total of 1,523 subjects with B -cell malignancies 
treated with ibrutinib monotherapy in 17 studies that have completed primary 
analysis or final analysis included in the CSR as of the 31 July 2017 cutoff date for 
the current IB  update in B -cell malignancies are summarized below.

1.2.2.1 Risks  
 
Bleeding-related Events   
There have been reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with 
ibrutinib, both with and without thrombocytopenia. These include minor hemorrhagic events such as contusion, epistaxis, and petechiae; and major hemorrhagic events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, 
intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria. 
 Initially, subjects were excluded from participation in specific ibrutinib Phase 2 and 3 studies if they required warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists. Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib unless specified in the protocol. 
Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided 
In an in vitro platelet function study, inhibitory effects of ibrutinib on collagen-induced platelet aggregation were observed. Use of ibrutinib in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding. See Section 7.3.1 for guidance 
on concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy and/or supplements. Ibrutinib should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post -
surgery, depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding. See Section 7.7  for guidance on ibrutinib management with surgeries or 
procedures. Patients with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been 
studied.  
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 19 of 65  
Infections  
Infections (including sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were 
observed in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Some of these infections have been associated with hospitalization and death. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in subjects who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Although causality has not been established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and hepatitis 
B reactivation have occurred in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Subjects 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms (fever, chills, weakness, confusion, vomiting and jaundice) and appropriate therapy should be instituted as indicated.  
 
Cytopenias  
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Monitor complete blood counts monthly.   
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Monitor subjects for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. If symptoms develop, interrupt ibrutinib and manage ILD appropriately. If symptoms persist, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines as 
needed. 
 
Atrial Fibrillations  
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, particularly in subjects with  cardiac risk factors, acute infections, 
and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor subjects clinically for atrial fibrillation. Subjects who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset of dyspnea should be 
evaluated clinically, and if indicated, have an ECG performed. For atrial fibrillation which persists, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines . 
  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with ibrutinib therapy. Subjects at risk of tumor lysis syndrome are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor subjects closely and take appropriate precautions. 
 
Non-melanoma Skin Cancer  
Non-melanoma skin cancer s have occurred in subjects treated with 
ibrutinib. Monitor subjects for the appearance of non-melanoma skin 
cancer.   
Diarrhea  
Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and combination therapy. Other frequently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, and constipation. These events are rarely severe and are generally managed with supportive 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 20 of 65 therapies including antidiarrheals and antiemetics. Subjects should be 
monitored carefully for gastrointestinal AEs and cautioned to maintain fluid 
intake to avoid dehydration. Medical evaluation should be made to rule out 
other etiologies such as Clostridium difficile  or other infectious agents. 
Should symptoms be severe or prolonged follow the protocol dos e 
modification guidelines.  
 
Rash  
Rash has been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherapy. Most rashes were mild to moderate in severity. Isolated cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions  (SCARs) including Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been 
reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Subjects should be closely 
monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of SCAR including SJS. 
Subjects receiving ibrutinib should be observed closely for rashes and treated symptomatically, including interruption of the suspected agent as appropriate. In addition, hypersensitivity -related events including 
erythema, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported. 
 
Hypertension 
Hypertension has been commonly  reported in subjects treated with 
ibrutinib. Monitor subjects for new onset of hypertension or hypertension 
that is not adequately controlled after starting ibrutinib. Adjust existing anti -
hypertensive medications and/or initiate anti -hypertensive treatment as 
appropriate.  
 
1.3 Rationale for the Proposed Study  
 Immunotherapy is an attractive strategy in the treatment of advanced human malignancies due to its potential to induce durable clinical responses and its low toxicity profile. 
Sipuleucel -T is the first FDA approved cancer vaccine for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Kantoff PW et al, 2010). Immune 
checkpoint antibodies targeting PD -1 and/or CTLA-4 have gained approval for the 
treatment of advanced melanoma and squamous NSCLC, and shows promise in a variety 
of other solid malignancies. While cancer immunotherapies have largely been focused at inducing T cell mediated anti -cancer immune response, B cells have recently been 
increasingly appreciated to play an inhibitory role on antitumor immune responses.  
 Ibrutinib is a potent inhibitor of BTK, which mediates critical B -cell signaling pathways and 
is critical to the survival of malignant B cells. Tumor -infiltrating B cells are increased in 
prostate cancer tissue, and high intra-tumoral density of B cells correlates with higher 
stage of disease and greater potential for recurrence or progression (Woo JR et al, 2014) . 
Unpublished data from our laboratory have shown that T cells within the prostate that are 
associated with B cell aggregates lack T cell activation markers. BTK also has inhibitory activity on other kinases including ITK, and essential  enzyme in T
H2 cells. Inhibition of 
BTK can therefore not only inhibit B cells but also potentially shift the balance between T
H1 and T H2 cells and enhance antitumor immune response. Indeed, Ibrutinib has recently 
been shown to enhance anti -PD-L1 mediated antitumor activity in preclinical models of 
lymphoma, breast and colon cancer (Sagiv-Barfi I et al, 2015) . We hypothesize that 
intratumoral B cells suppress anti-tumor immune responses in prostate cancer, and predict that ibrutinib reduces the frequency of  intratumoral B cells and enhances 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 21 of 65 the recruitment and expansion of tumor -reactive T cells into the prostate.  
 
BTK has also been found to be overexpressed in prostate cancer cells, and its expression 
level correlates with cancer grade. Furthermore, knockdown of BTK expression inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro (Guo W et al, 2014) . We hypothesize that BTK 
not only has immunomodulatory effects but also may have direct anti -tumor activity 
in prostate cancer that overexpress BTK. The goals of this study are to study the immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effects of ibrutinib in patients with localized prostate 
cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. These findings may justify further exploration of ibrutinib 
in prostate cancer, including combination therapy in advanced prostate cancer.  
 
1.4 Rationale for Study Design 
 This study will evaluate the immunologic and cytotoxic changes induced by ibrutinib in 
prostate tissues compared to pretreatment biopsies. Three patients were enrolled at the 
840 mg/d x 2 weeks dose level at UCSF and no DLTs were seen.  A safety lead-in 
consisting of 6 patients will be enrolled at the 840 mg/d x 4 weeks dose level to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib administered for 4 weeks preoperatively in patients scheduled for RP. If fewer than 2 DLTs are seen, an additional 18 patients will be treated 
with ibrutinib at the 840 mg/d x 4 weeks dose level before undergoing RP.  The safety profile of ibrutinib is well established from multiple studies in subjects treated with single agent ibrutinib (1061 subjects with B cell malignancies, 143 healthy subjects). 
Ibrutinib is generally well tolerated, and treatment related adverse events are generally manageable. The rationale for studying ibrutinib at dose of 840mg is that the dose of 
ibrutinib required for activity in solid malignancies via immune modulation and/or direct 
cytotoxicity may be higher than 560mg, the dose currently approved for hematologic malignancies. In the phase 1 study of ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory B -cell NHL and B -
cell CLL, MTD was not reached after dose escalation form 2.5mg/kg/day to 12.5mg/kg/day (Advani RH et al. J Clin Oncol 2012). The phase 1b/2 study of ibrutinib in 
relapsed/refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma showed similar efficacy and 
toxicity profiles of ibrutinib administered at 420mg and 840mg (Byrd JC, et al. N Engl J Med 2013). Recently, interim data from an open label phase 2 study of ibrutinib combined with dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma showed manageabl e 
toxicities at a dose up to 840mg (Vij R et al. ASH 2014). We therefore believe that the dose of ibrutinib 840mg will be well tolerated in patients with localized prostate cancer.  
 
1.5 Correlative Studies 
 
This study aims to evaluate the immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effects of ibrutinib in 
prostate cancer patients by comparing their pre-treatment prostate biopsy tissue to post-treatment prostatectomy tissue. Specifically, immunohistochemistry and genomic analysis 
will be carried out to analyze the following: 
1. Characterize the tumor and immune cell subsets  
2. Explore the location of tumor infiltration lymphocytes (e.g., tumor center, tumor and 
benign tissue interface)  
3. Characterize BCR and TCR clonality and diversity 
4. Examine PD -L1 expression in tumor and immune -infiltrating immune cells  
5. Examine Btk expression in B cells and tumor cells  
6. Assess rate of downstaging and pT0 rate 
7. Assess rate of PSA decline 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 22 of 65  
In addition, serum and blood will be analyzed to characterize circulating immune cell 
subsets in response to treatment.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1 Characteristics 
 
This is a single center phase 2 open label study starting with a safety lead-in ibrutinib 
administered as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer. We 
believe that the dose of ibrutinib 840mg x 4 weeks  will be well tolerated in patients with 
localized prostate cancer  based on current trial data on ibrutinib but to ensure safety, we 
will start with a safety  run-in. Previously at UCSF, 3 patients were enrolled to the 840 mg/d 
x 2 weeks dose level.  No DLTs were observed.  Beginning at WUSM, patients will be 
enrolled at the dose level of 840 mg/d x 4 weeks.  If there are fewer  than 2 DLTs, the 
Phase II dose expansion study will open and enroll up to an additional 18 patients to be 
treated with ibrutinib 840mg PO daily for 4 weeks.  
If there are ≥2 DLTs in the safety lead-in, dosing will be de- escalated as follows:  
- Level -1: 840 mg/d x 2 weeks, followed by de-escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs to Level -2 
- Level -2: 560 mg/d x 2 weeks  
 
In each enrolled patient, neoadjuvant ibrutinib therapy will be followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) performed 7 to 12 days after the last dose of ibrutinib. Pre-treatment and RP tissue will be evaluated for immunologic characterization, Btk expression and pathologic response. The proportion of patients achieving ≥ 50% PSA decline will be 
assessed. Serum will also be obtained to characterize circulating immune response. All 
patients will be followed clinically for 4 weeks after RP to monitor for adverse events.
 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 24 of 65  
3.2 Number of Subjects 
 
The safety lead-in part requires 6 patients  at the 840 mg/d x 4 weeks dose level . The 
phase II study will require a total of 24 patients (6 in the safety lead-in plus an additional 
18). A sequential stopping rule is in place during Phase II (see Section 12.5).  
If RP is delayed to over 12 days after the last dose of ibrutinib therapy (i.e. from scheduling 
delay of RP), a replacement patient will be accrued. The maximum number of allowed replacement patients is 4 (see Section 12.4).  
 To date, 3 patients have been enrolled and treated at UCSF (PI: L Fong) in Phase I/Cohort 
I (840 mg x 2 weeks) with no DLTs noted to date.

5 STUDY DRUGS 
 
5.1 Ibrutinib  
 
Ibrutinib capsules are provided as a hard gelatin capsule containing 140 mg of ibrutinib. All formulation excipients are compendial and are commonly used in oral formulations. Refer to the ibrutinib Investigator's Brochure for a list of excipients.  
 The ibrutinib capsules will be packaged in opaque high-density polyethylene plastic bottles 
with labels bearing the appropriate label text as required by governing regulatory agencies. 
All study drug will be dispensed in child-resistant packaging.   
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 28 of 65 Refer to the Pharmacy Manual/site investigational product manual for additional guidance 
on study drug storage, preparation and handling.  
 Study drug labels will contain information to meet the applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
5.1.1 Classification 
 
Cytotoxic drug: molecular targeted cytotoxic drug 
 
5.1.2 Mechanism of Action 
 
Ibrutinib is a potent (IC 50 0.39nM) orally bioavailable small -molecule inhibitor of 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). With only a few exceptions, a 10-fold or greater selectivity was demonstrated for BTK relative to off-target kinases. Upon oral administration, Ibrutinib binds to cysteine 481 of BTK and irreversibly inhibits BTK 
activity, thereby preventing both B -cell activation and B -cell mediated signaling. 
BTK is a member of the src -related BTK/Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases 
that is required for B cell receptor signaling, plays a key role in B cell maturation, 
and is overexpressed in a number of B -cell malignancies. The expression of BTK 
in other tumors has also been associated with increased proliferation, including 
prostate cancer and breast cancer (Guo W et al, 2014; Eifert C et al, 2013) .  
 
5.1.3 Contraindications 
 
Ibrutinib is contraindicated in subjects with clinically significant hypersensitivity, 
including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions to the compound itself or to the excipients in its formulation. 
 
5.1.4 Availability  
 
Ibrutinib will be supplied by Pharmacyclics Inc.  
 
5.1.5 Storage and handling 
 
Ibrutinib capsules should be stored according to the storage conditions indicated on the label. The recommended storage condition for ibrutinib capsules is 15
oC to 
25oC (59oF to 77oF) with excursions permitted to 30oC (86oF). 
 
 
6 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
6.1 Dosage and Administration  
 Ibrutinib is administered orally once daily on an outpatient basis at a dose of 8 40 mg. The 
capsules are to be taken around the same time each day with 8 ounces (approximately 
240 mL) of water, with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed intact and 
subjects should not attempt to open capsules or dissolve them in water. The use of strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers, and grapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided for the 
duration of the study .  Examples of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates can be found at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/ 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 29 of 65  
If a dose is  not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the 
same day with a return to the normal schedule the following day. The subject should not take extra capsules to make up the missed dose.  The first dose will be delivered in the clinic on Day 1, after which subsequent dosing is typically on an outpatient basis. Ibrutinib will be dispensed to subjects in bottles at each visit. Study drug may not be shipped to the subject without approval from PCYC and may 
not be dispensed to anyone other than the subject. Unused ibrutinib dispensed during 
previous visits must be returned to the site and drug accountability records updated at each visit. Returned capsules must not be redispensed to anyone.  
6.1.1 Overdose  
 
There is no specific experience in  the management of ibrutinib overdose in patients. 
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the Phase 1 study in which subjects received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1,400 mg/day). Healthy subjects were exposed up to single dose of 1680 mg. One healthy subject experienced reversible 
Grade 4 hepatic enzyme increases (AST and ALT) after a dose of 1680 mg. 
Subjects who ingest more than the recommended dosage should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.  Refer to Section 10 for further information regarding special reporting situations as 
a result of overdose.  
 
6.1.2 Regimen Description 
Study Drug  Premedication; precautions  Route  Schedule  
Ibrutinib  No premedication required  Oral       Days 1- 28 
 
Ibrutinib is supplied in 140mg capsules. Patients in the safety lead-in will be treated at a dose of 840 mg PO daily x 4 weeks.  If fewer than 2 DLTs are observed, 
patients will continue to be treated at that dose level.  If ≥ 2 DLTs are observed, 
dose de-escalation is required.  The first reduction will be to Level -1 (840 mg/d x 2 weeks) and the second reduction (if ≥ 2 DLTs are observed at Level -1) will be 
to Level -2 (560 mg/d x 2 weeks).   
6.1.3 Other Modalities  or Procedures  
 Blood samples for PSA and for immune assays will be collected at baseline, before RP, and after RP. Radical prostatectomy will be performed at Washington University , at least 7 days but not more than 12 days following the last scheduled 
dose of ibrutinib (Day 36 to 41; See Table 6.1). Information including WBC count prior to surgery, amount of blood loss during surgery and/or any post-operative 
complication(s) will be included in the safety analysis. As there is a potential for 
loss of immune cell infiltration within the prostate tissue after >12 days of not receiving ibrutinib, any patient who undergoes RP after 12 days from the last dose of ibrutinib will be included in the final analysis; however, an additional patient will be accrued as replacement. This will keep the treatment uniform in order to 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 30 of 65 evaluate for immune response. The maximum number of allowed replacement 
patients is 4.  
 
Standard institutional practices for the care and treatment of surgical patients will be followed before, during, and after each patient’s RP. Patients will be informed in the written consent that radical prostatectomy may be delayed due to adverse events resulting from study treatment, at the discretion of the investigator and performing surgeon.   
 
6.1.4 Dose Limiting Toxicities 
 
Each patient  in the safety lead-in  will be assessed periodically for the development 
of any toxicity as outlined in Section 7 Study Procedures and Observations . 
Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 .  Dose adjustments 
will be made according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity.   Dose de-escalation in this study will be based on the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur during the duration of ibrutinib therapy  and the period 
after the last dose of ibrutinib until the day of surgery. DLTs will be defined as any 
of the following that are attributable to ibrutinib.  
• Any grade 4 toxicity, including hematologic toxicities with the exception of 
lymphocytosis. Lymphocy tosis, in the absence of clinical symptoms, is 
excluded from DLT, as this may be considered an on-target pharmacodynamics effect of BTK inhibition.  
• Any grade 3 toxicity. 
• Any recurrence of the same grade 3 toxicity. 
• Any delay of RP due to study -drug related toxicity. 
• Any complications of RP (e.g., bleeding, delayed wound healing) deemed to be related to study drug. 
 
The dose of study drug should be modified according to the dose modification guidelines, including any of the following toxicities: 
• Grade 4 ANC (<500/mm
3) for more than 7 days.  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (<50,000/mm3) in the presence of clinically 
significant bleeding events. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3)). 
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if persistent, despite optimal anti-emetic and/or anti -diarrheal therapy.  
 Patients who experience a DLT may be removed from protocol therapy and undergo RP at the discretion of the operating surgeon.  
6.2 Dose Modifications for an Individual Patient Regardless of Dose 
Cohort  
 
If a patient experiences any CTCAE v4.0 grade 4 toxicity attributed to treatment, ibrutinib must be discontinued. If a patient experiences any CTCAE v4.0 grade 3 toxicity attributed to treatment, ibrutinib must be held until resolution of the toxicity to grade 1 or the patient’s 
baseline, at which time the patient may resume ibrutinib at 50% of the starting dose. If the patient experiences recurrence of the same grade 3 toxicity while on 50% reduced dose, 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 31 of 65 ibrutinib must be discontinued. If a grade 3 toxicity does not resolve to grade 1 or the 
patient’s baseline within 2 weeks of holding therapy, ibrutinib must be discontinued.  
   
Ibrutinib Dose Modifications According to Toxicity  
Event  Management  
Any grade 4 toxicity attributed to 
treatment  Discontinue ibrutinib  
Any grade 3 toxicity attributed to 
treatment  Hold ibrutinib until < grade 1, then 
resume ibrutinib at 50% starting dose  
Recurrence of the same grade 3 toxicity 
while on half dose  Discontinue ibrutinib  
Grade 3 toxicity not resolving to < grade 
1 within 2 week s Discontinue ibrutinib  
 
Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each 
patient based on individual benefit/risk assessments.  
  
6.2.1 Dose Modification for Hepatic Impaired Subjects 
 Subjects who develop acute hepatic toxicity with liver enzymes Grade 3 or higher 
while on study should be managed per standard dose modification guidelines.  
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver and therefore subjects with clinically significant 
chronic hepatic impairment at the time of Screening (Child - Pugh class C) are 
excluded from study participation. Concomitant use of strong CYP inhibitors is not permitted in subjects with chronic hepatic impairment. Refer to Appendix D for 
Child -Pugh classification. Please refer to the table below for dose modifications 
due to hepatic impairment.

* If further reduction is needed due to non -hepatic toxicity, dose may be reduced to 140 mg. In the event 
that additional reduction is needed, ibrutinib should be held for non -hepatic toxicity until resolution.  
** If further reduction is needed due to non -hepatic toxicity, ibrutinib should be held until resolution.   
 
6.3 Monitoring and Toxicity Management  
 
Each patient receiving ibrutinib will be evaluated for safety. The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical findings, and spontaneous 
reports of adverse events reported to the investigator by patients.  
 
We will monitor for potential adverse effects including but not limited to fatigue, dehydration, cytopenias, leukocytosis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, signs and symptoms of infection including pneumonia, as  well as skin disorders including rash.  
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 32 of 65  
Acute toxicity will be managed by  supportive care and/or delay of dose. Further 
management will depend upon the judgment of the treating clinician and may include dose 
reduction. Guidelines for dose modification and management of anticipated adverse events are summarized in Table 5.3.1.  
Criteria for dose adjustments and management of ibrutinib related toxicities 
Toxicity and Intensity  Dose Modification and Suggestions for Management  
Fatigue (very common)  
Grade 1 (relieved by rest)  Ensure adequate caloric intake and assess volume status. Rule out 
other causes of fatigue including anemia. Avoid prescription of 
steroids (e.g., Prednisone or Dexamethasone) which has 
immunomodulatory effects and may affect study endpo ints. 
Grade 2 (not relieved by rest, limiting instrumental ADL)  Ensure adequate caloric intake and assess volume status. Rule out 
other causes of fatigue including anemia. Avoid prescription of steroids (e.g., Prednisone or Dexamethasone) which has immunomodulatory effects and may affect study endpoints. If fatigue is not resolved to < grade 1 with supportive management, reduce the 
starting dose of ibrutinib by 140mg.  
Grade 3 (not relieved by rest, limiting self care ADL)  Ensure adequate caloric intake and assess volume status. Rule out 
other causes of fatigue including anemia. Avoid prescription of steroids (e.g., Prednisone or Dexamethasone) which has immunomodulatory effects and may affect study endpoints. Hold ibrutinib dosing until fatigue is resolved to < grade 2, at which time 
restart dose at 50% of the starting dose.  
Diarrhea (very common)  
Grade 1 (increase of <4 stools per day over baseline)  Consider Clostridium difficile testing if clinically indicated. The patient 
should be monitored carefully to ensure maintenance of fluid intake to avoid dehydration. Manage with supportive therapy including 
antidiarrheals.  
Grade 2 (increase of 4- 6 stools 
per day over baseline)  Patient should be evaluated by the treating clinician or other physicians including history and physical exam. Infectious work -up 
include Clost ridium difficile and other suspected organisms should 
be obtained. The patient should be monitored carefully to ensure maintenance of fluid intake to avoid dehydration. If infectious work -
up is negative, patient should be managed with supportive therapy including antidiarrheals. If symptoms are prolonged (e.g.,, >2 weeks) 
and do not improve with supportive management, reduce the starting 
dose of ibrutinib by 140mg.  
Grade 3 (increase of >7 stools per 
day over baseline; incontinence; 
hospitalization indicat ed) Hospitalization with management per standard institutional practices. 
Rule out Clostridium difficile . Hold ibrutinib until diarrhea < grade 1, 
then resume ibrutinib at 50% of the starting dose.

Prochlorperazine), or other antiemetic, alone or in combination can prevent nausea in the majority of patients. Avoid prescription of 
steroids (e.g., Prednisone or Dexamethasone)  which has 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 33 of 65 Toxicity and Intensity  Dose Modification and Suggestions for Management  
immunomodulatory effects and may affect study endpoints.  
Grade 2 (oral intake decreased 
without significant weight loss, 
dehydration or malnutrition; 3-5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours)  Implement one or more combinations of antiemetics. Avoid  
prescription of steroids (e.g., Prednisone or Dexamethasone) which has immunomodulatory effects and may affect study endpoints.  
Grade 3 (inadequate oral caloric or fluid intake; tube feeding, TPN or hospitalization indicated; >6 
episodes of vomiting in 24 hours)  Hospitalization and supportive management including hydration and 
caloric intake per standard institutional practices. Hold ibrutinib until nausea < grade 1, then resume ibrutinib at 50% of the starting dose

Grade 3 (ANC <1000 -500/mm3) Hold ibrutinib until neutropenia is resolved to < grade 1, at which 
time resume at 50% of the starting dose. Avoid the use of growth factors due to potential interference with immune effects of ibrutinib 
and study endpoints.  
Grade 4 (ANC <500/mm3) Discontinue ibrutinib. Growth factors such as filgrastim or 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 35 of 65 Toxicity and Intensity  Dose Modification and Suggestions for Management  
pegfilgrastim  may be used per institutional policy and in accordance 
with the ASCO guidelines . 
Febrile neutropenia (common)  
Grade 3 (ANC <1000/mm3 with a 
single temp  >38.3oC (101 F) or a 
sustained temp of >38oC (100.4 F) 
for >1 hour  Urgent admission and management including IV antibiotics per 
standard institutional practices. Hold ibrutinib until neutropenia is 
resolved to < grade 1 and any evident infection is adequately 
treated, then resume ibrutinib at 140mg lower than the starting dose. 
Avoid the use of growth factors due to potential interference with 
immune effects of ibrutinib and study endpoints.  
Grade 4 (life -threatening 
consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated)  Discontinue ibrutinib. Urgent admission and management including 
IV antibiotics per s tandard institutional practices. Growth factors may 
be used if clinically indicated.  
Leukocytosis (common)  
Grade 3 (ANC >100,000/mm3) Admit patient for close monitoring  including CBC and signs and 
symptoms of leukostasis. Hold ibrutinib until ANC normalizes, at 
which time resume ibrutinib at 50% of the starting dose.  
Grade 4 (clinical manifestations of 
leukostasis; urgent intervention 
indicated)  Discontinue ibrutinib. Supportive care including hydration and/or 
cytoreduction per standard institutional practices.  
Other ibrutinib- related AEs  
Grade 1 or 2  Maintain dose level and initiate standard supportive care. If grade 2 toxicity does not improve to < grade 1 with optimal supportive care, 
reduce ibrutinib dose by 140mg.  
Grade 3  Hold ibrutinib until resolve to < grade 1, then reduce dose by 50%.  
Grade 4  Discontinue ibrutinib.  
Frequency category is based on the following:  
• Very common: anticipated >10% 
• Common: anticipated >1% and <10%  
Notes:  
• All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. 
• If a patient requires a dose interruption of >14 days due to a study drug related toxicity, the patient 
must be discontinued from the study.  
• Patients who discontinue the study for a study related AE must be followed at least once a week for 
28 days and subsequently at 28 day intervals until resolution or stabilization of the event, whichever 
comes first.

7.1.3.1 Pregnancy 
 
Before study enrollment, subjects must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy  of a sexual partner. However, should a pregnancy 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 37 of 65 occur in the partner of a study subject, consent to provide follow -up 
information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the 
infant until 30 days old will be requested. 
 
A subject must immediately inform the Investigator if his partner becomes 
pregnant from the time of consent to 90 days after the last dose of study drug. The Investigator should counsel the subject, discussing any risks of continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus.   
 
Although pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event, the outcome will need to be documented. Any pregnancy occurring in a subject’s partner from the time of first dose up until  to 90 days after the last 
dose of study drug must be reported. Any occurrence of pregnancy must 
be reported to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, per SAE reporting 
timelines of learning of the event.  All pregnancies will be followed for 
outcome, which is defined as elective termination of the pregnancy, miscarriage, or delivery of the fetus. For pregnancies with an outcome of live birth, the newborn infant will be followed until 30 days old by completing 
the Pregnancy Report Form Part II and this must be reported to 
Pharmacycli cs Drug Safety, or designee, per SAE reporting timelines. Any 
congenital anomaly/birth defect noted in the infant must be reported as a serious adverse event.

any grade 
3. Any treatment-emergent central nervous system hemorrhage / hematoma of any grade 
 
*All hemorrhagic events requiring transfusion of red blood cells 
should be reported as grade 3 or higher AE per CTCAE  v4.03. 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 38 of 65  
Events meeting the definition of major hemorrhage will be captured 
as an event of special interest according to Section 10.4.3 above.  
 
7.1.4 Reporting to the FDA  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER 
FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the responsibility of the Washington University principal investigator to report to the 
FDA as follows: 
 
• Report any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction (refer to Appendix 5 for definitions) no later than 7 calendar 
days  after initial receipt of the information.
 
• Report a suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected (SUSAR, refer to Appendix 5) no later than 15 calendar 
days  it is determined that the information qualifies for reporting. Report  
an adverse event (refer to Appendix 5) as a suspected adverse reaction 
only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as:  
o A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known 
to be strongly associated with drug exposur e  
o One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with drug exposure but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug
 
o An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical 
trial that indicates those events occur more frequently in the 
drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group
 
• Report any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug no later than 15 calendar days after it is 
determined that the information qualifies for reporting.
 
• Report any findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest 
significant risk in humans exposed to the drug no later than 15 calendar days after it is determined that the information qualifies for reporting. 
 
• Report any clinically important increase in the rate of  a serious 
suspected adverse reaction of that listed in the protocol or IB within 15 calendar days after it is determined that the information qualifies for 
reporting.
 
 
Submit each report as an IND safety report in a narrative format or on FDA Form 
3500A or in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive.  Study teams must notify the Siteman Cancer Center Protocol Development team of each potentially reportable event within 1 business day after initial receipt of the 
information, and must bring the signed 1571 and FDA Form 3500A to the Siteman 
Cancer Center Protocol Development team no later than 1 business day prior to 
the due date for reporting to the FDA.

Events that do not require expedited reporting as described in Section 7.1 
include:  
• planned hospitalizations  
• hospitalizations < 24 hours  
• respite care  
• events related to disease progression  
 
 Events that do not require expedited reporting must still be captured in the EDC.  
8 STUDY PROCEDURES AND OBSERVATIONS  
 
8.1 Schedule of Procedures and Observations  
 
The study -specific assessments are detailed in this section. Screening assessments must 
be performed within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product. Any results 
falling outside of the reference ranges may be repeated at the discretion of the 
investigator. All on-study visit procedures are allowed a window of +/- 3 days unless 
otherwise noted. Treatment or visit delays for public holidays or weather conditions do not 
constitute a protocol violation.  
 
A written, signed, informed consent form (ICF) and a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be obtained before any study -speci fic 
assessments are initiated. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject and a copy will be filed in the medical record. The original will be kept on file with the study records.   
 
8.1.1 Pretreatment Period 
 
8.1.1.1 Informed Consent  
 
Before initiation of any screening procedures, each prospective subject will be provided a verbal, in- depth explanation of the study, requested to read 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form (ICF), and encouraged to ask questions. The Investigator must ensure that each subject understands how the study will be conducted and how they will participate if they so choose. The subject shall be given sufficient time to 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 40 of 65 properly consider the information and to make an informed decision 
regarding consent. Once all questions have been answered and the 
Investigator is assured that the subject understands the implications of 
study participation, the subject will be asked to provide written consent to participate in the study by signing the ICF. The Investigator will document the informed consent process in the subject’s medical chart or progress notes and will provide a copy of the signed ICF to the subject.

Version 11/05/2021  Page 44 of 65 8.3 Usage of Concurrent/Concomitant Medications 
 
Supportive medications in accordance with standard practice (such as for emesis, 
diarrhea, etc.) are permitted.  Use of neutrophil growth factors (filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim) or red blood cell growth factors (erythropoietin) is permitted per institutional policy and in accordance with the ASCO guidelines ( Smith 2006).  Transfusions may be 
given in accordance with institutional policy.  
 Short courses (≤14 days) of steroid treatment for non-cancer related medical reasons (e.g, 
joint inflammation, asthma exacerbation, rash, antiemetic use and infusion reactions) at 
doses that do not exceed 100 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent are permitted.  Treatment for autoimmune cytopenias are permitted for <14 days at doses that do not exceed 100 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent. 
 
Concomitant use of ibrutinib and drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A should be recorded on the CRF. Use of medications that inhibit platelet function and may increase the risk of bleeding (e.g. Aspirin) should be recorded on the CRF. Use of any medications that may have immunosuppressive effects should be recorded on the CFR.  
 All AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) that occur on study drug or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, will be recorded on case report forms (CRFs) from enrollment through 4 weeks post-surgery.  
 
8.3.1 Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants 
 
Use ibrutinib with caution in subjects requiring anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function. In an in vitro platelet function study, inhibitory effects of ibrutinib on collagen-induced platelet aggregation were observed.
 Supplements 
such  as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided during treatment 
with ibrutinib. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and petechiae, 
occurred in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Ibrutinib should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of 
bleeding (see Section 7.7).
 Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not 
been studied. 
 Subjects requiring the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (e.g. , atrial 
fibrillation), consider the risks and benefits of continuing ibrutinib treatment. If therapeutic anticoagulation is clinically indicated, treatment with ibrutinib should be held and not be restarted until the subject is clinically stable and has no signs of bleeding. Subjects should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding.  No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted. 
 
8.4 Dietary Restrictions  
 Ibrutinib can be taken with or without food at approximately the same time each day. Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A. Patients should also avoid supplements such as  fish oil and vitamin 
E preparations as they can cause an interaction with ibrutinib.  
 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 45 of 65 8.5 Prohibited Medications/Therapies  
 
The following should not be administered at any time during the study. 
• Any investigational product other than ibrutinib.  
• Systemic corticosteroid with the exception of a short course of steroids for the 
management of treatment related autoimmune cytopenias). Topical and inhaled 
steroids are allowed. 
• Anticoagulant including warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists and lower molecular weight heparin (LMWH) including enoxaparin. 
• With the exception of aspirin, anti -platelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel, glycoprotein 
IIb/IIIa inhibitors) are not allowed. 
• Vaccine therapy including influenza vaccination. However, COVID -19 vaccines 
may be allowed at discretion of investigator.  
• Hormone therapy including LHRH agonists, antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide), and 5-α -reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride)  
• Radiation therapy may not be initiated until after RP.  
 
Should subjects receive one or more of the above medications or therapies, they will 
remain on study and will continue to receive safety evaluations. Following RP, subjects 
may receive hormone therapy or radiation therapy as deemed appropriate by their medical professional.  
 
8.6 Restricted Medications 
 
Ibrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A.  
 
Concomitant use of ibrutinib and drugs that strongly or moderately inhibit CYP3A can increase ibrutinib exposure and should be avoided. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, intraconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazadone) and moderate inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole, erythromycin, aprepitant, ciprofloxacin, Diltiazem, 
fluconazole, verapamil) should be avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce the ibrutinib dose to 140mg or withhold treatm ent 
temporarily (for 7 days or less). If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce ibrutinib treatment to 140mg for the duration of the inhibitor use. No dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed.  
 
After discontinuation of a CYP3A inhibitor, resume previous dose of ibrutinib.  Administration of ibrutinib with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreases ibrutinib plasma concentrations by approximately 90%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John’s w ort). Consider 
alternative agents with less CYP3A induction.  For further information, please refer to the 
current version of the IB and examples of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates can be found 
at http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/. This website is continually revised 
and should be checked frequently for updates. 
 
Any medications known to cause QT prolongation should be used with caution; periodic 
ECG and electrolyte monitoring should be considered. 
 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 46 of 65 A standard list of prohibited and restricted medications is provided in Appendix 2. 
 
8.7 Guidelines for Ibrutinib Management with Surgeries and Procedures  
 
Ibrutinib may increase risk of bleeding with invasive procedures or surgery. The following  
guidance should be applied to the use of ibrutinib in the perioperative period for subjects  
who require surgical intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib.  
 
8.7.1 Minor Surgical Procedures  
 
For minor procedures (such as a central line placement, skin or needle biopsy, lumbar 
puncture (other than shunt reservoir access), thoracentesis, or  paracentesis) ibrutinib 
should be held for at least 3 days prior to the procedure and should not be restarted for at 
least 3 days after the procedure. For bone marrow biopsies that are performed while the subject is on ibrutinib, it is not necessary to hold ibrutinib.  A minimum of 3 days between  
prostate biopsy and start of study drug is required for patients who undergo prostate biopsy. 
 
8.7.2 Major Surgical Procedures  
 
For any surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib 
should be held at least 7 days prior to the intervention (except for emergency procedures)  
and should be held at least 7 days after the procedure and restarted at the discretion of 
the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably healed without serosanguineous drainage or the need for drainage tubes. 
 
 
9 REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION OF RESULTS  
 
9.1 Evaluation of Activity  
 
9.1.1 Characterization of PBMCs using flow cytometry  
 
The number and frequency of immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood, before, 
during and after ibrutinib therapy will be assessed. Fluorochrome-labeled antihuman antibodies, including antibodies to CD19, CD25, CD27, CD86, CD3, CD8, CD4, CD25, and FOXP3 will be used. Flow cytometry will be performed in either the Immunomonitoring Lab (IML)  or Pachynski Lab in the Center for Human 
Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs (CHiiPs) at Washington University . 
 
9.1.2 Characterization of immune infiltration within prostate tissue 
 
The effect of ibrutinib on the number of infiltrating B cells and T cells will be assessed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to CD20, IL-10, CD3, CD8, CD4, and FoxP3. Prostate tumor tissue from diagnostic core biopsy specimens 
and post-tre atment prostatectomy tissue specimens will be analyzed. Infiltrate will 
be scored by the number of cells/µm
2; thus, the number of inflammatory cells will 
be normalized to the unit area. For each patient, the change in the number of 
immune cell infiltration from the pre-treatment biopsy to post- treatment 
prostatectomy tissue specimens will be represented by the ratio of post-treatment 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 47 of 65 prostatectomy versus pre-treatment biopsy tissue specimen. IHC for immune 
infiltration will be performed in the Pachynski Lab at Washington University . 
 
9.1.3 Characterization of Circulating and Intratumoral T and B cells 
via TCR and BCR sequencing  
 
Next-generating sequencing (NGS) of the VDJ region of T-cell receptors (TCRs) 
and B-cell receptors (BCRs) will be utilized to define the TCR and BCR repertoire 
in the blood and tumor tissue before and after ibrutinib therapy. This approach allows the tracking of T and B cell clones in the blood and tissue over time to assess their expansion and migration. TCR and BCR sequencing will be carr ied 
out by Sequenta, Inc.  
 
9.1.4 PD-L1 Expression in Tumor and Tumor -Infiltrating 
Lymphocytes  
 
The expression level of PD -L1 on tumor and tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) 
will be examined using immunohistochemistry on diagnostic core biopsy specimens and post-treatment prostatectomy tissue specimens. The expression 
level of PD -L1 will be graded by an expert pathologist to determine the impact of 
neoadjuvant ibrutinib on PD -L1 expression in prostate cancer cells and TILs. IHC 
for PD -L1 will be performed in t he Pachynski Lab at Washington University . 
 
9.1.5 Btk expression 
 
The expression level of Btk on prostate cancer tissue from core biopsy before surgery will be examined using immunohistochemistry with anti -Btk antibody 
(Santa Cruz Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA; sc -1107). IHC for total Btk and phospho-
Btk will be performed in or the Pachynski Lab at Washington University. 
 
9.1.6 PSA  
 
The utility of a decline in PSA as a marker of response to neoadjuvant therapies is not well defined. However, the proportion of patients with PSA response, defined 
as >50% PSA decline, will be reported. 
 
9.1.7 Pathologic Response  
 
The proportion of patients with down-staging of disease by Gleason score will be reported. The proportion of patients with pathologic complete response (pT0) at 
the time of prostatectomy will be reported. 
 
9.2 Evaluation of Safety  
 The following will be collected to evaluate safety:  
• Adverse events (including SAEs and deaths)  
• Physical examinations  
• Vital signs  
• ECOG performance status  
• Laboratory test results  
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 48 of 65  
Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study drug. 
The study will use the CTCAE v4.03 for reporting of non-hematologic adverse events and 
modified criteria for hematologic adverse events. 
 
10 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the 
Principal Investigator will provide a Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) report to the Washington 
University Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QA SMC) semi -annually 
beginning six months after accrual has opened (if at least one patient ha s been enrolled) or one 
year after accrual has opened (if no patients have been enrolled at the six-month mark). 
 
For phase I dose escalation studies , Principal Inv estigator will review all patient data at least 
monthly (or before each dose-escalation if occurring sooner than monthly), and provide a semi -
annual report to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC). For phase II or dose expansion cohorts of a phase I study, the Principal Investigator will review all patient data at least every six months, and provide a semi -annual report to the QASMC. This report will 
include:

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND EVALUATION OF RESULTS  
 
12.1 Study Endpoints 
 
See Section 2.4 for study endpoints. 
 
12.2 Study Design  
 
This is a single center phase 2 open label study  of neoadjuvant ibrutinib in patients with 
localized prostate cancer. 
 
12.3 Sample Size and Power Estimate 
 
For this  phase 2 study, the primary endpoint is the change of B cells between the pre-
treatment biopsy and post-treatment RP specimen. Each patient’s response to 
neoadjuvant ibrutinib will be a binary classification. Patients will be considered to have a 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 50 of 65 “positive” response if there is >2 fold decrease in the number of B cells, or considered to 
have a “negative” response if there is <2 fold decrease in the number of B cells. The 
accrual of 18 patients to the phase 2 trial and incorporation of 6 patients who received 
ibrutinib at MTD in the safety lead-in  (a total of 24 evaluable subjects) will be sufficient to 
determine whether 20% or more of the cohort achieves this 2 fold decrease in B cells, 
compared to a null response of 5% or less of a reference group of patients who underwent 
RP without neoadjuvant treatment. This comparison has a power of 0.818  at a significance 
level of 0.044  based on a one-sided binomial exact test. If 4 more evaluable patients show 
a “positive” response, the treatment achieves the expected “response” rate of 20%.  
 The safety -run in will require 6 patients  (with a potential for 6-12 more if dose de-escalation 
is required). The Phase II study will require a total of 24 patients on MTD and thus 18 
additionally enrolled patients besides the 6 on MTD during the safety lead-in . 
 
12.4 Replacement Policy  
 All patients who receive a dose of ibrutinib will be analyzed for safety and efficacy. Subjects who discontinue from study participation prior to receiving any dose of study therapy may be replaced. Subjects who have received any dose of study therapy will not 
be replaced  for the safety and efficacy endpoints. Patients removed from study for 
unacceptable treatment related adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of all treatment related AEs to grade 2 or lower. However, they will not be replaced.  Patients enrolled during the safety lead-in who discontinue treatment during the 
DLT observation period for reasons other than a DLT will need to be replaced for DLT purposes.  
 Because there is a potential for loss of immune cell infiltration within the prostate tissue after >12 days of not receiving ibrutinib, any patient who undergoes RP after 12 days from the last dose of ibrutinib (i.e. from scheduling delay of RP) will be included in the final analysis; however, an additional patient will be accrued as replacement. This will keep the 
treatment uniform in order to evaluate for immune response. The maximum number of 
allowed replacement patients for delayed RP is 4.
  
 
12.5 Stopping Rules  
 
If ≥2 patients experience DLTs  during the safety lead-in , then the dose of ibrutinib will be 
reduced as follows:  
- Level -1 840 mg/d x 2 weeks ; if ≥ 2 of 6 DLTs are observed at Level -1, dosing will be 
de-escalated to Level -2 
- Level -2 560 mg/d x 2 weeks   
 If ≥2 patients experience DLTs at Level -2 , then the study will be terminated for lack of 
safety. 
 
Toxicity is continuously monitored for all patients.   
12.5.1 Non-hematological Toxicity and plans for data and safety 
monitoring 
 
Early stopping of the Phase II phase of the trial will be based on unacceptable non-
hematological toxicity. Approximately less than 15% of patients are expected to 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 51 of 65 experience grade 3 and up toxicity and a non-hematological toxicity rate of 30 % or 
more would definitely be unacceptable. Based on the sequential probability ratio 
test (SPRT) with 80% power and a 0.05 significance level, the study will be halted 
if 4 of the first 4, or 5 of the first 9, or 6 of the first 14, or 7 of the first 18, or 8 of the 
first 23, or if the 9 th non-hematological toxicity is observed before the last patient 
has completed the trial. Accrual will be stopped and the event will be reviewed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board if a grade 5 non-hematological toxicity is observed.  
 
12.6 Analyses Plans  
 
12.6.1 Analysis Population 
 
All patients who receive a dose of ibrutinib will be analyzed for safety  and efficacy . 
Subjects who discontinue from study participation prior to receiving any dose of 
study therapy may be replaced after discussion with the Study Monitor. Subjects 
who have received any dose of study therapy will not be replaced.   Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by each cohort and 
overall. In general, frequency distribution and percentage will be used to 
summarize categorical measurements, while mean with standard deviation and 
median with range will be used to describe symmetric and skewed continuous 
measurements, respectively. Univariate analysis among variables will be assessed using the two-sample t-test, Wilcoxon-rank -sum test, Chi -square test, as 
appropriate.  
 
12.6.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
 
12.6.2.1 Safety  
 
SAEs and non-SAEs will be summarized by descriptive statistics.  
 
12.6.2.2 Intratum oral Immune Infiltration  
 
For all subjects, immune cell subsets and localization will be summarized 
by changes from baseline to after treatment. Patients will be considered to 
have a positive response if there is > 2 fold decrease in the number of B 
cells, or considered to have a negative response if there is <2 fold decrease 
in the number of B cells. The proportion of patients who have “positive” 
responses will be reported, with 95% confidence intervals. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe pre -treatment biopsy immune infiltration, 
post-treatment RP immune infiltration, and immune infiltration of reference RP tissue.  
 
12.6.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 
12.6.3.1 Circulating immune subsets  
 
For each patient, flow cytometry of circulating immune cell subsets will also 
be performed on pre-treatment blood and again after RP. Established flow 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 52 of 65 cytometry panels will examine B cell and T cell populations. Immune cell 
quantification will be summarized by changes from baseline to after 
treatment using descriptive statistics.  Furthermore, paired Wilcox on 
signed-rank test will be applied to test the pre-post treatment changes.  When available, immune cells digested from resected tumor tissues will also be assessed by flow cytometry. 
 
12.6.3.2 Cytotoxic effects and clinical benefits: rate of 
downstaging, pT0 rate, > 50% PSA decline (phase II)  
 
Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of pathologic T0 rate at the time of RP will be obtained for phase 2 subjects treated with ibrutinib. Pathologic T0 rate at the time of RP will be compared with the null hypothesis rate separately by using binomial test.  
 
12.6.4 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
 
12.6.4.1 Assessment of Btk expression  
 
Btk expression on tumor tissue from pre-treatment biopsies, RP 
specimens, and any other tumor biospecimens obtained will be evaluated immunohistochemically and graded as low, intermediate or high. 
Frequency distribution and percentage will be used to summarize Btk  
expression by pre- and post- treatment. In addition, Kappa statistics will be 
used to test if there is any change of Btk expression from pre-treatment 
biopsy to post-treatment RP tissue.  
 
12.6.4.2 Assessment of PD -L1 expression  
 
PD-L1 protein expression on tumor tissue from pre-treatment biopsies, RP  
specim ens, and any other tumor biospecimens obtained will be evaluated 
immunohistochemically and scored on a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3. We will categorize tumors based on the frequency of tumor cells or of immune cells  
staining positively for PD -L1 as follows: IHC 0: <1%, IHC 1: 1-<5%, IHC 2: 
5-<10% and IHC 3: > 10%. Frequency distribution and percentage will be 
used to summarize PD-L1 protein expression by pre- and post- treatment.  
Furthermore, McNemar's test  will be used to assess the impact of the  
treatment on PD-L1 expression by considering IHC estimates of > 10% as 
being positive.  
 
12.6.4.3 TCR and BCR deep sequencing  
 
For each individual dose level, and for the phase II cohort the change in 
tumor -infiltrating BCR and TCR between pre-treatment and post-RP  after 
treatment will be assessed by calculating the number of unique clonotypes , 
read depth and Shannon diversity index. Repertoire overlap and change 
between sequencing experiments will be measured using Baroni -Urbani 
and Buser overlap i ndex  and Morisi ta’s distance, respectively .  
 
12.7 Reference Population 
 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 53 of 65 As discussed in the introduction (Section 1.1), in a prior study of neoadjuvant Sipuleucel -
T, a negative control was felt to be important to be confident that the observed changes in 
the study population were due to treatment effect since  the effect of systemic Sip-T 
administration on localized prostate cancer was unknown. Therefore, a group of 12 
patients who had undergone RP at UCSF without any neoadjuvant therapy, were selected 
prior to undergoing any tissue analyses , and were matched to the study population using 
the UCSF CAPRA -S score for preoperative risk stratification - were used as a negative 
control. These patients were selected from the surgical population at UCSF who provided 
separate, written consent to the use of their RP specimens for research purposes.  
 
Similarly, in this study, a cohort of 12 patients not treated with any neoadjuvant therapy will be used as a negative control, since the effect of neoadjuvant ibrutinib in prostate 
cancer tissue is unknown. Patients will be selected from the RP population at UCSF or 
Washington University  who provided separate, written consent to the use of their RP 
specimens for research purposes, and will be matched to the phase II study population 
using the UCSF CAPRA-S score for preoperative risk stratification. This analysis will provide confidence that the changes observed in the prostates of treated patients are due to neoadjuvant treatment effect. These 12 patients will not otherwise be included in the 
analyses as delineated in 12.6.  
 
12.8 Evaluation of Safety  
 
Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study drug.  
The study will use the NCI CTCAE v4.0.  
12.9 UCSF’s Data  
 Data from the first three patients enrolled at UCSF will be shared with Washington University under a Data Use Agreement and analyzed under the auspices of this study.

B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in  the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event 
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 
Version 11/05/2021  Page 61 of 65 o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the  ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Protocol Exceptions 
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
F. Deviation 
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

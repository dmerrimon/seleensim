4) Objectives  
Objectives: This study will compare patient reported outcomes ( PRO s) and patient 
satisfaction scores of patients seen at virtual phone visits  with patient s seen at in-person visits 
for post-operative follow up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 month s at a sports medicine clinic . 
This study will determine if there is  a difference in PRO s and satisfaction scores between 
these two groups of patients.  
 
Research hypothesis: Patients who are seen during a virtual phone visit will report different 
PRO and patient satisfaction scores compared to patients who are seen during an in -person 
visit for post -operative follow -up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 -months . 
5) Background  
Since th e WHO declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) a global pandemic 
on March 11, 2020, health systems have had to reorganize and change the way healthcare is 
provided to patients  [1]. An emphasis has been placed on social distancing to limit the sprea d 
of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2). In the past several 
months, healthcare has rapidly shifted towards telemedicine to limit the COVID -19 spread. 
Telemedicine is defined as healthcare where clinicians utilize technology a nd 
telecommunications to treat and diagnose patients [ 2]. Benefits of telemedicine has been 
found to include decrease healthcare costs, decrease overall appointment times, and similar  
patient satisfaction [ 3-4]. During the age of COVID -19, telemedicine  has played a vital role 
in allowing the conservation of resources like personal protective equipment (PPE), decrease 
in risk of clinician exposure to COVID -19, and maintain social distancing.  
Telemedicine has been researched in various medical specialties and  have been 
associated with good outcomes and patient satisfaction scores [ 5]. Based on the literature, the 
use of telemedicine in orthopedics has not been  extensively  studied. There are studies on 
virtual fracture clinics which have grown in use in the Uni ted Kingdom and Ireland, 
however, they do not utilize a live assessment model [6 -8]. One study looks at patient 
satisfaction of those seen at a regional medical center in rural Norway  through telemedicine  
[9]. Also, t here are studies exploring the use of t elemedicine to provide follow -up care after 
Patient  reported outcomes from  patients seen in virtual phone visits compared to in -person  
physical  visits  for post -operative follow -up at a sports medicine clinic: a prospective 
randomiz ed controlled trial  
 Page 3 of 13  total hip and knee arthroplasty [ 10-13] and the role of telemedicine by physical therapists as 
a viable option for virtual rehabilitation [1 4] 
However, there are few studies looking at PRO s in patients receiving orthopaedic care 
through telemedicine. PROs are an important marker of quality distinct from patient 
satisfaction because PROs are  standardized metrics of healthcare delivery. One study looked 
at the accuracy of physical exams and patient satisfaction from  post-operative follow up for 
arthroscopic knee procedures [15]. A study by Sathiyakumar et al looked at patient 
satisfaction scores during follow up from operative and non -operative management of 
orthopedic trauma injuries  and found similar satisfaction s cores between both groups [4]. 
Two studies collected both  PRO s and patient satisfaction scores of patients who attended 
telemedicine orthopaedic appointments. In Sharareh et al’s study, telemedicine visits are used 
to supplement physical follow up visits for patients that receive total joint arthroplasty [13]. 
In the other study by Grandizio et al, patients are seen for post-operative  follow -up for  upper 
extremity orthopaedic injuries  and had similar patient satisfaction scores, however PROs are 
not compared  [16].  
Before the COVID -19 pandemic, the standard of care was that after surgery, patients ar e 
seen for in -person follow up. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the standard of care has 
changed. Currently, at Harbor -UCLA Medical Center, many clinics and providers have 
started utilizing virtual phone appointments to see patients to allow social distancin g amidst 
the COVID -19 pandemic. The providers have been determining if a patient requires an in -
person visit or if a virtual phone visit would be appropriate. Virtual phone visits have been 
used for post -operative appointments, to complete pre -surgical his tory and physicals, and 
assessment of chronic medical conditions. With this study, we are creating controlled 
circumstances to determine if patients who receive virtual phone visits are satisfied with their 
care and report similar outcomes.  
We would  like t o analyze PROs and patient satisfaction scores  of patients that attend 
virtual phone visits for sports medicine injuries and compare them to scores from in -person 
physical visits. We will collect PROs and patient satisfaction scores from patients who atten d 
appointments at their 6-week , 12-weeks  and 6-month  post-operative appointment s.  
6) Setting of the Human Research  
Harbor -UCLA Department of Orthopaedic Surgery Sports Medicine Clinic  
7) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research  
Based on patient s cheduling, there are approximately 4 -6 new patients every week  who 
would be a potential Patient . We will need to recruit 50% of those potential  Patient s over a 6-
month  course.  
 
It will only be those doctors (residents) and research assistants listed on the study  
involved in recruiting patients . Once COVID is over, we will have research assistant 
involvement outside of residents and will make an addendum to the application to 
include them in the future.   
Our facilities will offer tablets which Participant s can use to answer surveys. The 
tablets are approved by HUMC Hospital Admin for use in clinic. The tablets belong 
Patient  reported outcomes from  patients seen in virtual phone visits compared to in -person  
physical  visits  for post -operative follow -up at a sports medicine clinic: a prospective 
randomiz ed controlled trial  
 Page 4 of 13  to HUMC and the IT department will help us set them up. The tablets will be secured 
in the physician work area under lock and key.  
The facil ities staff will be notified that this study is taking place, so that if a 
Participant contacts the staff about the study, they know who to redirect and call.  
The surveys are to  be completed by all participants of the study . Surveys are on 
REDCap s hosted by Lundquist 
(https://research.lundquist.org/redcap/surveys/?s=NK3YH4NWL3 ) and are done 
online.  This study will deliver the surveys in the  same manner  to participants that 
attend in -person visits and virtual visits. REDCaps will allow us to collect 
participants’  clinical data . The REDCap administrator is aware that these surveys are 
collected for research purposes . The surveys will result in  a score. This score from 
REDCaps wi ll be part of the DHS medical record.  Any Participant  that is part of the 
study and present for an in -person post -operative appointment will receive a tablet to 
complete the survey  after  their appointment . Any Participant  in the virtual phone 
group will receive an email with the survey to complete after  attending a virtual 
phone visit or if the Participant is having difficulty , one of the research staff go 
through the questions with the Participant  over the phon e. 
8) Prior Approvals  
No prior approvals are needed for this study.  
9) Study Design  
a) Recruitment Methods  
When: Participants will be recruited at the pre-op visit, day of surgery, or in -
person 2-week post-operative visit.  
Where: The Participant  will be r ecruited at Harbor -UCLA Medical Center in-
person .  
Researchers want to allow patients to have enough time to read the information 
sheet and consider participation in this study.  
In-person  consent will be done at any in -person visit including the pre -operative 
appointment, day of surgery, and at the routin e 2-week postop visit . 
How: The  Participant  will be recruited in -person.   
Source of the Participants : Patients that present to the Harbor -UCLA Medical 
Center sports medicine clinic  that have scheduled operative intervention.  
Methods to identify potential Participants : When patients of the sports medicine 
clinic have planned operative intervention, study team member  will go through 
the patient charts to see if patient meets criteria and then discuss and consent  the 
Participant  in-person . 
Materials to recruit  Participants : Patients who meet criteria will be given the 
information study sheet to review on their own.

randomiz ed controlled trial  
 Page 5 of 13  There are no payments to any of the Participants . 
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteria:  
 
Participants are at least 18 years of age. Participants  who are seen at Harbor -UCLA 
Medical Center sports medicine clinic.  Participants  have  agree d to have operative 
intervention. Participants  must own a phone with reliable calling capabilities.  The 
Participants  must h ave access to reliable internet to fill out the online survey.  The 
Participants  must be able to provide consent . Participants may include pregnant patients.  
Participants who start out in the virtual phone pathway, and the clinician deems person to 
require an in -person appointment at the 2-week  follow -up visit can be moved to the in -
person pathway.   
Exclusion criteria:  
Patien ts that are under the age of 18, any cognitive impaired adult, and any adult unable 
to provide consent . 
c) Local Number of Participants  
For a statistical significance of 0.05, Power of 80%, and assuming a medium 
effect size of 0. 8, 26 patients are required  per group for a total of 52 Participants .  
The number of Participants  need to complete the research procedure are 52.  
Locally we will attempt to recruit at least 104 Participants . This will allow room 
in case of patients are removed or fall from the study.  
d) Study -Wide Number of Participants  
This is not a multicenter study.  
e) Study Timelines  
The study will be ongoing until the appropriate number of Participants  are 
recruited from this site . 
The duration of an individual Participant’ s participation i n the study will be  from 
initial visit where consent is asked until completion and submission of the surveys 
at their 6-month  post-operative appointment.  
The duration anticipated to enroll all study Participants  will be 6 months .  
The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study  (complete primary 
analyses) is December 202 3. 
f) Study Endpoints  
Primary study endpoints: Pa rticipant reported outcome scores through PROMIS  Global .

shoulder and elbow injuries via QuickDash . Patient appointment satisfaction score s will 
be su rveyed.  
g) Procedures  Involved in the Human Research  
There are no procedures performed.  
The mentioned above surveys will be attached to this document.  
Study Design:  
In this prospective study, we will enroll patients undergoing operative 
intervention at a Sports Medicine clinic.  
The patient will arrive at the 2 week post -operative appointme nt to sign the 
consent form in the presence of study team member and  a witness in order to be 
eligible to participate in the study.  
After consent is obtained, the Participant  will be randomized to either in-person 
follow up or virtual phone follow up to take place after the 2-week  post-op visit. 
The virtual visits will occur using the same platforms th at they are currently 
taking place in accordance  and required by LA County DHS/HUMC.  
The randomization process will utilize block randomization and be conduc ted by 
an online program called http://www.randomization.com .(Wichmann and Hill, 
1982, as modified by McLeod, 1985) . The Participant  will be assigned a number 
based on the order the Participant  is enrolled in the study and that number will be 
randomly assigned to a follow -up group based on that number.   
The Participant  will be notified at the 2-week  post-op or after  if they will receiv e 
in-person follow up or virtual phone follow -up. If the Participant in the virtual 
phone group  feel they need an in -person visit, the Participant will be free to make 
an in -person follow -up. After each follow up visit ( 6-week , 12-week, and 6 -
month), the Participant  will be asked to fill out 30-minute surveys.  
The surveys the Participant will be asked to fill out are the  following :  
1. KOOS - a knee  specific  survey   
2. Quick  Dash  Outcome  Measure   
3. PROMIS  Global  
4. General  Health  Questionnaires  (2) 
5. Patient  Satisfaction  Survey  -We will have  the patient  complete  this also after 
every  visit to see if their preferences  change  over time as their recovery  changes.   
  
If a Participant  attend s an in -person post -operative follow up visit, then the study team 
member will check to see if the participant  is on the in -person list. If the participant  is on 
the list, then he or she will be given a tablet to fill out the online  surve y after the 
appoin tment . The tablet will be set up so a link to the surveys can be accessed and 
participants  can fill out the surveys. The surveys are on REDCaps 
(https://research.lundquist.org/redcap/ surveys/?s=NK3YH4NWL3 ). Patient s will be able 
to fill out the survey at home. For Participants that attend a virtual appointment, an online 
Patient  reported outcomes from  patients seen in virtual phone visits compared to in -person  
physical  visits  for post -operative follow -up at a sports medicine clinic: a prospective 
randomiz ed controlled trial  
 Page 7 of 13  link to the survey on REDCap will be sent to the Participant ’s email. Members of the 
study team can also call the participant to conduct the survey over the phone. The emails 
will be made secure by having them sent out from an  official DHS email that uses 
Microsoft outlook and requires double verification to logon. The content of the email 
message is included in the IRB submission as a separate document.  
 
The first page of the survey asks for the Participant’s  name, date of bir th, and preferred 
language  (English or Spanish), how comfortable filling out the form, who is completing 
the form, which joints, amount of pain, and amount of back pain.  The second  page of the 
survey will be a joint specific survey and will depend on the joint selected on the first 
page and the language chosen. It can be the KOOS, QuickDash Outcome Measure, or 
PROMIS Global.  There is a separate patient satisfaction survey that the patient will 
comple te. 
 
Participants  will have appointments with the surgeon for suture removal (10 to 14 days 
after surgery),  and evaluation at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery per usual 
practice.  
 
The source records that will be used to collect data about the Participants  are the surveys , 
and type of surgery, and results of follow up visits . The data collected will be asked on 
the surveys which include demographic information - Participants’  injury region, age, 
gender, and time since operative intervention.   
Study coordinator  will check  the upcoming Participant  schedule  and ensure the 
correct appointment is scheduled.  
h) Data and Specimen Banking  
None. No data or specimen banking will be done.  
i) Data Management /Statistical Analysis  
Statistical analysis will be conducted to compare the total scores of each  survey 
results from participants in the in -person group with participants in the virtual 
phone group. Each Participant  outcomes scores will be averaged with standard 
deviation calculated.  
Participant  outcomes scores from e ach appointment time frame (6 -week, 12 week, 
and 6 months) will be compared across the in -patient group and virtual phone 
group using Student t -test. Statistical significance will be based on an α level of 
0.05.  
To determine if there is a difference among  the Participants’  preference for an in -
person visit or telemedicine visit , we will conduct a chi -squared test comparing 
the percentage of Participant  responses from t he in -patient group with responses 
from virtual phone group.  
Within eac h category, to determine if Participant’s  satisfaction changed as time 
progressed, we will conduct an Analysis of Variance. This will help us determine 
Patient  reported outcomes from  patients seen in virtual phone visits compared to in -person  
physical  visits  for post -operative follow -up at a sports medicine clinic: a prospective 
randomiz ed controlled trial  
 Page 8 of 13  if Participants  who experience virtual phone visits start to have changing 
satisfaction the longer time has elapsed since initial operative intervention.  
The PROMIS Global  is used to calculate the required sample size as it as the 
largest range of the outcome measures resulting in the most conservative 
estimates.  
For a statistical significance of 0.05, Pow er of 80%, and assuming a large  effect 
size of 0. 8, 26 Participants  are required per group for a total of 52 Participants.   
At the end, study data will be exported into excel sheets. All the data collected will be on 
an excel spreadsheet for purposes of the study. Individual surveys will not be 
downl oaded. At that time, all identifiers will be removed and a de -identified data set is 
maintained and analyzed.  At this time, the study team  will not be able to identify which 
data belongs to which participant. Once this occurs, a subject will not be able to request 
removal of their data. This spreadsheet will be stored on the secure One Drive Microsoft 
account which uses double authentication  and is provided to all DHS employees.  Data 
originating from the surveys will also be kept in a password -protected location on the 
Harbor -UCLA One Drive Microsoft account. Data will be stored for 3 years after study 
completion.  Access to the data will be g iven only to those registered with the study.  
Signed consent documents any other paper records are kept in a locked cabinet in 
a locked office with limited access. The data will be stored for 3 years after 
completion of the research project.  
The only indi viduals with access to the information will be members of the study 
team.  
j) Confidentiality  
A list of Participants  participating in the study will include the Participant ’s name, 
element of dates, which experiment group the Participant  is a part of, MRN, and phone 
number and email , and study ID number. No health information is recorded with this list  
This list is be kept on the Harbor -UCLA One Drive Microsoft account and available to 
the research team.  All health data required will be r ecorded in REDCap hosted by 
Lundquist and the data will include direct identifiers such as name.   
 
k) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
This research does  not result in  more than minimal risk to the Participants . 
l) Withdrawal of Participants  
Participants  can withdraw from the study at any time.  
The procedure for orderly termination is that the Participant  will notify any staff 
member including nurses or providers. The study coordinator will be notified and 
the Participant’s  name, MRN, and emai l will be removed from the data list.  
The Participant’s  survey responses will be linked to Patient  identifiers so it will be 
possible to eliminate the Participant’ s responses.

physical  visits  for post -operative follow -up at a sports medicine clinic: a prospective 
randomiz ed controlled trial  
 Page 9 of 13  10) Risks to Participants  
Participants  may feel inconvenienced having to stay 30 minutes  longer to complete 
the survey on the tablets if you are attending an in -person visit.  
Participants  may also experience inconvenience or frustration if the survey system 
freezes and does not operate appropriately. You may also feel bored or tired.  
Risk Mi tigation  
The exclusion criteria exclude  any minors,  prisoners , and adults who cannot give 
consent, from participating in the study.  
Participants  will be given the opportunity to pick a time convenient for them to 
answer the questionnaire s after the virtual phone visit . Participants part of the in -
person visit will answer survey s after the visit . Partici pants are encouraged to answer 
all questions. If they skip any questions or the survey is not answered completely, 
their survey may be removed. Participants may stop at any time.  They may skip any 
questions they do not wish to answer, and they may stop at any time.  Participants  may 
withdraw from the study at any time.  To decrease risk mitigation, the data will be 
kept on REDCap hosted by Lundquist. Only members of the research team will have 
access to the data information.  
11) Potential Benefits to Participants  
We cannot promise any benefits to  Participants or others from taking part in this 
research. We cannot promise any benefits to others from taking part in this research.  
The st udy poses no more than minimal risk with the main risk a breach of 
confidentiality and the study involves ensuring patient reported outcome surveys 
completed consistently (which is currently not done in the current clinical setting) and 
scoring calculated and recorded in the medical record  
12) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants  
All partici pation and questionnaires in this study are optional. It is made clear to the 
Participants  that their participation is voluntary.  If Participants  would like additional 
appointments, they are free to contact their provider to schedule another one. 
Participa nts that are in the virtual phone group are free to contact their provider to 
schedule an in -person visit if they choose to or if their provider would like to see 
them for an in -person visit. Participating in the study, completing the surveys will not 
impa ct the quality of care provided to the participant . 
13) Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
This research does not involve more than minimal risk.  
14) Economic Burden to  Participants  
There is no economic burden to Participants . There is the burden of time to 
participate and fill out the survey.

physical  visits  for post -operative follow -up at a sports medicine clinic: a prospective 
randomiz ed controlled trial  
 Page 10 of 13   
15) Consent Process  
The Participants  will be identified as patients presenting at the Harbor -UCLA 
Orthopaedics Sports medicine clinic who agree to operative intervention. Patients will 
receive a study consent form to review on their own. The study team member will go 
through the patient char ts to determine patients that meet the inclusion criteria and 
then provide the patient with the study consent form. At the pre -operative visit for 
surgical planning and signing of the surgical consents, all patients will be given a 
study consent form and a sked to participate in the study. The study will be explained 
to the patient, questions will be encouraged and answered,  and the patient will be 
asked to sign the consent if they wish to participate in the study.  
A member of the research team will make it  clear that the patient can come in for an 
in-person visit if they wish and at any time for their post -operative care. The patient 
can also choose to spend more time to considering participating in the study.  
Potential Participants  who meet the eligibilit y requirements will be approached by a 
study team member at a pre -operative visit or their 2 -week in -person follow up visit.  
The participant will be provide d a copy of the consent document and PHI 
authorization and the study team member will engage in a t horough discussion of the 
study explaining what it entails, risks, benefits, alternatives, etc. and answer all of the 
participants ’ questions. The Participants are free to choose not to participate in the 
study. Participants are told if they decide not to t ake part in the study, there will be no 
penalty to them, the study will not affect any of their regular benefits, and they will 
continue to receive regular care. The participant will be encouraged to discuss the 
study with his/her family member or friends before deciding . The participant will be 
given ample time to make his/her decision on whether  to participate.  
 
The study team member will ask the Participant questions about the study  (e.g., what is the 
purpose, what they  do while in the study, how long participation lasts, etc.) to ensure 
Participant understands the study. If the Participant is interested in participating, s/he will 
sign the consent to document their agreement to volunteer to participate in the study.  
 
At any time , potential Participants can request additional time to think about the study, or to 
decline participation. All questions the Participant have will be answered to the satisfaction 
of the Participan t. The Participant  will also have study personnel ’s phone number  in case 
they have additional questions that come up later.   
 
Patients who are not yet adults will be excluded from the study. Parental permission will not 
be needed since children under the a ge of 18 will be excluded from this study. Cognitively 
impaired adults are excluded from the study. Adults that are unable to consent will not be 
part of the study.  
 
We will  review and follow HRP -090 SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research

Spanish -speaking  Participants  are also to be enrolled in the study. We will ensure all 
documents and surveys are available in Spanish. Oral communication will be provided 
through a staff member who is compliant and trained t o communicate with the Spanish 
speaking population. The consent document and PHI authorization will be translated by a 
certified translation service per the IRB requirements. In addition, the PROMIS, KOOS, 
QuickDash, and Participant surveys will be validated in Spanish.  
16) Process to Document Consent in Writing  
The research is not FDA regulated . 
We will review and follow HRP -091: Written Documentation of Consent  
17) Vulnerable Populations  
This study does not involve individuals who are vulnerable.  
This study will exclude adults unable to consent, individuals under the age of 18, and 
prisoners.  
18) Drugs or Devices  
This does not involve drugs or devices.  
19) Multi -Site Human Research  
This is not a multi -site human research project.  
20) Community -Based Participatory Research

1. Endpoints and Other Outcomes 
 
This section describes the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, as well as safety and other outcomes.   
 
1.1. Primary Endpoint 
 
Objective : To demonstrate acceptable safety and tolerability of tofacitinib in early dcSSc. 
 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who experience Grade 3 or higher (more severe) adverse events that occur at 
or before Week 24 (double-blind phase).   
 
1.1.1. Primary Analysis of the Primary Endpoint.   
The proportion of subjects in the safety population (see Section 2.1) with at least one Grade 3 or higher adverse event that begins at 
or before Week 24, the double-blind phase of the trial, will be calculated and compared for each of the study treatment arms.   
 
1.1.2. Secondary Analysis of the Primary Endpoint.   
To assess the robustness of the results for the primary analysis, an analysis of the total number of Grade 3 (severe) or higher adverse 
events that begin at or before Week 24 will also be compared for each of the study treatment arms. 
 
1.2. Secondary Endpoints  
 
1.2.1. Secondary Endpoint.  Analyses of the Primary Endpoint Over Time. 
The analyses of the primary endpoint described in sections 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 will be repeated at Weeks 12 to assess the time course of 
the safety profile as defined by the occurrence of Grade 3 or higher adverse events. 
 
1.2.2. Secondary Endpoint.  Analyses of the Adverse Events at the Grade 2 Threshold.   
The analyses described in sections 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 will be repeated for adverse events beginning at or before the time point of 
interest that are assessed as at least Grade 2 (moderate) severity.  
 
1.2.3. Secondary Endpoint.  % of Subjects with Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI).  
The proportion of subjects in the safety population experiencing an AESI will be compared between the two study treatment arms.    
Comparisons will be made for at least one AESI of any type, as well as for each of the events that are considered to be of special 
interest individually.   Separate analyses will be performed for AESIs that occur at or before Weeks 12 and 24.  AESIs are defined to 
be any one of herpes zoster, malignancy, serious infection, lymphocytes <500cells mm3, ANC <500cells mm3, AST > 3xULN, ALT > 
3xULN, Hy’s Law criteria met, Hemoglobin drop > 2mg/dL, increase in HDL/LDL ratio > 50%, or an increase in serum creatinine > 50%. 
 
1.2.4. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in the Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS).  
Change from baseline in the mRSS total score will be compared between the two treatment arms to assess skin thickness relative to 
the initiation of study treatment at the various time points.   The analysis will be performed separately at Weeks 12 and 24 on 
subjects in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (see section 2.1). 
 
1.2.5. Secondary Endpoint. Provisional American College of Rheumatology Combined Response Index in Systemic Sclerosis

(mITT) population (see section 2.1). 
  
1.2.6. Secondary Endpoint.  % of Responders as Defined by the mRSS.  
Subjects in the mITT population will be assessed for reaching clinical thresholds of decreased skin thickness over time as defined by a 
percentage reduction in the mRSS from baseline.   Time points assessed will be Weeks 12 and 24, and analyzed separately.   Within 
each of these time points, separate analyses will be performed for decreases (responder definition) of at least 20, 40, and 60% 
relative to the baseline mRSS total score.   
 
1.2.7. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in the mRSS sub-scores. 
Change from baseline in the mRSS representative score and maximum score will be compared between the two study treatment 
arms for the mITT population of subjects at Weeks 12 and 24 separately.    
 
1.2.8. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in Physician Global Health Assessment. 
Change from baseline in the physician’s global health assessment will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the 
mITT population of subjects at Weeks 12 and 24 separately, to determine overall progression of disease severity as determined by 
the subject’s physician.    
 
1.2.9. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in Patient Global Health Assessment. 
Change from baseline in the patient’s global health assessment will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the 
mITT population of subjects at Weeks 12 and 24 separately, to determine overall progression of disease severity as determined by 
the subject.    
 
1.2.10. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) using the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29). 
Change from baseline in the HRQoL total score will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the mITT population of 
subjects at Weeks 12 and 24 separately to determine perceived overall changes in quality of life since the initiation of study 
treatment as determined by the subject.    
 
1.2.11. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (SHAQ-
DI). 
Change from baseline in the SHAQ-DI total score will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the mITT population 
of subjects at Weeks 12 and 24 separately to determine perceived overall changes in the subject’s functional ability since the 
initiation of study treatment as determined by the subject.    
 
1.2.12. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in the UCLA SCTC Gastrointestinal Symptoms Total Score (GIT). 
Change from baseline in the UCLA SCTC GIT will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the mITT population of 
subjects at Weeks 12 and 24 separately to determine changes in the subject’s gastrointestinal symptoms since the initiation of study 
treatment.    
 
1.2.13. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Baseline in the PRO for Scleroderma-related Skin Symptoms (PRO-SRSS) Total Score. 
Change from baseline in the PRO-SRSS will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the mITT population of subjects 
at Weeks 12 and 24 separately to determine changes in the subject’s overall skin symptoms since the initiation of study treatment.    
 
1.2.14. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Screening in Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT). 
Change from screening PFTs will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the mITT population of subjects at Weeks 
12 and 24 separately for each of percent predicted FVC, FEV and DLCO.    
 
1.2.15. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Screening to Week 24 in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (Maximum of Range). 
Change from screening ejection fraction will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the mITT population of 
subjects at Week 24.    
 
1.2.16. Secondary Endpoint.  Change from Screening to Week 24 in Tricuspid Regurgitation Jet. 
Change from screening tricuspid regurgitation jet will be compared between the two study treatment arms for the mITT population 
of subjects at Week 24.    
 
1.3. Exploratory Endpoints 
Analyses of each of the secondary endpoints will be provided at weeks 36 and 48, provided the item was collected.   
 
1.4. Additional Measures  
Additionally, the following measures will be provided descriptively (no inferential analyses) by study treatment arm for the safety 
population: 
 Clinical laboratory values over time. 
 Vital signs over time. 
 Physical examination findings. 
 Concomitant medication. 
 
 
2. Analysis Strategy 
 
No formal interim analyses of the primary endpoint were conducted, therefore the nominal α level to be used at the final analysis is 
0.10 for the primary endpoint.  All other secondary outcomes will also be tested at the 10% level, with no adjustment for 
multiplicity.  Given the limited statistical power for a study consisting of 15 subjects, models will not include covariates.   
 
2.1. Study Populations    
 
Two study populations will be defined for these analyses: 
 Modified Intent to Treat (mITT):  The mITT analysis set consists of all subjects randomized, receiving at least one dose of 
treatment, and having at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment for the given parameter.   No imputation techniques 
will be utilized for missing observations.  
 Safety:  The safety population consists of all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of the study drug.    
 
 
2.2. Analyses of Primary Endpoint 
 
The primary analysis is a comparison of the percentage of subjects with Grade 3 adverse events that begin within the first 24 Weeks 
following initiation of study treatment between tofacitinib and placebo.  The analysis will be performed on the safety population.   
The test will be performed using Fisher’s Exact Test, given that the largest possible number of patients affected are 10 and 5, 
respectively, for tofacitinib and placebo.   The number and percentage of patients with at least one Grade 3 adverse event will be 
provided along with Clopper Pearson Exact confidence intervals for proportions at the 90% threshold.

2.2.2. Secondary Analysis of the Primary Endpoint. 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess how the total number of Grade 3 or higher adverse events, rather than just the 
proportion of patients experiencing the events, affect the conclusions of the analysis of the primary endpoint.   The analysis will 
employ Poisson Regression methodology, offset for time in the study (the lesser of 24 weeks, or withdrawal from the trial).

1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives  of this research . 
Response: The proposed research will translate research on delay discounting to 
the prevention of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in persons with prediabetes. In this 
study, we will  test our ability to engage and change the target, delay discounting 
(DD).  
1.2 State the hypotheses to be tested , if applicable.  
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to 
happen in your study that corresponds with your above listed objectives.  
Response: We predict that poverty conditions will increase disc ounting of the 
future for ERT subjects, but those receiving EFT will show levels of DD similar 
to levels observe d for participants in the neutral  condition. We also predict that 
EFT will activate brain regions associated with delay of gratification and 
prospection, and improve executive functions related to EFT, such as working 
memory . 
2.0 Scientific  Endpoints  
 
2.1    Describe  the scientific  endpoint (s), the main result or occurrence under 
study.

whether the objectives of the study have been met and to draw conclusions from the data.  
Include primary and secondary endpoints.   Some example endpoints are :  reduction of 
symptoms, improvement in quality of life, or  survival.   Your response should  not be a 
date.    
 Page 6 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  Response:  The primary endpoint is the reducti on of discounting of the future and 
increase activation in regions associated with delay of gratification and 
prospection . 
3.0 Background  
3.1 Provide the scientific or s cholarly background, rationale, and significance 
of the research  based on the existing literature an d how it will contribute to  
existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in current knowledge.  Include  
relevant pr eliminary findings or prior research by the inv estigator.   
Response: DD has been related to several adverse health behaviors 
including smoking (Bickel et al., 1999) and obesity (Rollins et al., 2010). 
Our laboratories have extensive experience collecting information about 
DD and these various health outcome behaviors.  
Initial research on Type 2 diabetes (T2D) using a brief monetary choice 
questionnaire showed T2D individuals who discount the future have worse 
metabolic control than those who delay gratification (Reach et al., 2011). 
To our knowledge, there has been no research on the effects of EFT on 
DD among patients with prediabetes.  
Adults with greater DD is associated with obesity (Appelhans et al., 2012), 
and low activation of brain sites critical for self -control in DD predicts 
longitudinal wei ght gain in adults (Kishinevsky et al., 2012). Likewise, 
inability to delay gratification predicts greater subsequent weight gain in 
young children (Francis and Susman, 2009) and poorer response to 
evidence -based pediatric weight control programs (Seeyave et al., 2009).  
In turn, the prevalence of T2D is associated with obesity (Kahn et al., 
2006). Moreover, T2D (Vanhanen et al., 1997, Kanaya et al., 2004, Yaffe 
et al., 2004) and risk for T2D (Vanhanen et al., 1997) are associated with 
increased risk of exe cutive dysfunction. This association suggests one of 
two possibilities: (1) diabetes causes a decline in executive function, or (2) 
inadequate executive function contributes to obesity and then diabetes. In 
either case, the relationship between executive f unction and both obesity 
and diabetes can present challenges in adhering to behavioral and medical 
therapies (Smith et al., 2011, Primoži č et al., 2012). Poor planning, low 
working memory, cognitive inflexibility, poor attention to detail in 
combination wi th excessive DD can lead to weight gain and poor 
metabolic outcomes.  
Research supports Episodic Future Thinking (EFT), self -projection into the future 
to pre -experience an event (Atance  & O'Neill, 2001), as an effective approach to 
reduce bias towards immediate gratification (Daniel & Epstein, 2013; Daniel, 
Stanton, & Epstein, 2013). However, little is known about EFT’s effect in 
individuals at risk for Type 2 Diabetes. Understanding the  effect of EFT in 
prediabetics can be efficacious in translating this technique into an efficacious 
health intervention.

4.0 Study Design  
4.1 Describe and explain the study design  (e.g. case -control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational).  
 Page 10 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  Response: This study is an experimental between -subjects design; subjects in the 
behavioral arm  will be randomized to poverty/neutral scenarios crossed with 
EFT/ERT in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Subjects in the fMRI arm will be randomized 
to one of two groups: episodic future thinking (EFT) versus episodic recent 
thinking (ERT) control.  
5.0 Local Number of Subjects  
5.1 Indicate the total number of subjects t hat will be enrolled or records that 
will be reviewed  locally.  
Response: Up to 100 -150 subjects  will be enrolled (up to 250 nationally) with 50 -
75 enrolled in each arm of the study. In addition, a small sample (approximately 
4-6 subjects) will be assigned to be pilot participants to help with quality 
assurance and data validity procedures. Participants will be informed if they are a 
pilot par ticipant at the time of consent.  
5.2 If applica ble, indicate how many subjects you expect to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your screen failure rate).   
Response: We expect to screen approximately 250  subjects to reach our target 
sample with about a 40% attrition  expected based on the screen f ail rate and a 
50% MRI ineligible rate from the previous two studies, MINDD 1  (Aim 1) and 
MINDD 2 (Aim 2).  
5.3 Justify the feasibility of recruiting the proposed  number of eligible  subjects 
within the a nticipated  recruitment period. For example, how many poten tial 
subjects do you have access to? What percentage of those potential subjects 
do you need to recruit?  
Response: The Division of Behavioral Medicine has access to a password 
protected database  that has been approved for use by previous IRB committees  
(385420, 389912, 385442 030-796526, STUDY00000936) . This is a large 
database of people interested in participating in future studies. Research staff has 
extensive experience using the database for recruitment purposes and we feel 
confident that we can recruit the required number of subjects from this database 
and through our community based efforts. In addition, physicians will refer 
people from their clinics that may be interested in participating.  
6.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria  
6.1 Describe the criteria that de fine who will be included  in your final study 
sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response: Adults: Participants must be 18 years of age or older to 
participate.  
Prediabetes: Participants must have a diagnosis of prediabetes within the 
last 2 years or meet criteria for prediabetes or meet criteria for prediabetes 
during screening for the study. The American Diabetes Association 
guidelines (Group, 2003) defines prediabetes as Fasting Plasma  Glucose 
 Page 11 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  (FPG) 100 -125 mg/dl, 2h glucose 140 -199 mg/dl after Oral Glucose 
Tolerance Test (OGTT), or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) approximately 5.7 -
6.4%.  
 
6.2 Describe the criteria that define who will be excluded  from your final study 
sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response:  Type  2 Diabetes : Individuals will be excluded if they have Type 2 
Diabetes.  
Pregnancy : Women who are pregnant or lactating will be excluded from 
participation.  
Substance use, abuse, or dependence : Individuals that currently have problems 
with substance depend ence, addiction, or problematic substance use that would 
limit participation (e.g., binge drinkers, alcoholics, daily recreational 
stimulant/opiate users) will be excluded.  
Conditions that affect adherence : Participants should not have a condition that 
would limit participation which include medical conditions that would affect 
individuals’ ability to use the computer for prolonged period of time; leave the 
individual unable to ambulate; or current diagnoses of an eating disorder 
(anorexia, bulimia,), unman aged  psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia), or an intellectual 
impairment that would impact study adherence.  
Abnormal glucose related to medications : Participants should not be taking 
medications that would limit participation and cause abnormal glucose levels (e.g. 
atypical antipsychotic medications or glucocorticoids) including diabetic drugs 
such as Metformin.  
Unwilling or unable to eat study food : Participants who are unwilling or not able 
to eat the study food (a PowerBar) will not be able to take part in this study.  
Prior participation in similar studies :  Individuals who have recently participated 
in a laboratory study using similar methods may also be excluded.   
Anyone who cannot h ave an MRI  (e.g. anyone who has any type of metallic implant 
in his/her body, including pacemakers, aneurysm clips, shrapnel, metal fragments, 
orthopedic pins, screws or plates, IUD’s or piercings that cannot be removed ) will 
not be able to participate in the imaging portion of the study (3b). Those who 
cannot have an MRI may be eligible to participate in the behavioral version of the 
study.  
Do not meet discounting criteria:  Individuals who do not meet discounting criteria 
(e.g. nonsystematic discounting) o n a delay discounting task may be excluded.  
6.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include any of the following special 
populations  in your study using the checkboxes below.   
 
 Page 12 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  NOTE:  Members of special populations may not be targeted for enrollment  in 
your study unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.  
Response: Individuals who are not yet adults, adults unable to consent, pregnant 
women, and prisoners will be excluded from this study.  
☐ Adults unable to consent  
☐ Individuals who are  not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
☐ Pregnant women  
☐ Prisoners  
 
6.4 Indicate whether you will include non -English speaking individuals  in your 
study .  Provide justification if you will exclude non -English speaking 
individuals .  
In order to meet one of the primary ethical principles of equitable selection 
of subjects, n on-English speaking individuals may not be routinely excluded 
from research  as a matter of convenience.  
In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent  or is designed to 
investigate areas that would necessarily require certain populations who 
may not speak English, the researcher is required to make efforts to recruit 
and include non -English speaking individuals.  However, there are studies 
in which it w ould be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak 
English .  Some examples include pilot studies, small unfunded studies with 
validated instruments not available in other languages, studies with 
numerous questionnaires, and some non -therapeutic studie s which offer  no 
direct benefit.  
Response:   
This study will not include non -English speaking participants. Since all the 
materials in this study will be in English, and the validated measurements are not 
provided in other languages, we will be excluding in dividuals who do not speak 
English.

8.0 Eligibility Screening  
8.1 Describe screening procedures  for determining subjects’ eligibility.  
Screening refers to determining if prospective participants meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.   
Include all relevant screening documents with your submission (e.g. screeni ng 
protocol, script, questionnai re).  

 Page 14 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  Response:   
Interested participants will have the opportunity to complete an initial 
screening by phone, online, or paper upon their preference to determine if 
they meet the inclusion criteria as previously described. See attached 
supporting documents “Phone Screening  Script” and “MINDD 3 
Prescreen Paper Copy” for questions used on phone screens, online 
screens, and paper screens. Information about the study will be provided 
and consent will be obtained to prescreen for eligibility purposes . 
During the prescreen , along  with other screening questionnaires 
participants will also complete the PHQ -2, a shorter version of the PHQ -9, 
which measures current (within the past two weeks) feelings of depression 
or loss of interest in activities. Those that score a 3 or above on th e PHQ -
2, will be contacted for follow -up via phone by a trained research staff 
member and be given the remainder of the PHQ -9. The PHQ -9 is a 
validated measure that looks not only at feelings of depression and 
associated symptoms, but also assesses for tho ughts of self -harm. Given 
the concern for having a participant indicate thoughts of self -harm, this 
procedure would allow for a real -time conversation with that participant to 
monitor responses and also provide t hem with appropriate resources. 
Additionally , if the participant appears to be extremely upset and/or 
emotional, we may ask them to fill out Columbia Severity Index, a reliable 
measure of assessing suicide risk . 
After completing the prescreen survey, responses will be reviewed by 
research staff to a ssess eligibility and determine which arm of the study 
they will be eligible for  (e.g. those who do not have a history of 
hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia but may safely participate in an MRI 
may be entered into the fMRI arm of this study. And those who meet all 
other eligibility criteria but cannot safely participate in an MRI may be 
entered into the behavioral part of this study).  Participants will be called, 
emailed, or mailed a letter (depending on their preferred method of contact 
provided in the pre screen survey) regarding their eligibility. Those who 
are eligible will be scheduled to come into our lab for an in person 
screening visit (session 1).  
At the in person screening visit (session 1) documented consent will be 
obtained from potential particip ants. During the screening procedure, 
participants may be asked to sign a medical release form allowing the 
primary care physician to provide us with the information regarding 
eligibility and also allow us to send any pertinent medical information to 
their primary care physician (e.g., diagnoses of obesity, prediabetes, 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, fMRI findings, depression score assessed by 
the BDI). If we do not receive the form within about 5 business days we 
will call to follow up with the primary care p hysician. At the screening 
visit, participants will have their HbA1c levels measured by finger stick to 
obtain a drop of blood. If subjects meet study eligibility criterion based on 
 Page 15 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  HbA1c levels (5.4% - 6.7%) at the initial screening visit, they may be 
eligible to participate regardless of confirmatory PCP diagnosis.  
Additionally at the first visit, female participants who have been entered 
into the fMRI arm of the study will provide us with a urine sample to 
check for pregnancy status. If the results are p ositive the participant will 
be informed and they will not be eligible to continue with study.  
Study personnel will inform participants that this information will be used 
to communicate with them about study eligibility and that this information 
will be ke pt confidential and not shared  with anyone outside of the study 
team.  
The information assessed during screening is recorded in a secure database that 
requires a password to enter. The database is used by all members of the Division 
of Behavioral Medicine a nd has been approved for use by previous IRB 
committees. Information is retained in the database only if the subject gives 
consent.  
 
☐ N/A:   There is no screening as part of this protocol.  
9.0 Recruitment Methods  
☐ N/A:   This is a records review only, and subjects will not be 
recruited.  NOTE:  If you select this option, please make sure that 
all records review procedures and inclusion/exclusion screening 
are adequately described in other sections.  
9.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be re cruited.   
NOTE:  Recruitment refers to how you are identifying potential participants and 
introducing them to the study.  Include specific methods you will use (e.g. 
searching charts for specific ICD code numbers, Research Participant Groups, 
posted advert isements, etc.).  
Response:  
Participants will be recruited through recruitment materials (e.g., flyers, 
letters, and handouts /postcards ), and web -based recruitment (e.g., 
departmental website, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, ResearchMatch, 
ClinicalTrials) d isseminated through the local community, university 
campuses, and medical clinics including UB -MD, the university physician 
network , Urban Family Practice,  and the Upstate New York Practice 
Based Research Network which is engaged in multiple research proje cts to 
improve patient care in Western New York. Used in previous IRB 
approved studies (030 -796526, STUDY 00000936), the physicians from 
UBMD have provided us with a list of patient names, addresses, contact 
information, and brief medical history (e.g., di agnosis of hypertension, 
diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, previous HbA1c measurements, BMI) for 
recruitment purposes of the MINDD Grant. These patients may be mailed 
a letter that has been jointly signed from the study team and their 
 Page 16 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  physician. Included in the  mailing are postcards with return address and 
that have been pre -stamped, so that these potential participants have the 
option to send back a reply regarding their interest in the study via postal 
mail Interested patients may contact the research team. Po tential 
participants who were mailed a letter jointly signed by the study team and 
the patient’s physician from UB -MD may also be contacted by the study 
team by phone to assess interest if the study team has not received a 
response from the individual afte r one  week.  
Potential participants who were mailed a letter jointly signed by the study 
team and patient’s physician at Urban Family Practice may also be 
contacted by the study team by phone to assess interest if the study team 
has not received a response  from the individual after one week. Since this 
is the first time we will be using Urban Family Practice to recruit from, we 
will follow their recruitment protocol, which allows us to contact and 
follow up with potential participants in this manner.  
We may  also use the i2b2 database through UB’s Institute for Healthcare 
Informatics (IHI) to recruit participants from the UBMD medical data base.  A 
letter will be sent to the eligible patient’s physician (see attached). After one 
week, if the physician doesn’t contact the research team to refuse, a recruitment 
letter will be sent to participants via mail (see attached). If we don’t hear fr om the 
patients within one week , one follow -up call will be made (see attached phone 
script). If at any point the physician o r the patient declines, the patient will be 
removed from the contact list.  
Additionally, a database of participants that have been involved in previous 
studies at the University at Buffalo Behavioral Medicine laboratory that expressed 
interest in future st udies will be used. Participants who have indicated interest in 
contact for future studie s will be contacted by email or phone with the study 
advertisement and survey link. The database is used by all approved members of 
the Division of Behavioral Medicine  and has been approved by previous IRB 
Committees, for phone/email contact (385420, 389912, 385442). No data or 
identifying information is collected prior to a potential participant’s expression of 
interest in the research study.  
9.2 Describe how you will prot ect the privacy interests of prospective subjects 
during the recruitment process.   
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.    
Response:  
Individuals who contact the research team after viewing the above recruitme nt 
materials disseminated at local sites control their own privacy interests.  
Individuals that have previously indicated interest and willingness to be contacted 
for participating in future studies will be contacted and thus can control their own 
participa tion. All individuals will be informed that participation is voluntary and 
they can withdraw from participation at any time. The study team will cease 
contact with any individuals that they have learned are not interested.  
 Page 17 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  The privacy of patients recruited  using the i2b2 data will be protected by 
following the UB IRB -approved procedure.  
9.3 Identify any  materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
NOTE:  Examples include scripts for telephone calls, in person announcements / 
presentations, email invitations.  
For advertisements, include the final copy of printed advertisements with your 
submission. When advertisements are taped for broadcast, attach the final 
audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior 
to taping to ensure the re will be no IRB -required revisions, provided the IRB also 
reviews and approves the final version.  
 Response:  
Web-based advertisements  posted on the  departmental website, Facebook, 
Twitter, Craigslist, ResearchMatch, ClinicalTrials , flyers, handouts, telephone 
calls, using the approved script , and mailed letters and postcards, will be used to 
recruit subjects.  
10.0 Procedures Involved  
10.1 Provide a description of all research procedur es or activities  being 
performed and when they are performed  once a subject is screened and 
determined to be eligible . Provide as much detail as possible.    
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint for your study and include enough detail 
so that another investigator could pick up your protocol and replicate the research.  
For studies  that have multiple or complex visits or procedures, consider the 
addition of a schedule of events table in in your response.  
Response:   
Behavioral Arm:  Upon arrival to the Division of Behavioral Medicine 
(G56 Farber Hall), participants will be greeted and  escorted to a private 
interview room where they will be given a verbal explanation  about the 
study and provide documented consent. Two copies of the consent form 
will be signed by all parties involved, person obtaining consent and the 
participant. One cop y will be obtained by study personnel and one copy 
will be given to participants for their records. After signing the consent 
forms, participants will have their blood glucose measured. Participants 
will then consume a PowerBar and begin completing study r elated tasks in 
which they will have their HbA1c, blood pressure, height and weight 
measured to calculate BMI , and complete measures of delay discounting 
and study questionnaires including demographics, consumption, alcohol, 
tobacco substance use, time per spective , and prospective memory . 
Measures  and questionnaires may be completed on either  the computer or 
paper/pencil labelled only with the participant’s ID number.  About 30-45 
minutes after consuming the PowerBar participants will have their blood 
glucos e measured again . In addition, participants will sign forms for 
release of their relevant medical records to confirm their eligibility (e.g., 
diagnosis with prediabetes, hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia , MRI 

 Page 18 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  eligibility ). Participants will be given a cho ice as to whether they would 
like their screening results shared with them and/or with their physician. If 
participants have values at a certain critical level (e.g. critically high blood 
pressure) they may be automatically notified . Participants may also 
complete a urine drug screen to confirm non -substance abuse and female 
participants may complete a urine pregnancy test to ensure eligibility.  
After completing all study tasks, questionnaires, measures etc. for the first 
session, participants may have the ir blood glucose measured again. Blood 
glucose will be measured up to 3 separate times during this visit. The first 
visit is expected to last between two to two and a half hours.  
If eligible, participants will be s cheduled for an additional session  to be 
completed within the next four weeks. The second session will last 
approximately two to two and a half hours . Participants may be asked to 
abstain from eating or drinking (except wate r) for approximately 2  hours 
prior to both of their sessions and engaging  in an y activity that may 
influence appetite.  Participants who are not about 2 hours post prandial or 
have experienced a major life event that may influence their performance 
on study measures and tasks  may have their appointment rescheduled. As 
in the fir st visit, participants will have their blood glucose measured and 
then offered a PowerBar to consume prior to completing all study related 
tasks. In this visit, participants will again have blood glucose measured 
three separate times (e.g. beginning of ses sion, about 30-45 minutes after 
consuming PowerBar, and at the end of the session).   
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, EFT or ERT, 
and complete an episodic thinking task. Participants will be randomized 
by stratifying for educati on level and sex. The episodic thinking task to 
generate episodic cues will be similar to the tasks used in our previous 
studies on EFT’s effect (Daniel et al., 2013). Each group will list and 
describe events for different time periods. The episodic compon ent of the 
thinking task will occur while the participants are asked to describe what 
they are imagining about each event (e.g. , vacations, weddings, parties, 
and so forth). EFT participants will list positive future events they are 
looking forward to and list events that could happen at different general 
future time points (e.g., 1 month, 2 -6 months, 7 -12 months). In contrast, 
the ERT group will list positive recent events (events that have already 
happened) that they have enjoyed that have occurred at dif ferent general 
time points (e.g., a few hours ago, 1 day  ago, 2 -6 days ago, 7 -12 days 
ago). All participants will rate the salience, valence, arousal, feasibility 
and vividness of each event and events with the highest ratings for 
vividness will be used in  the generation of episodic cues. An “imagery” 
score may be calculated by averaging the frequency/vividness scores for 
each event. Reductions in rate of discounting occur at higher levels of 
episodic imagery (Peters & Buchel, 2010). Additionally, participa nts will 
record their highest rated events into audio cues.  
 Page 19 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  Participants may also be  instructed to use and think about their episodic 
cues as they engage in a set of executive function tasks  (e.g., The Virtual 
Week) and other decision making tasks such as measures of delay 
discounting (e.g., discounting of money, food, sedentary 
behaviors/physical activity, future health; a series of single and cross 
commodity discounting tasks) and food preferences . Participants will be 
randomized to which cues (future or recent) they will be instructed to 
think about when engaging in The Virtual Week task.  Executive function 
tasks may take place on a computer screen or paper and pencil. 
Participants will complete questionnaires regarding their attention to their 
episodic c ues while engaged in study tasks.  
fMRI Arm:  If it is determined that the participant is willing and eligible to 
complete an fMRI they may be entered into the fMRI arm of this study. 
For these participants, the first visit is identical to that of the first  visit in 
the behavioral arm of the study, with the exception that participants will 
not complete an episodic thinking task, and the MRI screening form may 
be reviewed with the participant to ensure safety and eligibility . 
Eligible participants will be scheduled for an additional session to be 
completed within the next 30 days. The second session will last 
approximately an hour and a half to two hours.  Participants may be asked 
to abstain from eating or drinking (except wat er) for approximately 2  
hours prior to their sessions and engaging in an y activity that may 
influence appetite.  Participants who are not about 2 hours post prandial or 
have experienced a major life event that may influence their performance 
on study measur es and tasks  may have their appointment rescheduled. As 
in the first visit, participants will have their blood glucose measured and 
then offered a PowerBar to consume prior to completing all study related 
tasks. In this visit, participants will again have blood glucose measured 
three separate times (e.g. beginning of session, 30 minutes after 
consuming PowerBar, and at the end of the session).  
In the second visit, female participant will again be asked to provide a 
urine sample to confirm non -pregnancy status. E ligible participants will be 
randomly assigned to one of two groups, EFT or ERT, and complete an 
episodic thinking task identical to the thinking task in the first visit of the 
behavioral study.  They  may also be asked to complete decision making 
tasks while engaged in episodic thinking and undergoing an fMRI without 
contrast scan at their second session. Prior to the scan, MRI safety trained 
personnel will assess the safety of all participants. During the fMRI scan, 
the participant will be given a small box with buttons to press in response 
to the display that appears on the screen above them within the machine. 
The participant will be selecting objects that they prefer in decision -
making tasks. Additionally, interested participants may have the 
opportunity to receive a copy of their brain images.  
Following their last session, all participants will be debriefed.  
 Page 20 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  Pilot participants will complete identical procedures, but may complete fewer 
sessions and/or activities than those described above.   
Parti cipants who are considered “screen fails” for having low blood HbA1c, not 
within the prediabetes range (5.4 -6.7%), will be logged to track our “screen fail 
rate” and will not be included in the final data analysis. Participants who were 
initially tested on  the A1CNow+® system  and were screened ineligible for having 
a blood HbA1c measurement near the prediabetes range (i.e., between 5.0 and 
5.3) may be invited back to our lab for an additional HbA1c measurement using 
the Alere AfinionTM AS100 Analyzer System . Upon retesting, if their HbA1c 
measure is now in the prediabetes range, they will be eligible to continue with the 
rest of the study and will be recorded as “initially ineligible, eligible upon 
retesting HbA1c”, and will be included in the final data ana lysis.  
 
10.2 Describe what data will be collected.   
NOTE:  For studies with multiple data collection points or long -term follow up, 
consider the addition of  a schedule or table in your response.  
Response:   
Data co nsists of demographic measures , subjective pref erence and hunger, food 
questionnaires, energy intake, delay discounting, executive function, relative 
reinforcing efficacy, substance consumption,  pregnancy,  temporal perspective, 
blood pressure, HbA1c, blood glucose, fMRI images , and participants’ height s 
and weights recorded during the experimental session.  
10.3 List any instruments or measurement tools used to collect data 
(e.g. questionnaire, interview guide, validated instrument, data collection 
form).   
 
Include copies of these documents with your submission.  
Response:  
Please see the attachment labeled, “questionnaires (M3).”  
Demographics and Health Behavior : Race/ethnicity, household income, and 
educational level will be assessed using a survey -based questionnaire. Participants 
will also be asked  about their health behavior, including substance use, mental 
health, medical history, and food consumption.  
Food Consumption Questionnaire . Food consumption, including any food 
or beverages ingested in the last 10 -12 hours.  
Major Life Events : Individuals will be asked to complete the major life events 
questionnaire which measures major life events that may have been experienced 
during their involvement in the study. Individuals who are undergoing major life 
events such as a move, new baby or a new job may influence their performance 
on study measures and tasks.  

 Page 21 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  Financial Planning and Longevity . Individual differences in time period of 
financial planning will be assessed with the question, “In planning your, or 
your family’s, saving and spending, which of th e time periods is more 
important to you and your partner, if you have one?” (Picone, Sloan, & 
Taylor, 2004). Answer choices provided will range from not planning, to 
planning longer than ten years. Financial planning will be reported 
categorically, and wil l be converted to a continuous variable for analysis 
using midpoints of the categories. Subjective probability of living to age 
75 will be measured by asking “What do you think are the chances you 
will live to be 75 or more (where 0 means there is no chanc e you will live 
to 75 or more, and 100 means you will definitely live to 75 or more)?” 
(Picone et al., 2004). Higher values on either question will indicate greater 
future orientation.  
Time Perspective : Individual differences in temporal perspective will be assessed 
using measures that assess temporal orientation. Consideration of Future 
Consequences Scale (CFCS). CFCS assesses the extent to which individuals 
consider the potential future outcomes of their current behavior and the extent to 
which they are influenced by the imagined outcomes (Strathman et al., 1994).   
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS):  The PANAS comprises two 
mood scales, one that measures positive affect and the other which measures 
negative affect (Watson et. al., 1988)  
Height , Weight, BMI : Participants’ height will be assessed using a digital  
stadiometer. Participants’ weight will be assessed using a digital scale. Based on 
the height and weight data, Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated according 
to the following formula:  BMI = kg/m2. These are the current standards set forth 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Kuczmarski et al., 2002).  
Blood pressure : Blood pressure w ill be measured 3 times using an OMRON 
automated blood pressure device by trained personnel. The latter two readings 
will be averaged.  
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) : HbA1c will be measured using the A1CNow+® 
system (PTS Diagnostics, Sunnyvale, CA)  or the Alere AfinionTM AS100 
Analyzer System (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) . 
Blood Glucose:  Blood gluc ose will be measured using the FreeStyle Lite Glucose 
Monitor ( Abbott, Abbott Park, IL)  
Subjective Hunger : Participants will be asked to provide subjective ratings of 
their hunger. Hunger will be assessed using a 5 -point Likert scale (anchored by 1 - 
Extrem ely Full and 5 -Extremely Hungry).  
Subjective Preferences : Parti cipants may  be asked to provide subjective ratings of 
their food/activity preferences by ranking, rating their liking using a 5 -point 
Likert scale (anchored by 1 -Do not like and 5 -Like very muc h), and making 
choices between their food/activity.  
Same Day Food Recall : Participants will be asked if they ar e willing to eat the 
study food  during a 24 -hour recall questionnaire assessing past food behavior 
 Page 22 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  (e.g. what time they ate their last meal, food items consumed in the past 24 hours, 
etc.). Those who say they are no t willing to eat the study food  will not be included 
in the study.  
Cue Attention : A Likert -style scale assessing attentiveness to the episodic cues 
and vividness cues during tasks will b e assessed on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 
indicates “not at all” and 5 indicates “very much”.   
Delay Discounting : An operational definition of impulsivity is delay discounting, 
the degree to which a person will discount the value of a larger delayed rewa rd in 
favor of a smaller immediate reward. Computerized/ experimenter administered 
assessments will provide participants with choices between a smaller amount of a 
hypothetical commodity available immediately or a larger amount available later. 
Participant s will make choices between rewards such as money, food, physical 
activity, and health gains. Two methods will be used to measure discounting, 
Adjusting Amount and Adjusting Delay.  
 Adjusting Amount Discounting. The magnitude of the immediate 
commodity is adjusted until it is subjectively equivalent to the later larger amount. 
Subjective equivalence will be obtained at delays such as; 1 day, 1 week, 1 
month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. To ensure comparison between money 
and non -monetary rewards, prior to running the discounting programs for food, 
physical activity and health, participants will indicate the amount of the 
commodity whose receipt “right now” would be equally valuable to the 
participants as receiving a set amount of money, for example $100.  
Adjusting Delay Discounting. The adjusting delay discounting task is a 
five trial task in which participants are asked how much money they would prefer 
(e.g. $500) immediately or a larger reward after a delay (e.g. $1000). This task is 
presented on a compu ter screen and is designed to measure the amount of 
monetary discounting that occurs when rewards are presented at a delay. This task 
adjusts the delay to the larger reward and allows for the calculation of k -values. 
This task will be completed matching ea ch of the traditional tasks parameters (i.e. 
type and magnitude of the reinforcer).  
Executive Function : Cognitive processes, such as planning, cognitive flexibility, 
working memory, prospective memory, retrospective memory and attention may 
be measured by  using computerized tasks  (e.g., with Inquisit) or  paper and pencil 
that involves solving problems, remembering a set of letters or spatial locations 
while alternating with a distracter tasks, responding to specific stimulus in the 
presence of an orienting  cue, or playing the computer game “The Virtual Week” 
where users will plan out typical events that could actually happen during the 
week (e.g., taking their medication, calling their friend, picking up their dry 
cleaning) (Rendell, & Craik, 2000)  
Relative  Reinforcing Efficacy Food Purchasing Task : The food purchasing task is 
modified off of the cigarette purchasing task (CPT) that has been used by Jacobs 
and Bickel (1999) and assesses a number of different metrics of relative 
reinforcing efficacy. The proc edure we will use is a modified version of this 
procedure and will assess the relative reinforcing efficacy of a range of foods via 
 Page 23 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  an online survey or computerized task.  The chosen food will be displayed during 
the task so that participants have a frame of reference when completing the 
questionnaire.  
Neuroimaging : The MRI data will be collected during approximate 60 min 
sessions that will include positioning participants in the scanner, collecting T1 -
weighted structural scans, and conducting target fMRI e xperiments. Some 
parameters may be modified to accommodate the specifics of this multisite study. 
MRI scanning performed at the Dent Neurologic Institute will be performed on a 
Philips Ingenia 3T system (200 T/m/s slew rate).  T1 weighted anatomical images 
will be acquired with a 3D Turbo Field Echo (TFE) sequence at 1mm isotropic 
resolution and scanning parameters: Shot interval = 2500ms, TR = 7.7ms, TE = 
3.5ms, FA = 8 deg., BW = 191.5 Hz/2.26 pixel, and SENSE parallel imaging 
factor of 2.2, for an acquisit ion time of 5 minutes and 10 seconds. MRI scanning 
at Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute or at the Virginia Tech Corporate 
Research Center will be performed on a Siemens 3T Tim Trio system outfitted 
with a 45 mT/m gradient system (200 T/m/s slew rat e). T1 weighted anatomical 
images will be acquired with a 3D MPRAGE sequence at 1 mm isotropic 
resolution and scanning parameters: TI = 900 ms, TR = 2.6 s, TE = 3 ms, FA = 
8°, BW = 130 Hz/pixel, and GRAPPA parallel imaging factor of 2, for an 
acquisition t ime of 4 minutes and 38 seconds. FMRI data will be acquired using a 
T2* weighted single -shot EPI sequence, matched across the two sites (see also 
section 6.6.3). Whole -brain functional volumes will be acquired in 26 3.4 -mm 
axial slices (with a 20% slice ga p), each with 3.4 mm x 3.4 mm in -plane 
resolution. Additional fMRI imaging parameters include: TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, 
FA = 90 deg., BW = 1953 Hz/pixel.  
 
10.4 Describe any source records  that will be used to collect data about subjects  
(e.g. school records, elec tronic medical records).  
Response:  
Electronic medical records will be used. These will include records from patients 
at UBMD, Urban Family Practice, and additional records provided through the 
use of i2b2.  
10.5 Indicate  whether  or not  individual  subject result s, such as results of 
investigational diagnostic tests, genetic tests, or incidental findings  will be 
shared with subjects or others (e.g., the subject’s primary care physician) 
and if so, describe how these  will be shared.  
Response:  
Participants will be given a choice as to whether they would like their screening 
results shared with them and/or with their physician , see supporting document 
“Participant Physician Follow -up Form” . If participants have values at a certain 
critical level (e.g. critically high blood pressure ), express extreme feelings of 
depression (assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory), express  suicidal 
thoughts, or  the fMRI images reveal any areas of concern their physician  will 
 Page 24 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  automatically be notified  by mail, fax , or phone call . Records may include height, 
weight, blood pressure, HbA1c, pregnancy, drug screen, and brain images.   
10.6 Indicate  whether  or not  study results will be shared with subjects or others , 
and if so, describe how these  will be shared.  
Response:  
Study results will not be shared with subjects. Findings may be presented at 
conferences and published in scientific journals.  
11.0 Study Timelines  
11.1 Describe t he anticipated duration needed to enroll all study subjects.  
Response:  
This study will complete rollin g recruitment and we anticipate it will take 
approximately 1 year  to enroll all study subjects.  
11.2 Describe t he duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study.  
Include length of study visits, and overall study follow -up time.  
Response:  
Subjec ts will attend two appointments, each appointment being approximately 90 -
120 minutes.  This is the same for both arms of the study.  
11.3 Describe t he estimated duration for the investigators to complete this study 
(i.e. all data is collected and all analyses have been completed).

conduct the research.  
Response:  
The Principle Investigator will devote approximately 8 -10 hours per  week 
to meet with staff, oversee data safety and discuss recruitment and study 
specific information.  
The Project Coordinator will spend approximately 40% of their time 
training and supervising staff, including conducting weekly project 
meetings, 10% compl eting the Human Subjects Review Process, 20% 
coordinating the scheduling of appointments for staff and prospective 
subjects, 10% coordinating and assisting in the test sessions, 10% 
coordinating multisite weekly meetings, and 10% overseeing the 
development  of study materials.  
Research Assistants will spend approximately 50% of their time training and 
running participants, 20% recruiting subjects, 20% developing project materials, 
 Page 27 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  including questionnaires, surveys, and forms, and 10% entering data and qualit y 
control of the data collected during the study  
14.3 Describe the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects 
might need as a result of anticipated consequences of the human research , if 
applicable . 
NOTE:  One example includes: on -call ava ilability of a counselor or psychologist 
for a study that screens subjects for depression.  
Response:  
The availability of experienced endocrinologists will be available for our study 
that examines subjects at risk for Type 2 Diabetes.  
If a participant scor es high on the PHQ -9 (greater than or equal to 10) or they 
respond with any answer other than “not at all” to the suicidality question, the 
project coordinator and PI will be notified. These participants will also be 
provided with a resource list (see supp orting document “Resource List” with 
name, address, and phone number of local and national counseling resources, 
crisis services, and emergency services.  
During any of the visits, if the participant appears to extremely upset (e.g. 
emotional, crying,) the project coordinator and PI will be notified. These 
participants will be asked to fill out the Beck Depression Inventory as well as 
provided with the list of resources. We will notify this participant’s physician of 
their depression score by mail, fax, or p hone call, and suggest that they follow up 
with their patient. Additionally, we will follow up with the participant within the 
next 24 hours.  
14.4 Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the research 
are adequately informed about the pro tocol, the research procedures, and 
their duties and functions.  
Response:  
All personnel working on the project are required to complete the CITI training as 
required by IRB. Additionally, there are extensive procedures manuals that are 
read and followed b y all personnel. The Project Coordinator is responsible for 
training staff on data collection and recording procedures.  
Project coordinator and the principal investigators will be responsible for ensuring 
proper staff training on study procedures and consi stency of data collection 
between each site. This will be achieved through local training, regular 
communication between sites and coordinating procedural materials for 
experimenters.  
 
15.0 Other Approvals  
15.1 Describe any approvals that will be obtained prior to c ommencing the 
research (e.g., school, external site, funding agency, laboratory, radiation 
safety, or biosafety).

IRB approval for procedures taking place at Virginia Tech , DENT Neurologic 
Institute , and the Virginia Carilion Clinic.  
☐ N/A:   This study does not require any other approvals.  
16.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
 
16.1 Describe how you will protect subjects’ privacy interests  during the course 
of this research.  
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.  
Privacy applies to the person.  Confidentiality refers to how data collected about 
individuals for the research will be protected by the researcher from release.  
Confidentiality applies to the data.   
Examples of appropr iate responses include:  “participant only meets with a study 
coordinator in a classroom setting where no one can overhear ”, or “the 
participant is reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any questions that 
they do not feel comfortable answering. ”   
Response:   
Prospective participants may contact  the laboratory of their own free will and are 
thus controlling access to their privacy. All d ata will be collected in a secure 
laboratory environment in  password protected databases in  which only study staff 
has access.  Participants will only interact with project research staff and sessions 
will take place in a private laboratory room that includes a closed circuit 
television monitoring system that will be monitored by the experimenter  to ensure 
participant protocol adherence and safety . Participants are reminded that they are 
free to refuse to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable answering 
and that all information is kept confidential to the extent provided by law.  
16.2 Indicate how the research team is permitted to access any sources of 
information about the subjects.    
NOTE:  Examples of appropriate responses include:  school permission for review 
of records, consent of the subject, HIPAA waiver.  This question does apply  to 
records reviews . 
Response:   
Participants will be recruited using a secure database of interested participants 
maintained by the Division of Behavioral Medicine and approved for use by 
previous IRB committees. Potential participants will be contacted if  they had 
indicated that they are willing to be contacted for participation in studies and thus 
control their own participation. A HIPAA waiver has been completed for the 
recruitment of participants through medical records, which is completed through 
the p hysician’s office with the consent of the primary care physician. The 
research team may also contact primary care physicians to confirm eligibility after 
particip ants have completed consent/HIPA A/medical release forms.  
 Page 29 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  17.0 Data Management  and Analysis  
17.1 Describe  the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.   This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Response:  
Analytic plan is to use factorial ANCOVA to compare between group differences 
in different measures of DD, executive function and fMRI -measured brain 
function for subjects randomly assigned to poverty/neutral conditions and 
EFT/ERT. Covariates will be used if significant differences between groups are 
observed in subject characteristics. We predict a main effec t of neutral/poverty, 
such that those assigned to poverty will have higher DD than those assigned to 
neutral, and an interaction between poverty/neutral and EFT such that in the 
poverty condition, EFT will reduce the discounting to levels achieved by the 
wealth, ERT subjects. We also predict when participants who receive EFT under 
challenge of poverty that EFT will increase activation in brain regions associated 
with delay of gratification (LPFC and AC) and prospection (hippocampus) 
relative to those who re ceive EFT under similar challenges.  
17.2 If applicable, p rovide a power analysis.    
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit 
whether the i nvestigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study 
objectives  and justify a conclusion.   
Response:   
The sample size is based on our studies of EFT versus ERT on DD in o verweight 
and  obese subjects,  which showed an average AUC of 0.54 + 0.28, and  our 
unpublished research that poverty simulations reduces DD by 34%. We estimate 
in the ERT condition, neutral simulations will lead to less discounting and higher 
AUC than poverty simulations (0.54 vs 0.36). We estimate in EFT conditions, that 
simulation s of neutral  are associated with a small improvement in discounting in 
comparison to poverty simulations (0.63 vs 0.54). These predictions suggest that 
DD in EFT/ Poverty and ERT/Wealth will be equivalent. The effect size for this 
interaction is 0.35. Using  the overall SD we observed of 0.28, alpha of .05 and 
power of 0.80, we can show the effect size for this interaction with 17 Ss/group, 
or 68 total, or 34 per site  in the behavioral portion and in the imaging portion . To 
be conservative, we will study up t o 100 subjects.  
17.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected 
data.  
Response:  
The principal investigator will be responsible for ensuring data integrity and 
safety monitoring for human subjects who are involved in the research  and 
communicating any negative outcomes of the data and safety monitoring plans 
(DSMP) reviews or any serious event or problem (SEP) that occur to the SBSIRB 
and other required offices/agencies. Materials will be checked to make sure that 
 Page 30 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  all study data a re coded with a unique participant ID. The ID will be linked only 
by a name through a master list kept by the project coordinator in a password -
protected file.  
18.0 Confidentiality  
 
A. Confidentiality of Study Data  
 
Describe the local procedures for maintenance of  confidentiality  of study data 
and any records that will be reviewed for data collection .   
 
18.1 A.  Where and how will all data and records be stored?  Include 
information about:  password protection, encryption, physical controls, 
authorization of access, an d separation of identifiers and data, as applicable.  
Include physical (e.g. paper) and electronic files.  
Response:  
The i2b2 data will be protected by only accessing identifiable contact information 
remotely on IHI’s “virtual machine”, so the identifiable  data never leaves their 
secure encrypted server. All use of identifiable data is done behind the firewall on 
IHI’s secure system.  
Potential participants who have filled out the prescreen survey will have their 
responses stored on a password protected serv er that only the research staff will 
have access too. Additionally, if there are paper copies of the prescreen survey 
responses they will be de -identified and stored in a locked filing cabinet in a 
locked room (252A Farber hall) which only research staff h as access to.  
Participants will be assigned a unique identification number to ensure the 
confidentiality of the data. A master list that links subject ID and participant’s 
name will kept in a secure file that is password protected on a password protected 
computer. Only research staff will access to the master list. Paper files will be 
kept in locked lab offices at the Division of Behavioral Medicine Research Lab 
and electronic files will be kept on password protected computers in password 
protected/encrypte d databases only accessible to members of the research staff. 
When the results of the study are presented and/or published, only group data will 
be provided; no individual participant will be identifiable.  
18.2 A.  How long will the data be stored?  
Response:  
Data will be retained for a period of at least three years. The master list linking 
the study ID with the participant name will be kept in a locked cabinet in G56 for 
three years after the completion of the study at which point it will be destroyed. 
De-identified data will be retained indefinitely.  
18.3 A.  Who will have access to the data?  
Response:  
 Page 31 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  Only the principal investigator and research staff associated with the study will

 Page 32 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  18.10  B.  How will the specimens be transported?  
Response:  
N/A, the specimens will not be transported.  
 
19.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of 
Subjects  
☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects , or is limited to records review 
procedures only .  This section does not apply.  
 
NOTE:  Minimal risk studies may be required to monitor subject s afety if the research 
procedures include procedures that present unique risks to subjects that require 
monitoring.  Some examples include:  exercising to exertion, or instruments that elicit 
suicidality or substance abuse behavior.  In such cases, N/A is n ot an acceptable 
response.  
 
19.1 Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both 
harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe.  
Response:  
Data will be reviewed weekly and secured in Division of Behavioral Medicine 
Research  Lab. The Principal Investigator, Leonard H. Epstein, PhD, will be 
responsible for ensuring data integrity and safety monitoring for human subjects 
who are involved in the research along with the Data Safety Officer.  
19.2 Describe what data are reviewed , including safety data, untoward events, 
and efficacy data.  
Response:  
Study questionnaires and measurements that are collected by study personnel will 
be reviewed and monitored.  
19.3 Describe any safety endpoints.  
Response:  
This study poses no greater  than minimal risk; therefore, there are no safety 
endpoints.  
19.4 Describe h ow the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report 
forms, at study visits, by telephone calls with participants).  
Response:  
Participants will be encouraged to contact  study personnel if they experience any 
problems or difficulties, and if any adverse events (AE) are reported, the study 
personnel contacted will record the AE. AE will be recorded as soon as they are 
reported, and the PI and study coordinator will be made  aware. The study 
coordinator will summarize the AE in a memo; the participant will be called and 
the summary will be read to them to ensure that the information is accurate. The 
 Page 33 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  memo will then be submitted to the University at Buffalo IRB and the PI. If t he 
PI, or the IRB decide that further action is warranted, the PI and study coordinator 
will then formulate and carry out a plan to respond to the AE. The study 
coordinator will write a memo summarizing such actions; this memo will then be 
forwarded to the  IRB. Safety information will be collected and reported to both 
the UBIRB and the Safety Officer in the time frames outlined by the UBIRB.  
19.5 Describe t he frequency of safety data collection . 
Response:  
Data will be reviewed weekly and secured in G56 and G252 A Farber Hall. A 
weekly review of these data will be conducted by the principal investigator and 
project coordinator during their staff meetings with study personnel.  
19.6 Describe w ho will review the safety data.  
Response:  
Serious Events and Problems (SEP) wi ll be monitored by the principal 
investigator and project coordinator as well as reported to both the IRB and the 
Safety Officer in the timeframes outlined by the IRB.  
19.7 Describe t he frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative safety data.  
Response:  
Cumulative data will be reviewed approximately six months to a year based on 
the requirements of the Grant and NIH committee.  
19.8 Describe t he statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine 
whether harm is occurring.  
Response:  
N/A, there are no discontinuing criteria.  
19.9 Describe a ny conditions that trigger an immediate suspension of the 
research.  
Response:  
N/A, there are no discontinuing criteria.  
20.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects.  This section does not apply.  
 
20.1 Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects may be withdrawn 
from the research without their consent.  
Response:  
Subjects who do not adhere to the protocol procedures and study instructions may 
be withdrawn from research analyses, as determine d by the Principal Investigator 
and/or NIH Data Safety Committee . In addition to not adhering to study 
 Page 34 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  instructions, possible reasons for removal include nonsystematic responding to 
questionnaires and HbA1c (blood sugar) levels that are not in the prediabetes 
range. If a participant is withdrawn from the study without their consent, they will 
be debriefed a bout the nature of the study and be compensated for the amount of 
time spent in the study. We may also stop an ongoing session, or end participation 
in the study because we have collected  all the information we need.  
20.2 Describe any procedures for orderly ter mination.    
NOTE:  Examples may include return of study drug , exit interview with clinician .  
Include whether additional follow up is recommended for safety reasons for 
physical or emotional health . 
Response:  
Participants will be debriefed about the natur e of the study and the reason for their 
removal, if a safety concern . No additional follow -up is needed.  
20.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including retention of already collected data, and partial 
withdraw al from procedures with continued data collection , as applicable . 
Response:  
Participants can withdraw from the research at any time. If participants withdraw, 
no further data will be collected, but any information that had been provided may 
be retained by  the researcher and analyzed.  
21.0 Risks to Subjects  
21.1 List the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or 
inconveniences to the subjects related to their participation in the research. 
Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks.   Include 
a description of the probability, magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the 
risks.  
NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data.  
Response:  
There may be some sensitivity associated from certain questions asked 
when filling out questionnaires or having body measurements taken and 
subjects might feel uncomfortable disclosing some personal information 
such as medical history. Subjects can refuse to answer any questions that 
they are not comfortable answering. Subjects will be free to withdraw 
from the study at any time, and their refusal to continue will not affect 
other medical care provided at any healthcare facility.  
Participants may experience hunger due to refraining from eating before 
the sessi on or possibly suffer a ne w allergic reaction to the PowerBar ( i.e., 
an allergic reaction to a food to which he/she was not allergic in the past). 
Feelings of hunger will subside when the participant is able to eat after  the 
session and the study food used  is a common food  thus researchers 
anticipate that participants will know if they should avoid eating them for 
 Page 35 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  medical, religious, or preference reasons. In addition, only personnel 
certified in CPR, first aid, and AED will conduct study sessions and these  
individuals are trained to contact appropriate medical personnel in the 
event of an emergency.  
Breach of confidentiality is another potential risk. The studies will occur 
in our facilities at the University at Buffalo and the Virginia Tech Carilion 
Resear ch Institute. To protect confidentiality, we will use only ID numbers 
and keep all data in locked cabinets or in locked offices  and password 
protected electronic files in password protected computers . Any data 
shared between sites will involve de -identifie d data only and files will be 
encrypted or password protected. These screening, monitoring, and 
confidentiality procedures have been in effect for more than 10 years and 
for more than 2,000 subjects across the various protocols employed by our 
group.  
Parti cipants may have a small bruised area on the finger from the pinprick 
site. The bruise should fade over time without treatment. If during the 
course of the study, a subject’s blood glucose exceeds the range for 
prediabetes (Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) 100 -125 mg/dl, or 2h glucose 
140-199 mg/dl after Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) or hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c) 5.7 -6.4%),  that subject will be directed to his or her 
physician or other medical care provider for further evaluation.  
Participants may have their blood pressure measured. If during the course 
of the study, a subject’s blood pressure reaches hypertensive crisis 
(180/110 mmHg), that subject will be directed to his or her physician or 
other medical care provider for further evaluation.  
During the fMRI,  movement or heating of metallic implants is a potential 
risk; subjects will thus be carefully screened to exclude individuals with 
metallic implants, fragments, or pacemakers. Some individuals may 
experience mild discomfort or anxiety in the scanner, and all subjects will 
be informed of this possibility prior to the study. In addition, throughout 
the scanning procedures, subjects will be able to communicate with the 
investigators via intercom, and any individual experiencing discomfort 
will be removed from  the scanner immediately.  
As noted, physical risk to subjects during fMRI recording is very low. 
Nevertheless, in addition to the measures to ensure the safety and comfort 
of subjects noted above, every effort will be made to provide information 
to subject s to minimize discomfort. There may be additional risks 
associated with scanning at 3 T compared to the conventional clinical 
scanners in the 1.5 -2.0 T range. These include:  
Effect of the static field. There is no conclusive evidence for irreversible 
or ha zardous bioeffects to acute, short -term exposures of humans up to 2.0 
T (Shellock et al., 1996). Studies have indicated some side -effects at 4.0 
T, namely unusual sensations including nausea, vertigo, and metallic taste. 
However, there is no evidence that these effects are either irreversible or 
 Page 36 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  harmful. If subjects experience unusual sensations, they will be 
withdrawn.  
Effect of the gradient field. MRI operates by rapidly changing small 
additional fields, called gradients. This will induce small electrical  
currents in any conductor, and thus could theoretically induce mild 
peripheral nerve stimulation. However, this is not substantially different at 
higher magnetic fields as the gradients are separate from the main magnet. 
There is no evidence that the effe ct of the gradients is any different at 3 T 
than at 1.5 T. However, if subjects experience peripheral nerve stimulation 
such as tingling or twitching, they will be withdrawn.  
Effect of the RF electromagnetic field. The higher magnetic field strength 
requir es that higher RF frequency pulses be used to excite the protons in 
the subject’s brain. The limits of RF energy that can be safely given to 
humans has been clearly defined by the FDA: a) The exposure to RF 
energy below the level of concern is an SAR of 0. 4 W/kg or less over the 
body, and 8.0 W/kg or less spatial peak in any 1 g of tissue, and 3.2 W/kg 
or less averaged over the head; or b) The exposure to RF energy that is 
sufficient to produce a core temperature increase of 1 degree C and 
localized heating  to no greater extent than 38 degrees C in the head, 39 
degrees C in the trunk, and 40 degrees C in the extremities, except for 
patients with impaired systemic blood flow and/or perspiration. The 
scanner has a large monitor indicating the RF power level wh ich can be 
limited to a specific maximum, and we will adhere to the 
recommendations.  
There are no othe r risks anticipated. All personne l on the study will be CITI 
course certified and have completed the good research practices certification. All 
identifia ble data will be password protected and only the research team will have 
access to that information. Subjects will be informed of the risks associated with 
the study.  
21.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of 
risks, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety.  
Response:  
We have several provisions in place to ensure participants’ privacy and 
safety is protected while the data is being collected. The lab facilities of 
the Division of Behavioral Medicine research laboratory consist of private 
interview rooms that will be use d. Only the interviewer and participant 
will be present in the room during interviews. Data is recorded such that 
not even the person putting it in the file would ever be able to associate the 
data with the identity of the person providing it. Data and fil es that have 
been de -identified and encrypted will be shared between sites. Therefore, 
there is no reasonable risk of a breach of confidentiality. Only personnel 
certified in CPR, first aid, and AED will conduct study sessions and these 
individuals are tra ined to contact appropriate medical personnel in the case 
of a serious event. Should an emergency situation occur, access to further 
 Page 37 of 49 IRB Version: JAN2016  medical care is available via a telephone located in the laboratory and the 
following emergency plan will be followed:  
1. Have the subject immediately stop any activity and lay down.  
2. Call for help! ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY (716 -645-2222) or 
POLICE (911).

Response:  
Principal Investigator. Leonard H. Epstein, PhD, at the University at 
Buffalo will be responsible for the oversight of subject issues and 
coordination of experimental behavioral medicine approaches.  Warren K. 
Bickel, PhD, at Virginia Tech will be responsible for management related 
to behavioral task data collection and analyses and will coordinate 
functional aspect of the fMRI component. Each PI will be responsible for 
recruitment at their site, comm unication with each other and their team, 
and for his own fiscal and research administration.  
Communication Process. Project coordinator, study staff and/or the PIs 
will have a local weekly meeting to discuss any current issues with the 
study, including, b ut not limited to; IRB approvals, procedures, staff 
training, data safety, and interim analyses. PI and/or project coordinator 
will schedule monthly conference calls to discuss study information. 
Monthly reports/meetings will be used to track recruitment, data, data 
quality control, interim analyses and any IRB concerns. The agendas and 
reports will be saved and filed at both locations. The PIs will communicate 
as needed, either by phone, e -mail, or in person, to discuss experimental 
design, data analysis, and all administrative responsibilities. Each PI will 
share their respective research results with the other PI, key personnel, and 
collaborators.

UB will have records IRB approval fo r both sites. This will include copies 
of consents, protocols, questionnaires, and any other IRB -related 
document. Amendments and modifications will be discussed in weekly 
conference call meetings and implemented through UB’s IRB as required.  
Data Safety &  Sharing/Transfer. Any and all potential safety concerns will 
be report ed both to the IRB and additional site in a timely manner. We 
will follow the outlined procedures based on UB’s IRB New Information 
Reporting form. Any adverse event will be communicated to both sites 
within 24 hours to inform . UB will report new information  to the IRB .  
Procedures. The two research groups will work collaboratively to implement 
research methods across the sites, and will develop common training procedures 
for the delay discounting, episodic future thinking, neuroimaging, and prediabetes 
compo nents of the study. Members of each research team will be responsible for 
development of relevant manuals of operation for study methods. These will be 
communicated in regular email and phone meetings, as well as face -to-face 
meetings where investigators w ill travel to the other University for training and 
quality control issues. Team members are used to this approach since they have 
been involved in multi - center basic science and clinical projects. Each site will be 
responsible for data quality control, b ased on a common protocol, and quality 
control will be implemented after data sets are built prior to analysis.  
29.2 Describe the method for communicating to engaged participating sites:  
• Problem s 
• Interim results  
• Study closure  
Response:

coordinators. Study coordinators and PI’s will be responsible for reporting 
adverse events to each IRB within the UB IRB Reporting form time fram e 
(i.e. 5 days for new information that impacts participant risk). Study 
coordinators and PI’s will be responsible for determining amendments 
required for changes to study protocol.  
Interim results. Data will be shared between sites and all data will be de -
identified prior to sending a password -protected/encrypted file. Study 
coordinators and PI’s will be responsible for communicating any interim 
results that are analyzed.

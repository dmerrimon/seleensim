TITLE A Randomized, Open-Label, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy 
and Safety of Alirocumab versus Usual Care in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes 
and Mixed Dyslipidemia at High Cardiovascular Risk with Non-HDL-C Not 
Adequately Controlled with Maximally Tolerated Statin Therapy 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multinational-Multicenter 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3b/4 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 Primary objective: 
x To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab in comparison with 
usual care in the reduction of non-high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (non-HDL-C) after 24 weeks of treatment in patients with 
Type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia at high cardiovascular (CV) 
risk with non-HDL-C not adequately controlled with maximally 
tolerated statin therapy. 
Secondary objective(s): 
x To demonstrate whether alirocumab is superior in comparison with 
usual care in its effects on other lipid parameters at Weeks 12 
and 24 (ie, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 
apolipoprotein B (Apo B), total cholesterol (Total -C), lipoprotein a 
(Lp[a]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides 
(TGs), triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TGRLs), apolipoprotein A-1 
(Apo A-1), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo C-III), lipid subfractions by 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (ie, LDL particle 
size and LDL, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), HDL, 
intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particle number) 
x To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab in comparison with 
usual care in the reduction of non-HDL-C at Week 12. 
x To assess changes in diabetes related parameters in patients 
randomized to alirocumab vs. usual care treatment over a period of 
24 weeks  
x To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab  
x  
 
x To evaluate changes in proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 
(PCSK9) concentrations at Weeks 12 and 24 
x To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies 
x To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab versus fenofibrate 
therapy on non-HDL-C and other lipid parameters 
STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3b/4 randomized, open-label, parallel group study to assess 
the efficacy and safety of alirocumab administered by subcutaneous (SC) 
injection versus usual care in patients with Type 2 diabetes and mixed 
dyslipidemia at high CV risk with non-HDL-C not adequately controlled with 
maximally tolerated statin therapy.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 4 tolerated by the patient without other lipid modifying therapies at baseline. 
Patients may be on no statin if unable to tolerate statin therapy as judged by 
the investigator. 
Randomization will be unbalanced (2:1, alirocumab:usual care). The study will 
be a multinational, multicenter study. 
Usual care includes the option to continue on the maximum dose of statin that 
is tolerated by the patient without the addition of a new lipid modifying therapy 
(LMT) at randomization, or the initiation of either ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid at randomization for the remainder of the 
24-week treatment period. Initiation of usual care treatment investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) should start as soon as possible after randomization, 
but no later than 7 days from the day of randomization. 
The Investigator will select the most appropriate LMT for the patient prior to 
randomization (consisting of either no additional LMT but continuing on 
maximum tolerated statin, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid) and enter this information into the interactive voice response 
system (IVRS). If the patient is randomized to open label alirocumab, the 
Investigator will not institute the LMT option that was selected and entered 
into IVRS but instead treat the patient with open label alirocumab. If the 
patient is randomized to usual care (non-alirocumab), the Investigator will initiate treatment with the LMT option that was selected and entered into 
IVRS, as applicable, in addition to continuing the patient on the maximum 
tolerated dose of statin. 
Randomization will be stratified by the Investigator’s selection of usual care 
therapy prior to randomization (for example, the intent to prescribe 
fenofibrate, intent to prescribe ezetimibe, etc). This will help ensure balanced 
treatment groups with patients’ characteristics as homogenous as possible. Recruitment of patients will complete when ~420 patients have been 
randomized. 
Patients randomized to open label alirocumab will continue on the maximum 
dose of statin that is tolerated by the patient and will administer alirocumab 
SC with a starting dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 12 weeks with a blinded uptitration to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W at week 12 if the non-HDL-C at 
the week 8 visit is 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L). Patients who have a non-
HDL-C <100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) at the Week 8 visit will continue with 
alirocumab 75 mg Q2W until the end of the treatment period. 
No changes during the course of the study will be made to the dose of LMT 
administered as part of the usual care arm except for nicotinic acid for which 
the Investigator may prescribe at randomization a scheduled/gradual dose titration in order to allow for the maximum dose to be achieved based on 
patient tolerability or except if needed for any usual care LMT for the safety of 
the patient, based on the Investigator’s judgment. 
The study consists of: 
x A screening period of up to 3 weeks; 
x An open-label treatment period (OLTP) of 24 weeks; 
x A safety observation period of 8 weeks. 
A phone visit will take place at Week 32 in order to document any adverse 
event(s) that might occur between Weeks 24 to 32. 
Patients should have been previously instructed on a cholesterol lowering diet 
prior to screening. During the study, the Investigator may reinforce diet

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 5 recommendations according to local/regional guidelines. Patients should be 
receiving antihyperglycemic treatment in accordance with local/ regional 
standards of care. Changes to antihyperglycemics should be limited and made only in circumstances where it is clinically needed. 
Statin dose and dose regimen should be stable throughout the entire study 
duration including for 4 weeks prior to the screening period and from 
screening to the end of the open label treatment period. 
The data on lipid parameters from blood samples will be masked after 
randomization. No attempts should be made by the Investigator or patient to 
have the patient’s lipid values independently evaluated after randomization 
until after the Week 24 visit, except for the safety of the patient as per the 
Investigator’s judgment.  At the end of the OLTP (Week 24 visit), the 
Investigator will continue to manage the patient’s lipids in accordance with 
standard practice.  Any lipid values after randomization (eg, if done for patient 
safety) should be redacted in the source documents and not shared with the 
Sponsor. 
Duration of study treatment will be 24 weeks with the last injection of open 
label alirocumab administered at Week 22. The treatments prescribed in the 
usual care arm will be administered for 24 weeks.  From the Week 24 visit 
onward, the Investigator will continue to manage the patient’s lipids in accordance with standard practice. 
Patients will visit the study site at Weeks -3, 0, 8, 12, 20, and 24 with lab work 
at each visit; in addition a phone visit is scheduled at Weeks 4 and 32.  
Week 8 is a critical visit because it will be the only scheduled visit where a 
non-HDL-C value for uptitration will be available. 
STUDY POPULATION  
Main selection criteria Inclusion criteria: 
I 01. Patients with Type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia not 
adequately controlled with a stable, maximum dose/regimen of 
statin that is tolerated by the patient* for at least 4 weeks prior to the 
screening visit (Week -3) without other LMT. 
*Note: The maximum dose/regimen of statin that is tolerated by the patient is 
the highest registered dose/regimen tolerated by the patient based on the 
judgment of the Investigator. Patients not able to be on a maximum dose/regimen of statin should be treated with the dose of statin which is 
considered appropriate for the patient as per the Investigator’s judgment or 
concerns. Some examples of acceptable reasons for a patient taking a lower 
statin dose include, but are not limited to: adverse effects on higher doses, 
advanced age, low body mass index (BMI), regional practices, local prescribing information, concomitant medications. Patients may be on 
alternate day dosing of statin as long as the dose is consistently taken (eg, 
dose every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc). Concomitant treatment with 
more than 1 statin is not permitted. Patients who have documented statin 
intolerance, as judged by the Investigator, and who are no longer on statin 
therapy as a result will also be eligible for  the study. The reason(s) for not 
being on a maximum dose/regimen of statin (including statin intolerance) will need to be documented in the case report form. 
I 02. Patients 18 years of age or legal age of majority at screening visit 
whichever is greater. 
I 03. Documented history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD) or at least one additional CV risk factor.

SAR236553-LPS14354 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 11 Patients in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment 
group allocated by randomization.  
The safety population considered for safety analyses will be the randomized 
population who received at least one dose or part of a dose of the open-label 
alirocumab and all patients randomized to usual care.  The safety population 
will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. 
Primary analysis: 
The percent change in non-HDL-C from baseline to Week 24 will be analyzed 
in the ITT population using a Mixed-effect Model with Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) approach. Non-HDL-C is defined as Total Cholesterol (Total-C) 
minus HDL-C. All post-baseline data available within Week 8 to Week 24 
analysis windows will be used and missing data are accounted for by the 
MMRM model. 
The model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group (usual 
care versus alirocumab), time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 20, Week 24), 
randomization strata, treatment-by-time point interaction, strata-by-time point 
interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline non-HDL-C 
value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. Alirocumab will be compared to usual care using appropriate contrasts, and the 97.5% 
confidence interval (CI) of the difference will be provided. 
Analysis of key secondary endpoints and other efficacy 
endpoints: 
A hierarchical procedure (concerning key secondary efficacy endpoints only) 
will be used to control the type I error and handle multiple endpoints. If the primary endpoint analysis is significant at the 2.5% alpha level, secondary 
endpoints will be tested sequentially, using the order defined in section “Key 
Secondary efficacy endpoints”. 
Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution (eg, 
lipids other than Lp[a] and TGs), will be analyzed using the same MMRM 
model as for the primary endpoint with the continuous fixed covariates of 
corresponding baseline value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. 
Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated to have a non-normal distribution 
(eg, Lp[a] and TGs) will be analyzed using multiple imputation approach for 
handling of missing values followed by robust regression. Binary secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed using multiple imputation approach for handling of 
missing values followed by logistic regression.  
All the efficacy endpoints (primary, key secondary and other efficacy 
endpoints) will also be analyzed for the patients intended to receive 
fenofibrate in order to compare the efficacy of alirocumab versus fenofibrate; 
for this subgroup, significance will be claimed at the 2.5% alpha level and the 
hierarchical procedure will be used as well. The comparison of alirocumab 
versus the other options of the usual care will be performed via exploratory 
subgroup analyses.  
Analysis of other endpoints: Descriptive analyses will be performed concerning questionnaire and diabetes

Week 24 is needed for scientific communication purposes, safety analyses 
would be performed at the same time as efficacy analysis, with all safety data available until the cut-off date, and an update would be performed at 
Week 32. 
Advanced analysis: All the efficacy data will be available for the final analysis at a cut-off date 
corresponding to the Week 24 visit of the last patient. All the safety data will 
be available at the end of the study (Week 32). If needed for scientific 
communication purposes, both the efficacy and safety analyses will be 
performed at the Week 24 cut-off date, with an update for safety at the end of the study. If not needed, the 2 analyses will be performed at the same time, at 
the end of the study (Week 32). 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient)  The duration of the study is up to 9 months to include a 3-week screening 
period, a 24-week treatment period, and an 8-week period of safety 
observation. 
Patients with a serious adverse event (SAE) or an adverse event of special 
interest should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death.

b Physical examination and vital signs:  height, weight, HR, and BP.  Abnormal vital signs are to be recorded as adverse events o nly if they are medically relevant: symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, 
leading to discontinuation and/or fulfilling a seriousness criterion. 
c Injection-training is performed with placebo. Investigators will have the option of providing a second placebo for alirocumab f or patients who require additional self-injection training. The first open label injection is 
administered at the site by the patient or a trained designated person with open label treatment kit allocated by IVRS. Further  training with open label treatment can be done for patient’s randomized to alirocumab 
at an additional unscheduled visit(s) at the time of a planned injection per protocol, as per patient or Investigator’s judgmen t.  Only patients who are randomized to alirocumab will receive an injection of alirocumab 
at the randomization visit. 
d For kit dispensation:  along with kit dispensation, the treatment administration package should be given as well as the patient  diary and injection instruction manual, as needed. 
e Duration of study treatment will be 24 weeks.  Alirocumab w ill be administered every two weeks with the last injection of open label alirocumab administered at Week 22. The treatments prescribed in the usual 
care arm will be administered for 24 weeks.  At the end of the open-label treatment period (Week 24 visit), the Investigator wi ll continue to manage the patient’s lipids in accordance with standard practice. 
f Safety evaluation:  adverse events (AEs), and product complaints regardless of seriousness or relationship to alirocumab treatm ent, will be collected from the ti me the patient signs the informed consent form (ICF) 
until the end of the post-open-label treatment safety observation period.  If the patient discontinues the study, AEs would nee d to be reported up to 70 days after the last dose of open-label investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) or 70 days after the last on-site study visit if randomized to usual care and the Investigator has not prescribed  an additional LMT, or Study Day 225, whichever comes first.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 27 4 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 
Background on patient populations: 
More than 380 million people worldwide have diabetes ( 1), most of whom will die from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( 2, 3, 4). Compared to people without diabetes, those with diabetes 
are at higher risk of developing CVD, develop associat ed clinical complications and at an earlier 
age, and have shortened life expectancy by about 6-7 years ( 5, 6, 7). In addition to the high human 
cost of disease, CVD contributes greatly to the overall healthcare expe nditure in these patients ( 4). 
Individuals with diabetes often have mixed dyslipidemia characterized by elevated 
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and low HDL-C, leading to higher coronary heart disease (CHD) risk than raised LDL-C alone ( 8, 9). Management of mixed dyslipide mia is a persistent challenge 
in clinical practice and these patients are less likely to achieve recommended lipid levels 
following lipid modifying therapy (LMT) ( 10). 
Non-HDL-C: 
Non-HDL-C has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mixed dyslipidemia since it 
encompasses all of the circulating atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL, and lipoprotein a 
(Lp[a]). It has been shown to be superior to LDL-C in predicting CVD risk in individuals with 
diabetes ( 11). It is simply assessed by subtracting HDL-C from total c holesterol (Total-C). The 
specific non-HDL-cholesterol target differs depending on the guidelines consulted and the severity of risk experienced by the patient, but they generally recommend a target of <100 mg/dL in patients with diabetes at high cardiovascular (CV) risk (with documented CVD, severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), or with 1 or more CV risk factors and/or target organ damage) ( 5, 12, 13). 
Lipid modifying therapy for management of mixed dyslipidemia: 
Statins
 
Statins significantly lower LDL-C and non-HDL-C and, to a lesser extent, also lower TGs and 
raise HDL-C. Multiple clinical trials with statins and subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes 
have demonstrated significant reductions in CV events ( 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19). Greater reductions 
in LDL-C produce greater reduction in CV events, and comparative data of intensive versus standard statin treatme nt suggest that the lower the LDL-C leve l, the greater the benefit in patients 
at high CV risk ( 20, 21, 22, 23). Data from a meta-analyses including over 18 000 patients with 
diabetes suggest that, for each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL)  decrease in LDL-C patients with diabetes 
experienced a 9% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 13% reduction in vascular mortality over a mean follow up period of 4.3 years ( 19). 
Despite the widespread use of statin therapies, many patie nts with diabetes and dyslipidemia 
remain sub-optimally treated ( 20, 21, 24) or may be intolerant to sta tin therapy, due to troubling

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 28 side effects, and many go on to experience CV events. Additional therapies are used to manage 
mixed dyslipidemia, including ez etimibe, fibrates, nicotinic acid and omega-3 fatty acids. 
Currently, it remains unknown which is the best treatment strategy to address lipid abnormalities in these patients and to reduce CV burden. 
Ezetimibe
 
Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption from the intestine, and lowers apolipoprotein B (Apo B), 
non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TGs. The CV benefits of adding ezetimibe to a statin in patients post-acute coronary syndrome wer e recently demonstrated ( 25). Individuals with diabetes may 
have even higher benef it from this combination therapy ( 25). 
Fibrates
 
Fibrates are the most effective drugs for lowering TGs. They also may lower LDL-C and raise 
HDL-C. The potential CV outcome benefit of fenofibrate and statin combination therapy compared with statin monotherapy was evaluated in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid trial ( 26). In the overall study cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes, 
there was no significant difference in the primary end point of the first occurrence of nonfatal 
myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or death from CV causes. A pre-specified subgroup analysis suggested a possible interaction according to the lipid subgroup, with a possible benefit for patients with both high baseline TGs and low HDL-C (p = 0.057 for interaction) ( 26). 
Omega-3 fatty acids
 
Omega-3 fatty acids lower TGs but have little effect on LDL- C and HDL-C. Despite having 
multiple effects on surrogate cardioprotective markers (attenuate inflammation, improve endothelial function and reduce thrombus formation), omega-3 fatty acids have not been shown to improve CV outcomes in individuals with diabetes ( 27). 
Nicotinic acid
 
Nicotinic acid is currently the most effective drug in raising HD L-C with a moderate effect on 
lowering of LDL-C, TGs and Lp(a). However, the combination of nicotinic acid and statin has not been shown to provide additional CV benefits when compared with statin monotherapy in 2 outcome studies ( 28, 29). 
Background to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9): 
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) in this study is alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to 
proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is involved in regulating the levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) protein. Once PCSK9 is secreted in to plasma it directly binds to the LDL-R and 
promotes its degradation. The increased degradation of LDL-Rs leads to a reduced LDL particle 
removal and, therefore higher LDL-C circulating levels. Blocking PCSK9 binding to the LDL-R 
can potentially benefit patients with hypercholesterolemia by decreasing their plasma LDL-C levels and reducing non-HDL-C ( 30, 31, 32, 33, 34).

SAR236553-LPS14354 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 29 Summary of select clinical studies with alirocumab: 
As of 31 December 2014, 12 Phase 3 studies were completed or had a first step analysis 
completed, with 10 evaluating alirocumab administe red every 2 weeks (Q2W regimen) and 
2 evaluating alirocumab administered every 4 weeks (Q4W regimen). These studies evaluated 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) patients, patients with a range of CV risk but 
predominately high and very high risk, and patients  not taking statins including statin intolerant 
patients. 
Phase 3 studies that evaluated Q2W regimen – efficacy results:  
Ten studies that were completed or had a first step analysis evaluating 75 mg Q2W (with possible 
up-titration to 150 mg Q2W at Week 12) and 150 mg Q2W as initiation dose /dose regimen were performed.  Averaged across the various studies, alirocumab use resulted in a mean -45.6 to -48.9% reduction in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 in studies that investigated the up-titration regimen and -60.4% in studies that solely investigated 150 mg Q2W dosing, whereas control rates were 0.5 to 4.2% (placebo) and -19.3 to -22.3% (ezetimibe). Superiority in LDL-C 
reduction was demonstrated in all placebo-controlled studies with alirocumab administered as 
add-on to a maximally to lerated dose of statin. Superiority in LDL-C reduction was also 
demonstrated in all ezetimibe-contr olled studies, with alir ocumab being administe red as add-on to 
statin, or to LMTs other than statin, or in monotherapy. Overall, absolute reductions in LDL-C in the range of -40 to -90 mg/dL (-1.03 to -2.33 mmol/L) were observed in the alirocumab treatment arms. 
LDL-C reduction observed at Week 24 was ma intained over time in all the studies including those 
up to 78 weeks. In all studies, the LDL-C reduction was observed at the first LDL-C measurement following the first alirocumab dose at Week 4. 
Significant and clinically meaningful reductions were also observed in pro-atherogenic 
biomarkers, including non-HDL-C, Apo B, and To tal-C. Alirocumab was also superior to 
placebo, and to ezetimibe in most studies, for the reduction in Lp(a). Modest but consistent reductions in fasting TGs and increases in HDL-C were also observed with alirocumab treatment. 
Clinical safety:
 
In the completed studies, or studies with first-step analysis, 391 patients from Phase 1, and 
4300 patients from Phase 2 and Phase 3 have been exposed to 1 or more doses of alirocumab.  
 
. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 safety results:  
Safety data was analyzed from pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies with a Q2W dosing, which 
included a total of 5234 patients, of which 3340 patients were treated with alirocumab at a dose of 75 or 150 mg Q2W.

SAR236553-LPS14354 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 30 In the placebo-controlled and ezetimibe-controlled pooled studies, no dose relationship was noted 
for any adverse events (AEs) and there was no evidence of a pattern in the type of AEs observed. The percentages of patients who experienced at least 1 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), at least 1 treatment-emer gent serious adverse event (SAE), and any TEAEs leading to 
permanent treatment discontinuation were similar between the alirocumab and control groups. 
There was no safety signal observ ed with neurologic events and ne urocognitive disorders, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increase and hepatic disorders, adjudicated CV events, diabetes mellitus, and ophthalmologic disorders in the alirocumab-treated group overall, but more cataracts (2.1%) were noted in patients treated with alirocumab who achieved 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 mg/dL compared to those treat ed with alirocumab who did not meet this criterion (0.6%). 
The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with alirocumab were local injection site 
reactions (6.2% patients in the alirocumab group versus 4.2% in control groups in the global pool). Injection site reactions, influenza (upper respiratory symptoms), and pruritus were identified as adverse drug reactions (ADR). Rare and sometimes serious allergic adverse reactions 
(eg, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis) have been 
reported from clinical studies in patients receiving alirocumab. 
The analysis of the safety data with Q2W dosing did not suggest a safety signal as of 
31 December 2014. 
Further details on alirocumab are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
SELECTION OF THE DOSE 
Based on the results of the dose finding studies carried out with statin as background therapy, the 
Q2W dosing regimen is appropriate to maintain constant LDL-C lowering throughout the interdosing interval in statin-treat ed patients, with the maximum effi cacy at 12 weeks provided by 
the 150 mg Q2W dosing. A 75 mg Q2W dose was developed for patients who may not need the 
magnitude of effect observed with the 150 mg Q2W to achieve their individual target LDL-C 
goal, with up-titration to 150 mg Q2W in patients not achieving their LDL-C goal. Two main doses of alirocumab with the Q2W dosing regimen are evaluated in the on-going ODYSSEY Phase 3 program and assess both an initiation with 75 mg, with up-titration to 150 mg in patients who do not reach pre-de fined LDL-C levels, ba sed on their CV risk, and initiating treatment 
directly with the 150 mg Q2W dose.  
Rationale for protocol design: 
The objective of the present study is to assess the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in patients 
with Type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia with established CVD or otherwise at high CV risk whose non-HDL-C is not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated statin therapy. Patients 
will also be included if they ar e statin intolerant or are on alternat e day dosing of statin. Although 
statins serve as the foundation for LDL-C lowering many patients are not optimally managed and a second therapy to bring non-HDL-C to within the target range is frequently used in patients with diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia. There is no single preferred second line treatment for patients with elevated non-HDL-C as guidelines suggest an individualized approach. Alirocumab will be

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 31 compared to the physician’s usual care that will include the  option to continue on maximally 
tolerated statin monotherapy with no additional LMT, or to add either ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated beneficial effects of these therapies on the multiple lipid abnorm alities that characterize mixed dyslipidemia. 
It is important to note that all pa tients will continue their  maximally tolera ted statin therapy. 
Physician’s choice of next ste p therapy (ie, usual care) will be made at  randomization and 
implemented in patients who are not randomized to alirocumab. The treatment strategy implemented post-randomization will remain unchanged throughout the study.  
Alirocumab will be evaluated at a dose of 75 mg Q2W with a blinded increase of dose to 150 mg 
Q2W if non-HDL-C values at Week 8 are 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L). 
It is possible that some patients in a lirocumab arm may a ttain LDL-C levels well below 70 mg/dL. 
Persons with genetic mutations such as heterozygous form of hypobetalipoproteinemia linked to Apo B mutations or loss of function PCSK9 mutations have very low LDL-C levels throughout life and have low vascular risk, and no apparent adverse effects ( 33, 35, 36, 37). 
 
 
The sample size of 420 patients with treatment duration of 24 weeks is intended to provide a 
broad safety experience in this patient population and to assess the impact of uptitration of alirocumab on efficacy and safety parameters. The control group is composed of patients receiving usual care and is appropriate for the objectives of this study.  
Conclusion on the benefit risk assessment with alirocumab: 
Based on the clinical data available to date, treatment with alirocumab has demonstrated a 
significant LDL-C and non-HDL-C lowering ef fect and was ge nerally well tolerated in a 
population of patients with non-familial hypercholesterolemia (non-FH) or with heFH, including 
patients with a history of intoleran ce to statins. The efficacy on LDL-C was associated with 
consistent results in Total-C, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and Apo B/apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) ratio. Reductions in lipoprotein (a) and TGs and increases in HDL-C were also observed with alirocumab treatment.  There was no safety signal observed with neurologic events and neurocognitive disorders, ALT in crease and hepatic disorder s, adjudicated CV events, diabetes 
mellitus, and ophthalmologic disorders. 
Injection site reactions, influenza (upper respiratory symptoms), and pruritus were identified as 
ADRs. Rare and sometimes serious allergic adverse reactions (eg, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hyperse nsitivity vasculitis) have been re ported from clinical studies in 
patients receiving alir ocumab. Alirocumab lower ed LDL-C below 25 mg/dL in some patients. 
 
 
The benefit of alirocumab on CV morbidity and morta lity has not yet been determined and is 
under investigation in the on-going ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 32 This study is being undertaken to evaluate the risk benefit profile of alirocum ab in patients with 
diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia. In the ODYSSEY* program, the effect of alirocumab in patients with diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia has not been assessed in a dedicated study. The important clinical question is which therapy to add as the next lipid loweri ng agent when a patient with 
mixed dyslipidemia is not at non-HDL-C target despite taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. 
Therefore, a head to head study with alirocumab versus usual care in this patient population would be needed to address this question in an evidence based manner. This study design allows the physician to make the therapeutic choice for his/her patient with diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia and elevated non-HDL-C despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. Superiority of alirocumab versus fenofibrate on non-HDL-C and other  lipid parameters will also be assessed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 34 6 STUDY DESIGN 
6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
This is a Phase 3b/4 randomized, open-label, parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety 
of alirocumab administe red by subcutaneous (SC) injection versus usual care in patients with 
Type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia at high CV risk with non-HDL-C not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated statin therapy. The study will be multinational and multicenter. The study consists of a screening period of up to 3 weeks, an open-label treatment period (OLTP) of 24 weeks, and a safety observation period of 8 weeks. 
Patients, unless they are statin intolerant, will be taking a stable, maximally tolerated dose of 
statin therapy without other lipid modifying therapies (LMT). Statin dose and dose regimen should be stable throughout the entire study duration including for 4 weeks prior to the screening period and from screening to the end of the open label treatment period. Patients should continue 
to follow a cholesterol lowering  diet during the study, however, the Investigator may reinforce 
diet recommendations according to local/regional guidelines. Patients should be receiving treatment for diabetes in accordance with local/regional standards of care. Changes to antihyperglycemics should be limited and made only in circumstances where it is clinically needed. 
Randomization will be unbalanced (2 :1, alirocumab:usual care).  
The usual care arm includes the option to continue on the maximum dose of statin tha t is tolerated 
by the patient without the addition of a new LMT at randomization, or may initiate either ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid at randomization for the remainder of the 24-week treatment period.  Initiation of usual care treatment (IMP) should start as soon as 
possible after randomization, but no later than 7 days from the day of randomization. 
The Investigator will select the most appropriate LMT for the patient prior to randomization 
(consisting of either no additional LMT but continuing on maximum tolerated statin, ezetimibe, 
fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid) and enter this information into the interactive 
voice response system (IVRS).  If the patient is randomized to open label alirocumab, the Investigator will not institute the LMT option that wa s selected and entered into IVRS but instead 
treat the patient with open label alirocumab. If the patient is randomized to usual care (non-alirocumab), the Inve stigator will initiate trea tment with the LMT option tha t was selected and 
entered into IVRS, as applicable, in addition to continuing the patient on the maximum tolerated 
dose of statin. 
Patients randomized to open la bel alirocumab will c ontinue on the maximum dose of statin that is 
tolerated by the patient and will administer alirocumab SC with a starting dose of 75 mg Q2W for 12 weeks with a blinded uptitration to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W at week 12 if the non-HDL-C at the week 8 visit is 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L). Patients who have a non-HDL-C <100 mg/dL 
(2.59 mmol/L) at the Week 8 visit will continue with alirocumab 75 mg Q2W until the end of the

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 35 treatment period. No changes during the course of the study will be made to the dose of LMT 
administered as part of the usual care arm except for nicotinic acid for which the Investigator may prescribe at randomization a schedule d/gradual dose titration in or der to allow for the maximum 
dose to be achieved based on patie nt tolerability or except if needed for any usual care LMT for 
the safety of the patient, based on the Investigator’s judgment. 
The study consists of: 
x A screening period of up to 3 weeks; 
x An OLTP of 24 weeks 
x A safety observation period of 8 weeks. 
A phone visit will take place at Week 32 in order to document any adverse event(s) that might 
occur between Weeks 24 to 32. 
Patients should have been previously instructed on a cholesterol lowering diet prior to screening.  
During the study, the Investigator may reinforce diet recommendations according to local/regional guidelines. Patients should be receiving antihyperglycemic treatment in accordance with 
local/regional standards of care. 
Statin dose and dose regimen should be stable throughout the entire study duration including for 
4 weeks prior to the screening period and from screening to the end of the open label treatment 
period.  
The data on lipid parameters from blood samples will be masked after randomization. No attempts 
should be made by the Investigator or patient to have the patient’s lipid values independently evaluated after randomization until after the Week 24 visit, except for the safety of the patient as 
per the Investigator’s judgment. At the end of the OLTP (Wee k 24 visit), the Investigator will 
continue to manage the patient’s lipids in accordance with standard practice. Any lipid values after randomization (eg, if done for patient safety) should be redacted in the source documents and 
not shared with the Sponsor. 
Duration of study treatment will be 24 weeks wit h the last injection of open label alirocumab 
administered at Week 22. The treatments prescribed in the usual care arm will be administered for 24 weeks.  From the Week 24 visit onward, the In vestigator will continue to manage the patient’s 
lipids in accordance with standard practice. 
Patients will visit the study site at Weeks -3, 0, 8, 12, 20, and 24 with lab work at each visit; in 
addition a phone visit is scheduled at Weeks 4 and 32. Week 8 is a critical visit because it will be the only scheduled visit where a non-HDL-C value for uptitration will be available. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION

x a 24-week OLTP 
x a safety observation period of 8 weeks after the end of the OLTP 
Note, the Investigator will need to document in the CRF any AEs that have occurred up to Study 
Day 225.  A phone visit will take place at Week 32 in order to ensure documentation of any AEs 
that might occur during this period.  If the patient prematurely discontinues the study: 
x if treated with IMP, AEs would need to be reported up to 70 days after the last dose of 
IMP or Study Day 225, whichever comes first (even if patient continues on the usual care treatment that was added at randomization after discontinuing the study). 
x if randomized to usual care without additional LMT, AEs would need to be reported up to 
70 days after the last on-site study visit, or Study Day 225, whichever comes first. 
Patients with an SAE or an adverse event of special interest (AESI) should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or death. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The end of study is defined as be ing the last patient last visit/contact.  
6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
If needed for the purpose of scientific communication, an analysis of efficacy and safety may be 
conducted after the last patient has completed the Week 24 visit. At that time, all the efficacy data will be available for final analysis. Since safety da ta are being collected until the end of the study 
(Week 32), if the analysis with Week 24 data is performed, an update of the safety analysis will be performed at the end of the study.  If analyses are not needed at Week 24, then there will be only a one time analysis at the end of the study (Week 32).  
6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES 
Steering committee 
The Steering Committee is composed of university- based scientists (exper ts in lipids field, and/or 
Endocrinology/Diabetology) with clinical and study conduct expertise, working in collaboration with Sponsor based scientists. The committee will provide guidance on designing and conducting a scientifically sound study and ensure accurate reporting of the study. The Steering Committee will address and resolve  scientific issues if en countered during the study. They will also help with 
the study recruitment, as needed. The Steering Committee members and Sponsor based scientists 
will participate in face-to-face meetings at regular intervals throughout the study and in regularly 
scheduled teleconferences. Detailed activities and responsibilities of the Steering Committee will be described in the Steering Committee Charter.

7.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA 
I 01. Patients with Type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia not adequately controlled with a 
stable maximum dose/regimen of statin that is tolerated by the patient* for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit (Week -3) without other LMT. 
*Note: The maximum dose/r egimen of statin that is  tolerated by the patient is the highest 
registered dose/regimen tolerated by the  patient based on the judgment of the Investigator.  
Patients not able to be on a maximum dose/regimen of statin, should be treated with the dose of statin which is considered appropriate for the patient as per the Investigator’s judgment or concerns. Some examples of acceptable reasons for a patient taking a lower statin dose include, but are not limited to: adverse effects on higher doses, advanced age, low body mass index (BMI), regional practices, local prescribing information, concomitant 
medications. Patients may be on an alternate day dose of statin as long as the dose is 
consistently taken (eg, dose every Mond ay, Wednesday, Friday, etc). Concomitant 
treatment with more than 1 sta tin is not permitted. Patients who have documented statin 
intolerance, as judged by the Investigator, and who are no longer on statin therapy as a result will also be eligible for the study. The reason(s) for not being on a maximum 
dose/regimen of statin (including statin intolerance) will need to be documented in the case 
report form. 
I 02. Patient 18 years of age or legal age of majority at screening visit whiche ver is greater. 
I 03. Documented history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at least one 
additional CV risk factor.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
8.1.1 Alirocumab 
Sterile alirocumab drug product will be supplied at a concentration of 75 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL 
in histidine, pH 6.0, polysorbate 20, and sucrose, both as 1 mL volume, in an auto-injector (also known as prefilled pen). 
Sterile placebo for alirocumab will be prepared in the same formulation as alirocumab without the 
addition of protein as 1 mL volume in a pref illed pen, for the pa tients to perform injection 
training. 
During the screening period, the patient (or another designated person) will have to perform a 
placebo self-injection training, using a prefilled pen, before randomization and the first administration of alirocumab IMP.   
For those patients randomized to alirocumab, the initial dose is 75 mg administered SC once 
Q2W. The dose will be increased in a blinded fashion to 150 mg Q2W at Week 12 for patients randomized to alirocumab if the Week 8 non-HDL-C value is 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L).   
NOTE: in order to ensure the continuity of the study treatment without interruption (only in the 
event the manufacturer faces any performance or supply issues of the prefilled pen), contingency 
alternatives are: 
x in case of disruption of the 150 mg prefilled pen only, if the use of 75 mg prefilled pens is 
maintained, patients will need to administer 2 injections as follows: 
- 2 injections of 75 mg as 1 mL each in a prefilled pen for patients receiving the 150 mg 
dose 
- 1 injection of 75 mg as 1 mL in a prefilled pen plus 1 injection of placebo as 1 mL in a 
prefilled pen for patients receiving the 75 mg dose 
OR 
x in case of disruption of either 75 mg or 150 mg or both prefilled pens, patients will be 
switched to the use of prefilled syringes of 75 mg or 150 mg, with one injection of 1 mL 
for each of these doses. 
Should this occur, the alternative alirocumab IMP will be maintained until the end of the study.

SAR236553-LPS14354 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 44 8.1.1.1 Route and method of administration 
A prefilled pen training guide (auto-injector training guide)  will be provided to the sites and 
instructions for use (auto-injector for use) will be provided to the patie nt. Each administration of 
alirocumab will consist of 1mL SC injection in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of upper arm (ie, deltoid region). If another concomita nt drug is being injected at the same site planned for the 
alirocumab injection, then the patient should be advised to use an alternate location for administration of alirocumab. 
Alirocumab could be administered by self-injection or by another designated person (such as a 
spouse, relative, etc). In case a designated person is due to inject alirocumab to a patient during 
the study, it must be ensured that this person has been ad equately trained prior to administering 
the injection. Anyone that plans to administer alirocumab must be trained by the study staff. 
Instructions should be provided to the patient (or another designated person [such as spouse, 
relative, etc] that will administer the inj ections) at training and as neede d during the course of the 
study. Close supervision and feedback should be given at the first visit, and other visits as needed.  
The used prefilled pen wi ll be discarded in a sharps contain er which will be pr ovided to patients.  
It is recommended that the SC alirocumab injections be rotated within an anatomical area (eg, 
right thigh, then left thigh or right abdomen, then left abdomen). Patients also have the option to inject in a different anatomical area (eg, thigh then abdomen or the outer area of upper arm, etc) during the study. 
Patients will be asked to store alirocumab in a refrigerator. Prior to administration, alirocumab 
should be set outside in a safe location at room temperature for about 30 to 40 minutes. Thereafter, alirocumab should be administered as soon as possible. 
8.1.1.2 Timing of administration 
During the screening period, patients or the designated person will have to perform a placebo 
self-injection training using a prefilled pen, before randomization and the first alirocumab 
injection. 
At the randomization visit, the first alirocumab injection will be done at the site by the patient or 
another designated person (such as spouse, relative, etc) under direct site staff supervision. Patients will be monitored at the investigational site for at least 30 minutes after this first injection in this study. If the designated person changes during the course of the study, the new designated person will need to be trained with placebo prior to administering alirocumab to the patient. 
Alirocumab SC injections will then be  performed outside of the clinic, Q2W up to the last 
injection. If the injection is scheduled to take place on the same date as the site visit, then alirocumab should be administered after the blood sampling has been completed. In exceptional 
cases, if a patient prefers to have the injection performed at the study site and provisions are able 
to be made to accommodate the administration of injections at the site, it may also be allowed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 45 Alirocumab should be administered SC Q2W, ideally at approximately the same time of the day; 
however, it is acceptable to have a window period of ±3 days. The time of the day is based upon the patient’s preference. 
If by mistake or due to other circumstances an injection is delayed by: 
x more than 7 days from the missed date or completely missed, then the patient should 
return to the original schedule of alirocumab administration without administering delayed injections. 
x less than or equal to 7 days from the missed date, then the patient should administer the 
delayed injection and then resume the original schedule of alirocumab administration. 
Please note that injections should not be administered within less than 7 calendar days. Please 
refer to Section  10.4.1.3  for the definition of overdose with alirocumab. 
8.1.2 Usual care treatment 
There are five options available in the usual care arm including the option to add no additional 
LMT on top of the maximum dose/regimen of statin that is tolerated by the patient or to start one of the following treatments: eze timibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fa tty acids or nicotinic acid. All 
patients, regardless of the usual care option that has been selected, should continue on the maximum dose/regimen of statin (non-IMP) that is tolerated by the patient. 
The following drugs are identified as IMP:   
x Ezetimibe, 
x Nicotinic acid, 
x Fenofibrate, 
x Omega-3 fatty acids 
The pharmaceutical form, dose and number of units per administra tion and timing of dosing of 
usual care treatment will be dete rmined by the Investigator, and prescribed as per the 
Investigator’s usual practice in accordance with local standard of care. 
The usual care IMP will be financially supported by Sanofi.  The Investigator will provide the 
patient with a prescription for usual care IMP at randomization and at Week 12 to cover the treatment period. The commercially available products will be delivered to the patient by the Investigator or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacist) according to the prescription.

8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
The following classes of drugs are identified as non-IMP because the medication is a background therapy: 
x Statins 
Background statin treatment will not be provided by the Sponsor.  Patients will obtain these 
medications in compliance with local regulations. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
While allocation to treatment will be open-label, once a patient is randomized to alirocumab, data on the dose of alirocumab from Week 12 will be blinded. As such, alirocumab 75 mg and 150 mg will be provided in identically ma tched prefilled pens and will be packaged identically, which 
includes labeling to protect the blind. Each treatment kit will be labeled with a number which will be generated by a computer program from Sa nofi. The treatment kit number s will be obtained by 
the Investigator at the time of patient randomization and subsequent patient visits scheduled via IVRS/interactive web response (IWRS) that will be available 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected ADR unblinding by the Sponsor. 
8.3.1 Adverse event 
Information on dose of alirocumab may be unblinded by the Pharmacovigilance Department for 
reporting to the Health Authority of any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), ie, any Serious Adverse Event that is both unex pected (per the specific section of the 
Clinical Investigator’s brochure and reasonably associated with the use of alirocumab according to either the judgment of the Investigator and /or the Sponsor. 
Refer to Section  10.5 on suspected unexpected ADR  unblinding by the Sponsor. 
8.3.2 Lipid parameters 
Lipid parameter values from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit, run by the 
central lab, will not be communicated to the sites so that they cannot deduce the treatment effect based on non-HDL-C level attained. The sponsor’s operational team will not have access to lipid 
parameters associated with patient identification until after the final data base lock has occurred. 
For safety purposes, TG alerts for TG values 500 mg/dL any time after randomization will be 
sent to the Investigator ( Section  8.8.1  and Section  9).

lipids in accordance with standard practice. Any lipid values after randomization should be redacted in the source documents and not shared with the Sponsor. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
The randomized list of trea tment kit numbers will be generated centrally by Sanofi. Alirocumab 
(alirocumab 75 or 150 mg kits, or placebo training kit) will be packaged in accordance with this list. 
The Trial Supply Operations Manager will provide the randomized list of treatment kit numbers 
and the Study Biostatistic ian will provide the ra ndomization scheme to the  centralized treatment 
allocation system provider. Then, this centralize d treatment alloca tion system provider will 
generate the patient randomization list according to which it will allocate the treatments to the patients. 
Patients will be randomized to receive either usual care or alirocumab during the OLTP.  The 
randomization ratio aliroc umab:usual care will be 2:1. For each  patient randomize d to alirocumab, 
there will be several corresponding treatment kit numbers (resupply visits), which will be allocated through the centra lized treatment allocati on system. The randomiza tion is stratified by 
intent to prescribe usual care (eg,  intent to prescribe ezetimibe, intent to pres cribe fenofibrate). 
The treatment kit numbers will be allocated using the centralize d treatment allo cation system on 
randomization visit (Day 1, Week 0), and then at Week 12 as re-supply visits, and at unscheduled 
visits if needed. 
For patients in the aliroc umab treatment arm, the tr eatment kit allocated at Week 12 will be based 
on their Week 8 non-HDL-C level following the up-titration rules ( Section  6.1). Regular transfer 
of data will be planned betw een the central laboratory and the  centralized t reatment allocation 
system provider in order to proceed in a blinded manner for study sites and sponsor. 
Before randomizing a patient, the Investigator or designee will have  to contact the centralized 
treatment allocation system (eg, IVRS/IWRS). 
A randomized patient is defined as a patient who is registered and, if randomized to alirocumab, 
assigned with a treatment kit number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file. A patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. If a 
treatment is used without contacting the centralized treatment allocation system, then the patient 
will be considered as not randomized and withdrawn from the study. 
Two types of centralized t reatment allocation systems will be use d, the IVRS and the IWRS 
depending on the choice of the site.

8.5.1 Alirocumab 
For the OLTP, each open-label treatment kit will be prepared to contain 6 prefilled pens.  
In order to protect the blinding of dose information, treatment kit boxes for injection provided at 
Week 12 will have the same look and feel and therefore will be labeled with the same label. 
In addition to the open-label treatment kits for injection, a training kit containing 1 placebo for 
alirocumab pref illed pen will be prepared for the pu rpose of instructing patients on injection 
administration which is to be performed prior to randomization. If deemed necessary, a second injection training with placebo for alirocumab can be performed using an additional training kit prior to randomization.  Injection training with placebo will be performed and documented in the source data and the CRF, including if the designated person who administers alirocumab to the patient changes during the course of the study. 
Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements.

be in place for transportation of the alirocumab ki ts from the study site to the patient’s 
refrigerator. 
8.6.2 Usual Care 
Usual care treatments (IMP) will be stored in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.   
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the  quality of IMP may be subject to initia tion of a recall pr ocedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Measures taken to ensure and document IMP (alirocumab or usual care) compliance and accountability are described below: 
x The Investigator or designee will obtain via IVRS/IWRS the trea tment kit number(s) and 
he/she will dispense the treatme nt kit(s) to the patient if  the patient is randomized to 
alirocumab. 
x The Investigator or designee will enter th e treatment kit packaging number(s) and the kit 
numbers in the e-CRF, if applicable. 
x Alirocumab administration da ta will be recorded by the pa tients onto a Patient diary. If the 
patient is randomized to usual care, a diary to collect information on treatment compliance 
will also be completed by the patie nt and data recor ded into the CRF. 
x For alirocumab: 
- Used pens (sharps container) and the treatment kit dispensed at the previous 
dispensation visit are brought back by the patient at Weeks 12 and 24, as applicable

The patient will be instructe d on the importance to take the study treatme nt as planned for the 
remainder of the treatment duration. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
A detailed trea tment log of the destroyed IMP will be  established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by the Investigator and the monitoring team. The Investigator will 
not destroy the unused IMP before the Sponsor provides written authorization. 
Sharp containers contain ing all used prefilled pens will be broug ht back to the site by the patient 
for the purpose of destruction, as applicable. 
If the site is not able to destroy or destruction is not allowed in the country, all treatments kits will 
be retrieved by the Sponsor. A detailed treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Investigator or designee and countersigned by the Investigator and the Monitoring Team. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP(s) during the study, until Week 32. This medication is not provided by the Sponsor. 
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. However, if these are 
considered necessary for the patient’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IMP, they may be given at the discretion of the Investigator, with a stable dose (when possible). Besides the specific information related to concomitant medications provided in this section, any other concomitant medication(s) will be allowed and will ha ve to be recorded in the e-CRF and source

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 51 8.8.1 Management of background statin therapy 
For background statin use, and for LMT used as part of the usual care treatment arm, sites must 
follow the national product label for the safety monitoring and management of patients. 
Patients will be on stable, maximum dose/regimen of statin therapy that is tolera ted by the patient 
without other LMT during the study as indicated in Section  7.  
Lipid profile values will be blinded from samples obtained after randomization. Nevertheless, for 
safety reasons, sites will be ma de aware of TG alerts ( Section  9). 
From the screening visit (Week -3) until the Week 24 visit, the background statin therapy should 
not be changed. No dose adjustment, discontinuation or initiation of other statins or other LMT 
(except as initiated as part of the usual care arm) should take place during this time, barring 
exceptional circumstances whereby overriding co ncerns (including but not limited to a TG alert 
posted by the central lab) warrant such changes, as per the Investigator’s judgment. For a TG alert that has been confirmed by repeat testing, the Investigator should perform investigations, manage the patient, and modify the LMT as per his/her medical judgment.  Please note that the only fibrate that is allowe d is fenofibrate. 
8.8.2 Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive method throughout the 
entire duration of the study treatment and for at least 10 weeks after the last injection of alirocumab/last usual care treatment. The applied methods of contraception have to meet the criteria for a highly effective method of birth control according to the “International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. M3(R2): Guidance on nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals. ICH. 2009 Jun: 1-25.*”  
*Note: Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, 
that result in a low failure rate (i e, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.   
Please refer to Appendix C . 
8.8.3 Prohibited concomitant medications 
The following therapies are not allowed during the  study (including the screening period until the 
end of treatment visit): 
x Red yeast rice products 
x Other PCSK9 inhibitors 
x Bile acid sequestrants 
x Fibrates other than fenofibrate 
x Over the counter products/nutraceuticals known to impact lipids (eg, plant stanols such as 
found in Benecol, flax seed oil, and psyllium) except for omega-3 fatty acids which may be used as part of the usual care arm.

Lipid parameters 
Blood sampling to determine lipid parameters (ie, Total-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, TGs, non-HDL-C, 
Apo B, Apo A-1, ratio Apo B/Apo A-1, Apo C-III, lipid subfractions by NMR spectroscopy (ie, LDL particle size and LDL, VLDL, HDL, IDL particle number), and Lp [a]) should be performed in the morning, in fasting condition (at least 10 to 12 hours fast and refrain from smoking). Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and intense physical exercise within 24 hours preceding the 
blood sampling are discouraged. 
Total-C, HDL-C, TGs, Apo B, Apo A-1, Apo C-III and Lp(a) will be directly measured by the 
Central Laboratory as per the schedule in Section  10. LDL-C will be directly measured via beta 
quantification method by the Central Laboratory as per the schedule in Section  1.2. LDL-C will 
be calculated using the Friedewald formula at all visits (except Weeks 4 and 32) ( 39). If TG 
values exceed 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L) then the central lab will reflexively measure (via the beta quantification method) the LDL-C rather than calculating it. Non-HDL-C will be calculated by subtracting HDL-C from the  Total-C.  Ratio Apo B/Apo A-1 will be calculated. Triglyceride rich 
lipoprotein will be calculated by total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol minus LDL cholesterol (40). Detailed procedures of sample preparation, storage and shipment will be described in the 
specific laboratory manual which will be provided to sites.  
All patients will qualify for randomization based on the non-HDL-C value obtained at Week -3 
visit. If the patient is not fasting at this or any other visit requiring fasting, then he/she will be 
asked to come the day after or as close as possible to this date for the blood sampling.  
Communication of lipid results by central lab 
The lipid results from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit will not be 
communicated to the Investigators. However, sites will be notified in the ev ent of a TG level 
500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) obtained any time after randomization (ie, TG alert). Repeat testing 
should be done as soon as possible after a TG alert. For a confirmed TG alert, please refer to 
relevant information in Section  8.8.1 . 
Efficacy endpoints will not be considered as AEs, such as those involving abnormalities in lipid 
levels, unless meetin g the criteria in Section  10.4.2 .

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 54 9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT 
9.1.1 Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the percent change in non-HDL-C from baseline to Week 24 in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population, using all non-HDL-C values regardless of adherence to treatment 
(ITT estimand).   
The percent change is defined as: 100 x (non-HDL-C value at Week 24 – non-HDL-C value at baseline) / non-HDL-C value at 
baseline. 
The baseline non-HDL-C value will be the last non-HDL-C level obtained before randomization 
for all patients. The non-HDL-C at Week 24 will be the non-HDL-C level obtained within the Week 24 analysis window.  
All non-HDL-C values (scheduled or unscheduled, fasting or not fasting) between Weeks 8 to 24 
may be used to provide a value for the primary endpoint, if appropriate, according to above definition.  
The analysis window used to allocate a time point to a measurement will be defined in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
9.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
9.2.1 Key secondary efficacy endpoints (ITT estimand) 
x Percent change in measured LDL-C from baseline to Week 24. 
x Percent change in non-HDL-C from baseline to Week 12. 
x Percent change in measured LDL-C from baseline to Week 12. 
x Percent change in Apo B from baseline to Week 24.

9.2.3 Safety endpoints 
Safety parameters (AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs) will be assessed throughout the study. 
The observation of safety  data will be as follows: 
x Pre-treatment period is defined from the signed informed consent up to the first dose of 
open-label alirocumab injection/first dose of usual care treatment for those prescribed another LMT if allocated to the usual care arm . For those allocated to the usual care arm 
for whom another LMT is not prescribed, the p re-treatment period will end on Day 1 at the 
time of randomization. 
x Treatment Emergent Adverse Even t period is defined as the time from the first dose of 
open-label aliroc umab injection to the last dose of open-label treatment + 70 days 
(10 weeks) as residual effect of treatment could be expected until 10 weeks after the stop 
of alirocumab. For patient s randomized to usual care, this will be considered as 70 days 
after the last usual care treatment (IMP) has been administered, or Study Day 225, whichever comes first.  For patients who are randomized to usual care and the Investigator has not prescribed an additional LMT, the “date of last dose of usual care” is defined as the date of the last on-site visit.  
x Post-treatment period is de fined as the time starting the day after the end of the TEAE 
period up to resolution/stabilization of all SAE and AESI, whichever comes last. 
9.2.3.1 Adverse events 
Refer to Section  10.4 to Section  10.6 for details. 
All AEs diagnosed by the Investigator will be reported and described.  
All AEs will be coded to a “Lowest Level Term (LLT)”, “Preferred Term (PT)”, “High Level 
term (HLT)”, “High Level Group Term (HLGT)” and associated primary “System Organ Class 
(SOC)” using the version of MedDRA (Medical Di ctionary for Regulatory Activities) currently in 
effect at Sanofi at the time of the considered database lock. 
Adverse events/AESIs, SAEs, and product complaints will be collected from the time the patient 
signs the ICF to the last scheduled study visit.  
Definitions for AEs, SAEs, and AESI, as well as obligation for reporting are further defined in 
Section  10.4.1  and Section  10.5.

SAR236553-LPS14354 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 69 10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of suspected AEs. Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and 
or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered a ccording to his/her best 
medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and 
Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be recorded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the CRF.  
Temporary treatment discontinuation is defined as one or more scheduled injections (for patients 
randomized to alirocumab) or one or more missed doses of IMP (if randomized to usual care) that are not administered to the patient as decided by the Investigator. 
This section is not applicable for patients who are randomized to usual care for whom no 
additional LMT is added. 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the pa tient not to re-expose the  patient to the IMP at 
any time. Patient withdrawal from the study treatment or study should be avoided as much as possible. 
This section is not applicable for patients who are randomized to usual care for whom no 
additional LMT is added. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from trea tment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the CRF or 
e-CRF.  
Patients should discontinue IMP for the following reasons:

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 70 x Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longer with effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females only). 
x Acute injection reaction of clinical concern (if randomized to alirocumab). 
x Serious adverse event (or non-serious but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reaction 
considered rela ted to IMP. 
x At patient request, ie, withdrawal of the consent for treatment. 
x If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation with the administration of the IMP would be 
detrimental to the pa tient's well-being. 
x Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of the IMP (eg, laboratory 
abnormalities, please refer to decision tree in Appendix E ). 
x At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
x Patient receives open-label treatment prior to randomization 
Any abnormal laboratory value will be immediately rechecked for confirmation (within 24 hours 
if possible), before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.   
This section is not applicable for patients who are randomized to usual care for whom no 
additional LMT is added. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up accord ing to the study procedures as  specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last. This means that patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment (regardless of the reason) should still continue the study and undergo all visits and procedures as described in Section  1.2 with the exception of study 
treatment administration and its associated procedures. If possible, and after the permanent 
discontinuation of treatment, the pa tients will be assessed using the procedure normally planned 
for the end of open-label treatment visit (this should take place within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible) and then resume the original study schedule until end of study. 
If after treatment discontinuation, the patient refuses to resume the original study schedule until 
the end of the study, then if possible, the patient should undergo an unscheduled visit with 
assessments normally planned at the end of open-label treatment visit (it should take place within 
5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible). The patient, at a minimum, should then be followed-up for at least 10 weeks from the la st administration of IMP or  until recovery or 
stabilization of any AE as specified in this protocol, whic hever comes last. A final end of study 
phone visit will take place 10 weeks after the premature discontinuation. 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation should be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the CRF when considered as confirmed. IVRS/IWRS should be notified when a patient prematurely discontinues study treatment. In the medical record, at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented.

10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact follow-up, eg, medical records check. Patients requesting withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow-up may jeopardize the public health value of the study. If possible, the patients should be assessed using the procedures defined above. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicited should be documented. Preferably the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s failure to  withdraw consent in writing .  
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end of 
open-label treatment visit. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unless the patient withdraws the consent for follow-up, 
the Investigator should make the best effort to recontact the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physic ian, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to 
determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact such 
patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
The SAP will specify how the primary endpoints of patients who are lost to follow-up will be 
considered. 
Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.  
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 72 10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death, or 
x Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of d eath at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
 hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event 
 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
 reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not  be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the  patient or may require medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective  treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medi cally important events is intende d to serve as a guideline 
for determining which condition has to be considered as a medically important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive: 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
x Development of drug dependence or drug abuse 
x ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN 
x Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality 
x Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling) 
x Bullous cutaneous eruptions 
x Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study  
x Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study 
x Suspected transmission of an infectious agent: if any suspected transmission of an 
infectious agent via a medicinal product (eg, product contamination)

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 73 10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required.  Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or removed during a study by protocol amendment. Please refer to protocol Section  10.4.4 . 
For this study, the AESI are:  
x Increase in ALT.  
- ALT 3 x ULN (if baseline ALT <ULN) or ALT 2 times the baseline value (if 
baseline ALT ULN) (See  Appendix E ). 
x Pregnancy: 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient or the partner of a male patient (if permitted 
by the female partner and by local regu latory authorities) during the study or within 
70 days following the last dose of study drug (open-label alirocumab) or 70 days following the last dose of usual care treatment (IMP) (as applicable) or Day 225, whichever comes first. If the patient is randomized to usual care and the Investigator 
has not prescribed an additional LMT, the “date of the last dose of study drug” is defined as the date of the last on-site study visit. 
- Pregnancy will be recorded as AESI in a ll cases. Pregnancy will be qualified as an 
SAE only if it fulfils one or more SAE criteria.   
- In the event of pregnancy of a female patient included in the study, study product 
should be discontinued.   
- The follow-up of the preg nancy will be mandatory until the outcome has been 
determined.   
x Symptomatic overdose with alirocumab: 
- An overdose (accidental or  intentional) is an event suspected by the Investigator or 
spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systematic injection counts) and defined as at least twice of the intended dose within the intended thera peutic interval 
(ie, 2 or more injections are administered in <7 calendar days), to be reported using the 
Term “symptomatic OVERDOSE”  (accidental or inte ntional), indicating the 
circumstance in parentheses (eg, “symptomatic overdose [accidental]” or “symptomatic overdose [intentional]”). The patient should be monitored and appropriate symptoma tic treatment instituted. 
- The circumstances of the overdose should be clearly specified in the verbatim and 
symptoms entered on separate AE/SAE forms.  
- Of note, asymptomatic overdose should be reported as a standard AE.  
x Other project specific AESI(s) 
x Allergic events (including local injection site reactions that are allergic in nature):

the Investigator (or have an allergic component), that require consultation with another physician for further evaluation of hypers ensitivity/allergy as per the Investigator’s 
medical judgment should be reported as an AESI. 
Note:  Other local injection site reactions are non-AESIs.  Please see Section  10.4.1.4  
for details. 
x Neurologic events: 
- Neurologic events that require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a 
specialist should be reported as an AESI. If the event does not require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a specialist, it should be reported as a standard adverse event. 
x Neurocognitive events 
- All neurocognitive events will be considered as AESI 
Note: The definition of AEs and AESIs, the reporting time frame, and the corresponding

10.4.1.4 Local injection site reactions 
Local injection site reactions that are considered non-allergic (eg, local injection site reactions 
related to mechanics of injection) or  allergic but not requiring consultation with another physician 
are not considered as AESIs but should be reported as standard AEs. 
Local injection site reactions that are consid ered by the Investigator as non-allergic events and 
that are related to the alirocumab injection, as opposed to another injectable agent, should be further characterized by evaluating the re lated symptoms that compris e an injection site reaction 
such as but not limited to redness, pain, etc.  
Under certain circumstances, no AE of local injection site reactions should be reported as this is 
not typically considered a clinically important finding: 
x The patient has erythema/redness, and/or swelling, and all <2.5 cm, AND 
x The swelling does not inte rferes with activity, AND 
x No other signs or symptoms are involved. 
Note: if the patient has a reaction of swelling with a diameter <2.5 cm that interferes with activity, 
it should be considered as a clinically relevant finding and should be reported as an AE with a 
corresponding intensity of moderate or severe, in accordance with Appendix G . 
The definition of local injection site reactions, the reporting time frame, and the corresponding 
complementary forms in the e-CRF to be filled are summarized in Appendix D .

x All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the CRF. 
x All product complaints associated or not to an AE are to be recorded immediately on the 
corresponding products (study medical device) complaints pages and reported to the local 
Complaint Service immediately (within 24 hours). 
x Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, corrective treatment/the rapy given, additional investig ations performed, outcome, 
and his/her opinion as to whether there is a rea sonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).  
x The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory re sults have returned to  normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in orde r to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that 
observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
x When treatment is prematurel y discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient. 
x Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:

10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or any de signees must immediately: 
x ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically se nd a notification to the monitoring team after 
approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay.  
x SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were performed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email address appear on the clinical trial protocol. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical tr ial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document 
provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. If for any reason, results of lipid values are indicated on any source documents (done for the safety of a patient in exceptional circumstances only), all such information should be redacted. 
x All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as a dditional information (for  laboratory data, concomitant 
medications, patient status, etc) should be sent (by fax or e-mail) to the monitoring team within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to further document any SAE that is fatal or lif e threatening within a week (7 days) of the 
initial notification. 
x A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the 
e-CRF system does not work 
In case of e-CRF back-up: 
x SEND (within 24 hours, preferably by fax or e-mail) the signed and dated corresponding 
page(s) from the CRF to the representative of the monitor ing team whose name, fax 
number and e-mail address appear in the clinical trial protocol. 
x ATTACH a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these 
examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any 
copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges.

Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time af ter the end of the study for the 
patient and considered by him/he r to be caused by aliroc umab with a reasonable possibility, 
should be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest   
For each defined AESI the Investigator must make  every attempt to collect additional specific 
information such as: 
x Preexisting related condition or lif estyle of interest for the  AE (eg, habits, CV risk factor). 
x Expected list of associated signs and symptoms. 
x Corrective actions (eg, treatment discontinuation, concomitant treatment). 
x Diagnostic actions (eg, test(s) or procedure(s) results). 
x Additional descriptive factors. 
x Sequelae. 
For these AEs, the Sponsor must be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAEs 
notification described in Section  10.4.3 , even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding screens in the e-CRF.  Please refer to Section  10.4.1.3  for a listing of AESI and 
Appendix D or a summary of reporting AEs. 
10.4.5 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be monitored, documented, and managed 
according to the related flow chart in  Appendix E . Reporting instructions are provided in  
Appendix D . 
x Neutropenia 
x Thrombocytopenia 
x Increase in ALT 
x Acute renal insufficiency 
x Increase in CPK (other than cardiac-related) and suspicion of rhabdomyolysis 
Investigators are strongly encouraged to follow these algorithms in  Appendix E , especially in 
situations where the abnorm ality persists or when there is no clear explanation for the observed 
abnormality. However there may be situations where these algorithms are not entirely applicable; therefore, the Investigator may use his/her best judgment. Also, in some situations, the Sponsor may wish to discuss with the Investigator. Examples where these algorithms may not be applicable include, but are not limited to, the following situations:

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 78 x Patients with known stable, low or borderline neutrophil count at baseline 
x Patients with known stable, low or borderline platelet count at baseline 
x Patients with impaired renal function at baseline  
The Investigator should attempt to have a diagnosis for the observed finding and should use 
his/her best judgment as whether to or not enroll such patients, and if the patient is enrolled, how 
to best monitor these baseline abnormalities throughout the study.  
Additional examples where these al gorithms may not be applicable  include, but are not limited to, 
the following situations: 
x Patients with ALT increase for which the abnormality resolves following statin dose 
reduction or statin discontinuation 
x Patients with elevated creatinine kinase for which the abnormality resolves following 
statin dose reduction or statin discontinuation 
x Patients with elevated creatinine kinase caused by an MI 
In addition, discontinuation caused by a laboratory abnormality can be either permanent or 
temporary, depending on the particular case. There is no requirement for permanent treatment 
discontinuation in every case of the general guidance for the follow-up of selected laboratory abnormalities mentioned in  Appendix E . 
10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
x All SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to alirocumab (SUSAR), 
to the regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate and to the Investigators.    
x All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to alirocumab to the regulatory 
authorities, according to local regulations. 
The AESIs listed in Section  10.4.1.3  will be reported to those regu latory authorities who require 
such reporting.  
In this study, some AEs are considered related to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected as indicated in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report.

10.6.1 Local tolerability (local injection site reactions that are non-allergic or allergic and 
not requiring consultation) 
The classification of local injection site reactions, the reporting time frame, and the corresponding 
complementary forms in the e-CRF to be filled are summarized in  Appendix D . 
In case the Investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability, then this should 
be treated and followed-up as per the Investigator’s medical judgment.  
Specific e-CRF screens are to be filled in. The local symptoms should be reported in the “local 
injection site reaction” se ction of the complementary form. If  the injection site reaction were to 
progress/expand/worsen/etc, both “local injection site reaction” and “general allergic reaction” of 
the complementary form should be completed. Information on classifying the reaction are given in Section  10.4.1.4  and on reporting these reactions is given in  Appendix G . 
10.6.2 Allergic adverse events requiring consultation and local injection site reactions that 
are allergic and requiring consultation 
Specific e-CRF screens are to be filled in to assess allergic reactions or allergic-like reactions 
requiring consultation with another physician that may occur during the clinical studies conducted with alirocumab. 
Sometimes transient injection site reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, requiring no 
intervention and being of dubious significance. These reactions would not be considered to be allergic reactions. 
Adverse events that may constitute an  allergic reaction (eg, ge neralized itch, nasa l itch, swelling 
at injection site, flushing, hives, swelling at lips, ey es, face, tongue, hands, feet, lump in throat, 
difficulty to swallow, hoarseness, change in pitch of voice, incapacity to speak, wheezing, chest tightness, stridor, etc) should be considered to be reported on the General Allergic Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Compleme ntary Form if meeting the criteria for an AESI. 
Adverse events that are obviously not of allergic origin (eg , local injection site reactions related to 
mechanics of injection) should only be recorded on the Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form. However, injection site reactions that progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated as recommended in Appendix G
 and the General Allergic Reaction Complementary 
form should be completed. 
The IMP should be immediately interrupted (temporarily discontinued) if there is a suspicion of 
an allergic event related to IMP. See Section  10.3.1  for further information on treatment 
interruption and Section  10.3.2  for criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation. 
The Investigator should exercise medical judgment concerning the handling of all 
background/concomitant medications potentially related to an allergic event.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 80 10.6.2.1 Allergic adverse event with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic origin or injection 
site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated by a dermatologist as soon as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event. 
The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs. An unscheduled assessment for hematology, chemistry, liver 
panel should be obtained. An additional blood sample will have to be drawn for pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-alirocumab antibody analyses (a dequate instructions will be provided to the site by 
the Monitor). If it is possible, the site will take pictures of the skin lesions in order to provide the 
patient with them for the dermatologist’s visit. If the photos are obtained, then copies should be 
kept as source documents which may later be collected by the sponsor. The Investigator will provide a summary of the patient's case, reason for consultation, and information being requested to the consulting dermatologist. 
A full consultation report should be sent by the dermatologist to the Investigator. The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following information; a detailed description of the rash (such as the morphology [lesion type], shape of individual lesions, arrangement of multiple lesions [eg, scattered, grouped, linear], distribution, color, consistency, presence of pruritus or pain, and other clinical signs) and in case a skin biopsy (including histopathology and immunofluorescence) was done (if it was deemed necessary as per the dermatologist’s or Investigator’s medical 
judgment), the results of this investigation with, if applicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE. The 
Investigator will fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring Team Representative within 24 hours. 
10.6.2.2 Acute allergic injection reactions 
Acute allergic injection reaction (which are considered under the category of general allergic 
reactions) is defined as any AE that occurs during or shortly after injection of alirocumab 
(characterized by but not limited to hypotension, bronchoconstriction, urticaria, edema, angioedema, nausea, vomiting). Emergency equipme nt and medication for the  treatment of these 
potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamine s, bronchodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, 
acetaminophen, and epinephrine) must be available for immediate use for the injections at the training, and inclusion visits. 
Patients will be observed at the  investigational site for at lea st 30 minutes following the injection 
that takes place at the inclusion visit. Patients should be treated symptomatically if any AEs are 
observed. Patients are to remain at the site until any acute injection reaction is assessed as stable, per the Investigator’s discretion. General Allergic Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction 
Complementary Form will have to be completed. 
10.7 ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 
All events will be managed and reported in compliance with a ll applicable regulations, and 
included in the final clinical study report.

11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patient who met the  inclusion criteria and signed the 
informed consent.  
Randomized patients consist of all screened patients who are recorded in the IVRS/IWRS 
database (if randomized to usual care) and with a tr eatment kit allocated (if randomized to 
alirocumab), regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or not. Patients treated without being randomized or treated with a treatment kit before the randomization will not be considered as randomized and will not be included in any analysis population. The safety experience of patients treated and not randomized will be reported separately and these  patients will not be in 
the safety population. 
For any patient randomized more than once, only the data associated with the first randomization 
will be used in any analysis population. The safety experience associated with any later randomization will be asse ssed separately. 
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the ITT population as defined below.

SAR236553-LPS14354 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 82 11.3.1.1 Intent–to-treat population 
The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients who have an evaluable primary efficacy 
endpoint.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is evaluable when the two following conditions are met: 
x The baseline non-HDL-C value is available 
x At least one non-HDL-C value is available within one of the analysis windows up to 
Week 24. 
Patients in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by 
randomization. 
11.3.2 Safety population 
The safety population considered for safety analyses will be the randomized population who received at least one dose or part of a dose of the open-label alirocumab and all patients randomized to usual care. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received (usual care or alirocumab). 
The safety analysis will focus on the TEAE period de fined as the time from the first open-label 
dose to the last open-label dose of alirocumab + 70 days (10 weeks) (if randomized to alirocumab) or, if randomized to usual care, 70 days after the last usual care treatment (IMP) has been administered or Study Day 225, whichever comes first. 
If the patient is randomized to usual care and the Investigator has not prescribed an additional 
LMT, the date of the “last dose of study drug” is defined as the date of the last on-site study visit. 
In addition:  
x Nonrandomized but treated patients will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be pr esented separately.  
x Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety population as randomized. 
x For patients receiving more than 1 study treatment during the trial, the treatment group 
allocation for as-treated analysis will be the  one to which the patie nt was treated with the 
longest duration  
11.3.3 Other analysis population 
The anti-alirocumab antibody analysis will be performed on all treated patients (safety population) 
with a blood sample at Week 0 (baseline) and at least one evaluable blood sample for antibodies 
post-open-label trea tment administration/post-ba seline (for those ra ndomized to usual care).

11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and co mpliance will be assess ed and summarized by 
actual treatment received within the safety population. 
In order to ensure the continuity of the investigational treatment for the patients without 
interruption (only in case a disruption occurs in the availability of device components or during production of the prefilled pen), back-up plans may be implemented as described in Section  8.1. 
In that case, exposure to initial device and bac k-up device will be summa rized and impact on 
study results will be assessed. Mor e details will be provided in the SAP, if applicable. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
Alirocumab arm  
The total exposure will be assessed by: 
Duration of alirocumab exposure in weeks is defined as:  (last dose of open-label treatment 
date - first dose of open-labe l treatment date + 14 days)/7, re gardless of un planned intermittent 
discontinuations.  
The total number of injections by patient. 
The number (n) and percentage (%) of patients with an up-titration in the alirocumab group will 
be described. 
Usual care arm (except when no LMT other than statin is prescribed)  
The total duration of exposure in weeks is defined as:  (last dose of open-label treatment 
date - first dose of open-label treatment date + 1 day)/7, regardless of unplanned intermittent discontinuations.  
11.4.1.2 Compliance  
A given administration will be considered noncompliant if the patient did not take the planned dose of treatment as requir ed by the protocol. No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 84 Compliance will be assessed using  the following parameters: 
x For alirocumab:  
- the injection frequency will be defined for ea ch patient as the average number of days 
between 2 injections, that is: (last dose  date – first dose date)/(number of injections -1). 
- The compliance is defined by the actual number of injections/number of planned 
injections 
x For IMPs in usual care: 
- the compliance is defined by the number of days with all intakes as planned / duration 
of exposure x 100. The number of patients with a compliance 80% will also be 
assessed. 
These parameters will be summarized descriptive ly (N, Mean, SD, Median, Min and Max). 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
All the efficacy endpoints (primary, key secondary and other efficacy endpoints) will be analyzed 
in all patients (ITT population) for the overall comparison (alirocumab versus usual care) and for patients intended to receive fenofibrate in order to compare the efficacy of alirocumab versus 
fenofibrate.  Further de tails will be provided in the SAP. 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary endpoint 
The percent change in non-HDL-C from baseline to Week 24 as defined in Section  9.1 will be 
analyzed in the ITT population using a Mixed-effect Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach. All post-baseline data available within Week 8 to Week 24 analysis windows will be used and missing data are accounted for by the MMRM model.  
The model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group (usual care versus 
alirocumab), the randomization stratum (as per IVRS), time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 20 and Week 24), treatment-by-time point interaction, stratum-by-time interaction, as well as the 
continuous fixed covariates of baseline non-HDL-C value and baseline value-by-time point 
interaction. Model assumptions for normality will be explored prior to the analysis testing. 
This model will be run using SAS Mixed procedur e with an unstructured co rrelation matrix to 
model the within-patient errors. Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Satterthwaite’s approximation. This model will provide baseline adjusted LS means estimates at Week 24 for both treatment groups with their corresponding standard errors (SEs) and 97.5% confidence intervals (CIs). To compare the alirocumab group to the usual care group, an appropriate contra st statement will be used to test the differences of the se estimates, at  the 2-sided 
0.025 level.  
Let μ0 and μ1 be the population means of the percent change from baseline in non-HDL-C at 
Week 24 under usual care and alirocumab, respectively. The null hypothesis that will be tested is:

versus 
H1 : μ0  μ1 
Robustness of this statistical method will be assessed via sensitivity analyses detailed in the SAP, 
including different methodologies. In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be performed on the main analysis excluding non-HDL-C values assessed after the first treatment change compared to the randomized treatment (d iscontinuation or start of a new drug). 
The same methodology will be applied to compare alirocumab versus fenofibrate in the “intent to 
prescribe fenofibrate” stratum. 
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
Method for controlling the overall type-I error rate when testing the key secondary efficacy endpoints is described in Section  11.4.2.3 .  
For key secondary efficacy endpoints (defined in Section  9.2.1 ) and other efficacy endpoints 
(described in Section  9.2.6 ), descriptive summaries and analys es will be performed in the ITT 
population.  
For descriptive summaries, percent change from baseline in non-HDL-C, total-C, HDL-C, TGs, 
and LDL-C will be provided at each time point for each treatment group. All measurements, scheduled or unscheduled will be assigned to analysis windows defined in the SAP in order to 
provide an assessment for the se time points. Laboratory assessme nts other than the  ones provided 
by the central laboratory will be excluded. The time profile of each parameter will be plotted by treatment group with the corresponding SEs.  
Similar tables (with either pe rcent change from baseline or ab solute change from baseline for the 
ratio) and plots will be provided for other efficacy endpoints: Apo B, Apo A-1, ratio Apo B/Apo A-1, Apo C-III, Lp(a), TGRLs, lipid subfractions by NMR spectroscopy (ie, LDL particle size, and LDL, VLDL, HDL, IDL particle number). For TGs and Lp(a), summa ry statistics will include 
Q1 and Q3, and medians (instead of  means) by time point will be plotted.  
Multiple types of measurements are planned to be analyzed during differing time points in the 
trial, specifically continuous measurements expected to have a normal distribution (eg, percent 
change in non-HDL-C), continuous measurements expected to have a non-normal distribution (eg, 
TGs), and binary measurements (eg, proportion of patients reaching non-HDL-C <100 mg/dL). 
Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution 
Continuous secondary variables defined in Section  9.2 anticipated to have a normal distribution 
(eg, lipids other than TGs and Lp[a ]) will be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the 
primary endpoint. Specifically, the model will contain fixed categorical effects of treatment group, planned time points to Week 24 and treatment-by-time point interaction, as well as, the

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 86 continuous fixed covariates of corresponding baseline value and baseline value-by-time point 
interaction. 
Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a non-normal distribution 
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Section  9.2, anticipated to have a non-normal 
distribution (eg, TGs and Lp[a]), will be analyzed using a robust regression model (ie, 
ROBUSTREG SAS procedure with M-estimation option) with treatment group as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate. Missing values will be addressed using a multiple imputation approach, which will be  described in the SAP. The variables in the multiple imputation 
model will at least include the same variables as used in the robust regression model. The treatment group combined means will be provided with respective SE estimates. The combined mean difference between the treatment groups will be provided with the SE, 97.5% CI and p-value. 
Binary endpoints 
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Section  9.2.1  will be analyzed using logistic 
regression with treatment group as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate. 
Missing values will be addr essed using a multiple imputa tion approach which will be described in 
the SAP. The variables in the multiple  imputation model will at least incl ude the same variables as 
used in the logistic regression model. Treatment effects will be compared and the combined odds ratio estimate between the treatment groups, with their corresponding 97.5% CIs and p-value will be provided.  
In the data dependent case that the logistic regression method is not applicable (eg, the response 
rate is zero in 1 treatment arm and thus the maximum likelihood estimate may not exist), the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach would be used for handling of missing values and an exact conditional logistic regression would be performed to compare treatment effects. The 
LOCF imputation method will consist of using the last value obtained up to the Week 24 analysis 
window (or Week 12 as applicable) to impute the missing Week 24 value (or Week 12 respectively). 
The same methodology will be applied to compare alirocumab versus fenofibrate in the “intent to 
prescribe fenofibrate” stratum. 
11.4.2.3 Multiplicity considerations 
The following strategy will be applied in both analyses (alir ocumab versus usual care and 
alirocumab versus fenofibrate) in order to keep an overall alpha type I error rate at 0.05: 
In order to handle multiple key secondary efficacy endpoints, the type-I error (0.025 for each 
analysis) will be controlled by the use of a seque ntial inferential approac h. Statistical significance 
of the primary parameter at the 0.025 alpha level is required before drawing inferential conclusions about first key secondary parameter (refer to order of list in Section  9.2.1 ).

SAR236553-LPS14354 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 87 Inferential conclusions about successive key secondary parameters require statistical significance 
of the prior one. This fixed hierarchical approach  will ensure a strong control of the overall type-I 
error rate at the 0.025 level for each analysis (alirocumab versus usual care and alirocumab versus fenofibrate).  
No further adjustments will be made for other efficacy endpoints for which p-values will be 
provided for descriptive purpose only. The comparison of alirocumab versus the other options of the usual care will be performed via exploratory subgroup analyses. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
The summary of safety results will be presented by treatment group. No formal inferential testing 
will be performed. Summaries will be descriptive in nature. 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population using the following common rules: The baseline value is defi ned generally as the la st available value before  the first injection of 
open-label alirocumab/first dose of usual care treatment or before randomization for patient’s randomized to usual care and not receiving additional LMT.   
The following definitions will be applied to la boratory parameters and vital signs. 
The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal values 
considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined criteria/thresholds based on literature review and defined by the Sponsor for clinical laboratory tests and vital signs. 
Potentially clinically significant abnormality criteria will determine which patients had at least 
1 PCSA during the on-treatment period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the 
on-treatment period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage. 
The following definitions will be applied to AEs: 
x Pre-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
PRE-TREATMENT period  
x Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious 
during the TEAE period  
x Post-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
POST-TREATMENT period 
Liver function tests 
The liver function tests, namely ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin, are us ed to assess possible 
drug induced liver toxicity. The proportion of patients with PCSA values at any post-baseline visit by baseline status will be displayed by treatment group for each parameter.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 88 A graph of distribution of peak values of ALT versus peak value s of total bilirubin will also be 
presented. Note that the ALT a nd total bilirubin values are presente d on a logarithmic scale. The 
graph will be divided into 4 quadrants with a vertical line corresponding to 3 x ULN for ALT and a horizontal line corresponding to 2 x ULN for total bilirubin. 
The incidence of liver-related AEs will be summarized by treatment group. The selection of PTs 
will be based on standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) Hepatic disorder. Time to liver-related treatment discontinuation a nd time to liver death may also be provided based on hepatic disorder 
SMQ. 
11.4.3.1 Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by SOC (sorted by internationally agreed order), HLGT, HLT and PT sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the 
same patient will be c ounted only once in the tables within a treatment phase. The denominator 
for computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group. 
Adverse event incidence table will be provided by treatment group for all types of TEAEs: all 
TEAEs, all treatment-emergent AESI (defined with a PT or a prespecified grouping), all treatment-emergent SAEs and all TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
If any clinically significant signal is detected and needs further characterization or for AE of 
clinical interest, exploration of time  to onset will be performed for these selected TEAEs as 
described below to account for the di fferential exposure time  in all patients.  
Selected TEAEs will be also analyzed using  time-to-event approach (Kaplan-Meier 
methodology). Time to the first occurrence of the event will be calculated (only the first event will be counted), with the origin date being the date of the first dose of open-label IMP for patients receiving an additional IMP (alirocumab or usual care) or the date of the randomization for patients not receiving an IMP (statins only). Patients without any event will be censored at the end of the TEAE period. Incidence rates at 6 months will be presented and Kaplan-Meier curves will be provided. 
Death: The following deaths summa ries will be generated: 
x Number (%) of patients who died by study period (TEAE, on-study, post-study) 
summarized on the safety population by treatment received 
x Death in non-randomized patients or randomized and not treated patients   
x TEAE leading to death (death as an outcome on the AE CRF page as reported by the 
Investigator) by primary SOC, HLGT, HLT and PT showing number (%) of patients sorted by internationally agreed order of SOC and alphabetic order of HLGT, HLT, and PT.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 89 11.4.3.2 Laboratory data and vital signs 
The summary statistics (including  mean, median, Q1, Q3, SE, minimum and maximum) of all 
laboratory variables, all vital signs parameters (raw data and changes from baseline) will be calculated for each visit, last and worst value  assessed during the treatment period and presented 
by treatment group. 
For selected parameters, mean changes from baseline with the corresponding standard error will 
be plotted over time (at same time points) in each treatment group. 
The incidence of PCSAs at an y time during the TEAE period (on-treatment PCSAs) will be 
summarized by treatment group whatever the baseline level and/or according to the following 
baseline categories: 
x Normal/missing 
x Abnormal according to PCSA criterion or criteria 
For laboratory parameters for which PCSA criterion is not defined, similar table(s) using the 
normal range could be provided. 
Hepatitis C Test 
The number and percentage of patients with an observed seroconversion for Hepatitis C test will 
be provided by treatment group. Further details will be provided in SAP. 
11.4.4 Analyses of diabetes-related endpoints 
The analyses of diabetes-related endpoints will be performed on the ITT population and will be descriptive only. Summa ry statistics, including the mean, median, Q1, Q3, SE, minimum, and 
maximum of the 4 endpoints (HbA1c, FPG, and number of glucose lowering treatment) will be calculated for each visit and presented by treatment group, as well as the change from baseline.

11.4.6 Analyses of other endpoints 
Analyses of anti-alirocumab antibodies 
Analyses of anti-alirocumab antibodies will be described in the SAP. 
Analyses of pharmacokinetic variables 
Analyses of PCSK9 levels will be described in the SAP. 
11.5 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
No interim analysis is planned.  However, a first-step analysis including the final analysis of the 
primary endpoint may be needed in order to provide results in a timely manner for a scientific communication.  
All the efficacy data will be available for final analysis at a cut-off date corresponding to the 
Week 24 visit of the last patient. Sin ce safety data are being coll ected until the end of the study 
(Week 32), if the analysis with Week 24 data has to be performed, an update of the safety analysis 
will be performed at the end of the study. If analyses are not needed at Week 24, then there will be only a one time analysis at the end of the study.  
The first-step analysis would be conducted as soon as all patients have been randomized and have 
at least all their data up to Week 24 collected and validated, and will consist of a final analysis of 
the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints up to Week 24. The safety analysis will be performed on all safety data collected and va lidated at the time of this first-step analysis.  
The second-step analysis will consist of the updated analysis of safety endpoints until Week 32. 
Even in the case of a two-step analysis, there is no multiplicity issue because all efficacy analyses 
will be completed at the time of the advanced analysis, so that no adjustment would be performed 
on the type I error rate.

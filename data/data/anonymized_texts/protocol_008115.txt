PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title  Evaluation of Endometriosis with 18F -fluoroestradiol PET / 
MRI 
Funder  The University of N orth Carolina  
Clinical Phase  Pilot Study  
Study Rationale  Current techniques to diagnose endometriosis (apart from 
laparoscopy) lack the necessary sensitivity to detect the 
disease.  As endometriosis expresses estrogen receptors, a 
radiotracer that binds to estrogen receptors may be able to detect it in a noninvasive fashion.  
Study Objective(s)  The primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity and 
specificity of  18F-fluoroestradiol ( FES) PET/MR for evaluating 
endometriosis.   Secondary objectives include comparing PET 
to conventional MRI, using histopathology from laparotomy as 
the gold standard and evaluating association of uptake values (SUV -max) with EHP -30 and pain rating scales, controlling for 
covariates.  
  
Investigational Drug  
 This s tudy will be an evaluation of the radiotracer, FES, whi ch 
binds to estrogen receptors and has previously been used to 
study estrogen receptor expression in tumors, to detect endometriosis .   
Study Design  
 This is a prospective, one arm, single center study of 12 
subjects with clinically suspected  endometriosis  to 
demonstrate FES PET -MR’s clinical utility for diagnosis of 
endometriosis .  
Subject Population

 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Introduction 
Endometriosis is a major cause of infertility and pain for many women of childbearing 
age. Estimates of the frequency of endometriosis in infertile women range from 20- 50%, 
with an estimated overall prevalence of 0.8- 6% in the female population.  1   
Imaging is often used for evaluation of endometriosis. Endometriosis is divided by location into ovarian, peritoneal, and deep; ovarian endometriosis is located in the ovary (often known as endometrioma), peritoneal endometriosis is in the perit oneum 
penetrating less than 5 mm, and a deep infiltrating endometriotic (DIE) lesion penetrates into the retroperitoneal space or pelvic organ walls to at least 5 mm, affecting 4- 37% of 
women wit h endometriosis. Transvaginal ultrasound is usually the first -line imaging 
modality used, with MRI as a second line to look for deep implants.
2 In general, these 
are both quite effective, with transvaginal ultrasound being effective for genital DIE and 
MRI for the diagnosis of pelvic genital and extragenital DIE; however, even MRI can 
have difficulty distinguishing between surgical scar and active lesions if the patient has been previously operated, and questions still remain about its efficacy in evaluatin g 
nerves and bowel.
3   
While DIE is often amenable to detection  by conventional methods , more superficial 
lesions, even those with extensive coverage of the pelvic endometrium, are frequently invisible to currently -used imaging techniques.
4 The lack of non- surgical diagnostic or 
even screening test s is one factor leading to the average five to nine -year delay 
between symptom onset and diagnosis.5,6 The ability to detect earlier -stage 
endometriosis could play a key role in preventing unnecessary surgery on the one hand 
and prevent ion of progression on the other .7 The overlap in symptoms between 
endometriosis and other causes of chronic pelvic pain also makes recurrence difficult to assess, leading to potentially preventable repeat surgery.
7 Finally, without non -surgical 
diagnostic techniques, innovations in medical therapy are very difficult to develop. These factors have led to an international consensus that non- invasive diagnostic 
testing is a key research priority for the field.
7  
One potential option for imaging endometriosis  is a radiotracer, 16α -[18F]fluoro -17β-
estradiol or more commonly 18F- fluoroestradiol (FES). This involves an estradiol 
molecule which has been labeled with a radioactive fluorine atom, which binds to estrogen receptors and can be detected by positron emission tomography (PET). The tracer correlates with receptor expression in biopsy material
8,9, and can be administered 
with minimal (<50 micrograms) estrogenic material10 and doses similar to those in other 
nuclear medicine studies.11–13 This tracer has already been demonstrated for use with 
estrogen- receptor positive breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, correlating with 
expression in tumors, response to endocrine therapy, assessment of tumor burden and heterogeneity of disease, and pharmacodynamics.
14 Other applications have included 
differentiating endometrial hyperplasia from endometrial cancer and differentiating

 benign uterine leiomyomas from malignant uterine sarcomas.14 Given t hat 
endometriosis contains estrogen receptors, we hope to use FES to  identify 
endometriosis using non- invasive imaging approaches.   
 
1.2 Existing work with FES  
Current use of FES : A t the present time, FES has only been used to find endometriosis 
in one study of 4 patients with extragenital endometriosis, specifically of the deep 
infiltrating variety. This study showed multiple lesions detectable on FES -PET that were 
not detectable on MRI; of the 9 lesions found by histology, 4 were found by MRI, 8 by FES-PET, and the histology agreed with PET in all cases.
3 There was also a limited 
relationship between SUVmax and chronic pelvic pain.3 Furthermore, this study was 
performed using PET/CT, which increases the radiation exposure to patients relative to PET/MR.   
Our innovation: Pr
 evious work with FES has involved breast cancer or other 
malignancies which express estrogen receptors , such as endometrial cancer. We are 
hoping to build on prior work by Cosma et al.3 which shows that endometriosis, which 
also displays endometrial receptors, can be detected by FES -PET.  
 I n addition, we will utilize PET /MR rather than PET/CT , to allow us to avoid the 
radiat ion dose associated with the CT. This is particularly important in women of 
childbearing age. In addition, the superior soft tissue contrast of MRI vis -à-vis CT can 
help to localize lesions in the pelvis.  Furthermore, we will utilize novel MR imaging 
approaches to potentially enhance the sensitivity of MR -only studies to endometriosis.  
Utilizing PET/MR will also improve the co -registration for the development of MR based 
approaches . If endometriosis could be reliably detected through noninvasive imaging, 
infertility patients who did not display FES uptake, particularly those with prior surgical history who might be difficult to stage using MRI, could avoid the expense and pain of exploratory laparotomy.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
The aim of this study is to demonstrate FES PET/MR’s  clinical utility for d iagnosis of 
endometriosis .

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
3.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, one arm, single center study of 12  subjects with clinically 
suspected endometriosis to demonstrate PET -MR’s  clinical utility for diagnosis of 
endometriosis .  
3.2 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Subjects  
We will include a total o f 12 participants in this trial. These subjects will be followed for 
up to 3 months  after initial imaging with PET -MR.  
3.3 Study Population  
3.3.1  Inclusion Criteria  
• Age 18 or older  
• Female of childbearing age  
• Clinically suspected  (symptomatic)  endometriosis.  
• S cheduled for planned operative laparoscopy with no hormone treatment for at 
least two cycles (Note: if women are amenorrhoeic , 56 days will be used as a 
substitute for 2 cycles. ) 
• Able to provide informed consent  
 
3.3.2  Exclusion Criteria  
• Male  
• Institutionalized subject (prisoner or nursing home patient)  
• Known history of breast,  ovarian or endometrial cancer.  
• Pregnant or breast -feeding women  
• Contraindication to MRI (pacemaker, metallic implants, metallic fragments or 
foreign bodies, body piercings that are unable to be removed, and certain cardiac 
devices)  Subjects will be screened for any contraindications prior to the MRI.   
• Claustrophobia that would prevent subjects from being inside the MRI scanner 
for the duration of the scan.   
 
4. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Patients with suspected (but not confirmed) endometriosis and suspicion of extragenital 
DIE who are scheduled for planned operative laparoscopy with no hormone treatment for at least two cycles will be recruited from the Minimally Invasive Gynecological Surgery  C linic (Director, E. Carey, Co -I) at UNC. I f women are amenorrhoeic , 56 days 
will be used as a substitute for 2 cycles. The Endometriosis  Health Profile -30 (EHP -30), 
a quality of life questionnaire used in women with endometriosis, a pain numeric rating scale, and information about the last menstrual  period will be obtained. Patients will 
undergo FES PET/MR within 4 weeks  prior to  surgery. Prior to surgery, suspected 
areas of endometriosis will be identified on imaging. Th ese imaging findings will then be

 compared to surgical findings and histopathology from exploratory laparotomy.  Surgical 
documentation of endometriosis location will rely on published, consensus  staging 
methods .15,16 Surgeons will not see the results from the  FES-PET/MRI prior to surgery. 
The results of FES -PET MRI will not be used to guide surgery . The surgeons will be 
perform ing exploratory laparoscopy as per standard of care.  
4.1 Screening/Baseline Visit procedures  
A total of 12 participants will be enrolled to this study. The study subjects will be 
consecutively recruited from individuals that  have  clinically suspected endometriosis 
and hav e planned exploratory laparoscopy . Eligible patients will be identified by 
research staff review in coordination with the UNC MIGS group.  
Once a patient has been referred, the patient will be approached by a coordinator from 
Radiology to assess interest in participation.    
All eligible participants who agree to participate in the study will be asked to come to their scheduled appointment thirty minutes early to complete the informed consent process.   
Review of the consent will take place in the privacy of an exam room, or when possible, a sample consent form will be sent to the patient via email prior to the patient’s visit to allow for ample review .   
Patients will complete the EHP -30 and pain scale questionnaire.  In addition, patients 
will be asked the date of their last menstrual period.  These questionnaires may be completed in person, via the phone, or via REDCap, whichever is preferred by the participant.   
4.2 Research Imaging Procedure  
Participants who consent for the study will be escorted by the research coordinator to the dedicated study room for the imaging exam. For our female patient s who are of child 
bearing  age, a pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the 
radiotracer.  
The subject will have the PET -MR scan performed in a similar manner to a conventional 
clinical PET -MR scan s. The imaging agent will be injected approximately one hour prior 
to imaging after dosimetry and radiotracer has been verified per protocol.  The research 
technologist will assist in positioning the patient in the PET -MR unit. Once positioned, 
the total scan time is approximately 1 hour. The length of time for the positioning and examination of a subject’s  pelvis  may vary but it is expected that the entire visit  will take 
about 150 minutes. We will not utilize gadolinium contrast agent for this study.  
We have extensive experience in the synthesis of radiotracers at the UNC Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC), with dedicated radiochemists and radiopharmacists. We thus expect to be able to synthesize the radiotracer without much difficulty, as there is an established IND available for cross -filing on the NCI webs ite 
17, which contains a

 full set of manufacturing and QC documents . A manufacturing IND has already been 
obtained.  
4.3 Follow -Up Phone Call  
Patients will be called 3 to 4 weeks following the FES PET scan to determine the last 
menstrual period following the scan.   
4.4 Medical Record Abstraction  
Participants’ medical record will be reviewed for up to 3 months  following their initial 
research imaging to meet the primary aim . The operative surgeon will be asked to fill 
out a specific post -operative form defining the areas in which they identified visible 
endometriosis within the pelvis.  
4.5 Interpretation  
Upon completion of all study image data collection , a reader study will be performed 
with a fellowship -trained abdominal radiologist and nuclear radiologist  (separate 
individuals) . The abdominal and nuclear reads will be performed separately , without 
discussion between radiologists.  MR informati on will be used for anatomic localization 
of the PET scan, as is commonly performed. Differences between the two will then be 
discussed in the eventual publication. All images will be reconstructed using standard 
algorithm s, and nuclear medicine studies presented on MIM workstations for nuclear 
medicine viewing,  with PACS viewing software with conventional zoom/pan/window and 
level tools. Locations of endometriosis will be recorded with the same classification system as the surgical system. This research  classification will be made by radiologists 
who are blinded to the surgical findings of endometriosis.  
4.6 Variables of Interest  
Primary Variables of Interest:  
• Presence of endometriosis  based on imaging ( true/false ) 
• Localization of endom etriosis ( American Society for Reproductive Medicine 
Revised Classification of Endometriosis 1997 and World Endometriosis 
Foundation System )
15  
• Standardized Uptake values (positive real number)  
• EHP-30 value (integer)  
• Pain rating (integer)  
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION    
5.1 Primary Endpoint  
The sensitivity of FES PET  /MR is defined as the ability of readers (radiologists) to 
detect endometriosis  in patients. Diagnostic accuracy will be defined by the histologic  
presence of endometriosis and by  symptomatic improvement as defined s urgically by 
the referring physician within 3 months of surgery .  
FES PET/MRI Endometriosis   CONFIDENTIAL

August 27, 2020  
Page 13 of 33 
 5.2 Statistical Methods  
Subjects will be recruited until 12 subjects complete the research imaging . For subjects 
that are enrolled and do not complete the research PET/MR, they will be  considered a 
screen fail and replaced.  Two  radiologists , a nuclear radiologist and an abdominal 
radiologist,  will be recruited to conduct the reader study.  Both the r adiologists and 
surgeons will utilize the Revised Endometriosis Classification System.  
Sensitivity and specificity of 18F -fluoroestradiol (FES) PET/MR for evaluating 
endometriosis  will be computed by comparing imaging against surgical findings and 
histopathology  in order to answer Aim 1.  We will compute point estimates, along with 
95% confidence intervals and precision estimates that may be used to plan future 
studies.  
We will address Aim 2 in the following fashion.  After imaging, we will compare the PET 
results against conventional MRI, using histopathology obtained at exploratory 
laparotomy as the gold standard. We will do this in 2 phases, first, at the patient level, 
and then, as an ancillary analysis, at the endometriotic implant site level. For each 
phase, we will report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the PET results, along with 
associated 95% confidence intervals. We will also report sensitivity, specificity, and 
accuracy, along with associated 95% confidence intervals, using conventional MRI. We will use McNemar’s test, constructing the 2x2 table among all patients with a surgical 
diagnosis of positive to compare sensitivity for PET versus conventional MRI. Similarly, we will use McNemar’s test among all patients with a surgical diagnosis of negative to 
compare specificity for PET versus conventional MRI.   P-values <0.05 for the 
comparison of sensitivity and specificity wil l be construed as evidence that 
sensitivity/specificity differ between PET and conventional MRI.  P -values >0.05 will be 
considered inconclusive.    
To evaluate Aim 3, whether uptake values are associated with EHP -30 and pain rating 
scales, we will impleme nt a random effects linear regression model, modeling SUV -max 
as a function of EHP -30 and the pain rating, while controlling for patient -level covariates 
(BMI, race, age). We will include physician as a random effect to account for physician-level correlat ion. P-values <0.05 for the EHP -30 and pain rating parameter estimates 
will be taken as evidence of association with uptake values.  P -values >0.05 will be 
considered inconclusive.    
As a sensitivity analysis for Aim 3 , we will compute Cook’s distance (D)  for all 
observations , remove observations where D >1, and recalculate the above specified 
model, comparing model conclusions to the original analysis .    
Budgetary constraints limit sample size for this study. For Aim 2 and Aim 3, precision of estimators will be low, power levels of tests will be low, and confidence intervals will be 
wide. However, study results are expected to be useful in a grant proposal for a future study.

 5.3 Sample Size Rationale  
With 12 patients, we will have 80% power at alpha=.05 to detect an odds ratio of 21.91 
for comparing sensitivities between PET/MRI versus conventional MRI. The detectable 
OR will be >10000000 for comparing specificities between PET/MRI versus conventional MRI.  
Given our analysis strategy, McNemar’s test, the following information was needed for the power calculation for detecting differences in sensitivity between 2 modalities:   the total number of patients and the anticipated proportion of discordant pairs.   We used 12 for the number of patients due to budget constraints for the pilot study.  The proportion 
of discordant pairs is the percentage of test results that do not agree between PET/MRI 
and conventional MRI.  We estimated this to be 55% based on published studies about MRI and the Cosmal et al. study. From this, we estimated an odds ratio of 21.91. Power calculations are made using GPower, version 3.1.9.2.  
 
5.4 Interim Analysis  
Interim analyses will not be conducted.  
6. ADVERSE EVENTS (DRUGS - CONTRAST AGENTS)  
6.1 Definitions  
6.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not rel ated to the medicinal product.  
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result 
of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should 
not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, 
unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study therapy.  
6.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR ) 
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibil ity that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or

 concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, 
and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:  
Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with drug 
exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon i n the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once 
occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor - 
investigator  could determine that there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
event.   
An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
6.1.3 Unexpected AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if the specificity or severity of it is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.   
6.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of the sponsor - investigator, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization;  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functi ons; 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event .

 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.  
6.2 Documentation of non- serious AEs or SARs 
For non- serious AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of study treatment 
and continue through the 30- day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued.   
Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for that 
patient.  Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug. D ocumentation 
should occur at least monthly.  
6.3 SAEs or Serious SARs  
6.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by 
a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, medication washout.  
For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued.   
6.3.2 Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
6.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
The UNC- IRB will be notified of all SAEs  that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem as 
per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web -based reporting system within 7 days of 
the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
Pregnancy  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study should be recorded as SAEs.  The patient is to be discontinued immediately from the study. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician- gynecologist, preferably 
one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnorm al outcome). If 
the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the 
abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.

 If an investigator deems that an event is both a serious SAR AND unexpected, it must 
also (in addition to REDCap) be recorded on the MedWatch Form 3500A as per 21 CFR 312.32. The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm . 
(Please be sure and access form 3500a, and not form 3500). The Sponsor -investigator  
of the study will make the final determination regarding FDA submission.  
Once the UNC Principal Investigator determines an event is a serious SAR AND unex
pected, the MedWatch 3500A form will be submitted to the FDA.  
 
7. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Principal Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of patient safety in this trial with periodic reporting to an independent Medical Monitor. The medical monitor will review any reported Unanticipated Adverse D rug Effects after patients 5 and 10. 
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include the investigators and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem 
appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to 
study progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with 
the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the 
oversight (Office of Human Res earch Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Scientific 
Review Committee (SRC), the Office of Clinical Trials (OCT), or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
The PI will be responsible for submitting the following information for review by the independent medical monitor: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of study participants imaged; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  Findings of the medical monitor review will be disseminated by memo.  
7.1 Adverse Events Safety Assessments  
A licensed provider will observe subject vitals following the administration of the 
radiotracer on through the completion of the imagining scan. Study personnel will 
contact subjects  1 day (+3 days window)  after to inquire about delayed onset 
complications. The subjects will also be given a phone number that they can call to reach a nurse if they believe they have developed a complication of the procedure.

 It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form, assent form,  and protocol.  
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory  requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study  and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB -approved consent form.  
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.   
For patients under the age of 18, appropriate assent must be obtained in addition to parental permission prior to participation in the study.   
8.2 Registration Procedures  
Study participants will be registered into CRMS , a web based clinical research platform 
by one of the Study Coordinators.  
8.3 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing 
The FES PET -MR scan that is  obtained of all eligible enrolled subjects will be de-
identified for inclusion in the appropriate readers study.  Copies of the clinical report forms as well as the de -identified images described in the preceding will be submitted 
for each case to the Study Coordinators for maintaining the study record and entering data in preparation for the reader study.  
The online REDCap software system provided by UNC’s TraCS Institute will be used to 
collect and store research data.  Information regarding why a data value is missing will 
be documented in the study database.  
Coded copies of subject study images will be received at the time of the scan and will be stored in  the participant file in a locked fi le cabinet . 
8.4 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for a n emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and 
well-being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall be 
conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.

 11. APPENDIX  
Appendix A: FES  
Most of this information is taken directly from the NCI Investigator’s Brochure.  
11.1 Chemical name  
16α-[18F] -fluoro-17β-estradiol (FES)  
 
11.2 Pharmacology and toxicology  
16α-[18F] -fluoro- 17β-estradiol (FES)  is a radiopharmaceutical designed 
for imaging estradiol binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) in vivo . Its molecular 
weight is 290.4 Daltons. FES has chemical properties very similar to estradiol. 
The relative binding affinity (RBA, FES/estradiol) for the estrogen receptor is 0.81. 
The metabolism of FES and estradiol are similar2, 3 with elimination primarily b y 
conjugation in the liver, followed by renal clearance of the glucuronide. 
Measurements of the relative binding affinity for the blood transport protein, sex 
hormone binding globulin (SHBG)4, was 10% relative to estradiol5. An average of 
45% of circulating FES is bound to SHBG, similar to estradiol6. In the sections 
that follow, the pharmacology and toxicity of estradiol in addition to FES is reviewed.  
FES is produced with a specific activity greater than 170 Ci/mmol and the 
injected mass dose is less than or equal to 5 μg (17 nmole). The requirement for 
high specific activity, low mass dose, assures that only a small fraction of the estrogen receptors (ER) are occupied during a PET imaging study. If the receptor approaches saturation, then FES uptake would no longer reflects receptor 
concentration. A 5- μg dose is far below any known toxicity for fluoroestradiol or 
other ER ligands.  
The pharmacology of FES is best understood by analogy to estradiol. 
Estradiol is a naturally occurring steroid that comes from two sources: (1) synthesis in the ovary in pre- menopausal women and (2) conversion from 
adrenal steroids, largely through aromatization (and aromatase enzymes)
7, 8 in a 
variety of tissues, most notably fat, breast tissue, and breast cancers. Pre-menopausal  levels of estradiol vary widely depending upon the phase of the 
menstrual cycle, reaching levels as high as 500 pg/ml  (1.7 nM) mid- cycle. In 
post-menopausal women, and in men, levels are generally less than 30 pg/ml 
(0.1 nM).  
Estradiol is very lipophilic  and is generally present in slightly higher 
concentration in tissues with higher fat content. Circulating estradiol is largely protein bound with high affinity but low capacity to SHBG and with low affinity but high capacity to albumin
6, 9. Much of circulating estradiol is bound to SHBG and 
the remainder is bound to albumin6. FES is an estrogen analog used as a 
diagnostic agent to image regional estradiol binding to ER and is closely related to estradiol
1. Estradiol exerts its physiologic effect by binding  to ER, a nuclear

 receptor. ER is selectively expressed in a variety of tissues, most notably the 
breast, uterus, ovaries, bone, and pituitary.  
Ovarian synthesis of estradiol is a key component of female endocrine 
function in a complex feedback loop with t he pituitary. Estradiol also promotes 
new bone formation and is important in maintaining bone mineral density, especially in women. Estrogens affect the cardiovascular system, largely through 
their beneficial effect on serum lipids. In the breast, estradiol promotes ductal 
epithelial cell proliferation and is a key component stimulating lactation. Estrogens are established growth factors for endometrial and many breast cancers. Approximately 60% of breast cancers express ER, and estradiol and other estrogens provide a key stimulus for tumor growth and an opportunity for endocrine- based therapy. This last effect is the impetus for developing a 
diagnostic agent for imaging ER expression in breast cancer patients that led to our investigation of FES for use in PET diagnostic imaging
10. 
FES metabolism has also been studied in humans. Metabolite analysis of 
blood and urine was performed in patients undergoing [18F]FES PET studies2. 
Results were similar to rat data, showing that FES is rapidly metabolized to polar species, with less than 20% of blood radioactivity in the form of [
18F]FES by 60 
minutes after injection. There is also net clearance of both FES and labeled metabolites from the blood via hepatic uptake, biliary excretion, and urinary  
excretion of polar conjugates. By 120 minutes after injection, circulating FES is less than 5% of peak values, and the total of FES and labeled metabolites is less than 40% of the peak. Clearance rates of intravenous FES and intravenous estradiol are simi lar; for both compounds circulating levels have decreased to 
less than 5% of peak levels by 60 minutes after injection. Analysis of metabolites excreted in the urine sampled 90 – 120 minutes after injection has been done 
using glucuronidases to dissociate the glucuronide conjugates and acid 
hydrolysis to break the sulfate conjugation bond. These experiments recovered 
mostly [
18F]FES, with a small percentage of a more polar substance not identified 
in the studies2. These results suggest that, on the time scale of PET imaging, 
FES is metabolized primarily to non- oxidized conjugated FES.  
In summary, FES biochemistry, ER binding affinity, and metabolism are 
very similar to estradiol, suggesting that data on estradiol biochemistry and pharmacology are applicable to FES. Any differences between results for FES 
and estradiol appear to arise from the fact that only short -term (1 – 2 hours), 
transient kinetics and metabolism of the radiolabeled [
18F]FES are relevant to its 
use in PET. Studies of estradiol physiology suggest that exposures of several 
hours to days are needed to elucidate physiologic effects and thus longer -term, 
equilibrium kinetics and metabolism are most relevant. Because of the 18F half -
life limitation, oxidation plays only a minor role in [18F]FES metabolism and liver 
conjugation is responsible for enterohepatic circulation and prompt excretion in urine over the life of 
18F.

 Biodistribution studies in humans further support the concept that FES 
metabolism is similar to that of estradiol. The liver rapidly takes up FES with 
subsequent excretion into bile2, 11 . From sequential images of the biodistribution 
of FES using PET, it was shown that FES passed into the bile and moved through the small intestine
11. Very little, if any, radioactivity was seen in the large 
intestine, suggesting highly efficient enterohepatic circulation, similar to that of 
estradiol. Similar results were found using 16- α-radioiodo- 17-β-estradiol in a 
swine model 12. 
11.3 Toxicity of FES in humans  
Estradiol is a naturally occurring substance with biochemical and 
pharmacologic properties nearly identical to FES. It is important to interpret 
toxicity data for FES relative to reported toxicity for estradiol in the context of the intended use of FES as a single- dose- administration agent for diagnostic 
imaging. In this setting, FES reaches physiologic levels (i.e., greater than post -
menopausal levels) only on a transient basis. This must be viewed in the context of many years of exposure to physiologic levels of estradiol in most women.  
[
18F]FES could potentially exert toxic effects through one of three mechanisms: 
(1) radiation exposure to tissues from the radioactive label11, (2) physiologic 
actions mediated through the ER, and (3) directly toxic or mutagenic effects of FES metabolites. Radiation exposure from [
18F]FES at activity doses used in 
PET (6 mCi, typical) is low, and is comparable to other nuclear medicine procedures
11. Radiation exposure is discussed in detail in Section 10.4. With 
respect to the other two mechanisms of toxicity, FES injected as a bolus for PET imaging transiently reaches physiologic concentrations, but returns to sub-physiologic levels within an hour after injection. As such, toxic effects due to actions mediated through the ER and directly toxic effects of metabolites will be far less than those of natural ER ligands.  
Given the biochemical and pharmacologic similarity
 between FES and 
estradiol, the low mass administered and short -term exposure to FES resulting 
from PET studies, the estradiol toxicity literature serves as an appropriate gauge for any potential toxicity of FES.  
11.4 Dosimetry  
The uptake of [
18F]FES in normal human tissues has been measured and 
used to estimate the radiation absorbed dose associated with the imaging procedure. Dosimetry studies were performed at the University of Washington and have been peer -reviewed and published in the Journal of Nuclear 
Medicine
11. For more details, the reader is referred to the investigator’s brochure 
at NCI.

11.5 Previous FES human imaging studies  
Early studies established a correlation between FES uptake and in vitro 
assay of ER expression13 and documented the biodistribution and radiation 
dosimetry of FES11. Several studies documented the metabolism, clearance, and 
serum protein binding of FES in humans5, 11. Other studies demonstrated 
heterogeneous uptake of FES in advanced breast cancer as a reflection of 
heterogeneous ER expression14, 15. One paper measured FES uptake in 
meningiomas16 Finally, other studies have measured FES uptake in patients 
treated with hormonal therapy17, 18, 19. The general conclusion from the studies 
summarized above is that [18F]FES PET images identified estrogen receptor

 positive tissue that was heterogeneously distributed within human tumors. These 
data may be helpful in identifying patients who will benefit from endocrine therapy for their cancer and predict the likelihood of response to specific treatment hormonal regimens.  
In a paper published in 2010, Tsujikawa et al
20 reported on the correlation 
between the uptake of 16α -[18F]fluoro -17β-estradiol (FES) and expression of 
estrogen receptors, as well as other related immunohistochemistry markers. Nineteen patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma underwent preoperative PET studies with FES and FDG. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) for each tracer and the regional FDG to FES SUV ratio were calculated using images after coregistration. FES uptake showed a significantly positive correlation with expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα). The FDG to FES ratio showed  a 
significantly negative correlation with expression of ERα and progesterone receptor B (PR -B). The FES uptake and FDG to FES ratio did not correlate with 
expression of ERβ, Ki -67 or glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). FDG uptake was not 
correlated with any of  the immunohistochemical scores. The PR -B score was 
strongly correlated with the ERα score. Well -differentiated carcinoma (grade 1) 
showed a significantly higher FES uptake and significantly lower FDG to FES ratio than moderately or poorly differentiated carcinoma (grade 2 – 3). None of 
the PET parameters were significantly different between advanced- stage 
carcinoma (≥ stage IB) and early -stage carcinoma (IA) based on the Féderation 
International de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) staging classification. Differentiation grade was the most closely correlated parameter to FES uptake and FDG to FES ratio by multivariate analyses. The authors concluded FES PET combined with FDG would be useful for non- invasive evaluation of ERα 
distribution, as well as ERα function, which reflects differentiation grade in endometrial carcinoma
20.  
In a study of 16 female healthy volunteers published in 2007, Tsuchida et 
al21 administered a single dose of FES to investigate the relationship between 
endometrial and myometrial F ES uptake and menstrual phase or endogenous 
estrogen level.  
Endometrial SUV was significantly higher in the proliferative phase than in 
the secretory phase (6.03 ± 1.05 vs. 3.9 ± 1.29, P = .022). In contrast, there was 
no significant difference in myometri al SUV when the proliferative and secretory 
phases were compared ( P = .23). Further, there was no correlation between SUV 
and endogenous estrogen level in the proliferative phase. The authors concluded that the change of ER concentration relative to menstrual cycle as characterized 
by FES PET was consistent with those from previous reports that used an 
immunohistochemical technique. These data suggest that FES PET is a feasible, noninvasive method for characterizing changes in ER concentration
21.  
In a study published in 2008 by Tsujikawa et al22 FES and FDG PET studies were 
performed in 38 patients with benign and malignant uterine tumors to compare differences in tracer accumulation. Regional values of tracer uptake were

 evaluated by using standardized uptake value (SUV). Patients with endometrial 
carcinoma showed significantly greater mean SUV for FDG (9.6 ± 3.3) than for FES (3.8 ± 1.8) ( P < .005). Patients with endometrial hyperplasia showed 
significantly higher mean SUV for FES  (7.0 ± 2.9) than for FDG  (1.7 ± 0.3) ( P < 
.05). Patients with leiomyoma showed significantly higher mean SUV for FES (4.2 ± 2.4) than for FDG (2.2 ± 1.1) ( P < .005), and patients with sarcoma 
showed opposite tendencies for tracer accumulation. Tracer uptake in patients with endometrial carcinoma was significantly higher for FDG ( P < .001) and 
significantly lower for FES ( P < .05) when compared with values in patients with 
endometrial hyperplasia. On the other hand, patients with sarcoma showed a significantly higher uptake for FDG (P < .005) and a significantly lower uptake for 
FES ( P < .05) compared with patients with leiomyoma. The authors concluded 
that ER expression and glucose metabolism of uterine tumors measured by using PET showed opposite tendencies, and that PET studies utilizing both FES and FDG could provide pathophysiologic information for the differential diagnosis of uterine tumors. These results demonstrate the potential predictive capability of 
FES PET
22.  
In another study by Peterson et al published in 200823, [18F]fluoroestradiol 
uptake was compared with ER expression assayed in vitro by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) with both qualitative and semiquantitative measures. Seventeen patients with primary or metastatic breast cancer were studied with dynamic [
18F]FES PET; cancer tissue samples, collected close to the 
time of imaging, were assayed for ER expression by IHC. For each tumor, partial -volume -corrected measures of [
18F]FES uptake were compared with ER 
expression measured by three different ER scoring methods:  qualitative scoring 
(0 – 31), the Allred score (0 – 10), and a computerized IHC index. The authors 
noted that there was excellent agreement (r2 = 0.99) between observers using 
IHC as well as the different methods of measuring ER content ( P < 0.001), and 
they concluded that there is good agreement between [18F]FES PET and ER 
expression measured by IHC, and that [18F]FES imaging may be a useful tool for 
aiding in the assessment of ER status, especially in patients with multiple tumors or for tumors that are difficult to biopsy
23. 
In a study by Dehdashti et al published in 200924, 51 post -menopausal 
women with advanced estrogen receptor positive breast cancer were studied. Patients underwent FES PET and FDG PET at baseline and repeat FDG PET after 30 mg estradiol. Tracer uptake was measured as the standardized uptake value (SUV). Patients were subsequently treated with either an aromatase 
inhibitor or fulvestrant. PET results were correlated with responsiveness to 
endocrine therapy. Per study criteria, 17 patients responded and 34 patients did not respond to endocrine therapy. Four responders and one non- responder had 
a clinical flare reaction, while only the responders demonstrated metabolic flare. After estradiol challenge, a significantly higher mean (± SD) percent change in SUV for FDG was noted in responders (20.9 ± 24.2) compared with non-
FES PET/MRI Endometriosis   CONFIDENTIAL

 responders ( -4.3 ± 11.0, P < 0.0001). On FES PET, a higher tumor SUV was 
noted in responders (3.5 ± 2.5) compared with non- responders (2.1 ± 1.8, P = 
0.0049). There was significantly longer overall survival in patients with metabolic 
flare than in those without flare regardless of type of endocrine therapy ( P = 
0.0062). The authors concluded that baseline tumor FES uptake and metabolic flare after an estradiol challenge are both predictive of responsiveness to 
endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer
24.  
In a study by Kumar et al published in 200725 an improved automated 
radiosynthesis methodology for [18F]FES was developed. Stability studies of the 
resulting injectable form were performed up to 24 hours after dose formulation under normal storage conditions. A comparison of FES versus FDG PET imaging was then conducted in ER+ breast cancer patients. The results of the improved synthesis methodology were favorable and the subsequent PET imaging suggested specificity of FES for ER+ tumors versus FDG
25.  
In a 2008 paper Tsujikawa et al26 reported two postmenopausal patients under 
suspicion of endometrial carcinoma on the basis of  cytology and/or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), who were on tamoxifen treatment since undergoing surgery for breast cancer. Pelvic MRI suggested endometrial carcinomas, whereas FDG and FES -PET showed no abnormal tracer accumulation. A 
postoperative histopathologic examination revealed that the lesions were endometrial hyperplasias with no malignant findings. They concluded that FES PET enabled them to evaluate endometrial ER expression noninvasively. The evaluation of ER expression using FES PET requires  careful attention regarding 
the influence of hormonal therapy because tamoxifen greatly affects FES accumulation of even endometrial hyperplasia, which should be an FES -avid 
lesion
26.  
Another study published by Tsujikawa et al in 200927 investigated whet her 
[18F]FES and [18F]FDG PET reflect clinic -pathologic features in patients with 
endometrial tumors27. A total of 22 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma 
and nine with endometrial hyperplasia underwent [18F]FES PET for estrogen 
receptor imaging and [18F]FDG PET. The diagnostic accuracy of MRI findings for 
clinical staging was also compared. They found that although the SUV for [
18F]FDG was significantly lower in endometrial hyperplasia than in carcinoma, a 
statistically significant difference between high -risk and low -risk carcinoma was 
observed only in SUV for [18F]FES. High -risk carcinoma showed a significantly 
greater [18F]FDG to [18F]FES ratio (3.6 ± 2.1) than did low -risk carcinoma (1.3 ± 
0.5, P < 0.01) and hyperplasia (0.360.1, P < 0.005). Low -risk carcinoma showed 
a significantly higher [18F]FDG to [18F]FES ratio than hyperplasia (P < 0.0001). In 
receiver  operating- characteristic (ROC) analysis, the most accurate diagnostic 
PET parameter for predicting high- risk and low -risk carcinoma was the [18F]FDG 
to [18F]FES ratio. The optimal [18F]FDG/[18F]FES cutoff value of 2.0, determined 
by ROC analysis, revealed 73% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 86% accuracy, which was better than the 77% accuracy for MRI. The [
18F]FDG to [18F]FES ratio 
FES PET/MRI Endometriosis   CONFIDENTIAL

 of 0.5 yielded a correct diagnosis for carcinoma from hyperplasia with 100% 
accuracy. They concluded that endometrial carcinoma reduces estrogen dependency with accelerated glucose metabolism as it progresses to a higher stage or grade, that the [
18F]FDG to [18F]FES r atio reflects tumor aggressiveness, 
and that this index will be useful for making noninvasive diagnoses and deciding the appropriate therapeutic strategy for patients with endometrial carcinoma
27. 
11.6 Reported adverse events and potential risks  
Approximately 1500 subjects are represented in the published studies. 
Other than infrequent transient intravenous site discomfort and an “alcohol taste”, there have been no adverse events related to [
18F]FES administration.  
Although lab values have not been routinely measured pre- and post -FES PET 
scans as part of the PET procedure, many patients at the University of Washington have undergone serial measurements of renal and liver function, differential blood counts and assay of electrolytes as part of their clinical management. To estimate toxicity risk, 109 consecutive patients who underwent FES PET scans between 2002 and 2005 were examined. Of these 109, 30 
patients had hematology and serum chemistry values measured both before FES 
PET scanning (median 16 days prior) and within 21 days after the infusion of [
18F]FES (median 10.5 days post scan).  
Measurements of renal and liver function (serum creatinine, SGOT, 
SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase) showed no clinically significant changes pre- versus post -FES i nfusion in this group of patients. Three patients had elevated 
alkaline phosphatase prior to FES infusion, due to extensive bony metastatic disease, and these patients continued to have elevated levels post FES infusion with no clinically significant change. Differential blood counts (platelet counts, WBC, neutrophils, hemoglobin, and hematocrit) were examined. These showed a number of patients with abnormal blood values prior to FES PET scanning; 
however, this was expected in a heavily pre- treated populati on undergoing 
salvation therapy for metastatic breast cancer. There were no clinically significant 
changes in blood counts seen post -[
18F]FES infusion compared with the 
preimaging values.  
11.7 FES Administered Dose  
The [18F]fluoroestradiol is a sterile, IV injectable solution with a volume of 
≤ 20 ml containing 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline: < 15% ethanol (v:v). The injected dose of [
18F]FES is generally 6 mCi (185 MBq) with an allowable range 
of 3 to 6 mCi of [18F]fluoroestradiol. The drug product solution is stored at room 
temperature in a gray butyl septum sealed, sterile, pyrogen- free glass vial with an 
expiration time of 8 hours. The mass of injected drug is ≤ 5 μg (≤ 17 nmol) of FES.  
11.8 Agent Availability  
[18F]FLT will be provided by the Biomedical Research Imaging 
Radiopharmaceutical Core under an IND held by the Cancer Imaging Program (CIP)/NCI.

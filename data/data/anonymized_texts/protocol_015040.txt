 Protocol Synopsis  
Relapse Prophylaxis with IL -15 Super  Agonist  N-803 in Patients with Acute 
Myelogenous Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome Following Reduced Intensity 
Conditioning (RIC) Allogeneic  Stem  Cell Transplantation  
  Study 
Design:  This is a single -arm, multi -center Phase II trial using IL -15 super -agonist complex (N -803 formerly 
known as Alt -803) maintenance  after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplan t (alloHCT ) for acute 
myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MD S). The primary  objective  is to 
determine  if post -transplant N -803 effectively reduces  relapse as measured  by the cumulative incidence 
of relapse between the 1st dose of N -803 and two years after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)  
alloHCT.  The hypothesis  is that N-803 will reduce relapse from a historical estimate of 35% to 20% in 
the study cohort . The rationale is that N -803 will  enhance  allogeneic  immunity  through  activation and 
expansion of donor -derived NK cells and CD8+  T cells capable  of mediating  a response  to remaining 
leukemia cells (minimal residual disease, MRD); therefore decreasing relapse rates . A secondary  aim 
is to achieve  this goal without  increasing frequency or severity of graft -versus -host disease ( GVHD)  
 
In this study N-803 is given at 6 mcg/kg subcutaneously (SQ) once every 4 weeks for a maximum 
of 10 doses. Treatment must begin between Day 42 and Day 60 post-transplant with the goal to 
enroll patients as close to Day 42 as feasible  as starting anti -tumor maintenance is a lo gical goal . 
GVHD prophylaxis will continue per individual institutional standard practice. Follow -up for late 
toxicity, disease status , and survival continues for 2 years from alloHCT . 
 
Sixty patients are planned for enrollment with an analysis for futility after 40 patients are enrolled 
(while enrollment continues) . The trial will be discontinued if the cumulative incidence estimate of 
2 year relapse is  projected at  >34%.  Otherwise , enrollment continues to complete the trial  in the 
absence of excessive toxicity as monitored by early stopping rule s by donor type (sibling, umbilical 
cord blood, unrelated and haploidentical):  
1) Grade III -IV acute GVHD by Day 120 post -transplant  
2) Grade 4 an d 5 non -relapse toxicity by Day 120 post -transplant  
 
Primary 
Objective:  The primary objective is to determine if post -transplant N -803 effectively reduces relapse from a 
historical estimate of 35% to 20% in the study cohort  as measured by cumulative incidence of relapse 
between the 1st dose of N -803 and 2 years after a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplant ( alloHCT ) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) . 
 
Secondary 
Objectives:   
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of every 4 week  N-803 administration  
• To determine the incidence of relapse at two years after alloHCT stratified by number of doses 
of N-803 (1 -3 or 4 -10) 
• To determine  the frequency and severity  of acute  and late acute/chronic  graft-versus -host 
disease ( GVHD)  by graft source  
• To evaluate whether cytogenetic and flow cytometry positive minimal residual disease ( MRD ) 
post-transplant (before and after N-803)  determine overall survival at 2 years post-transplant  
• To determine the incidence of non -relapse mortality at 2 years post-transplant  
 
Correlative 
Objectives:  • To monitor  the number  and function  of NK cells,  T cells,  T regulatory  cells and myeloid derived 
suppressor cells  pre- and post-N-803 therapy  and serum cytokines that could influence 
response  
• To determine the incidence of CMV viremia or disease by Day 100 post -transplant   
• To characterize N-803 immunogenicity

1 Objectives  
1.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary objective is to determine if post -transplant N -803 effectively 
reduces relapse from a historical estimate of 35% to 20% in the study cohort 
as measured by cumulative incidence of relapse between the 1st dose of N -
803 and 2 years after a reduced  intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) 
and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).   
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the  safety and  tolerability of every 4 week N -803 administration   
• To determine the incidence of relapse at two years after alloHCT stratified 
by number of doses of N -803 (1 -3 or 4 -10) 
• To determine  the incidence  of acute  and late acute/chronic  graft-versus -host 
disease ( GVHD)  
• To evaluate whether cytogenetic and flow cytometry positive minimal residual 
disease ( MRD ) post-transplant (before and after N-803) 
• To determine overall survival at 2 years post-transplant  
• To determine the incidence of non -relapse mortality at 2 years post-
transplant  
1.3 Correlative Objective s 
• To monitor  the number  and function  of NK cells,  T cells,  T regulatory  cells and 
myeloid derived suppressor cells  pre- and post-N-803 therapy , as well as 
serum cytokines reflecting the immune activation  
• To determine the incidence of CMV viremia or disease by Day 100 post -
transplant  
• To characterize  the immunogenicity profile of N-803 
 
 
2 Background and Significance  
2.1 Introduction  and Rationale for the Approach  
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is  the most common acute leukemia in adults 
with 18,860 cases estimated for 2014 and an additional 800 cases in children 
(www.LLS.org). The incidence is increasing, as it develops in patients who 
survive treatment from other cancers or evolves in elderly patients with 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The main cause of treatment failure for AML 
continues to be relapse. Successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 14 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 transplantation (HCT) requires the infusion o f healthy stem cells, as well as 
lymphocytes capable of participating in a graft -versus -tumor/leukemia (GVL) 
reaction . The importance of the infused lymphocytes has been demonstrated 
in studies showing increased relapse after transplants with lymphocyte -
depleted grafts and by the therapeutic efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusions1-
2. Unfortun ately, relapse after allogeneic HCT remains a significant problem 
with rates approaching 35% in patients receiving non -myeloablative 
conditioning ( NMAC), and even higher in those with high -risk diseas e3. Optimal 
strategies to balance immune responses to favor GVL without harmful graft -
versus -host disease (GVHD) are needed .  
 
Profound NK Cell Functional Defects After HCT. Unlike adaptive B and T 
cells, which express a single somatically recombined, clonally expressed 
antigen receptor that recognize specific or cross reactive antigen, NK cell 
activation is controlled by germline -encoded activating and inhibitory receptors . 
With the notable exception of CD16, which binds to the Fc portion of 
immunoglobulin and mediates ADCC, no activating receptor is functionally 
dominant, and each can be counteracted by inhibitory receptor signal ing4,5. 
Activating and inhibitory killer cell lectin -like receptors (NKG2C and NKG2A) 
and KIR are encoded by gene complexes, recognize class I molecules, and are 
expressed in a variegated fashion6. These inhibitory receptors are primarily 
responsible for NK cell education, the process by which acquisition of function 
is mediated through engagement of class I MHC. After HCT, NK cells are the 
first cancer fighting defense as NK cells recon stitute in large numbers. 
However, we have identified a profound defect in the function of reconstituting 
NK cells for up to 6 months after HCT . Our approach is to stimulate this function 
as early as possible after transplant in hope of preventing relapse.  
2.2 rhIL-15 
Interleukin -15 (IL -15) is a cytokine and growth factor capable of expanding 
activated T cells and NK cells. By broad consensus, the NCI Immunotherapy 
Workshop (2007) ranked IL -15 as the #1 agent with “high potential for 
immunoth erapy7.” Based on preclinical non -human primate and early phase 
clinical trial data, including those at the University of Minnesota, IL -15 regimens 
can unquestionably be designed to prospectively  and reproducibly increase T -
cell and NK -cell counts.  
 
The NCI Biological Resource Branch has manufactured E. coli -expressed 
recombinant human IL -15 (rhIL -15), and this is the first IL -15 product tested 
here at the University of Minnesota . Systemic adminis tration of NCI rhIL -15 by 
daily intravenous (IV) bolus has been shown to increase the number of 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 15 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 circulating CD8+ T and NK cells, but the cytokine has a very short half -life. We 
have established the MTD for NCI -manufactured rhIL -15 using IV and 
subcutaneous dosing . Although safer with subcutaneous administration  
allowing more drug delivery , we identified limitations with the rhIL -15 in clinical 
testing. Specifically, high levels of free rhIL -15 decrease circulating IL -15R, 
acting a s a negative feedback signal to reduce further IL -15 trans -presentation . 
This is the rationale in this trial for using IL-15/IL -15R-Fc (N-803), an IL -15 
product that physiologically trans -presents  IL-15. 
2.3 IL-15/IL -15R-Fc (N-803) 
This trial will evaluate an alternative IL -15 construct designed to have a 
prolonged serum half -life. The novel IL -15 immunoconjugate, N-803, was 
developed by our collaborator, Altor BioScience Corporation (Altor, Miramar, 
FL), to overcome some of the biol ogic, regulatory, and commercial limitations 
of monomeric NCI  rhIL-15. Under natural circumstances, IL -15 and IL -15 
Receptor -alpha (IL -15R) are coordinately expressed by antigen -presenting 
cells (i.e., monocytes and dendritic cells)8. During signaling by the IL -15 
pathway, IL -15 bound to IL -15R is presented in trans to neighboring NK or 
CD8+ T cells expressing only the IL -2R receptor. At the immunologic synapse, 
IL15 trans -presentation appears to b e a dominant mechanism for IL -15 action 
in vivo, providing tight physiologic control over the functions of IL -15 under 
homeostatic conditions and in response to immune stimuli9. N-803 is a soluble 
complex consisting of two protein subunits of a human IL -15 variant10 
associated with high affinity to a dimeric human IL -15 Receptor α (IL -15Rα) 
sushi domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein11. 
  
The IL -15 variant is a 114 aa polypepti de comprising the mature human IL -15 
cytokine sequence with an Asn to Asp substitution at position 72 of helix C 
(N72D)12. The human IL -15Rα sushi domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein 
comprises the sushi domain of the human IL -15 Receptor α subunit (IL -15Rα) 
(aa 1 -65 of the mature human IL -15Rα protein) linked with the human IgG1 
CH2-CH3 reg ion containing the Fc domain (232 amino acids). Aside from the 
N72D substitution, all of the protein sequences are human. N-803 has a 
prolonged serum half -life in preclinical animal models  and has a 4 -fold increase 
in biologic activity greater than wild -type IL -15 (IL -15 wt)10.  
2.4 N-803 by Subcutaneous Injection   
IV and SC administration of N -803 were compared in early phase 1 studies in 
solid and  hematologic tumors (QUILT -3.003, QUILT -3.004, QUILT -3.005). The 
decision to discontinue  IV administration was based on the high Cmax 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 16 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 observed via this route, which was associated with  markedly increased serum 
cytokine levels and high fever, rigors, tachycardia, and relative  hypotension.15 
SC administration of N -803 results in an approximately 100 -fold lower Cmax 
than IV and allows N -803 serum concentration to be maintained up to 96 hours 
post-dose with still detectable levels at 7 days (while IV N -803 declined below 
detection 48 - 96 hours post -administration). A PK study using SC N -803 in 
healthy volunteers (QUILT -1.004) showed that serum levels of N -803 remained 
elevated over a relatively  prolonged period after a single administ ration of the 
drug; the apparent mean half -life of the  complex was 20 -21 hours. SC 
administration resulted in significant attenuation of AEs as  compared to IV 
administration. Subjects receiving N -803 via SC administration most commonly  
experienced injection site reaction, mild fever, hypoalbuminemia, and chills, 
while those  receiving IV N -803 most commonly experienced higher fever, 
rigors, fatigue, nausea, and  hypertension. The common localized skin rash 
observed with SC administration o f N-803 could  be managed with topical 
steroids when necessary. In addition to its favorable tolerability and  PK profile, 
SC administration of N -803 is associated with equivalent and possibly 
enhanced  efficacy and biological activity. In QUILT -3.004 (hemato logic 
malignancies), SC administration  of N -803 was associated with a greater 
increase in circulating NK cells than IV administration.15 In QUILT -3.002 
(relapsed or refractory iNHL), the combinat ion of rituximab  with N -803 led to 
objective responses in 58% (7 out of 12) of SC -treated subjects and  44% (4 out 
of 9) of IV -treated subjects. In total, these observations show that SC 
administration  is well tolerated, yields a lower Cmax yet more sustain ed serum 
levels of N -803 over time, and  has equivalent or greater efficacy and biological 
activity as compared to IV administration.

2.5 Study Rationale  
As we perform more transplants in older adults using reduced intensity 
conditioning, relapse rates are unacceptably high irrespective of graft 
source13,14. Currently there is no effective maintenance therapy available for 
this patient population . We also described an NK cell defect early after HCT . 
IL-15 is an optimal cytokine to improve NK and T cell  function ; potentially 
improving graft versus tumor effect and reducing th e relapse risk  after RIC 
transplants . We have tested a number of IL-15 products and IL-15/IL -15R-Fc 
(N-803) seems to be the best candidate for use in this setting .  
 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 17 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 While some  studies continue to dose escalate (currently 15 and 20 mcg/kg are 
under study) ; we are testing immune activation in a minimal residual setting 
and will use a lower safe dose ( N-803 6 mcg/kg SQ).  We have chosen to be 
conservative in the dosing here 1) beca use of the complexity of patients early 
post-transplant and 2) because of the use in the prophylactic setting . In 
addition, we have shown that 6 mcg/kg is safe, especially with subcutaneous 
dosing , where as unlike IV N-803, subcutaneous dosing is associated with less 
severe constitutional symptoms compared to IV dosing . In addition, we have 
immunologic data suggesting that 6  mcg/kg is biologically active.  
 
The cumulative experience with ALT -803 (initially from Altor Bio Sciences) has 
grown and we p ublished the first -in-human experience in 31 transplant patients 
as the rationale for this trial15. This paper also details the immune activation 
and long half -life of subcutaneous (S Q) dosing, the approach we use here. We 
have treated 8 subjects with weekly S Q dosing  in this current trial  and learned 
that weekly dosi ng is simply not feasible because injection site reactions (very 
common in all cohorts tested) take more than one week to resolve. In addition, 
pre-clinical data suggest that higher levels of  IL-15 may lead to NK cell 
exhaustion16. During the progress of th is trial , BioSciences  became a  wholly -
owned subsidiary of ImmunityBio, Inc.  While there is no change in the drug, 
they now refer to it as N -803, reflecting the business acquisition. ImmunityBio, 
Inc. has also performed additional studies in normal volunteers (unpublished) 
showing that dosing intervals should probably be 3 -4 weeks to prevent 
exhaustion and maximize immune activation. Every 4 -week  dosing was chosen 
to amend this trial based on this new information recognizing the higher risk 
cohort and to maximize patient convenience with this maintenance therapy 
strategy.  In addition, the treatment plan was revised to initiate  N-803 dosing 
closer po st-HCT (from a window of Day 60 - Day 100) to as close to Day 42 as 
feasible,  and no later than Day 60  post-transplant . Starting anti -tumor 
maintenance earlier is a logical goal, while continuing GVH D prophylaxis per 
individual institutional practice. This decision is supported by an  ongoing clinical 
study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  which administers 4 doses of N -803 subcutaneously 
between  on Day +7 and Day +17 after a RIC allo -HCT (Day 0) /haploidentical 
NK cells on Day +7 without an increased incidence of GVHD ( Todd Fehniger, 
MD - personal communication).

 3 Study Design  
This is a single -arm, multi -center Phase II trial using IL -15 super -agonist complex 
(N-803) maintenance after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) for 
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The 
primary objective is to determine if post -transplant N -803 effectively reduces 
relapse as measured by the cumulative incidence of relapse between the 1st dose 
of N-803 (Day 42  to Day  60 post -transplant ) and two years after RIC alloHCT. The 
rationale is that N -803 will enhance allogeneic immunity through activation and 
expansion of donor -derived NK cells and CD8+ T cells capable of mediating a 
response to remaining leukemia cells (mini mal residual disease, MRD); therefore 
decreasing relapse rates. A secondary aim is to achieve this goal without increasing 
frequency or severity of graft -versus -host disease (GVHD).  
 
In this study N -803 is given at 6 mcg/kg subcutaneously (SQ) once every 4  weeks 
to a maximum of 10 doses. Treatment must begin between Day 42 and Day 60 
post-transplant with the goal to enroll patients as close to Day 42 as feasible as 
starting anti -tumor maintenance is a logical goal.  GVHD prophylaxis will continue 
per individ ual institutional standard practice. Follow -up for late toxicity, disease 
status , and survival continues for 2 years from alloHCT.  
 
Sixty patients are planned for enrollment with an analysis for futility after 40 patients 
are enrolled (while enrollment continues). The trial will be discontinued if the 
cumulative incidence estimate of 2 year relapse is projected at >34%. Otherwise, 
enrollment continues to complete the trial  in the absence of excessive toxicity as 
monitored by early stopping rul es. 
 
We hypothesize that risk of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and Grade 4 -
5 non -relapse toxicity following N -803 treatment could vary by donor type. 
Therefore, we will count  events towards the stopping rules separately for each 
donor type (siblin g, umbilical cord blood, unrelated, and haploidentical) as follows:  
1) Grade III -IV acute GVHD by Day 120 post -transplant  
2) Grade 4 and 5 non -relapse toxicity by Day 120 post -transplant  
 
Note: Overall enrollment is irrespective of donor type.  If a stopping rule is met for 
one donor type, enrollment will be suspended for that group only. Enrollment for all 
other donor groups may continue until the maximum study size is reached.

5.1 Enrollment with the University of Minnesota Clinical Trials Office  
Any patient who is consented is to be entered in OnCore by the site Study 
Coordinator  or designee.  
 
If a patient is consented but is not enrolled  in the study treatment (i.e. is found 
to be ineligible) , the patient’s record is updated in OnCore as a screen failure 
and reas on for exclusion recorded.  
 
Complete enrollment information is found in the study’s Procedures Manual for 
Participating  Sites.  
 
In addition, participating institutions  are responsible for fulfilling any local study 
registration requirements.  
5.2 Patient Enrol lment to Study Treatment in OnCore  
To be eligible for study treatment , the patient must sign the treatment consent 
and meet each inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria on the 
eligibility checklist based on an eligibility assessment documente d in the 
patient’s medical record.

 5.3 Patients Who Do Not Begin Study Treatment  
If a patient is enrolled in  the study (i.e. assigned a sequence number) and is 
later found unable to begin  N-803 by Day 60 , the patient will be removed from 
study and treated at the physician’s discretion . The study staff  will update 
OnCore of the patient’s non -treatment status  (off study)  with t he reason for 
removal from study prior to starting study treatment clearly indicated . The 
patient will be replaced to complete  enrollment.  
 
 
6 Treatment Plan  
In order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical 
conditions, investigator discretion may be used in the prescribing of all supportive 
care drug therapy (i.e. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, antimicrobials, etc .).  
 
The use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss of therapeutic effects 
of the study drug and should be avoided . Standard of care GVHD prophylaxis  is 
permitted per institutional practice . Topical steroid cream is permitted . 
 
CMV and other viral prophylaxis/management will be per institutional practice.  
6.1 N-803 Administration  
Treatment is given as an outpatient.  
 
N-803 at 6 mcg/kg is administered subcutaneously  on Day 1 of a 28 day cycle 
for a maximum of 10 doses , or until relapse, unacceptable toxicity, or patient 
refusal, whichever comes earlier.   
 
A window of ±1 week  is permitted  for each “monthly” N -803 injection in the 
event of s cheduling issues (i.e. holiday, bad weather or other scheduling 
issues)  but the first dose must be given by Day 60 . There  is no resetting of the 
treatment calendar  when a treatment window is used  as the recommended 
schedule for N -803, in general is every 3  to 4 weeks.  At minimum of 3 weeks 
must separate each injection.  
 
N-803 dosing is calculated using  a weight obtain ed within 7 days prior to the 
first dose . For patients > 100 kilograms weight, the N-803 dose is calculated 
using a weight capped at 100 kg. The patient’s  weight is re-checked prior to 
each dose (within 7 days) and  the dose re -calculated  if ≥ 10% change  from the 
weight used for the previous dose calculation . Rounding of a dose is permitted 
per instit utional policy.

 If the total subcutaneous dose is greater than 1.5 mL  volume , the dose will be 
divided  by the pharmacist  into 2 -3 subcutaneous injections as needed.  
Injection s are given in the abdominal area. The i njection site should be rotated 
per instit utional guidelines and each injection site separated by at least 1 inch.   
 
Pre-medication  
Use of pre -medications is at the discretion of the treating physician on an 
individual patient basis.  Acetaminophen may be given prior to the injection to 
reduce the intensity of the fever that often occurs a few hours later.  
 
Required post N-803 dose monitoring  
Patients will be observed for a minimum of 2 hours after the 1st dose of N -
803 for immediate adverse events. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, 
respiration, temperature, and oxygen saturation) will be documented prior to 
the N -803 injection and then at 30, 60 and 120 minutes with a ± 20 minute 
window for each time point.  
 
If the 1st dose of N -803 is well tolerated, subsequent doses may be 
administered with  a 30 minute post dosing observation period.  Vital signs 
(heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, temperature, and oxygen saturation) 
will be documented prior to each N-803 injection  and then at 30 minutes ± 10 
minutes.  
6.1.1  Provider’s Assessment Prior to Each N-803 
In order to proceed with a planned N-803 injection, a  provider must assess the 
patient prior to administration to rule -out any of the following contraindications 
for dosing : 
• the previous injection site reaction is not showing signs of resolving 
(improving)  based on measurement or intensity  
• signs or symptoms of a new infection  
• fever  > 101°F (38.3 °C)  
• there are signs or symptoms of new acute GVHD  as evidenced by new skin 
rash outside of the injection reaction area  
• there is clinical progression of existing acute GVHD  
• there are signs or symptoms of relapse  
 
The N-803 dose  will be delayed  for 1 week if one or more of the above 
conditions are present . Refer to Section 6.2  GVHD Management Guidance in 
the event of new (or suspected ) aGVHD or worsening of existing aGVHD.  
 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 24 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 In addition, N-803 may be delayed  for 1 week on the day of a planned dose for 
either of the following situations:  
• any Grade 3 or greater ongoing N-803 treatment related toxicity ( injection 
site reaction , neurologic, increased liver function tests)  
• if in the opinion of the treating physician , holding N-803 would be of benefit 
to the patient   
 
If after a 1 week rest : 
• The patient meets the criteria for treatment , the patient may receive N -803. 
The patient calendar would not be adjusted (reset)  
• The patient does not meet the criteria for treatment or the investigator  feels 
holding treatment would be of benefit to the patient,  the dosing may be 
skipped with treatment resumed at the next planned date.   
 
There is no resetting of the treatment calendar in  OnCore for  either 
scheduling issues or delays due to toxicities . Cycle 1 Day 1 is the anchor 
for all subsequent injections spaced every 4 weeks. A ± 1 week window is 
asso ciated with each injection date; however injections should be no closer 
than 3 weeks apart.  
6.1.2  Dose Reduction  
A one -time dose decrease to 4 mcg/kg is allowe d for recurrent N-803 related 
constitutional symptoms (e.g. fever, fatigue, muscle aches) interfering with 
activities of daily living (ADL) despite pre -medication. Patients unable to 
tolerate the reduced dose will be discontinued from further N-803. Re -
escalation of the dose is not permitted.  
6.1.3  Inadequate Dosing  
If a patient receives only one dose  of N-803, the patient will be taken off 
treatment  and followed per Section 8.1 . The patient will be fully evaluable for 
safety and toxicity, but replaced  in the evaluation of efficacy .  
6.2 GVHD Management Guidance  
New or worsening skin rash outside of injection site area (whether GVHD 
clinically suspected or previously diagnosed ) and other GVHD manifestations 
should be managed as described in this section . Refer to Section 7. 1 for 
management of skin rash /injection site reaction  within the vicinity of the 
injection.  
 
The following guidance  is based on GVHD grading criteria using the University 
of Minnesota  aGVHD Grading Scale ( Appendix I II).  
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 25 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
  
If new GVHD Grade  I or Grade II is clinically suspected or definitive , hold 
N-803 until the next planned dose . N-803 may resume  with the next planned 
dose  if GVHD is clinically improving with topical steroids and/or low dose 
systemic steroids ( prednisone ≤ 0.3 mg/kg/day  or equivalent ) with clinical 
stability for at least 1 week  prior to the planned N-803 injection  (and other 
criter ia for treatment in Section 6.1  is met) .  
 
If new or worsening GVHD Grade III is clinically suspected or definitive , 
hold N-803 until the next planned dose . If the GVHD flare was in the context of 
tapering immunosuppressive  medications, one could consider subsequent 
cycles if GVHD is controlled with systemic steroids (≤ 0.3 mg/kg/day) with 
clinical stability for at least 1 week  prior to the planned N-803 injection. I f GVHD 
flare was not in the context of tapering immunosuppressive medications, one 
should consider permanently discontinuing N-803. If prednisone > 0.3 
mg/kg/day (or equivalent) is required, N -803 will be permanently discontinued.  
 
If new or worsen ing GVHD Grade  IV, N-803 will be permanently discontinued.  
6.3 Supportive Care  
Supportive care will be provided per institutional guidelines and standard of 
care. Guidelines may be updated based on current data/drugs without requiring 
a protocol amendment or be considered a protocol deviation.  
 
At study enrollment, GVHD prophylaxis will be continued according individual 
institutional standard practice.  
 
Supportive care may be given as needed on an individual patient basis 
including, but not limited to:  
Fever  - acetaminophen  
Chills  - meperidine or morphine sulfate  
Nausea and vomiting  - anti-emetics and IV fluids  
Diarrhea  - loperamide and fluids after stool testing  
6.4 General Concomitant Medications Guidelines  
Administration of additional glucocorticoids is discouraged  during the N-803 
treatment period as the use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss 
of therapeutic  effects of the study drug . Sustained use of steroids at a 
prednisone dose > 0.3 mg/kg/day  or equivalent ( other than standard GVHD 
prophylaxis per institutional practice ) or steroid use to treat related toxicity will

April 14, 2022  Page 26 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 be an indication to stop N-803. Transient use is permitted as needed per 
standard of care . Topical steroid cream is permitted .  
 
CMV prophylaxis/management will be per institutional practice.  
 
The use of anti -cancer therapies  including maintenance therapy , agents that 
affect immunity, an d investigational agents , are prohibited  while a patient is 
receiving study treatment . 
 
Refer to Section 6.2  for guidelines in the management of GVHD.  
6.5 Duration of Treatment  
N-803 post-transplant may continue for a maximum of  10 doses  unless one of 
the following occurs:  
• unacceptable toxicity  
• develop ment of  Grade IV aGVHD  (refer to Appendix I II) or GVHD requires 
steroid dose > 0.3 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent  
• initiation of  new anti-cancer therapy  or other prohibited therapy ( including 
approved therapies, investigational agents, agents that affect immunity)  
• consent is withdrawn or patient is not compliant  
 
An End of Treatment (EOT) visit occurs 4 weeks (± 1 week) after the last dose 
of N-803 to assess for signs of acute GVHD and N -803 related toxicity.  
 
All patients will be followed per Section 8.1  and evaluable per Section 13.1 . 
6.6 Duration of Study Participation  
Patients are followed for late toxicity, disease status , and survival for 2 years 
from the date of transplan t, unless one of the following occurs:  
• consent is withdrawn  
• patient is discharged to hospice and/or not returning to the study site  for 
routine post -transplant follow -up – in these cases, follow -up information 
including date and cause of death may be obtained , as available from other 
sources (i.e. BMT database) .

 7 Management of Injection Site Reactions/Skin Rash in 
Association with N -803 
Based on current experience, localized skin rashes are common with 
subcutaneous administration . If a rash occurs and the rash area surrounding the 
N-803 injection site is > 6 cm or symptomatic (painful and/or itchy), it may be 
treated with topical 0.05% clobetasol propionate (i.e. 0.05% Cormax) or 0.1% 
triamcinolone (i.e., Kenalog) cream. Diphenhydramine may be administered pre - 
and post -dosing (25 -50 mg TID orally x 2 days) of N-803 at the discretion of the 
treating physician .  
 
Usually  the rash associated with an N-803 starts small at the site of the injection 
and spreads outwardly sometimes covering a large area of the abdomen. It 
generally resolves within 7 days of treatment. Patients will be instructed to contact 
a member of the study team for rashes outside of the injection site area and/or 
lasting more than 7 days . 
 
8 Clinical Evaluations and Procedures  
Scheduled evaluations  during the treatment cycles  may be performed up to 3 days 
before (-3 days) the targeted date  with the additional visits during Cycle 1 having a 
±1 day window .  
 
A window of ±1 week  for the N-803 dosing is allowed in the event of scheduling 
issues . Treatment may be delayed for 1 week for toxicity related reasons as detailed 
in Section 6.1.1 ; however, if treatment cannot be giv en after a 1 week delay, 
treatment will be held until the next planned dose.  
 
The End of Treatment  (EOT)  visit (4 weeks after the last dose of N -803) may be 
scheduled  using a ±1 week . After the EOT visit, follow -up for this study will coincide 
with the standard of care transplant follow -up schedule through 2 years post -
transplant . In addition, targeted days may be altered as clinically appropriate.

samples if patient is treated 1 week later  
3 Immunogenicity samples are stored frozen at the study site until the time of batch shipping directly to 
ImmunityBio, Inc ’s central laboratory.  
 
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for additional details.  
 
Note: if a patient is not abiding by the required clinical care calendar ( Section 8.1 ), 
the collection schedule of the toxicity (adverse event) data and research related 
samples schedule  may be altered or discontinued on an individual patient basis, 
as appropriate.  It will not be a protocol deviation if a research related sample 
collection is not done because the patient did not comply with the standard of care 
visit. 
 
It is recognized that with novel therapies as used in this study, the timing of protocol 
directed research samples may miss important patient specific events . For this 
reason, up to 3 extra samples of 60  ml of blood each may be drawn at additional 
relevant time points  (i.e. develop ment  of GVHD, relapse , change in blood counts 
(lymphocytosis )) as per the PI’s opinion , and are not specified above.  
8.2.1  Assessment of Immune Activation (TTL)  
Samples  to evaluate lymphocyte number, phenotype and function  will be 
collected as detailed above for the Masonic Cancer Center Translational 
Therapy Lab (TTL)  along with serum (red top tubes) for measure of cytokines 
that can reflect immune activation.  
 
Flow cytometry analysis of a fraction of the PBMC will detect surface markers 
that define lymphocyte subsets (NK, NKT, B, and T cells, both CD4 and CD8), 
as well as intracellular markers that define regulatory T cells (Foxp3) and 
proliferating cells (Ki67) . All remaining PBMC will be cryopreserved in 10%

 DMSO and sto red in liquid nitrogen for future testing , if subject agreed to future 
storage at the time of initial consent . 
8.2.2  Immunogenicity  (ImmunityBio, Inc ) 
Immunogenicity assays will be performed at ImmunityBio, Inc . Serum samples 
for immunogenicity testing will be c ollected for all. The collection schedule is 
specified in the Study Calendar . One 5 mL silicone coated (red top) tube per 
time point will be collected .  
 
The collected blood samples will be processed (centrifuge at 1000 -1500 x  g for 
10 minutes) at the study site and the serum portion will be frozen and shipped 
to ImmunityBio, Inc  in batches upon request for evaluation using validated 
ELISA methods.  
 
In these tests, human anti -N-803 antibodies are detected in patient serum 
sampl es using a direct sandwich ELISA method with plates coated with N-803. 
After the appropriate wash conditions, biotinylated N-803 is used for detection 
with standard HRP -labeled streptavidin reagents. For analysis of clinical 
samples, anti -IL-15 antibody se rve as reference standard and serum from N-
803 immunized mice serve as a positive control . The level of anti -N-803 
antibody in patient samples is determined based on the anti -IL-15 antibody 
standard curve.  
 
9 N-803 Formulation, Supply, and Potential Toxicity  
N-803 (previously known as ALT -803 - Altor BioScience  is now a wholly owned 
subsidiary of ImmunityBio, Inc.) is a recombinant human superagonist IL -15 
complex. Its active ingredient is N-803 and its pharmacologic class is a n anti-
cancer and anti -viral immunotherapeutic.  
 
N-803 has been referred to as IL -15N72D:IL -15RαSu/IgG1 Fc complex in various 
preclinical study r eports, publications, and other related documents.  
 
N-803 is an IL-15-based  immunostimulatory  protein  complex  that acts as a growth  
and activation  factor for NK cells and effector  and memory  T cells.  Based  on the 
results  of animal  tumor  models,  N-803 stimulated  cellular  immune  responses  
are expected  to exhibit  potent  activity  against  human  tumor  cells.  Due to the 
higher  affinity  single  amino  acid substituted  IL-15 variant  and the presentation  of 
IL-15 with IL-15RαSu,  N-803 is likely  to be effective  at low concentrations.  
Owning  to its longer  half-life as a result  of fusion  with Fc, N-803 is likely  to be 
effective  using  a practical  regimen  of every 4 week  injections  in this patient 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 31 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 population . It is likely  that low concentrations  of N-803 will increase  the 
peripheral  blood  T cell and NK cell counts  to predictable levels with a safety  
profile  appropriate  for outpatient  use. 
9.1 Structural Formula  
N-803 is a soluble complex consisting of 2 protein subunits of a human IL -15 
variant associated with high affinity to a dimeric IL -15R sushi domain/human 
IgG1 Fc fusion protein. The IL -15 variant is a 114 aa polypeptide comprising 
the mature human IL -15 cytokin e sequence with an Asn to Asp substitution at 
position 72 of helix C (N72D).6. The human IL -15R sushi domain/human IgG1 
Fc fusion protein comprises the sushi domain of the IL -15R subunit (aa 1 -65 of 
the mature human IL -15Rα protein) linked with the human I gG1 CH2 -CH3 
region containing the Fc domain (232 amino acids). Aside from the N72D 
substitution, all of the protein sequences are human. Based on the amino acid 
sequence of the subunits, calculated molecular weight of the complex 
comprising 2 IL -15N72D pol ypeptides and a disulfide linked homodimeric IL -
15RαSu/IgG1 Fc protein is 92.4 kDa. Each IL -15N72D polypeptide has a 
calculated molecular weight of approximately 12.8 kDa and the IL -
15RαSu/IgG1 Fc fusion protein has a calculated molecular weight of 
approxi mately 33.4 kDa. Both the IL -15N72D and IL -15RαSu/IgG1 Fc proteins 
are glycosylated resulting in an apparent molecular weight of N-803 as 
approximately 114 kDa by size exclusion chromatography . The isoelectric point 
(pI) determined for N-803 range from app roximately 5.6 to 6.5. Thus, the fusion 
protein is negatively charged at pH 7. The calculated molar extinction 
coefficient at A280 for N-803 is 116,540 M -1, or 1.26 OD280 for a 1 mg/mL 
solution of ALT -801, or one OD280 is equivalent to 0.79 mg/mL solution of N-
803. 
9.2 Formulation  
The biological drug product, N -803, is formulated in a phosphate buffered 
saline (PBS) solution. The solution appears as a clear and colorless liquid. The 
drug substance is produced by a recombinant mammalian cell line and is 
manufactured using a protein free media.  
9.3 Packaging  
Vials are packaged in cartons and shipped to the clinical site.  
9.4 Storage  
N-803 is supplied in a 2 -mL single -dose/single -use vial containing 0.6 mL of N -
803 (extractable volume is 0.5 mL) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/m L. 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 32 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 N-803 will be stored at the site in a secured area at 2°C to 8°C with limited 
access and protection from excess light and heat.  
9.5 Study Drug Preparation  
N-803 dosing is calculated using a weight obtained within 7 days prior to the 
first dose. For patients > 100 kilograms weight, the N -803 dose is calculated 
using a weight capped at 100 kg. The patient’s weight is re -checked prior to  
each dose (within 7 days) and the dose re -calculated if ≥ 10% change from the 
weight used for the previous dose calculation.  Rounding of a dose is permitted 
per institutional policy.  
The appropriate volume of  N-803 is withdrawn .  
If the total subcutaneous dose is greater than 1.5 mL, the dose will be divided 
into 2 -3 subcutaneous injections as needed.  
N-803 can be stored in a syringe for up to 24 hours at 4°C.   
9.6 Agent Inventory Records  
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the i nvestigator (e.g. 
institutional investigational pharmacy), must maintain a record of the inventory 
and disposition of all agents received from ImmunityBio, Inc  using the Study 
Agent Drug Accountability Record.  
9.7 Toxicity  
The most common side effects seen in studies with subcutaneous (under the 
skin) injections have been fever , chills, hypoalbuminemia, and injection site 
reaction, and skin rash, which at times has been widespread . These localized 
skins reactions are common (occurring in more than 50% o f patients ).  
 
In June 2020 an SAE was filed on a study participant who developed atrial 
fibrillation (a -fib) with no prior history resulting in a hospitalization. W e identified 
a previous case of a patient who developed a-fib while on treatment from a 
different clinical trial that used N -803 weekly to treat relapse. In both cases of 
a-fib, there were other potential explanations that could have triggered the 
arrhythmia. While we cannot directly attribute causality between N -803 and a -
fib, it is at least possible that they are related, directly or indirectly. A -fib may 
be indirectly triggered in susceptible patients by fevers and/or use of diuretics 
for fluid retention that can be observed with some N803 regimens. Based on 
this information, we decided to add the  development of a -fib as a possible rare 
side effect from N -803 in the consent form.

• infection including upper respiratory 
infection  
• atrial fibrillation (a -fib) – may be 
asymptomatic , but when symptoms 
do appear they may includ e irregular 
and often rapid heartbeat, shortness 
of breath, and fatigue  
Tuberculosis is a potential risk of N -803. One instance of tuberculosis has been 
reported in a participant receiving N -803 in combination with BCG (a live, 
attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis ) administered into the bladder by a 
urinary catheter. A cau sal relationship between N -803, in combination with 
BCG, and tuberculosis infection cannot be definitely ruled out.  
 
Anti N -803 antibodies have been detected in subjects receiving N -803. The 
impact of anti -N-803 antibody formation on clinical efficacy and safety of N -803 
is unknown.  
 
Previous editions of the ALT -803 Investigator’s Brochure  prior to 2019  relied 
heavily on clinical experience with the related cytokine therapeutic Proleukin® 
Interleukin -2 to anticipate potential risks associated with ALT-803 ( N-803) 
administration. This approach was based on the fact that N -803 and IL -2 are 
both γ chain cytokines and thus could reasonably be predicted to have similar 
immunostimulatory properties. However, the substantial accumulated 
information on N -803 effects  in humans indicates that many side effects of IL -
2 are not observed in patients  treated with N -803 at the doses being used 
clinically. For this reason, side effects observed in subjects treated with IL -2 but 
not N -803, such as capillary leak syndrome, pul monary dysfunction, acidosis, 
and gastritis, have been removed from the IB and are reflected in this protocol 
and its consent form .

10 Adverse Event Monitoring, Documentation, and Reporting  
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified and graded according to NCI's 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE) and reported on 
the schedule below . A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP 
home page : 
 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40 ). 
 
The following definitions of adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs ) will determine whether th e event requires expedited reporting via the 
OnCore SAE Report Form in addition to routine documentation in the OnCore AE 
case report form (CRF).  
 
The reporting timeframes for SAEs, product related issues,  and other reportable 
events are located in Section 10.6. 
 
Note: Throughout this section the generic term “ study drug” refers  to the study 
related treatment ( N-803 injections).  
10.1 Adverse Event Terminology  
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Serious Adverse Event:   An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in an y of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject

April 14, 2022  Page 35 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Unexpected Event:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or avail able, is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere 
in the current application, as amended .  
 
The categories for AE attribution  to study treatment  are as follows:   
• Definite – clearly related  
• Probable  – likely related  
• Possible – may be related  
• Unlikely – doubtfully related  
• Unrelated – clearly not related  
 
The following definitions are from the Masonic Cancer Center’s Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP) Deviation Reporting:  
 
Major Deviation:  A deviation or v iolation that impacts the risks and benefits 
of the research; may impact subject safety, affect the integrity of research 
data and/or affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the research. 
Deviations that place a subject at risk, but do not result in harm are 
considered to be major deviations.  
 
Minor Deviation:  A deviation or violation that does not impact subject safety, 
compromise the integrity of research data and/or affect a subject’s 
willingness to participate in the research.  
10.2 AE Documentation Requirements  
Adverse event collection for the purposes of this study will focus on events 
felt to be related to N-803 or events that cannot be attributed to other causes 
(i.e. transplant -related, co -morbidities ).  
 
At visit s through the End of Treatment visit a targeted toxicity worksheet 
(Appendix IV) will be completed to document select expected toxicities 
associated with N-803 as follows:  
• Prior to each planned N-803 injection  
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 36 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 • At the end of dose monitoring period (as described in Section 6 .1) 
with ±20 minute window for 2 hour monitoring or ±10 minute window 
for 30 minute monitoring  
• Day 8 and Day 15  visits after 1st dose  only 
• At the End of Treatment visit  
 
In addition, unexpected events and expected events that are not listed in 
Section 9.7 or the consent form or the IB must also be documented.  
 
Note: if a patient is not abiding by the standard of care study calendar 
(Section 8.1 ), collection of the corresponding targeted events also may be 
altered or discontinued on an individual  patient basis, as appropriate.   
 
After the End of  Treatment visit , monitoring for adverse events will become 
less fre quent based on the schedule in Section 8.1 and only events that are 
unexpected and at least possibly related to N-803 will be documented  upon 
knowledge .  
10.3 SAE Documentation  and Reporting  
Any event meeting the definition of an SAE must be  documented using the 
paper  MCC  SAE Report Form.  
 
Any event meeting the definition of serious must be reported to Masonic 
Cancer Center Multisite Program  Manager  within 24 hours of knowledge . 
Refer to Section  10.6. 
10.4 Early Stopping Rule Event Documentation and Reporting Requirements  
The following event count s toward an early study stopping rule and must be 
reported to the MCC Multisite Program Manager using the Event  Form 
found OnCore under the reports tab:  
• Grade III  or IV acute GVHD from the day of first dose of N-803 through 
Day 120 after alloHCT (refer to Appendix I II for grading)  
• Grade 4 and 5 non-relapse toxicity from the day of first dose of N-803 
through  Day 120 after alloHCT 
 
An event  that count s toward an early stopping rule do es not necessarily 
constitute a SAE and should be reported as such only if it meets  the criteria 
for reporting as defined in Section  10.3.

12 Study Endpoints   
12.1 Prim ary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be cumulative incidence of relapse evaluated 
between the day of the first dose of N-803 (approximately 42 days after 
alloHCT , but as late as 60 days ) and two years after  alloHCT.  
12.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include safety and efficacy outcomes listed below.  
• Frequency of adverse and serious adverse events  
• Description of N-803 dose intensity based on the number of doses given 
out of the number planned ( 10 doses)  
• Incidence of relapse at two years after alloHCT stratified by number of 
doses of N -803 (1 -3 or 4 -10). 
• Incidence  of Grade II-IV and Grade III-IV acute /late acute  graft-versus -host-
disease (GVHD) at 100 and 180  days after alloHCT 
• Incidence of chronic  graft-versus -host disease ( GVHD)  at one year after 
alloHCT 
• Incidence of  cytogenetic and flow cytometry positive minimal residual 
disease (MRD) post -transplant (before and after N-803) 
• Overall survival at two years after alloHCT  
• Incidence of non -relapse mortality at two years after alloHCT  
 
 
13 Statistical Considerations  
13.1 Objectives and Study Design  
This is a single -arm, open -label, multi -center phase II trial with discontinuation  
for futility using IL -15 super -agonist complex (N -803) maintenance after 
alloHCT for AML and MDS. The primary objective is to determine if post -
transplant N -803 effectively reduces relapse from a historical estimate of 3 5% 
to 20% in the study cohort as me asured by cumulative incidence of relapse 
MT2016 -07:  Relapse Prophylaxis with N-803 Following RIC Allogeneic Stem Cell for AML and MDS   
 
    
April 14, 2022  Page 43 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 between the 1st dose of N -803 and 2 years  after alloHCT . A total of 60 
subjects will be enrolled if the trial reaches conclusion. An analysis for futility 
will be carried out after 40 patients have been enrolled  (without pause in 
enrollment) . A secondary aim is to achieve this goal without increasing the 
frequency or severity of  graft-versus -host disease (GVHD).  
 
Follow -up for disease status , toxicity, and survival will be done for 2 years 
from alloHCT (i.e., 22 mon ths after 1st administration of N -803). Patients are 
considered evaluable if they receive the first dose of N -803.  
13.2 Statistical Analysis  
Analysis Population  
The primary analysis will be intent -to-treat in that all patients receiving the first 
dose of study  drug will be evaluable for relapse. This single arm study will 
compare the cumulative incidence of relapse of N -803 treated patients to an 
historical controls estimate of 35% at 2 years. This estimate is based on data 
of AML or MDS patients from the Unive rsity of Minnesota as well as data from 
the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research 
(CIBMTR ). 
 
Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
Relapse and non -relapse mortality at 2 years and their respective 95% 
confidence intervals will be calcula ted using the cumulative incidence 
function, considering the other event as a competing risk18. For the final test, 
the incidence of relapse will be compared to the historical estimate of 35% 
using a one sample log -rank test with an assumed exponential distribution for 
the null hypothesis with one -sided alpha = 0. 05. Interim analysis for futility will 
be carried out after 40 patients have been enrolled  (without pause in 
enrollment ). If the cumulative incidence of relapse is projected to be greater 
than 34%, enrollment will be suspended, otherwise enrollment will co ntinue 
until 60 subjects have been  accrued.  
 
Secondary Analysis  
Adverse events, tolerability, immunogenicity and MRD will be tabulated with 
frequencies and percentages. The function of NK cells, T cells, T regulatory 
cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells pre - and post N -803 therapy and 
cytokines will be correlated  with response using the Wilcoxon rank -sum test. 
Overall survival at 2 years and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated 
by the Kaplan -Meier curve19. GVHD and their 95% confidence intervals  will 
be calculated using the cumulative incidence function, with death as a 
competing risk20.

April 14, 2022  Page 44 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
  
Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years and 95% confidence intervals will 
be described for the following subgroups: patients who receive 1 -3 doses of 
N-803, and patients who receive 4 -10 doses of N -803. 
 
All primary and secondary outcomes will be described overall and for each 
donor type. Compar ison of relapse versus historical controls will be made for 
the pooled cohort only.  
13.3 Sample Size and Power  
This study is designed as a Phase II trial to estimate relapse from 42 days to 
2 years post -transplant. We will potentially enroll a total of 60 patients with 
one interim analys is (without pause in enrollment)  at 40 subjects to test for 
futility. Since the goal is to estimate the relapse at a long -term time -point (2 
years), w e ran a simulated exponential model 10,000 times based on 
complete follow -up and a one -sided log -rank test through 2 years with interim 
analysis based on accrual of 40 subjects with incomplete follow -up to 
generate sample size and power estimates.  
 
Based o n interim analysis of the first  40 patients, we will discontinue the trial 
if the projected cumulative incidence curve has an estimate d 2 year relapse 
of >34%. Assuming the null hypothesis of 35% relapse is true, we have a 25-
50% chance of stopping the tri al early due to futility  depending on the rate of 
initial accrual . Assuming the alternative hypothesis of 20% relapse from 42 
days to 2 years, we have an overall power of approximately 80%.  
 
Accrual  
We expect to complete the study after 2 years of enrollment plus 2 years 
follow up after the last enrolled patient.  The study was suspended in October 
2018 to rewrite the protocol using every 4 week N -803 dosing.  The study re -
opened to accrual in May 2019 , but was suspended in March 2020 due to 
COVID -19.  
13.4 Stopping Rules  
We hypothesize that risk of acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) and 
Grade 4 -5 non -relapse toxicity following N-803 treatment could vary by donor 
type. Therefore, there will be  separate stopping rule s for each donor type 
(sibling, umbilical cord blood, unrelated, and haploidentical)21. If a stopping 
rule is met for one donor type, enrollment will be suspended  for that group 
only. Enrollment for all other donor groups may continue  until the maximum 
study size is reached . Note: overall enrollment is irrespective of donor type.

April 14, 2022  Page 45 of 57 CPRC #201 6LS058 
 13.4.1 Grade III-IV acute GVHD  
Grade III -IV acute GVHD between Day 42 and Day 60 has been near 10 % 
in adult alloHCT for AML and MDS . We will stop for unacceptably high 
Grade III -IV acute GVHD when 2/4, 3/9, 4/14, or 5  patients at any time are 
diagnosed in a donor group , from t he day of first dose of N-803 through Day 
120 after allo-HCT. If the true acute GVHD incidence is 10% (expected) , 
there is a 9 % probability of stopping  in a given group . If the true acute GVHD 
incidence is 30% (unacceptable) , there is a 71% probability of stopping, with 
an expected number of 9 patients treated in that group . These expectations  
are base d on an assumed group size of 15, but the group sizes will not be 
fixed.  
13.4.2 Grade 4 and 5 Non -Relapse Toxicity   
Grade 4 and 5  non-relapse  toxicity between Day 42 and Day 60 is expected 
to be near 10% in adult alloHCT for AML and MDS. We will stop for 
unacceptably high Grade 4 and 5  non-relapse toxicity when 2/4, 3/9, 4/14, 
or 5 patients at any time have toxicity in a donor group, from the day of first 
dose of N-803 through Day 60 after alloHCT . If the true incidence of toxicity 
is 10% (expected), there is a 9% probability of stoppin g in a given group. If 
the true incidence is 30% (unacceptable), there is a 71% probability of 
stopping, with an expected number of 9 patients treated in that group. These 
expectations are based on an assumed group size of 15, but the group sizes 
will not be fixed.

 Appendix II – Disease Specific Response Criteria  
 
ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA (AML) RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
Modified RECIST  
Complete Remission (CR)  
CR requires that all of the following be present.  
• Peripheral Blood Counts  
o ANC count > 1,000/mm3 
o Platelet count > 100,000/ mm3 
o Reduced hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit has no bearing on remission status.  
o Leukemic blasts must not be present in the peripheral blood  
• Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy  
o Bone marr ow biopsy must demonstrate trilineage hematopoiesis with maturation of all 
cell lines.  
o < 5% blasts  
• Extramedullary leukemia, such as CNS or soft tissue involvement, must not be present.  
 
Morphological Remission (MR)  
MR requires that the following be present:  
• Patient meets all peripheral blood and bone marrow criteria for CR, except that platelet 
count is < 100,000/mm3 but > 50,000/mm3. 
 
Relapse  
Relapse following CR is defined as:  
• Peripheral Blood Counts  
Presence of peripheral blasts. A bone marrow exa mination must be performed to confirm 
relapse. However, please note that the date of relapse is the first date at which the 
relapsed patient had: leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood smear, or >5% blasts in the 
bone marrow.  
• Bone Marrow Aspirate or Biopsy  
Presence of more than 5% blasts, not attributable to another cause (e.g., bone marrow 
regeneration).

o Persistent dysplasia will be noted  
o Peripheral Blood:  
▪ Hgb > 11g/dl  
▪ Platelets > 100 X 109 /L 
▪ Neutrophils > 1000  
▪ Blasts = 0%  
• Partial Remission (PR) : all CR criteria if abnormal before except:  
o BM blasts decreased by > 50% over pre -treatment but still >5%  
• Marrow CR : Bone marrow with < 5% myeloblasts and decrease by >50% over pretreatment 
with incomplete peripheral blood count normalization  
• Hematologic Improvement (HI):  
o Hgb: Increase by > 1.5g/dl or decreas ed PRBC transfusions by at least 4/8 week 
period (only PRBC given for Hgb<9.0g/dl)  
o Platelet Response:  Absolute increase of > 30 X 109/L for those starting at >20 X 109/L 
For those < 20 X 109/L at baseline increase by 100%.  
o Neutrophil Response: at least 100% increase and an absolute increase of >0.5 X 
109/L 
• Stable Disease:  Failure to achieve at least a PR but no evidence of disease progression for 
>8 weeks  
• Failure: Death during treatment or disease progression characterized by worsening 
cytopenias, increase percentage of marrow blasts, or progression to a more advanced MDS 
FAB subtype  
• Cytogenetic Response:  
o Complete: Disappearance of any pre -treatment chromosomal abnormalities without 
the appearance of new ones  
o Partial: At le ast 50% reduction of chromosomal abnormality  
• Disease Progression : Compared to pre -treatment values  
o Less than 5% blasts: greater than 50% increase to >5% blasts  
o 5-10% blasts: greater than 50% increase to >10% blasts  
o 10-20% blasts: greater than 50% increase to >20% blasts

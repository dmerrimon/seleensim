PROTOCOL TITLE  Molecular -guided therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed 
and refractory childhood cancers  
PROTOCOL NUMBER  NMTRC009  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  Feasibility  
OBJECTIVES  Primary  
Determine feasibility of using tumor samples to assess genomic 
sequencing using predictive modeling to make real -time treatment 
decisions for children with relapsed/refractory cancers  
 
Secondary  
• To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on:  
• Overall response rate (ORR)  
• Progression free survival (PFS)  
• To continue to evaluate the safety of allowing a molecular tumor 
board to determine individualized treatment plans  
• (Voluntary) To explore the relationship between tumor 
phenotype/genotype and response by permitting use of tumor tissue 
in a correlative biologic study  
• To compare PFS interval to PFS intervals of previous 
chemotherapy regimens since relapse for each subject . 
• Sub analysis  examination  of disease types.  
STUDY DESIGN  A prospective open label, multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  
of molecularly guided therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory childhood cancers  
 
A total of 200 evaluable subjects with childhood cancer that are 
refractory to or have relapsed on conventional therapy will be treated 
with molecular guided therapy.  Additional patients may enroll through 
compassionate access if no other treatment options are available.  
 
Subjects will be evaluated in 3 strata:  
• Stratum 1 : 50 subjects with refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma 
• Stratum 2 : 50 subjects with relapsed or refractory brain tumors  
• Stratum 3 : 100 subjects with refractory or relapsed rare tumors  
 
Guided therapy will allow the use of individualized therapeutic 
combinations (up to 4 agents). All subjects will be followed for 
survival, disease response, progression and safety.  All subjects will be 
treated according to the discretion of the treating oncologist and study 
committee (minimum 3 oncologists and one pharmacist). Extent of 
disease will be measured and assessed for changes throughout the 
course of the study.

1 Background  
 
1.1 Study Disease 
 
Relapsed or refractory  neuroblastoma, brain tumors, and rare childhood tumors.  
 
1.2 Rationale  
 
Lethality of Relapsed/Refractory Pediatric Cancers  is an Unmet Clinical Need . 
 
Although improvements in the past 40 years have led to markedly improved survival rates of 
approximately 80% overall for pediatric cancers, patients with relapsed, rare and advanced stage 
tumors still have a very poor prognosis. Soft tissue sarcomas account for ~ 7% of pediatric 
cancers, with 850 -900 new cases annually in the United States [1] .  Rhabdomyosarcoma, the most 
common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, affects nearly 350 children in the United States each year [1].  Patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma have a poor prognosis with an overall survival rate of ~30% [2]. The non- rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas affect ~500 
children each year.  Patients with metastatic non -rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas have 
long- term survival < 20% [3] .  Malignant bone tumors (mainly Ewing’s Sarcoma and 
Osteosarcoma) account for 6% of childhood cancers, with ~400 cases of osteosarcoma and 200 
cases of Ewing’s Sarcoma diagnosed annually [1]. Patients with localized osteosarcoma, who 
have a poor response to pre -operative chemotherapy have a survival rate of around 50%, while 
patients with metastatic osteosarcoma or Ewing’s sarcoma disease at presentation, have a survival 
of < 20% [4, 5] .  Renal cancers account for ~6% of pediatric cancer diagnoses, with 95% of cases 
being Wilms Tumor, which has a very favorable prognosis [1].  However, rare and high risk renal 
tumors such as metastatic anaplastic Wilms tumor, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell 
carcinoma, and malignant rhabdoid tumor have an inferior outcome, with survival of < 20% [6, 
7]. For all these patients survival remains poor, despite use of dose -intensified multi- agent 
chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Therefore, new approaches such as targeted therapies are warranted.  
 
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, with approximately 700 
new diagnoses per year . It accounts for 7% to 10% of childhood cancers [8, 9] .  Whereas the 
prognosis for infants with neuroblastoma is generally good, currently only 30% of children 
diagnosed after 12- 15 months of age survive despite aggressive multimodal therapies [10, 11] .  
Even with high- dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed
 by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT) and maintenance therapy with retinoic acid the 5 -year event -free survival remains below 
50% [12, 13] .  Long- term survival of patients who are treated with conventional therapies 
following relapse is <5%. As such, neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths in the United States [14] . Consequently, the evaluation of
 new drugs is strongly needed in this 
disease.  
 
Recent evidence has established the genetic heterogeneity of neuroblastoma  and revealed the 
existence of several major molecular subsets that collectively may provide prognostic value for future disease management [15]  [16]. While the poor prognosis for older neuroblastoma patients 
underscores the need for new treatment strategies, the elucidation of specific biologic subsets of neuroblastoma suggests a way to improve disease management. The current standard- of-care 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 21 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  treatments for relapsed neuroblastoma include a variety of Phase II or Phase I studies that 
generally have only modest response rates (10% -35%) [11]. Even in responding patients, tumors 
often go on to further rapid relapses and novel strategies to treat this patient population are 
urgently needed. There are currently few treatment options from which pediatric oncologists can 
select with any degree of confidence to improve the management of multiply recurrent 
neuroblastoma patients. The current strategy is to add salvage therapies based on the anecdotal 
experience of the treating physician, which often lead s to drug- related toxicity but may or may 
not extend life. The identification of agents that target specific molecular pathways associated with the development and/or progression of neoplastic diseases holds promise. Improved 
approaches that identify in a more rational (data- driven) fashion combinations of existing agents 
that are likely to be effective should result in a survival benefit in the clinical setting, while 
avoiding the toxicity associated with agents that are unlikely to be beneficial. [17] . 
 
CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, with 3000- 4000 new diagnoses each 
year. CNS tumors account for approximately 25- 30% of all childhood cancers. Though many of 
these CNS tumors are quite treatable, the 5 -year survival for pediatric CNS tumors is only 
71%[18]. Patients who have relapsed and refractory CNS tumors are those most likely to 
succumb to their disease, in spite of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, often followed by HSCT [19, 20] . Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed for control of CNS tumors.  
 There is a growing focus on treating CNS tumors based on the biology of the disease [21, 22]  
rather than with “one size fits all” therapy. Risk stratification in CNS tumors based on biology is 
increasingly understood to be a priority. For example, medulloblastoma has been broken into 4 
biologic categories with different genetic mutations and different clinical outcomes [23-25]. 
Similar to neuroblastoma, these differences in the biology and clinical outcome of patients with 
medulloblastoma suggest new strategies to improve disease management. Ongoing clinical trials 
of upfront therapy for medulloblastoma are attempting to incorporate molecularly guided 
therapies. The current standard -of-care treatments for relapsed CNS tumors include Phase I and 
Phase II therapies that often have few, if any, responding patients [26, 27] . Again reflecting the 
challenges in neuroblastoma, responding patients with high grade CNS tumors often experience multiple relapses and are in dire need of novel treatment strategies. Improved approaches that can 
inform treatment regimens based on the biology of the disease could result in a survival benefit in 
this challenging patient population.  
 
Molecular Networks as the Drug Target .  
It is now firmly established that cancer results from perturbations in the molecular networks 
within cellular systems that disturb the normal homeostatic state [ 28-30]. Fluctuations in these 
networks can result from genetic or epigenetic cellular events and/or changes in the molecular 
constitution of the tumor microenvironment, which collectively dictate the phenotype of the 
biological system. The molecular networks engaged during tumor development and/or 
progression are complex. Molecular networks have evolved to provide the ultimate level of 
cellular plasticity, allowing cells to adapt to or exploit extracellular cues within the local milieu 
[31]. The complexity of a tumor system is further exaggerated by the inherent genomic instability 
seen in many neoplasms, which leads to an accelerated micro -evolutionary process that results in 
further cellular and tumor sub- system heterogeneity [ 32, 33]. This variability combined with the 
adaptability of many molecular pathways provides a somewhat predictable and highly probable path to resistance for any given agent that targets a subset of cellular systems within a tumor’s 
molecular and genetic repertoire [ 34]. A fundamental challenge in the area of targeted cancer 
treatment is how to identify optimal therapeutic combinations that can treat heterogeneous tumors that are both highly adaptive and that exhibit significant inter - and intra -patient variation [ 28, 35-
37]. Our proposal outlines an approach by which we can utilize our expanding knowledge of 
molecular networks and the mechanisms of action of a growing pharmacopeia [38, 39] in 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 22 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  conjunction with standardized biomarker assessments to deliver targeted combinations of 
effective therapies to pediatric cancer  patients.  
 
Practice and Promise of Biomarkers for Patient Treatment Planning . 
A panel of individual biomarkers has recently been identified that can be used in the clinical 
setting to identify neuroblastoma patients most likely to respond to a specific therapy. For 
example, activation of the ALK gene through sequence variation mutations has been identified in 
a subset of neuroblastoma patients, and small -molecule inhibition of the ALK -encoded receptor 
tyrosine kinase caused cytotoxicity in affected neuroblastoma cell lines [ 40]. Such studies, in 
conjunction with a large body of in vitro and in vivo data, have further demonstrated that the 
efficacy of specific treatment modalities is dependent upon the molecular constitution of the 
tumor, and that the observed variations in tumor response to current therapies is attributable in 
large part to disease heterogeneity at the molecular level.  
 
While individual biomarkers may be predictive of responses to specific therapies, especially in 
the context of front -line treatment, a different approach to the management of patients with 
refractory disease is needed in order to identify effective treatments from the catalog of available 
agents. Advances in informatics and molecular technologies, coupled with our expanding 
knowledge of molecular networks and mechanism of action of the existing pharmacopeia, 
provide a great opportunity in translational medicine to develop a model that more accurately 
predicts tumor response. The studies outlined in this proposal are a step in the development of 
personalized oncology, in which each patient is truly treated individually based upon the 
systematic molecular analysis of their disease. Our project is focused on testing the merits of a 
specific data- driven predictive method through which any number of drugs in our current 
knowledge base has a chance of being recommended, of these only the FDA approved drugs 
listed in Appendix III will be used. Although this novel approach to personalized therapeutics 
brings with it to the concern that toxicities that may arise from novel combinations of agents, it is 
strongly felt by the investigators that the logical interpretation of molecular data by a committee 
of highly qualified physicians and pharmacist s in order to identify drug candidates for 
consideration in the treatment of a patient population with few alternative options is a worthwhile 
endeavor. The systematic biomarker -driven approach outlined in this proposal, by tailoring a 
combination of drugs targeting the specific molecular composition of a tumor —irrespective of 
tumor classification or anatomical origin — provides a feasible alternative to the conventional 
approach that targets specific organs or tissues without consideration of the underlying tumor 
biology.  
 
 
A Pilot Trial Testing the Feasibility of using Molecular -Guided Therapy in Patients with 
Refractory or Recurrent Neuroblastoma.  
 
The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of using predictive 
modeling based on genome -wide mRNA expression profiles of neuroblastoma tumor biopsies to 
make real -time treatment decisions.  Feasibility was defined as the completion of the following in 
a two week time period: tumor biopsy, quality RNA extraction, mRNA U133 2+ Affymetrix gene chip hybridization, analysis utilizing a series of predictive meth odologies, report generation, 
tumor board review with formulated treatment plan, and medical monitor review.  Subjects were 
not treated on this study.  There were 5 subject s enrolled between April -June 2010 with multiply 
relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Subject s had received between 2 -13 previous relapsed 
therapies and were between 2 -6.5 years post diagnosis. All subject s had soft tissue disease which 
was able to be biopsied. All biopsies were adequate by pathology evaluation (>75% viable tumor) 
and RNA quality (>6.5 RIN). Gene chips were completed in 3- 7 days, report generation was 1- 5 
days, tumor board was 1- 3 days, medical monitor sign off was 1 day. The total time was 10- 12 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 23 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  days for all subject s. The tumor board which consisted of 4- 10 pediatric oncologists from sites 
across the US and a pediatric oncology pharmacist was able to create individualized therapy 
regimens for all subject s. Correlative biology specimens were obtained and grown in culture. 
Mice xenografts of 3 /5 subject s were establ ished. Cultures and xenografts are able to be  used for 
validation studies of predicted drug sensitivity.  In conclusion i t is feasible to obtain real- time 
genomic profiling for molecularly guided therapy for use in treatment decision making.  
 
 
A Feasibility Trial using Molecular -Guided Therapy in Patients with Refractory or 
Recurrent Neuroblastoma.  
 
The primary objective of this feasibility  study was to evaluate the feasibility  and safety  of using 
predictive modeling based on genome -wide mRNA expression profiles of neuroblastoma tumor 
biopsies to make real -time treatment decisions.  Feasibility was defined as “enrollment onto 
study, quality mRNA obtained, gene chip completed, tumor board held, medical monitor review 
and approval, start of treatment by 21 days post biopsy/surgical resection date, and completion of 
1 cycle of therapy.” Sixteen (16)  subjects were enrolled to this study, all with multiply relapsed or 
refractory neuroblastoma. Subjects were between 1 -11 years post diagnosis. All subjects had soft 
tissue disease which was able to be biopsied. All biopsies were adequate by pathology evaluation 
(>75% viable tumor) and RNA quality (>6.5 RIN). 2 subjects were deemed ineligible due to 
tumor type after biopsy. Gene chips were completed in 3 -8 days (95% CI: 3.8 –  6.8), report 
generation took 0- 3 days (95% CI: 0.0 – 1.5), tumor board took 1- 6 days (95% CI: 1.6 – 4.2), 
medical monitor sign off took 1- 2 days (95% CI: 0.8 –  1.4). The total time from date of biopsy to 
tumor board was 6- 11 days (95% CI: 7.5 –  10.2) for all subjects and 7- 20 days to treatment (95% 
CI: 8.9 –  16.1) , with an average of 12.4 days . The tumor board which consisted of 4- 15 pediatric 
oncologists from sites across the US and a pediatric oncology pharmacist was able to create 
individualized therapy regimens for all subjects. Correlative biology specime ns were obtained 
and grown in culture. Mice xenograft establishment is ongoing. Cultures and xenografts are able 
to be used for validation studies of predicted drug sensitivity. Triplicate biopsies showed 
reproducible sets of drugs and the comparatively large differences in drug lists between patients 
show that the drug lists are tailored to patients. Comparison of RNA expression profiles with 
RNA sequencing from each patient showed strong correlation.  
 
The study endpoint show ed that 14/14 patients were feasible to enroll, biopsy, genomic analysis, 
tumor board review and patient treatment was met. All regimens were found to be safe by the 
medical monitor proving that the molecular tumor board was able to make safe decisions similar 
to hospital tumor boards making treatment decisions without molecular information on the 
patients. It was felt that the pharmacy review for evaluating drug- drug interactions and deciding 
on laboratory and safety testing was an important part of the tumor board (this is not usually present at hospital tumor boards) and will continue to be incorporated in this and future trials.   
All patients tolerated therapy well and were treated without any serious adverse events related to 
study drugs.  Clinical benefit was seen 64% of patients.   This study shows that it is feasible to 
create therapeutic treatment plans based on genomic profiling in real time and that patients are able to be treated safely on a tumor board derived molecular guided therapy using existing 
medications  
 
 
In this study w e proposed to study reproducibility by applying it to triplicate samples obtained by 
dissecting each of five solid tumors. The primary goal of the reproducibility study is to evaluate the variation among sets of drug therapies associated with the same tumor. Secondary goals are 1) 
to compare the variation among sets of drug therapies from the same tumor with variation 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 24 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  between tumors from distinct patients and 2) to evaluate variation associated with earlier steps in 
the process, in particular, expression profiles and comparative expression profiles.  
   
  
Distance- based nonparametric multivariate 
analysis of variance [41, 42]  allowed us to reject the null hypothesis that variation between 
biopsies can be accounted for by the variation within biopsies (p=0.001). That the variation 
among expression profiles associated with the same biopsy is small compared with the variation 
between expression profiles associated with different biopsies is apparent from Princi pal 
Component Analysis (Figure 1).  
 Sets of drug therapies  
Similarly, the variation among drug sets associated with the same biopsy is small compared with 
the variation among drug lists associated with different biopsies (p=0.001). The reproducibility 
averaged over patients, replicates, and drugs is 0.68.  As the threshold score increases the reproducibility increases to 1 (Figure  2). 
 A Feasibility Trial using Molecular -Guided Therapy in Patients with Relapsed and 
Refractory Childhood Cancer.  
 The primary objective of this study was  to determine feasibility of using tumor samples to  assess 
genomic mRNA expression arrays and DNA Mutation Panels using predictive modeling to make real-time treatment decisions for children with relapsed/refractory cancers.   Feasibility was 
defined as “enrollment onto study, RNA expression profile completed, DNA Mutation Panel 
completed, genomic analysis and report generation, tumor board held with treatment decision, 
treatment review completed and start of treatment by 21 days post biopsy/surgical resection date,  
Figure 1 Principal Component Analysis . The first 
three principal component scores, PC1-PC3,  
illustrate the observation that the variation 
associated with the six samples for each biopsy (all of which have the same symbol and color) is 
small relative to the variation between biopsies.

Conclusion  
Collectively, the early preclinical and current  clinical data suggests that this integrated approach 
is highly feasible  and safe in pediatric cancers  and that it is reproducible among repeat samples 
within patients.  Based upon the significant need for a more rational -based approach to therapeutic 
select ion in these difficult to treat pediatric tumors  continued development of this approach is 
warranted . The area of genomic analysis is advancing rapidly and recently DNA exomes and 
RNA sequencing are now available by CLIA certified laboratories. We have adapted our analysis 
to move from RNA expression profiling to RNA sequencing and DNA mutation panel to DNA 
exomes. This will be evaluated in this study for use by the molecular tumor board in treatment 
decision making.

2.3 Subject  Enrollment and Sample Procurement and Data Processing  
Eligible subject s will be enrolled onto this study at each site following a registration process that 
includes receipt of a signed subject  consent form and a copy of the required baseline laboratory 
tests. Subject s will undergo a scheduled surgical resection and/or diagnostic biopsy procedure. 
Common sample identifiers will be provided by the NMTRC Lead Study Coordinator to the 
participating site and will be used by all parties throughout the project to ensure s ample, data and 
report alignment between participating organizat ions.  At the time of tissue resection or biopsy, 
fresh tumor samples  and a blood sample  will be committed for this specific research study 
(referred to as “Primary Samples”), and prepared immediately per Appendix II and section 9. 3. 
Primary Samples will be sent to Ashion Analytics, LLC , which is a CLIA -certified laboratory 
housed at the Translational Genomics Reserach Institute ( TGen ). Samples will be reviewed by 
local pathology to confirm  that the sample sent to TGen contains  >50% tumor  cell viability  
which is the minimum required for successful analysis . The absence of an adequate tumo r 
specimen from an enrolled subject  will make them  not eligible  to continue on the study.  Tumor

 Upon arr ival of the tumor specimens at Ashion  and the Sholler Pediatric Oncology Translational 
Research Laboratory , the samples will be logged and immediately processed according to details 
in Section 9 . 
2.4 DNA and RNA Sequencing  
 
Sequencing for this study will be performed at Ashion Analytics, LLC (Ashion).  Ashion is a 
CLIA -certified laboratory developed by TGen in order to perform whole exome and RNA 
sequencing in a clinical laboratory to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and quality of the data. The 
sequencing will be performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencer. Quality thresholds will 
include metrics such as base calling quality, coverage, allelic read percentages, stran d bias, and 
alignment quality. Once data has passed all QC thresholds, t he de -identified data will be 
preprocessed and  uploaded directly to the NMTRC TransMed software for creation of the 
NMTRC Drug Prediction Report.  
 
Data Flow  
At enrollment in the study, a patient record will be created and the tumor and blood samples for the patient will be given a sample identifier and stored in the NMTRC laboratory management 
database (LIMS). The samples, tagged with the LIMS sample identifier, will then be sent to the 
CLIA laboratory in Phoenix, A Z.  Once there, whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing 
will be performed on the tumor sample. Whole exome sequencing will also be performed on a blood sample from the patient. For exome sequencing, fastq files are aligned with BWA 0.6.2 to 
GRCh37.62 and the SAM output are converted to a sorted BAM file using samtools 0.1.18. BAM 
files are subjected to indel realignment, mark duplicates, and recalibration steps in this order with GATK 2.2 where dpsnp135 is used for known SNPs and 1000 Genomes’ 
ALL.wgs.low_coverage_vqsr.20101123 is used for known indels. Lane level sample BAMs are 
then merged with Picard 1.79 if they are sequenced across multiple lanes. Variant calling is done 
with Unified Genotyper and the output VCF files are recalibrated with VariantRecalibrator from 
GATK 2.2. SnpEff 3.0, and SnpSift 1.7 is then used to annotate these VCF files with database 
version GRCh37.66.For RNA sequencing, lane level fastq files are appended together if they are 
across multiple lanes. These fastq files are then aligned with TopHat 2.0.6 to GRCh37.62 using 
ensembl.63.genes.gtf as GTF file and the resulting BAM files are assembled with Cufflinks 2.0.2 
using the same GTF file and ensembl.63.genes.MASK.gtf as the mask file. HTSeq 0.5.3 is used 
to count the number of reads spanning each gene. Changes in transcript expression are calculated with Cuffdiff 2.0.2. For novel fusion discovery, reads were trimmed to 50 base pairs and then 
aligned with TopHat -Fusion 2.0.6. At the completion of RNA Sequencing, two files will be 
produced that will be consumed by the personalized medicine reporting engine. The first of these 
files is a VCF file that specifies the variants that were observed in the tumor sample. The second 
file is an FPKM file that specifies the expression levels of genes in the tumor sample. Both of 
these files will be in the VCF 4.1 format -  an example of the VCF 4.1 format for expression is 
shown in the appendix.  At the completion of the whole exome sequencing, a single file VCF file 
containing the variants for the tumor sample and identifying them as either somatic or germ line 
by comparison to the normal blood sequence. The tumor variants will be in VCF4.1 spec 
generated by Seurat 2.5.  An example of a variant (for the V600E mutation of BRAF) is shown in 
the appendix below where AR is allele ratio, DP1 is depth of normal, DP2 is depth of tumor, LN1 
is length.  The effect of the variant is extracted with the following regular expressions, regex is 
EFF=/ \((.*)\ )/.

Issued 10 January 2017  Patient data captured on the Ashion  server is encrypted and pushed via a file transfer server  (FTP)  
for secure delivery of data to authorized NMTRC study personnel. The LIMS system contains a 
file detection system that will identify when samples are made available on the FTP site. These 
files, tagged with the sample identifiers will be pulled from the FTP site and imported into the 
LIMS system. The LIMS system will then process the three files into a personalized medicine 
report as described in the algorithms section.  
 
2.5 NMTRC Drug prediction report  
 
The following describes  the NMTRC report generation  which utilizes data generated from 
Ashion  (as described in section 2.4  above).  
 
 
Predicted Therapeutic Compounds:  At this time, there are currently greater than 200 drugs 
within the NMTRC drug library each with previously defined  or inferred  molecular target s.  For 
the purposes of this protocol, the tumor board will only use the drugs listed in Appendix III.  
 Algorithms    
 
There will be three drug matching algorithms utilized in this molecularly guided therapy protocol.  
 
1. Direct variant/drug matching  
2. Inferred variant/drug matching  
3. Expression of biomarkers/drug targets (biomarker expression)  
The algorithms are described in detail below. Although there will not be formal ranking of the 
drug calls, there are different levels of confidence in the three algorithms and as such, the drugs 
will be listed in the report in the order of the confidence in the algorithms that identified them as 
candidate therapies for the patient (Direct variant first, followed by inferred variants, followed by 
biomarker expression). This is because sequence variants (whether direct or inferred) provide stronger evidence of tumor dependence than simple gene expression calls, with direct 
drug/variant relationships being the highest confidence of all three.  Within the biomarker 
expression, the drugs will be listed in descending order from most to least differentially 
expressed.  
 
Variant drug matching  
 
The NMTRC LIMS system has a database that contains a table linking drugs, variants, and genes 
with evidence from peer reviewed literature. The patient's tumor variants from the VCF files 
produced by Ashion  are linked to the variants and genes in this table to identify potential 
therapies. This matching provides the output for direct variant/drug matching and inferred variant 
drug/matching. The inferred and direct refer to the strength of the evidence supporting the 
relationship between the drug and the variant. The first level of confidence, direct evidence 
indicates that the literature indicates that 1) the variant has been directly associated with a change in response to the therapy (either becoming more sensitive or more resistant) and the gene is the 
target of the drug or 2) the variant has been directly shown to activate the pathway for which the 
drug is a target or 3) the variant has been associated with changes in response to the drug due to 
indirect mechanism including but not limited to transportation or metabolism. Evidence of direct 
activation of the drug target by the variant is considered a sensitivity indicator, unless there is 
specific evidence that the variant induces resistance to the drug. The second level of confidence, 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 28 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  inferred evidence, indicates that the variant is in a gene that is a direct target of a drug and is 
computationally predicted to have biological impact in the gene, but the variant has not been 
directly associated with changes in response to drug or activation of target.  For inferred variants the variant must be a somatic mutation (present in the tumor only) and also have a minor allele 
frequence from the 1000 genomes project which is less than 0.5%.Whether the evidence is direct 
or inferred will be indicated by a column in the report. The evidence that resulted in the drug selection will be provided as a hyperlink in the table.  
 Biomarker Expression  
 The third algorithm utilizes the gene expression as measured by RNASeq. A consistent step for 
the NMTRC methodologies outlined in this proposal is the conversion of normalized probe set 
intensities to a relative measure of transcript abundance.  We utilize a standardized z- score 
method (described below in Signal Pre -Preprocessing and Z -Score Calculation) to determine 
statistically significant differences in each sample relative to a whole body reference and relative to cancer reference.  This method assigns a z- score to each probe set based upon the number of 
standard deviations from the normal sample population mean.  This provides a good assessment 
of transcript “differences” relative to a whole body reference or cancer reference sets which may 
not necessarily be associated with large fold changes in transcript expression. Having established a consistent data input of relative transcript abundance in each subject ’s tumor specimen, the 
following analytical methods will be applied to the standardized data to predict drug efficacy.  
 The method is fundamentally very straightforward. There are two classes of expression rules. The first of these rules are biomarker rules and are of the type “ overexpression of gene g1 implies 
sensitivity (or insensitivity) to drug d1” or “underexpression of gene g2 implies sensitivity (or 
insensitivity) to drug d2” whereas the second is “g3 is the target of drug d3, thus overexpression of g3 implies sensitivity to d3 ”. The NMTRC LIMS contains a database of drugs and the genes 
along with a column that implies whether over or under expression of that gene indicates 
sensitivity (or insensitivity)  to the drug and the evidence for that rule. In order for a gene to be 
called over or underexpressed a method is required to identify calls. This is described in more 
detail in the next section.  
Gene expression calls  
 
Two distinct perspectives are consistent with using over - or underexpression to guide therapy but 
suggest different sets of reference samples and different statistical tests. If gene expression level 
is interpreted to reflect sensitivity of a cell to a drug then elevated (alternatively, depressed) 
expression should be anomalous  by comparison with normal cells throughout the body (the whole 
body normal reference). The drug should then kill the tumor cells before it kills normal cells. We call elevated (depressed) expression relative to samples of the whole body N ormal Reference 
using a standard score ( Z-score), referred to as the NRZ.  
In contrast, if gene expression level in a cancer cell is interpreted as reflecting comparative drug sensitivity among cancer cells then elevated expression should be called based on its rank among 
other cancer samples (the cancer reference). We call elevated (alternatively, depressed) 
expression relative to the Cancer Reference based on the C umulative distribution, referred to as 
the CRC statistic.  
We report indications based on both the NRZ and CRC, based on only the NRZ, and based on 
only the CRC. For each such indication we report both the NRZ and the CRC.

deviation of 𝑋𝑋. The NRZ is consistent with the statistic we used previously for microarray -based 
expression measurements. We use a threshold of 2, that is, NRZ> 2 indicates overexpression NRZ 
< -2 indicates underexpression. The normal reference set comprises 42 normal tissues, organized 
into 21 tissue types: Adrenal Gland, Brain, Bronchus, Corpus uteri, Corpus Uteri, Esophagus, 
Gland, Heart, Large Intestine, Liver, Lymph Node, Nipple, Prostate Gland, Salivary Gland, 
Skeletal Muscle, Skin, Small Intestine, Spleen, Testis, Tonsil, Uterus. Many (28) of the samples are also given a sub -type designation, for example, Brain: Hippocampus .

𝑠𝑠𝐶𝐶 is the standard 
score for the query by comparison with cancer case 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋�𝑖𝑖 is the mean associated with samples 
from case 𝑖𝑖  , and 𝑠𝑠𝐶𝐶 is the sample standard deviation, obtained from 𝐶𝐶. CRC estimates the 
proportion of cancer samples that are less extreme than the query, that is, a higher CRC indicates 
more strongly for treatment based on the rule. For example, with an overexpression rule, CRC = 1 
means that expression in the query sample was higher than in all cancer reference samples by at 
least 2 standard deviations. We have chosen to call samples that are in the top quartile 
(CRC>0.75) as elevated or depressed in expression.  We also identify genes support by both NRZ 
and CRC when NRZ > 2 and CRC > 0.5.  
In contrast to the use of the use of the NRZ, with which the objective is to call anomalous 
expression, comparison with the cancer reference requires estimating the quantile associated with 𝑋𝑋
𝑞𝑞. The proportion of cancer samples that express a gene at a level below the query sample might 
be estimated using the empirical cumulative distribution function, for example, in the case of 
overexpression 
𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖∈𝐶𝐶�𝑋𝑋𝑞𝑞>𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖�. 
However, variation arises as a result of biological differences between tumors and as a result of 
differences in observations of the same tumor. If all tumors were biologically identical with 
respect to expression of a gene then quantiles would reflect exclusively the observation and 
variation would not be relevant.   Since our cancer reference set includes samples representing pediatric oncology tumors  we can estimate the variation within  cancer case and therefore estimate 
the proportion of cancer cases for which expression of the gene falls significantly below (overexpression) or above (underexpression) the query.  
Report : 
The process of report generation begins when all of the sequencing data is available on the FTP server. If gene matches gene in the database then aberration is checked. For each gene/variant that 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 30 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  matches a rule in the rules database, a row will be generated in the report. All variants supported 
by direct evidence will be listed first in the report indicating their greater clinical significance and 
an indication that the relationship is supported by direct evidence. If an aberration meets the 
criteria for an inferred indicator of drug response (described in the algorithms section) it will 
generate a line in the report which indicates that the relationship between the drug and gene is 
inferred. For each differentially expressed biomarker indicating/not indicating, a line will 
be generated in the report. For all rows in the report there will be a link to the PubMed article that 
supports the identified aberration/drug relationship. The set of rules will be in a read only 
database that will be inaccessible for changes during the trial.  
The software has been validated to show that:  
1. 100% reproducible output given the same input.   
2. Simple yet sophisticated rules management.   
3. Cross reference data with several open source data sets.  
4. Generation of a clinically understandable, actionable report.  
Positive mutation findings from the whole exome and RNA sequencing will be verified using Sanger Sequencing. While all attempts will be made to have this data available to the tumor board, due to the potential length of time to process Sanger Sequencing samples, these results 
may not be available until after the tumor board has met and the patient has started protocol 
treatment. If Sanger Sequencing results differ from the original sequencing, the results and the 
subject has already started protocol treatment, this information will be communicated to the 
treating site Principal Investigator who will then communicate this information to the patient and 
a mutual decision about continued treatment will be made.  
3 Treatment Protocol Decision  
3.1 Decision Making Rules for Treatment Regimens  
Treatments protocols will be generated from the molecular tumor board meeting utilizing the 
information contained in a report generated on the basis of genomic analysis of the gene 
expression profile of the subject ’s tumor. The molecular tumor board consists of pediatric 
oncologists, pharmacists, bioinformations, genomicists, and pathologists  (as available).   Specific 
treatment details will consist of a regimen chosen from a guided list of agents implicated in 
critica l molecular signaling pathways  summarized in the guided therapy report s and may include 
one standard chemotherapy agent  not included on the report . All agents are listed in the current 
FDA approved pharmacopoeia  with age appropriate dosing, but will differ amongst individual 
subject s. 
3.1.1 Decision  rules for the committee will include:  
1. All drugs with predicted efficacy will be reported to the tumor board . At this time, FDA 
approved and over the counter medications  predicted by one of the different predictive 
methodologies under evaluation will be included. For the se panel s the analytical methods 
are independently applied to the standardized and normalized (relative to whole body and 
cancer reference set s) gene sequencing data derived from the profiling of each subject ’s 
tumor. Each method is associated with an objective statistical threshold that must be 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 31 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  exceeded in order for a specific drug to be predicted and reported for consideration. 
Molecular -based predictions of drug efficacy will be supplemented with evidence 
gathered from searching of the literature, clinical trials and the internet.  
2. Drugs must be FDA approved or available over the counter with established standard and safe age appropriate dosing schedules .  
3. Potential drug choices will be analyzed with regards to safety, mechanism, availability 
and cost. Focus will be on low -toxicity, targeted therapies.  
4. Drug combinations will be allowed, up to a maximum of 4 agents. Literature searches will be conducted to assemble data on previously established and tested regimens. These 
regimens will be given priority.  
5.  A pharmacist will analy ze potential drug interactions between the guided agents and the 
subject’s routine medications and supplements. F or drug interactions and known 
toxicities the following databases will be used: MicroMedex LexiComp, Facts and 
Comparisons , Natural Medicines Database.  
Subject s’ history and previously received treatments will be reviewed. Drugs which a subject  
has failed will be given low priority and used only if there is a rationale for synergy in 
combination therapy.  
3.1.2 Recommended  priorities for determining drug dosing to be used in individualized 
treatment plans include the following:  
1. For a given proposed individualized combination of drugs the first priority to establish 
doses will be to identify the same combination of drugs in a peer -reviewed journal article 
or presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an ongoing peer -reviewed clinical 
trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  
2. When a proposed individualized combination of drugs has not previously been reported, 
the process to establish doses will be to then identify individual members of the proposed 
combination that have been used in combination with other cytotoxic agents similar to 
those being considered for combination therapy. The source of information will be a 
peer-reviewed journal article or presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an 
ongoing peer -reviewed clinical trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  
3. When a proposed individualized combination of drugs have no available combination 
data, dosing guidelines will start with the MTD determined from a phase I/II pediatric 
study.  Reference information will be based upon either a peer -reviewed journal article or 
presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an ongoing peer -reviewed clinical 
trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  Doses will be reduced to compensate for potential 
additive toxicities of combination agent s.  
Please note that many of the drugs that will be considered for proposed individualized combination therapy in this protocol are not considered cytotoxic agents and therefore will not have previously been specifically tested as part of conventional antineoplastic protocols. 
Examples of these medications may include anti -seizure or anti -cholesterol agents. These non-
cytotoxic agents will be used at standard doses based on recommendations of an experienced pediatric pharmacis t and described pharmacy programs that are used to evaluate potential 
interactions and combina tion dosing for all medications . The final treatment regimen  will be 
subjected to a 12 hour in depth review and evaluation for safety and then be signed  off by one of 
the protocol pharmacist s. The treatment memo  will then be discussed with the subject  and their 
parents  (if the subject is < 18 years of age) .

Issued 10 January 2017  3.2 Additional Biopsies : 
 
Subjects that are having additional biopsies done as standard of care during the course of the 
study, when deemed appropriate by study PI, may complete the study process again and have new reports generated on the latest tumor. A new tumor board discussion will occur utilizing all rules 
of this protocol and the new reports. The subject may then change treatment regimens based on 
the decision  of the tumor board. All protocol requirements and specifications will be followed as 
if it were a new biopsy.  
 
3.3 Safety Evaluations  
The principal investigator and the study chairs will evaluate  reported  serious adverse events  and 
other toxicities in real time.  Study chair and PI meetings will occur at least monthly. The principal investigator will meet with the clinical research team at frequent and regularly scheduled intervals to determine treatment modifications and treatment based toxicities.  
 
Any safety concern or new information that might affect either the safety or the ethical conduct of 
this trial will be immediately forwarded to the study chairs in written form.  The NMTRC will be 
responsible for informing the central IRB and DSMB.  If trends in toxicities are noted or stopping 
rules are met, the study chair  will temporar ily suspend enrollment while reviewing the episodes 
with the DSMB.  The DSMB will convene every 6 months for evaluation of all safety data.  
 
Study will be on hold for  safety monitoring by DSMB review when : 
1. Any deaths deemed related to the study drug by the treating PI w hile on study or 
occurring less than 30 days after medications ended or 2 serious adverse events 
possibly related to protocol within 60 days.  
2. Any other reason that the NMTRC feels it is in the best safety interest of the subjects.  
Subject s will be required to either come off study or be dose reduced per treating physician 
standard of care if one of the following toxicities  related to treatment  regimen occurs. Toxicity 
will be graded according to the NCI -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE  
v4.0).  
 
 Non-Hematologic toxicity:  
∙ ≥Grade 3 non- hematological toxicity not resolved to <Grade 2 or baseline 
within 2 weeks excluding nausea, vomiting, anorexia, hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities corrected with oral supplementation. 
 
 
 Hematologic toxicity:  
∙ Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥14 days;  
 
∙ Grade 4 neutropenia with Grade 4 infection

At the times indicated in Section 4 and the Table of Procedures and Assessments , scans will be 
obtained to evaluate response data for subject s enrolled in this study. Efficacy will be assessed 
according to criteria outlined in Section 6 ( Efficacy Asses sments ) to evaluate the activity and 
potential benefit of the chosen treatment s protocol in this subject  population.  
 
3.5 Biological Studies   
Subject s will have an opportunity to participate in correlative biological studies on a voluntary 
basis. This study will be used to correlate in vivo and in vitro predictive drug responses.  This 
study may be able to contribute to our knowledge of molecular determinants of response to 
therapy and/or development of biomarkers to help guide future therapy.  
 
 
3.6 Treatment during waiting period  
Subject s will be allowed to receive one cycle of standard of care or treating physician chosen 
therapy after their biopsy and before starting tumor board defined  therapy in order to prevent 
progression during this waiting period. Subjects that opt to have this cycle of therapy will need to have recovered from hematological effects (to baseline) and have repeat scans of their primary 
tumor sites and any sites being followed for study efficacy before starting tumor board defined 
therapy.

5 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
5.1 Enrollment of Subject s  
 
All subject s (or subject s’ legal representatives) must provide written informed consent before any 
study specific assessments may be performed. The NMTRC  will keep a “possible enrollment list” 
for all sites combined. Subject s will be allowed to enroll in the order that they are added to that 
list. Prior to consent of the subject , the NMTRC  research coordinator will be contacted (via e-
mail) to place subject  on this possible enrollment list. The NMTRC  coordinator will then reply 
with study space availability. If a spot is not available at that time, the site will be contacted as 
soon as a spot does open up (based on the subject ’s order on the list). If a spot is available at the 
time, the potential subject  will undergo consent and completion of all required screening 
procedures and certification of all inclusion and exclusion criteria by the Investigator. If the 
subject  fits all enrollment criteria, the site will again contact the coordinator at the NMTRC  for 
official enrollment confirmation and unique subject  identifier assignment. In addition, a study 
enrollment form will be e -mailed or faxed to the coordinator at the NMTRC . A subject may NOT 
be enrolled on trial until official approval from the NMTRC  is received. When a spot becomes 
available, the first subject  from the list will be contacted and will have 5 working days with which 
to enroll in the study. If this subject  does not enroll by that time then the subject  forfeits his/her 
spot and the next subject  will be offered that spot.

6 Protocol Drugs  
Specific treatment details will consist of a regimen chosen from a guided list of agents implicated 
in critical molecular signaling pathways and/or from signature -based predictions of drug efficacy 
summarized from the guided therapy report. All agents are listed in the current pharmacopoeia for 
human use, but will differ amongst individual subject s. The treatment regimens will be discussed 
with families and will include review of known side effects per Pharmacopeia Library (Appendix 
III) (information obtained from package insert and from MicroMedex,  LexiComp, Facts and 
Comparisons , and Natural Medicines Database), serious adverse effects of possible new drug 
combinations, and any additional clinical monitoring that may be recommended by t he tumor 
board. The family will be given the option to proceed with therapy and if the family decides to proceed with the tumor board’s treatment decision they will be asked to sign a treatment specific 
memo .  
 
Drugs will be prescribed  by the enrolling institution per treating hospital protocol and 
administered per FDA guidelines and tumor board recommendations.  
 
6.1 Treatment modifications  
Dosing delays and modifications will be at the discretion of the treating Principal Investigator and 
their institutional pharmacist and based upon the selected therapy, subject  response and practiced 
dosing regimens. Decisions will be made on the basis of clinical expertise of the physicians and 
pharmacists and with the subject ’s welfare being the principal concern. Informational websites 
such as drug bank (Micromedex, Lexicomp, Facts and Comparisons , Natural Medicines 
Database)  will be utilized to identify potential adverse events associated with individual 
treatments. The study pharmacist will be available to consult on decisions made with respect to 
changes and modification made due to potential drug related adverse events.  
 
6.2 Concomitant Medications and Treatments  
All intercurrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according 
to acceptable community standards of medical care. All concomitant medications and treatments 
will be documented on the appropriate case report form.

Tumor assessments/imaging studies must be obtained at baseline, at the end of cycle  2 and again 
after every other cycle (or every 8 weeks, whichever occurs first) . After Cycle 6, may be done per  
institutional standard.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  
 
All radiological images must be available for source verification. Images may be submitted for 
extramural review for final assessment of antitumor activity.  
Subject s who come off study should have a final end of study disease -specific assessment done 
when possible.  
 
7.2 Scan Submission:  
All required study scans (CT’s, MRI’s, MIBG’s  and PET’s ) will be de -identified and sent to the

7.3 Response Criteria  
Overall response rate (ORR) in subject s with radiologically assessable disease will be determined 
by CT or MRI by cross -sectional imaging, MIBG /PET  scans, and/or bone marrow assessment.  
Response Assessment:  Each subject will be classified according to their “best response” for the 
purposes of analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the objective statuses described below.  
Response Criteria for Subjects with Solid Tumors:  This study will use the (RECIST) 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (version 1.1) from the NCI [44]. Key points are that 
a maximum of 5 target lesions are identified and that changes in the largest diameter (uni -
dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
• Measurable disease:  The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension with the longest diameter at least 10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). The investigator will identify up to 5 measurable lesions to be followed 
for response. Previously irradiated lesions must demonstrate clear evidence of progression to 
be considered measurable.  
• Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with CT or MRI, using the same method of 
assessment is to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and 
during follow -up. 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 43 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  • Quantification of Disease Burden The sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions 
will be calculated and reported as the disease measurement.   
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target and non- target lesions. 
• Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): Greater than 90% decrease of the disease 
measurement for CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study entry. Non -target CT/MRI lesions stable to smaller in 
size. 
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study enrollment. No new lesions or progression of any non- target measurable lesion.  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR or sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD from study entry.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements 
for measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment (nadir), and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Response Criteria for Subject s with Bone Marrow Disease:  
• Those subject s with morphologic evidence of disease by routine H and E staining (NSE 
staining only is not evaluable) will be evaluable to assess bone marrow response.  
• Complete response: No tumor cells detectable by routine morphology on two consecutive 
bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least three weeks apart after study entry.  
• Progressive disease: Tumor seen on morphology on two consecutive bone marrows done at 
least three weeks apart in subject s who had NO tumor in bone marrow at study entry. (Note: 
Subject  may be declared as progressive disease in bone marrow after only one diagnostic bone 
marrow at the discretion of the treating physician after discussion with the study chair.)  
• Stable disease : Persistence of an amount of tumor in the bone marrow by morphology that 
does not meet criteria for either complete response or progressive disease.  
 
Response Criteria for Subject s with MIBG or PET  Positive Lesions  
• Subject s who have a positive MIBG or PET scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for 
MIBG or PET  response. All MIBG’s  and PET scans  will be performed at the research 
institution and then centrally reviewed.  
• Complete response = complete resolution of all positive lesions  
• Partial response = resolution of at least one positive lesion, with persistence of other MIBG 
positive lesions.  
• Stable disease = no change in scan in number of positive lesions (includes subject s who have 
same number of positive lesions but decreased intensity)  
• Progressive disease = Development of new positive lesions  
 The intensity of MIBG uptake is not to be considered in the above institutional evaluation.  
Duration of response : 
Duration of response is defined as the period of time from when measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), whichever is first recorded, until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The assessment of response will include the initial measurable targets and will be performed after 
the second cycle, then after every other cycle (or 8 weeks, whichever occurs first). Serial results 
of bone marrow aspirates, biopsies and urinary catecholamines will be reviewed for responding 
subject s to confirm response or lack of progression.   
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 44 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  Clinical Response  
A subject will be defined as having a clinical response if they have stable disease or better and  a 
decrease in their tumor markers by ≥ 50%. Clinical response will also be defined as a subject that 
has a complete clearing of a previously positive bone marrow while on study.  
Progression Free Survival  
Time to progression, defined as the period from the first day of administration of study drug until the criteria for progression are met taking as reference the screening measurements, will be assessed.   
 
8 Sample Size Justification  
 
Feasibility  
Since this is primarily a feasibility trial, the definition of feasibility for this study will include:  
 “Enrollment onto study, genomic profile, analysis and report generation completed, tumor board held with treatment decision, treatment review completed, start of treatment, and 
completion of 1 cycle of therapy .” 
 
Our preliminary results for 5 subject s indicates that we have a sample collection success rate of 
5/5 (100%) subject s, a genetic report profile success rate of 5/5 (100%) within the 7- 10 day time 
window as well as a treatment agreement success rate of 5/5 (100%) within the 5 day time window.  The average time (+/ -SD) for completion of the genetic profile was 6.6 days (+/ -1.7 
days) with a median of 7 days.   The average time (+/ -SD) for time to Treatment was 3.2 days (+/ -
0.8 days) with a median of 3 days.   Data preliminary to date for each of these three feasibility 
markers are very consistent with our anticipated performance standards.   
  
Our initial feasibility trial continues to show that it is feasible and safe to use RNA expression 
analysis and a DNA mutation panel for tumor boards creating treatment decisions for patients 
without curative options. This study will ask the feasibility of utilizing  DNA exomes and RNA 
sequencing in a tumor for molecular guided therapy. 
 
 Assumptions :  The feasibility o utcome is a binary measure for each of the three clinical strata 
with a lower success null value of 50% which would require reconsideration of the full process and an upper success value of 75% for the alternative which would be deemed worthy of further 
consideration for an efficacy trial at the next phase. A binomial distribution was used for the 
testing process with a combination of Type I error levels (10%) and Power (75 %).  The  basic 
design overall is a MiniM ax approach which minimizes the overall sample size. The MiniMax  
design with an interim look will require an overall sample size of n = 16 .  Each of the three 
clinical strata will use a two -stage decision rule.  
 
The Two -Stage Stopping Rule for each of the three strata is as follows:  
 Stage 1: Stop and accept the null hypothesis if the observed feasibility rate is less than or equal to 
5/9.  Otherwise, continue to stage 2.  
 The probability of stopping for futility is 0. 746 when Ho is true and 0.166 when Ha is true.  
 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 45 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  Stage 2: Stop and accept the null hypothesis if the observed feasibility rate is less than or equal to 
10/16.  Otherwise, stop and reject the null hypothesis.  
 
As of Amendment 3.0, 100 subjects have been enrolled and all feasibility measures for all strata 
have been met.   To gain additional feasibility with the new Drug Prediction Report and additional 
safety and efficacy data, additional subjects will be enrolled to meet a revised goal of 200 total 
evaluable subjects.  
 The expanded access for 100 patients will enroll following implementation of Amendment 
3.0.  Their tumor samples will be analyzed using an updated Drug Prediction Report (Appendix 
III).  Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) for this group will be 
compared to those of the first 100 patients who received treatment based upon the original Drug Prediciton Report and Pharmacopeia Library.  
 
9 Laboratory Evaluations  
9.1 Specimens to be Collected, Schedule and Amount  
Required samples will be collected at the start of study. Recommended /Secondary  
(volunteer /optional ) samples  will also be collected  at the start of study. Additionally,  optional 
bone marrow samples will  be collected  every 6-8 weeks per Study Procedure Table.  
 
9.2 Tumor collection and correlative biology studies . 
 
Fresh tumor will be flash frozen and placed in kit for Ashion along with 4 -6ml blood sample in an 
EDTA tube . Viable, fresh tumor from tumor biopsy should be placed in cell growth media using 
sterile technique for, cell line and xenograft generation, one vial of tumor in RNA later,  and two 
vials of fresh frozen  tumor  to be shipped to the Pediatric Oncology Translational Research 
Laboratory for RNA analysis . Samples should be labeled with subject ’s study number , date of 
extraction and sample contents . If excess tissue is available, then snap frozen tumor tissue 
approximately 5mm in size should be wrapped in foil, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC. Tissue samples will be coded. Fixed tissue remaining from diagnostic evaluation may be 
used.  Bone marrow samples will also be sent to the 
Pediatric Oncology Translational 
Research Laboratory for tumor cell isolation and culture . 
 
At the  Pediatric Oncology Translational  Research Laboratory  tumor cells will be grown to 70% 
confluency in cell growth media . Cell lines will be maintained in culture for biology studies. 
These will include determining the growth curves and responsiveness of cells derived from these 
tumors to a variety of agents identified on the report in vitro  (both the chosen regimen as well as 
alternate options). Cells will be injected into the inguinal fat pad of NOD SCID mice for 
generation of subject  xenografts. These mice will be used for correlative drug testing experiments 
based on predictive models. Evaluation of mechanism of action of new drug combinations will be evaluated in mice models and in cell culture through immunohistochemical staining , 
phosphoproteomics , PCR , and western blotting. These models will allow us the opportunity to 
evaluate alternate drug combinations that might have been superior to the chosen regimen.

Issued 10 January 2017  9.3 Detailed Procedure For Sending Subject  Samples:  
 
At screening, subject s will have biopsy samples sent. The main sample for study report will be 
referred to as the “Primary Sample.”  
 The “Primary Sample” will be a current solid tumor biopsy or core bone marrow biopsy  (with 
>50% viable tumor) along with a 4 -6 mL blood sample collected in an EDTA tube . 
 
If a solid tumor sample cannot be obtained and the subject ’s bone marrow is < 50% tumor then 
they will be ineligible for study.  
 In addition to the “Primary Sample”, if subject s have signed the additional consent for optional 
sample collection, they will also have these secondary samples sent as follows.  
 
9.3.1 Sample Procurement and Shipping  at Screening :

Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 52 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  9.6 Plan for Communication of Collaborating Sites  
Communication between centers will be critical in this trial.  Prior to consent of the subject , the 
NMTRC  research coordinator will be contacted (via e- mail). If a spot is available at the time, the 
potential subject  will undergo consent and completion of all required screening procedures and 
certification of all inclusion and exclusion criteria by the Investigator.  If the subject  fits all 
enrollment criteria, the site will again contact the coordinator at the NMTRC  who will notify 
TGen,  Ashion,  Spectrum Health, and the Pediatric Oncology Translational Research Laboratory 
in preparation for collection and processing of tissue sample. The research coordinator at 
NMTRC  will organize the convening of members of the tumor board for discussion of the current 
case once the full report is available. In addition, a study enrollment form will be faxed to the 
coordinator at  NMTRC , a unique subject  identifier will be assigned and the enrollment form will 
be sent back to the participating site. The NMTRC will contact all sites via e -mail if the study 
enrollment is on hold or closed at any time.  
 Subject  samples will be collected at each institution and follow the flow chart above.  Once the 
report s are generated they will be sent to NMTRC/ Dr. Sholler.  The Principal Investigator 
enrolling the patient will prepare a tumor board presentation. The presentation and reports will be 
sent to all tumor board members by the NMTRC coordinator.  There will be a meeting of the 
tumor board within 4 days of receiving the report to decide on the treatment plan 
recommendation. The recommendation will be reviewed in depth for safety by the Pharmacist. 
The treatment plan and memo will be discussed with the subject  and their parents and  upon their 
signed agreement  the treatment will begin within 1 week of the discussion with parents .   
  
 
Each site will also participate in a 1 hour monthly video or teleconference meeting to review study progress and subjects  currently enrolled. There will also be a yearly face- face study 
committee meeting hosted by a member institution.  
 
10 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
10.1  Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
An untoward medical event which occurs outside the period of follow -up as defined in the 
protocol will not be considered an adverse event unless related to study drug.  Worsening of a 
medical condition for which the efficacy of the study drug is being evaluated will not be 
considered an adverse event.  
 
10.1.2  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected adverse event  is one for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent 
with the applicable product information as outlined in package insert filed with the FDA.  
 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 53 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  10.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)  
• Requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
• Results in  a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of an event; the event itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This is not the same 
as “serious”, which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functioning.    
10.1.4  Documenting Adverse Events   
The Investigator should elicit information regarding the occurrence of adverse events through 
open- ended questioning of the subject , physical examination and review of laboratory results.   
 
All adverse events, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents and Grade 3 
or higher (per CTCAE 4.0) related and unexpected adverse events that occur while on study 
should be captured on the adverse event case report form.  All Baseline AE’s will be captured on 
a separate baseline Adverse event case report form. All Grade 3 or higher  related and unexpected  
new events, as well as those that worsen in intensity or frequency relative to baseline, which 
occur after administration of study drug through the period of protocol -specified follow -up, must 
be captured.  
 Information to be reported in the description of each adverse event includes:  
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded)  
• The date of onset of the event and relatedness to treatment regimen.  
• The date of resolution of the event and whether the event is serious or not  
• Action taken; drug treatment required; non- drug treatment required; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization required; diagnostic procedure performed; subject  
discontinued from the study  
• Outcome: complete recovery or return to baseline; unknown/lost to follow -up; adverse 
event persisting; subject  died (notify the NMTRC  immediately)   
 
Adverse events will be collected for 30 days following the last treatment or until a new treatment 
is started. S uspected study drug- related  toxicity at the 30 day follow- up visit must continue to be 
followed until resolution to baseline or ≤ Grade 2 or stabilization of the event.   
 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 54 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  10.1.5  Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All fatal or life –threatening adverse events must be reported to the NMTRC  immediately by 
telephone, fax, or e -mail within 24 hours  of knowledge of the event. If full information is not 
known, additional follow -up by the Investigator will be required.  
 
All other serious adverse events that are related  and unexpected (not listed in the relevant 
appendices) which occur any time  after the subject has been consented up to 30 days after the last 
dose of treatment, and are possibly , probably, or definitely related to the research must be 
reported to the study chair  and appropriate regulatory authorities (local IRB and FDA if required)  
within 7 days of notification of the event . 
 
 
The Investigator must report all serious adverse events reported to regulatory authorities in an 
expedited manner to the local IRB or IEC.  All serious adverse events must be followed until resolution or stabilization.   Unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious 
adverse events related to participation in the study, and all volunteer deaths related to 
participation in the study should be promptly reported to the NMTRC .

10.1.6  Grading and Relatedness of Adverse Events  
10.1.6.1 Grading of Severity of an Adverse Event  
Each adverse event (Grade 2 or higher) will be graded for severity per the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V 4.0), and these criteria 
must be used in grading the severity of adverse events.  The criteria can be found at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 
Grading of Severity of an Adverse Event Not Listed in Published Criteria:  
For those adverse events which are not listed as part of the NCI CTCAE V 4 .0, the same grading 
system should be used, where:  
• Mild corresponds to an event not resulting in disability or incapacity and which resolves 
without intervention  
• Moderate corresponds to an event not resulting in disability or incapacity but which 
requires intervention  
• Severe corresponds to an event resulting in temporary disability or incapacity and which 
requires intervention  
• Life-threatening  corresponds to an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the 
time of the event  
• Fatal  corresponds to an event that results in the death of the subject

Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 55 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  10.1.6.2 Relatedness to Study Drug  
The Investigator must attempt to determine if an adverse event is in some way related to the use 
of the study drug and define an attribution category. This relationship should be described as 
follows:  
 
RELATIONSHIP  ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated to 
investigational 
agent/intervention  
 Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the 
intervention.  
The event is clearly due to causes distinct from the use of 
the study drug, such as a documented pre -existing 
condition, the effect of a concomitant medication, or a new 
condition which, based on the pathophysiology of the 
condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would 
be unrelated to the use of the study drug . 
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention.  
Adverse event does not have temporal  relationship to 
intervention,  could readily have been produced by the 
subject’s clinical state, could have been due to environmental or other interventions, does not follow 
known pattern of response to intervention, does not 
reappear or worsen with reintroduction of intervention . 
Related to 
investigational 
agent/intervention  
 Possible  The AE may be related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug and the event follows a 
known response pattern to the study drug BUT the event 
could have been produced by an intercurrent medical condition which, based on the pathophysiology of the 
condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would 
be unlikely related to the use of the study drug OR the 
event could be the effect of a concomitant medication . 
Probable  The AE is likely related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, the event follows a 
known response pattern to the study drug AND the event 
cannot have been reasonably explained by an intercurrent medical condition OR the event cannot be the effect of a 
concomitant medication . 
Definite  The AE is clearly related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug, the event follows a 
known response pattern to the study drug and based on the 
known pharmacology of the study drug, the event is 
clearly related to the effect of the study drug.  The adverse 
event improves upon discontinuation of the study drug and 
reappears upon repeat exposure.

Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 56 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  11 SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL AND TRIAL DISCONTINUATION  
11.1 Criteria for Subject Off -Therapy  
Subjects will be removed  from the study therapy for the following reasons:  
• Subject completes p rotocol defined therapy (a minimum of one cycle)  
• Progressive neoplastic disease 
• Subject  or guardian withdraws consent to continue in the trial  
• Subject  develops an intercurrent illness that precludes further participation, or requires a 
prohibited concomitant treatment  
• The Investigator withdraws the subject  in the subject ’s best interests  
• Subject  is lost to follow -up (defined as the inability to contact the subject  on 3 separate 
occasions over a period of 2 weeks)  
• Administrative reasons (e.g., the subject  is transferred to hospice care)  
• An adverse event, which in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes further trial 
participation or fulfills the protocol requirements for withdrawal  
• Death  
 
11.2 Criteria for Subject Off -Study  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study completely which includes withdrawal from survival follow -up for the following reasons:  
• Completion of all study requirements  
• Subject or guardian withdraws consent to continue in the trial  (if this occurs, no further 
study visits or data may be collected)  
• Subject is lost to follow -up (defined as the inability to contact the subject on 3 separate 
occasions over a period of 2 weeks)  
• Death  
 
11.3 Trial Discontinuation   
The Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium (NMTRC) may 
discontinue the trial as a whole or at an individual investigational site at any time. Reasons for 
early trial discontinuation may include, but are not limited to, unacceptable toxicity of 
treatment regimens, a request to discontinue the trial from a regulatory authority, protocol 
violations at an investigational site, violations of good clinical practice at an investigational 
site, or poor enrollment. The NMTRC  will promptly inform all Investigators in the event of 
premature study discontinuation and provide all Investigators with instructions regarding the 
disposition of subject s still on study. Should the study be terminated prematurely, all case 
report forms and any other study material will be returned to the NMTRC .  
 
12 DATA ANALYSIS   
12.1 Data Quality Assurance  
Electronic and paper c ase report forms will be checked for correctness against source document 
data by the independent study monitor. If any entries into the CRF are incorrect, incomplete or 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 57 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  illegible, the study monitor will ask the Investigator or the study site staff to make appropriate 
corrections.  
12.2 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)   
An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee the conduct of the study. The members of this Board will receive database summaries, including adverse event 
reports, and will convene either in person or via teleconference according to section 3.5 . The 
Board will be responsible for decisions regarding possible termination and/or early reporti ng of 
the study.  
12.3 Process and Feasibility Analysis  
Each of the process measures including the total time to treatment initiation and time to 
completion of the first cycle of treatment will be described using standard descriptive methods 
such as means, medians, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals.  The total time duration to treatment initiation and time to completion of the first cycle of treatment will also be 
examined using Kaplan- Meier plots since some patients who are considered process failures or 
who do not complete the full duration to the completion of the first cycle of treatment may 
contribute censored data.  The formal hypothesis testing of the feasibility or success is based upon the 2 -stage Mini -Max testing process outlined in Section 8: Sample Size Justification.   Further 
quantification of the feasibility success rate will be based upon the percentage of the n = 16 patients in each strata who achieve the specified overall time frame limits.  This success rate will 
be supplemented with an exact 95% confidence interval using a Binomial distribution model due 
to the small sample size involved.  
12.4 Secondary Data Analysis  
Overall response rates (ORR) will be examined using rates for each of the clinical response 
categories supplemented using exact 95% confidence intervals.  Progression free survival (PFS) data for each of the three clinical strata will be examined using Kaplan -Meier time to event plots.  
Differences in the PFS for the current treatment protocol with historical PFS values will be 
explored using Cox proportional hazard rate methods when possible.  Patients that enroll through 
compassionate access will be included in secondary data analysis.  
 
13 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
13.1 Subject  Informed Consent   
No study related procedures will be performed until a subject  or a subject ’s legal representative 
has given written informed consent. The NMTRC  will provide the site Investigators with a 
sample informed consent document that conforms to all the requirements for informed consent 
according to ICH GCP and US FDA guidelines (21 CFR 50). However, it is up to each site 
Investigator to provide a final informed consent that may include additional elements required by 
the Investigator’s institution or local regulatory authorities. The IRB/EC for each investigational 
site must approve the consent form document prior to study activation; changes to the consent 
form during the course of the study may also require IRB/EC approval. The informed consent 
document must clearly describe the potential risks and benefits of the trial, and each prospective 
participant must be given adequate time to discuss the trial with the Investigator or site staff and 
to decide whether or not to participate. Each subject  who agrees to participate in the trial and who 
signs the informed consent will be given a copy of the signed dated and witnessed document. The 
original copy of the signed  dated and witnessed informed consent document will be retained by 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 58 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  the Investigator in the study files. After the tumor board has made a therapy decision and that 
decision has been reviewed by  the pharmacist , a therapy specific treatment memo  will be signed.  
 
The Investigator must also obtain authorization from the subject  to use and/or disclose protected 
health information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA). Written HIPAA authorization may be obtained as part of the informed consent process.  
 
13.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study and IRB/IEC Approval   
The study will be conducted according to the principles of the 2004 version of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Guidance on Good Clinical Practice and 
the requirements of all local regulatory authorities regarding the conduct of clinical trials and the 
protection of human subjects.  
 
The Investigator will submit the protocol, the informed consent and any other material used to 
inform subject s about the trial to the local IRB/IEC for approval prior to enrolling any subject  
into the trial. The IRB/IEC should be duly constituted according to applicable regulatory 
requirements. Approval must be in the form of a letter signed by the Chairperson of the IRB/IEC 
or the Chairperson’s designee, must be on IRB/IEC stationary and must include the protocol by 
name and/or designated number. If an Investigator is a member of the IRB/IEC, the approval 
letter must stipulate that the Investigator did not participate in the final vote, although the 
Investigator may participate in the discussion of the trial. The Investigator will also inform the 
IRB/IEC of any serious adverse events that are reported to regulatory authorities and will provide 
to the IRB/IEC a final summary of the results of the trial at the conclusion of the trial.  
 
Any amendments to the protocol will be done through the NMTRC , and will be submitted to the 
coordinating IRB/IEC for review and written approval before implementation.  
 
13.3 Monitoring   
An independent study monitor will make regularly scheduled trips to the investigational site to 
review the progress of the trial. The actual frequency of monitoring trips will depend on the 
enrollment rate and performance at each site. At each visit, the monitor will review various 
aspects of the trial including, but not limited to, screening and enrollment logs; compliance with 
the protocol and with the principles of Good Clinical Practice; completion of case report forms; 
source data verification; facilities and staff.  
 
During scheduled monitoring visits, the Investigator and the investigational site staff must be 
available to meet with the study monitor in order to discuss the progress of the trial, make 
necessary corrections to case report form entries, respond to data clarification requests and 
respond to any other trial -related inquiries of the monitor.  
 
In addition to the above, representatives of the NMTRC  or government inspectors may review the 
conduct/results of the trial at the investigational site. The Investigator at each site must promptly 
notify the NMTRC  of any audit requests by regulatory authorities.  
 
A separate monitoring plan will be provided for additional monitoring guidelines.

It is the responsibility of the investigator to insure that the confidentiality of all subject s 
participating in the trial and all of their medical information is maintained. Case report forms and 
other documents submitted must never contain the name of a trial participant. Each subject  in the 
trial will be identified by a unique identifier that will be used on all CRF’s and any other material 
submitted to the NMTRC . Case Report Forms for this study will be both paper and electronic. 
Electronic d ata will be stored in a HIPAA compliant data center . All case report forms and any 
identifying information must be kept in a secure location with access limited to the study staff 
directly participating in the trial.  
 
Personal medical information may be reviewed by representatives of the NMTRC , of the IRB or 
of regulatory authorities in the course of monitoring the progress of the trial. Every reasonable 
effort will be made to maintain such information as confidential.  
 
The results of the study may be presented in reports, published in scientific journals or presented 
at medical meetings; however, subject  names will never be used in any reports about the study.  
 
13.6 Source Documents   
The Investigator will maintain records separate from the case report forms in the form of clinical 
charts, medical records, original laboratory, radiology and pathology reports, pharmacy records, 
etc. The Investigator will document in the clinic chart or medical record the name and number of 
the trial and the date on which the subject  signed informed consent prior to the subject ’s 
participation in the trial. Source documents must completely reflect the nature and extent of the 
subject ’s medical care, and must be available for source document verification against entries in

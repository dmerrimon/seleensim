STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
ADX-629-ET-001 is a Phase 1b, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 
crossover study to assess the interaction between ADX-629 and ethano l while exploring the 
safety, tolerability, and activity of ADX-629 in subjects with elevated ethanol levels. 
Approximately 30 subjects are expect ed to be enrolled in the study. 
This study will utilize a 2-sequence, 2-period,  2-way crossover design. Subjects will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatmen t sequences (AB or BA) on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1.  
 Treatment A: 3 oral doses of ADX-629 600 mg (2 × 300 mg) oral tablets; and 
 Treatment B: 3 oral doses of matching placebo. 
Study procedures will be comple ted during the following periods: 
 A Screening Period (Day -28 to -2); 
 Two 3-day inpatient periods (T reatment Periods 1 and 2) ( from Check-In through completion 
of treatment period), each c onsisting of the following: 
o Check-In: Subjects will be admi tted to the study site on the day prior to dosing in each 
treatment period. Baseline symptom and sign a ssessments (except for the Clinical Global 
Impression [CGI]-Improvement Scale) will be completed, and subjects will then be 
housed overnight where they will be require d to adhere to a standardized high-fat, 
high-sucrose diet; 
Note: Subjects will be reminded at the beginn ing of each treatment period that this study 
is placebo-controlled. The placebo-control reminder text will be read as follows: “You 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol ADX-629-ET-001 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 7 of 53 
Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 are participating in a placebo-controlled  study, which means that you will not know i f 
you are taking a sugar pill or a drug pill. It is important that you try not to decide whether 
you have taken a sugar pill or a drug pill. A ny questions that you answer about how you 
are feeling should not be influenced by wh ether or not you belie ve you have taken a 
sugar pill or a drug pill. Please answer questions about how you are feeling as if you had not taken any pill at all.” 
o Day 1: 1 dose of study drug will be administere d at approximately 4:30 pm followed by 
standardized ethanol consumption as outlined  in the manual, and then 1 dose of study 
drug will be administered at approximately 7 pm followed by continued standardized ethanol consumption to reach a target  blood alcohol concentration (BAC) o
f 
0.14 g/100 mL, measured via breathalyzer. For more details on the breathalyzer measurements, refer to the Study Procedures  Manual. Symptom and sign assessments 
(with the exception of the CGI-Improvement Scale) will be evaluated and should be 
completed as soon as practical after target  BAC is reached. Study procedures will be 
reviewed for randomized subj ects, and, based on the emerging data, the standardized 
ethanol solution and/or BAC testing methods may be modified as needed to ensure target 
BAC is reached within a 4-hour win dow for the remain ing subjects; and 
Note: Subjects will be observed for safety  during the treatment periods by study site 
personnel who will be present to assist subj ects at all times; there will be a minimum 
requirement of at least 2 study site personnel to assist subjects during their assessments. 
Safety measures will be in  place to prevent falling. 
Note: Ethanol will be administered in a standardized oral solution. For more details on the consumption guidelines, refer to the Study Procedures Manual. 
o Day 2: 1 dose of study drug will be adminis tered at approximately 8 am, and symptom 
and sign assessments (including the CGI-Im provement Scale) will be completed at 
approximately 7 am, 10 am, and 1 pm. Subjects  will be discharged from the study site 
after completion of study pro cedures (approximately 12 hours af ter the last dose of study 
drug). Prior to discharge, vital signs will be measured. Subjects will have to achieve a 
BAC of 0.00 g/100 mL as measured by a breathalyzer be fore discharge. 
 A follow-up telephone call will occur 3 days ( 1 day) after completion of Treatment 
Period 2. 
For subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion, study procedures will be 
performed at an Early Termination Visit. 
There will be at least a 14-day washout period between the last dose of study drug in Treatment 
Period 1 and the first dose of study drug in Treatment Period 2. Subjects will need to refrain 
from drinking alcohol du ring the washout period.  
An individual subject’s particip ation in the study is estimated to be approximately 41 days. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUT E OF ADMINISTRATION: 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. will supply sufficient quantities of study drug (ADX-629 and matching placebo) to allow for completion of the study. The lot numbers will be recorded in the 
final Clinical Study Report.

ENDPOINTS:  
The study is not formally powered and a ll endpoints are exploratory in nature. 
The primary exploratory efficacy end
points include the following: 
 Assessment of symptoms using the Glob al Impression Visual Analog Scale, 
CGI-Impairment Severity Scale, CGI-Improv ement Scale, and the Alcohol Toxicity 
Symptom Scale;  
 Assessment of signs, determined by evaluation of the following: 
o Objective flushing and ocular redness scales (via digital photography); and 
o Proprioception tests (Romberg Te st [time of up to 60 seconds],  One Leg Stand Test [time 
of up to 60 seconds], Straight-Line H eel-to-Toe Test [up to 100 steps]). 
 Assessment of ADX-629 activity, determin ed by evaluation of the following 
pharmacodynamic (PD) markers,  for both treatment periods, on Day 1 pre-dose, on Day 1 
one hour after the target BAC is  achieved, and on Day 2 one hour  after the last dose of study 
drug: o 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), acetaldehyde, malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adduct (MAA), 
and malondialdehyde (MDA) pl asma concentrations; and 
o Plasma cytokine concentrations includi ng, but not limited to, interferon gamma, 
interleukin (IL)-1b, IL -10, IL-12, and IL-17. 
The primary safety endpoint is the safety and tolerability of ADX-629, determined by evaluation 
of the following: 
 Adverse events; 
 Physical examinations; 
 Vital signs (blood pressure, hear t rate, respiratory rate, temper ature, and oxygen saturation); 
 12-lead electrocardiograms; 
 BAC; 
 Clinical laboratory assessments (including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis); and 
 Lipid panel evaluations.

Confidential & Proprietary Page 9 of 53 
Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 The PD Population is defined as all subject s who have at least 1 PD measurement. 
In general, categorical variable s will be summarized by the count  and percentage of subjects. 
Continuous variables will be summarized by th e number of non-missing observations, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. 
In general, the comparison of change from baseline in endpoints over time between the 
2 treatment sequences will be assessed by a mixe d effect model for repeated measures. The 
model will include cha nge from baseline as the dependent variable with sequence, period, 
timepoint, treatment, and the intera ction of treatment by timepoint as  fixed effects, and baseline 
as a covariate.  
 
 
 
Efficacy data will also be listed and summarized descriptively. 
Demographic and baseline data will be  listed and summarized descriptively. 
Safety and tolerability assess ments will be listed and summarized descriptively as the 
observations and, when appropriate, as the change from baseline, and shift tables will be 
produced. 
The statistical analyses to be performed will be further outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). The SAP will supersede the protocol if th ere are any differences between the 2 documents 
in the plans for data analysis, and these differences will be noted in the SAP. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: Approximately 30 subjects are expected to be en rolled in the study. The samp le size is not based 
on statistical considerations and is not formally powered as all endpoints are exploratory in 
nature.

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. ha s developed ADX-629, a proprietary new chemical entity for the 
treatment of systemic immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases that are believed to be caused 
or exacerbated by elevated concentrations of reactive aldehyde species (RASP). ADX-629 is a 
small molecule formulated for oral administration that binds rapidly and irreversibly to RASP such as hydroxynonenal (HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), thereby preventing RASP-mediated 
inflammation and ot her toxicities. 
1.1 Background 
Ethanol, commonly referred to as alcohol, is a psychoactive subs tance with dependence-producing 
properties that has been widely us ed in many cultures for centuries.
1 The harmful use of alcohol 
causes large disease, social, and economic burdens in societies. Alcohol consumption is a causal factor in more than 200 di sease and injury conditions.
1 Drinking alcohol is associated with a risk 
of developing health problems such as mental and behavioral disorder s, including alcohol 
dependence; major noncommunicabl e diseases such as liver cirrhosis; some cancers; and 
cardiovascular diseases, as well as injuries resu lting from violence and road clashes and collisions.1 
Furthermore, patients with nonalcoho lic steatohepatitis (NASH) can have elevated levels of blood 
alcohol and proteobacteria, which produce alcohol. The understanding of the drug-alcohol 
interaction could help elucid ate the mechanism of action of ADX-629 in NASH patients.  
The major enzyme systems responsible for the ox idation of ethanol are the alcohol dehydrogenase 
(ADH), and to a lesser extent , the cytochrome P450-dependent  ethanol-oxidizing systems.2 These 
routes of ethanol metabolism result in the formation of acetaldehyde.2,3 Ethanol is  metabolized in 
the liver by ADH to produce acetaldehyde, which is then further converted to acetate by aldehyde 
dehydrogenase (ALDH).2,3 The ADH and ALDH reactions lead to an accumulation of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  hydrogen (NADH), and the consequent reduction of the 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/NADH ratio has a significant effect on important 
biochemical pathways, such as glycolysis, the citric acid cycl e, fatty acid oxidation, and 
gluconeogenesis.3 NADH is mainly reoxidized to NAD+ by the mitochondrial electron transfer 
chain.4,5 During this electron transfer to oxygen, reactive oxygen specie s (ROS) are formed.4 A 
small portion of these ROS can generate toxi c effects through lipid peroxidation, enzyme 
inactivation, DNA mutations, and destruction of cell membranes.6,7,8 Lipid peroxidation is the mos t 
important reaction involved in certain types of alc ohol-induced damage, such as liver damage 
through the formation of RASP.9,10 
Through covalent binding to amino and thiol groups  on receptors and kinases, RASP, such as HNE 
and MDA, potentiate upstream pro-inflammatory signaling cascades that involve the nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of ac tivated B cells, inflammasomes, scavenger recepto r A, and other 
mediators.11,12,13,14 Elevations in RASP concentration s, pa rticularly HNE and MDA, have been 
described in a variety of inflammatory diseases.  
ADX-629 acts as a RASP-sequestering agent by i rreversibly binding to aldehydes and thereby 
preventing RASP-mediated inflam mation and other toxicities. ADX- 629 forms these adducts with 
RASP on a 1:1 stoichiometric basis. Thus, target  concentrations of ADX-629 approximate levels 
of MDA.

 Clinical Studies of ADX-629 
The potential benefit of RASP inhi bition in immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases has been 
demonstrated by the first-in-class RASP inhibito r reproxalap (ADX-102), a structural homolog of 
ADX-629, which has shown to be beneficial in treating ocular inflammation, including dry eye 
disease and allergic c onjunctivitis, across numerous Phase 2 a nd Phase 3 clinical trials, and is 
currently in Phase 3 clinical testing. 
In addition to nonclinical  safety studies, clinic al development of A DX-629 in inflammatory 
disease is supported by safety testing in healthy human volunteers in single and multiple ascending 
dose (10-day), placebo-controlle d Phase 1 trials. Overall, A DX-629 was found to be safe and 
tolerable at the doses explore d, including the maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily (BID). The 
adverse event (AE) profile of ADX-629 was favorable compared to placebo. A total of 6 (9.4%) subjects who received ADX-629 had treatment-emergent AEs compared to 
4 (19.1%) subjects who received placebo. None of the subjec ts required interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug. 
Although pharmacokinetic (PK) variability was observed, a linear correlation was evident in 
maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) as dose 
increased. The half-life was consis tent across cohorts and days, with mean values in multiple day 
exposures ranging between 3.49 to 6.83 hours. Little to no accumulation of the drug was observed

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 across cohorts. At the to p dose (600 mg BID), a C max of 1750 ng/mL (approximately 8.7 μM) and 
an AUC from time 0 to 12 hours of 6.260 h*ng/mL aver aged at Day 1 and Day 10 were consistent 
with an adequate molar ratio to achieve stoichiometric efficacy ag ainst elevated RASP. A decrease 
in free MDA levels was observed in  the plasma of healthy voluntee rs over 10 days of dosing with 
ADX-629 600 mg BID that was statistically greater than that of subjects treated with placebo. 
Following ingestion of a high-fat meal on Day 10 of dosing with 600 mg BID or placebo, levels 
of free fatty acids were statistically lower and leve ls of high-density lipoproteins were statistically 
higher in ADX-629-treated subjects than in placebo-treated subj ects, potentially representing 
additional anti-inflammatory activity of ADX-629. 
Additionally, ADX-629 is curr ently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical trial for the treatment 
of inflammation associated w ith coronavirus disease 2019 (COVI D-19), asthma, and psoriasis. 
1.2 Rationale 
This Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind study w ill assess the interaction between ADX-629 and 
ethanol while exploring the safety, tolerability, and activity of ADX-629 in subjects with elevated 
ethanol levels. Scientific evidence suggests that administration of ADX-629 may mitigate the effects of 
acetaldehyde and other toxic metabo lites of ethanol in subjects with acute ethanol toxicity. 
ADX-629 may mitigate the inflammato ry response sufficiently to lower levels of RASP and 
potentially improve outcomes of subjects. 
1.3 Risk/Benefit 
The ADX-629-ET-001 study will assess the inte raction between ADX-629 and ethanol while 
exploring the safety, tolerability, and activity of ADX-629 in subjects with elevated ethanol levels. 
The safety of the clinical dosi ng regimen in this study is suppor ted by a Phase 1 study in healthy 
volunteers and a number of nonclinical toxicology and PK studies  in which no serious safety 
concerns or treatment-related AEs were noted at the proposed dose after 10 days of BID 
administration.

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 3 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Summary of Study Design 
ADX-629-ET-001 is a Phase 1b, si ngle-center, double-blind, placeb o-controlled, randomized, 
crossover study to assess the in teraction between ADX-629 and ethano l while exploring the safety, 
tolerability, and activity of ADX-629 in subjects with elevated ethanol levels. Approximately 
30 subjects are expected to be enrolled in the study.  
This study will utilize a 2-sequence, 2-peri od, 2-way crossover design. Subjects will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA) on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1.  
 Treatment A: 3 oral doses of ADX-629 600 mg (2 × 300 mg) oral tablets; and 
 Treatment B: 3 oral doses of matching placebo. 
Study procedures will be comple ted during the following periods: 
 A Screening Period (Day -28 to -2); 
 Two 3-day inpatient periods (Treatment Peri ods 1 and 2) (from Ch eck-In through completion 
of treatment period), each c onsisting of the following: 
o Check-In: Subjects will be admitte d to the study site on the day prior to dosing in each 
treatment period. Baseline symptom and sign as sessments (except for the Clinical Global 
Impression [CGI]-Improvement Scale) will be co mpleted, and subjects will then be housed 
overnight where they will be required to adhere to a standardized high-fat, high-sucrose 
diet; 
Note: Subjects will be reminde d at the beginning of each treatment period that this study 
is placebo-controlled. The plac ebo-control reminder text will be read as follows: “You are 
participating in a placebo-controlled study, wh ich means that you will not know if you are 
taking a sugar pill or a drug pill. It is importa nt that you try not to decide whether you have 
taken a sugar pill or a drug pill. Any questi ons that you answer about how you are feeling 
should not be influenced by whet her or not you belie ve you have taken a sugar pill or a 
drug pill. Please answer questions about how you are feeling as if you had not taken any 
pill at all.” 
o Day 1: 1 dose of study drug will be administered at a pproximately 4:30 pm followed by 
standardized ethanol consumption as outlined in the manual, and then 1 dose of study drug 
will be administered at approximately 7 pm  followed by continued standardized ethanol 
consumption to reach a target blood alc ohol concentration (BAC) of 0.14 g/100 mL, 
measured via breathalyzer. For more details on the breathalyzer  measurements, refer to the 
Study Procedures Manual. Symptom and sign assessments (with the exception of the 
CGI-Improvement Scale) will be evaluated an d should be completed as soon as practical 
after target BAC is reached. Study procedures  will be reviewed for randomized subjects, 
and, based on the emerging data, the standard ized ethanol solution and/or BAC testing 
methods may be modified as needed to ensu re target BAC is reached within a 4-hour 
window for the remain ing subjects; and 
Note: Subjects will be observed for safety during the treatment periods by study site 
personnel who will be present to assist subjec ts at all times; ther e will be a minimum

Safety measures will be in  place to prevent falling. 
Note: Ethanol will be administered in a standard ized oral solution. For more details on the 
consumption guidelines, refer to  the Study Procedures Manual. 
o Day 2: 1 dose of study drug w ill be administered at approximately 8 am, and symptom and 
sign assessments (including the CGI-Improv ement Scale) will be completed at 
approximately 7 am, 10 am, and 1 pm. Subjects will be discharged from the study site after 
completion of study pro cedures (approximately 12 hours af ter the last dose of study drug). 
Prior to discharge, vital signs will be meas ured. Subjects will have to achieve a BAC of 
0.00 g/100 mL as measured by a br eathalyzer before discharge. 
 A follow-up telephone call will occur 3 days ( 1 day) after completion of Treatment Period 2. 
For subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion, study procedures will be 
performed at an Early Termination Visit. 
There will be at least a 14-day washout period between the last dose of study drug in Treatment 
Period 1 and the first dose of study drug in Treatment Period 2. Subjects will need to refrain from 
drinking alcohol during the washout period.  
An individual subject’s particip ation in the study is estimated to be approximately 41 days.

documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
In the case of subjects lost to follow-up, atte mpts to contact the subject must be made and 
documented in the subject’s medical records. Withdrawn subjects may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor.  Additional subjects will be screened as reserve subjects. Reserve subjects who are eligible for 
enrollment will also be admitted to the study site  to ensure enough eligible subjects are available 
to fill the treatment sequence. Subjects who fulfill the eligibility  criteria but are not randomized 
may either remain at the study si te for participation on a subseque nt dosing date or they may be 
discharged and return for a future  dosing date. It is not required that the Screening procedures be 
repeated provided, the subject remains within the screening window. Check -In procedures do not 
need to be repeated if the subject remains confined to the study site and protocol restrictions are 
monitored and followed. If  the subject is discharged and retu rns, Check-In procedures will be 
repeated. Reserve subjects who remain eligible bu t fall outside of the screening window will be 
allowed to rescreen.

5.1 Treatment Groups 
All subjects will receive 3 doses  of ADX-629 600 mg (2 × 300 mg) oral tablets and 3 doses of 
matching placebo. The study drug will be administered  twice on Day 1, the first dose prior to the 
commencement of the standardized ethanol cons umption, and once on the day following ethanol 
consumption (Day 2).  
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
 
 
  
 
5.3
 Randomization and Blinding 
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment  sequences (AB or BA) on Day 1 of Treatment 
Period 1.  
 Treatment A: 3 oral doses of ADX-629 600 mg (2 × 300 mg) oral tablets; and 
 Treatment B: 3 oral doses of matching placebo. 
Subjects, Investigators, and study site personn el (including the Sponsor/d esignee) involved in the 
administration and assessment of the study drug will be blinded to the subject treatment 
assignments throughout the study. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
The Investigator is responsible for the medical care of  subjects during the study. In an emergency, 
when knowledge of the subject’s tr eatment assignment is essential for the clinical management or 
welfare of the subject, the Invest igator can unblind the treatment assi gnment. It is encouraged that 
the Investigator contact the Medical Monitor (or designee) before proceed ing with the unblinding 
process. Unblinding should only occur for the subject in question if it is critical for treatment 
decision making by the Investigator for the well-being of the subject. 
Prior to unblinding the subjec t’s treatment assignment, the I nvestigator should assess the 
relationship of the AE to study drug (yes or no). If  unblinding is warranted, the Investigator must 
then follow the appropriate procedures to unblind an individual subject’s treatment assignment.  
Generally, the blind should only be broken for events  that are considered to be serious, unexpected, 
and causally related to the study treatments, or as requested  by local regulat ory authorities.  
If the study blind is broken, the In vestigator must detail the date  and reason for unblinding in the 
subject’s records. The Investigat or must also notify the Sponsor  (and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) if applicable), if  this has not already been done, that  the study blind has been broken. If the 
blind is broken due to an AE, the AE form must be completed and reported to the Sponsor (see 
Section 8.6).

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 7 ENDPOINTS 
The study is not formally powered as a ll endpoints are explor atory in nature. 
The primary exploratory efficacy endpoints include the following: 
 Assessment of symptoms using the Global Impression Visual An alog Scale, CGI-Impairment 
Severity Scale, CGI-Improvement Scale, a nd the Alcohol Toxicity Symptom Scale; 
 Assessment of signs, determined by evaluation of the following: 
o Objective flushing and ocular redness scales (via digital photography); and 
o Proprioception tests (Romberg Test [time of up to 60 seconds], One Leg Stand Test [time 
of up to 60 seconds], Straight-Line H eel-to-Toe Test [up to 100 steps]). 
 Assessment of ADX-629 activity, determined by evaluation of the following PD markers, for 
both treatment periods, on Day 1 pre-dose, on Day 1 one hour after the target BAC is achieved, 
and on Day 2 one hour after th e last dose of study drug: 
o HNE, acetaldehyde, malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adduct (MAA), and MDA plasma concentrations; and 
o Plasma cytokine con centrations including, but  not limited to, interferon gamma, IL-1b, 
IL-10, IL-12, and IL-17. 
7.1 Symptom Assessments 
7.1.1 Global Impression Visual Analog Scale 
For both treatment periods, subjects will be asked to assess the extent of their symptoms at the 
timepoints indicated in the Schedule of Procedur es (Appendix A) utilizin g the Global Impression 
Visual Analog Scale (Appendix C). The exten t of symptoms will be assessed on a 100-point scale 
from no symptoms to maximal symptoms.  
7.1.2 Clinical Global Impression-Impairment  Severity and -Improvement Scales 
For both treatment periods, subjects will be asked to rate their overall severity of impairment and 
improvement in symptoms at the timepoints indica ted in the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A) 
utilizing the CGI-Impairment Severity and CGI-Improvement Scales (Appendix C).  
Overall severity of impairment will be assesse d on a 7-point scale from no impairment to very 
severe impairment.  
For both treatment periods on Day 2, overall impr ovement of symptoms (relative to symptoms 
upon waking on Day 2) will be assessed on a 7-point scale from very much worse to very much 
improved. The CGI-Improvement Scale will only be administered on Day 2 at approximately 
7 am, 10 am, and 1 pm. 
7.1.3 Alcohol Toxicity Symptom Scale 
The subjects will be asked to score their sympto ms at the timepoints indi cated in the Schedule of 
Procedures (Appendix A) utilizi ng the Alcohol Toxicity Symptom Scale (Appendix C). This scale 
will include assessment of hydration status, fati gue, headache, and nausea including inquiries 
about vomiting, muscle weakness, ability to con centrate, light and sound sensitivity, sweating, 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol ADX-629-ET-001 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 30 of 53 
Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 trembling/shaking, and mood such as anxiety and/or depression. For the 0 to 10 scale in the 
Alcohol Toxicity score, subjects wi ll be instructed that a “10” imp lies that the subj ect would have 
to call off from work an d/or be unable to perfor m normal activities until recovered, due to that 
specific symptom. A “5” implies that the subject could perform normal activ ities, such as work, 
but with a decreased performan ce level. A “0” implies that th ere would be no impact on normal 
activities at all. For the thirst /dehydration and sweating category, subjects will rank their symptom 
on a scale of 0 to 10 based on prior, subjective experience. 
The vomiting category within th e Alcohol Toxicity Symptom Sc ale is meant to  measure the 
secondary effects of ethanol toxicity (ie, from  acetaldehyde) as opposed to effects related to 
euphoria or central nervous syst em depression. Vomiting will be  evaluated separately with 
individual AEs. A positive vomiting score will be  documented if vomiting has occurred 8 to 
12 hours after BAC is met. Vomiting observed 0 to 8 hours after BAC is met will not be included in the toxicity reporting. 
7.2 Sign Assessments 
7.2.1 Objective Flushing and Ocular Redness 
Subjects will be evaluated for signs of objective flushing and ocular redness via digital 
photography at the timepoints indicated in  the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A). 
7.2.2 Proprioception Tests 
Subjects will be evaluated for proprioception using the Romberg Test, One Leg Stand Test, and Straight-Line Heel-to-Toe Test at the timepoi nts indicated in the Sc hedule of Procedures 
(Appendix A). 
The Romberg Test will be conducte d in a standing position with th e subject’s feet together, arms 
by the side, and eyes closed. Subjects will be evaluated to determine how long they can stand 
without movement, (eg, any part  of body movement, including eyes  opening). Slight swaying is 
allowed. The length of time the subject is able to stand without movement will be recorded. 
The One Leg Stand Test will be conducted in a standing position with one of the subject’s legs 
raised slightly off the ground. The le ngth of time the subjec t is able to stand in this position will 
be recorded. 
The Straight-Line Heel-to-Toe Test will be cond ucted with the subject walking heel-to-toe on a 
demarcated floor that wi ll include a walking line and an “out -of-bounds” area marked 3 to 6 inches 
outside of the walking line. The number of steps the subject is able to take without stepping 
“out-of-bounds” will be recorded.

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
The primary safety endpoint is  the safety and tolerability of  ADX-629, determined by evaluation 
of the following: 
 AEs; 
 Physical examinations; 
 Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respirat ory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation); 
 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs); 
 BAC; 
 Clinical laboratory assessments (including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis); and 
 Lipid panel evaluations. 
8.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untow ard medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unf avorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the in vestigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, which include clinical labor atory test variables, will be m onitored and documented from the 
time of informed consent until study participati on is complete. SAEs occurring from the time of 
informed consent until 30 days following the last  administration of study drug will be monitored 
and documented. Subjects should be instructed to  report any AE that they experience to the 
Investigator, whether or not they think the event is due to study treatment. Beginning at Screening, 
Investigators should make an assessment for AE s at each visit and record the event on the 
appropriate AE eCRF. Wherever possible, a specific dise ase or syndrome rather than in dividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  the Investigator and recorded  on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not cons idered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be reco rded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medi cal or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be  recorded as an AE, not  the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already present at Screening should be recorded as medical history and not 
be reported as an AE unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity, frequency, or seriousne ss at any time during the study. In this case, it shou ld be reported 
as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (eg, EC G) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at Sc reening and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as AEs, as described below. Th e Investigator will exer cise his or her medical 
and scientific judgment in deciding whether an  abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically significant. Clinically  significant ab
 normal laboratory values occurring 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol ADX-629-ET-001 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 32 of 53 
Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 during the clinical study will be followed until repeat  tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no 
longer clinically sign ificant. Abnormal test results that are de termined to be an error should not be 
reported as an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or othe r abnormal clinical  findings (eg, ECG 
abnormalities) should be reported as an AE  if any of the follo wing are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 
 If action taken with the study drug is require d as a result of the abnormality; or 
 Based on the clinical judgm ent of the Investigator. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended respon ses to a medicinal product re lated to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal product m eans that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie the 
relationship cannot be ruled out. 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information.  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Even ts by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intens ity) of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of severity: 
The severity of all AEs should be graded according to the latest version of Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). For those AE  terms not listed in the CTCAE, the following 
grading system should be used: 
 CTCAE Grade 1: Mild; asymptomat ic or mild symptoms; clinic al or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated; 
 CTCAE Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living; 
 CTCAE Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; di sabling; limiting self-care 
activities of daily living; 
 CTCAE Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; and 
 CTCAE Grade 5: Death related to the AE.

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 Causality assessment: 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of  the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: 
No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related) – The time cour se between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapies,  complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defin itely related) – The time course  between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies,  complications, etc) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonabl e possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that  there are facts (e vidence) or arguments to s uggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration; 
The event should occur after the study drug is  given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases; 
Each report should be ev aluated in the context of  the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other di sease the subject may have. 
 Concomitant drug; 
The other drugs the subject is ta king or the treatment the subjec t receives shoul d be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug; 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate wh ether a particular respon se is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/or  mental stresses; and 
The exposure to stress might induc e adverse changes in the recipient and pr ovide a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug; 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, me tabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
8.1.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
There are no AEs of special in terest defined for this study.

8.1.6
 Special Safety Considerations 
Study staff will always be present to assist and ensure subject safety. Ther e will be a minimum of 
2 staff members to assist subjects during assessme nts, and a security officer will be in the unit 
supervising subjects while intoxicated. If a subject becomes a danger to themse lves or others, they 
will be isolated and may be physically restra ined using soft hospital-approved restraints. 
During the study, subjects will stay in private room s and not be sharing rooms. Some procedures 
(ie, digital photography) will occur outside thei r room, and subjects will be accompanied by staff 
throughout the protocol assessment s. Throughout the study, subjects wi ll be instructed to remain 
in their personal space a nd continuously supervised by multiple staff. 
Staff will always be present to monitor, assist, an d ensure subject safety. There will be a minimum 
of 2 staff members to assist subjects during as sessments. Subjects will be sequestered to their 
private rooms while intoxicated. Staff will be available to escort subjects to the restroom. Each 
restroom is equipped with an al arm. Arrangements could also be made for a bedside commode and 
urinals as needed. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is consid ered serious if, in the view of e ither the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occu rrence places the subj ect at immediate risk  of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death. 
 Requires hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalizations; 
Note: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overn ight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room or urgent care visit without hos pital admission will not 
be recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent,  or elective treatment of  a pre-existing condition 
that did not worsen from baseline. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of 
hospitalization that occu r during elective surgery should be re corded as AEs and assessed for 
seriousness. Admission to the hospita l for social or situational reas ons (ie, no place to stay, live 
too far away to come for hospital visits, re spite care) will not be considered inpatient 
hospitalizations.  

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol ADX-629-ET-001 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 35 of 53 
Version 3.0, 16 March 2022  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the a bove criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical  intervention to pr event one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include alle rgic bronchospasm requir ing intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dys crasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency. 
8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial reports: 
All SAEs occurring from  the time of informed consent until 30 days following the last 
administration of study drug will be monitored and documented and must be report ed to  
Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence. Afte r the 30-day  reporting 
window, any SAE that the Investigator consider s related to study drug must be reported to 
 Clinical Safety or the Sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form elect ronically in the electr onic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is comple ted, personnel will be notified 
electronically by the EDC system and will retrieve th e form. If the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to  
 
 
. When the EDC system becomes 
available, the SAE information must be entered w ithin 24 hours of the system becoming available. 
Follow-up reports: 
The Investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the subject 
dies. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Inve stigator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any s upporting documentation 
(eg, subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to  Clinical Safety via fax or email. 
If it is not possible to access the EDC system, re fer to the procedures outlined above for initial 
reporting of SAEs. 
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a subject becomes pregnant duri ng the study or within the safety  follow-up period defined in the 
protocol, the Investigator is to stop dosing with  study drug immediately a nd the subject should be 
withdrawn from the study. Early termination procedures should be  implemented at that time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it must be reported to  
Clinical Safety within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  Clinical Safety will then 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol ADX-629-ET-001 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 36 of 53 
Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 provide the Investigator/site the Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to  Clinical Safety.  
If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while th e subject is receiving study drug 
or within the safety follow- up period defined in the protocol , the Investigator should notify 
 Clinical Safety as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 
 Clinical Safety. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complica tion, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator sh ould follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.5 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant information about suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) that are fatal or life-threatening as soon as possible to the FDA and 
in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by the Sponsor/designee of such a case. Relevant 
follow-up information will subsequently be co mmunicated within an additional 8 days.  
All other SUSARs will be reported to the FDA as soon as possible but within a maximum of 
15 days of first knowledge by the Sponsor/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country-specifi c legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform all Inve stigators as required per local regulation. 
The requirements above re fer to the requirements relating to study drug. 
8.6 Special Situation Reports 
Special Situation Reports include reports of overdose, misuse, abus e, medication error, and reports 
of adverse reactions associat ed with product complaints. 
 Overdose: Refers to the admi nistration of a quant ity of a medicinal product given per 
administration or cumulatively (accidentally or  intentionally), which is above the maximum 
recommended dose according to the protocol. Clin ical judgement should al ways be applied. In 
cases of a discrepancy in the dr ug accountability, overdose will be  established only when it is 
clear that the subject has taken additional dose(s) or the Investigator has reason to suspect that the subject has taken additional dose(s).  
 Misuse: Refers to situations where the medici nal product is intentiona lly and inappropriately 
used in a way that is not in accordance with th e protocol instructions or local prescribing 
information and may be accompanied by harmful physical and/or psychological effects.  
 Abuse: Is defined as persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by harmful p hysical or psychological effects. 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022  Medication error: Is any unintentional error in th e prescribing, dispensing,  or administration of 
a medicinal product by a health care professional, patient, or  consumer, respectively. The 
administration or consumption of  the unassigned treatment and administration of an expired 
product are always reportable as medication errors; cases of subjects missing doses of 
investigational product are not considered reportabl e as medication errors. 
 Product complaint: Is defined as any written, electronic, or or al communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, du rability, reliability, safe ty, effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or device af ter it is released for distribu tion. A special situations form 
will only be completed if a complaint is a ssociated with an adverse drug reaction.  
All special situation events as described above must be repo rted on the Special Situation Report 
form and faxed/emailed to  Clinical Sa fety (contact informati on listed below) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. All AEs asso ciated with these Special Situation Reports 
should be reported as AEs or SAEs as well as recorded on the AE eCRF and/or the SAE report 
form. Details of the symptoms and signs, clinic al management, and outcome should be provided, 
when available. 
 
 
 
8.7 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory assessments will include c linical chemistry, hemato logy, and urinalysis. See

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 8.8 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include blood pressure, heart ra te, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen 
saturation. Vital signs will be measured after a minimum 5-minute rest on Day 1 before each study 
drug administration, and blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation will be measured 
approximately every 30 minutes after consumption of alcohol unt il the subject’s BAC returns 
to 0.11 g/100 mL. Vital signs may be measured in the seated or supine position. If there is a 
clinically important change in  blood pressure or body temperat ure from the prev ious recording 
with values outside the normal range, measurements will be repeated to confirm the change. 
Prior to discharge on Day 2, vital signs w ill be measured (both treatment periods). 
8.9 Electrocardiograms 
All 12-lead ECGs will be performed after the subject  has been resting in the supine position for at 
least 10 minutes prior to each study drug administration on Days 1 and 2 and prior to discharge on 
Day 2. Repeat ECGs are permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. 
8.10 Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening (and the Earl y Termination Visit, 
if applicable) and will consist of general appear ance, skin, head, eyes, ears, mouth, oropharynx, 
neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, a nd neuromuscular system. Additional body systems 
may be assessed, per Inve stigator discretion. 
A limited physical examination will be performed at Check-In (both treatment periods) and will consist of a minimum of general appearance, sk in, heart, lungs, and abdomen. A symptom-based 
physical examination will be pe rformed on Day 1 (pre-dose and post-dose of each study drug 
administration) and Day 2 (pre-dose and post-do se). Additional body systems may be assessed, 
per Investigator discretion. 
Additional physical examina tions may be performed, per Investigator discretion. 
Height will be collected at Screening only. Bo dy weight will be collected at Screening and

Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 11 INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS  AND QUALITY CONTROL  
11.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an internationa l ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies  that involve human subjects. Compliance 
with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects 
are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, 
and that the clinical study data are credible. 
11.2 Institutional Review Board 
The IRB will review all appropria te study documentation in order to  safeguard the rights, safety, 
and well-being of subjects. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB approval has been 
obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, in formed consent form (ICF), advertisements (if 
applicable), written information given to the subjects, safety updates, annual progress reports, and 
any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by the Investigator. 
Federal regulations and Interna tional Council for Harmonisation (I CH) Guidelines require that 
approval be obtained from an IRB pr ior to participation of subjects in research studies. Prior to 
study onset, the protocol, any protoc ol amendments, ICFs, advertisem ents to be used for subject 
recruitment, and any other writte n information regarding this study to be provided to a subject or 
subject’s legal guardian must  be approved by the IRB. 
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization has been received 
by the Sponsor. 
11.3 Informed Consent 
The ICF and any changes to the ICF made during th e course of the study must be agreed to by the 
Sponsor or designee and the IRB pr ior to its use and must be in  compliance with all ICH GCP, 
local regulatory requirements,  and legal requirements. 
The Investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated  with participation and must ensure that the 
subject has been informed of his/her rights to  privacy. The Investigat or will obtain written 
informed consent from each subject before any study-specific activity is  performed and should 
document in the source documentation that consen t was obtained prior to en rollment in the study. 
The original signed copy of the ICF must be main tained by the Investigator and is subject to 
inspection by a representative of  the Sponsor, their representative s, auditors, the IRB, and/or 
regulatory agencies. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject. 11.4 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibil ity of the Investigator to ensure that the study is c onducted in accordance with 
the protocol, Declaration of Hels inki, ICH GCP, and applicable re gulatory requireme nts, and that 
valid data are entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the CRA’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor, in the maintenance of complete, legible, well-organiz ed, and easily re trievable data. 
Before the enrollment of any subject in this study , the Sponsor or their designee will review with 
the Investigator and site pers onnel the following documents: prot ocol, Investigator’s Brochure, 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol ADX-629-ET-001 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 43 of 53 
Version 3.0, 16 March 2022 eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, and the procedure for 
reporting SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor or thei r designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recordi ng and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents and requests for clar ification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data are 
entered by the site, the CRA will re view the data for safety info rmation, completeness, accuracy, 
and logical consistency. Computer pr ograms that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the CRA and 
provide any missing informa tion, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by signature and date on the study-specific monitoring log. 
11.5 Disclosure of Data 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection by the FDA, the Sponsor or their 
designee, applicable foreign health  authorities, and the IRB as appropriate. Subjects or their legal 
representatives may reques t their medical info rmation be given to their personal physician or other 
appropriate medical personnel re sponsible for their welfare. 
Subject medical information obtained during the study is confidential and disclosure to third 
parties other than those no ted above is prohibited. 
11.6 Retention of Records

PROTOCOL TITLE  Economic Impact of Reducing Hospital Admissions for Patients Presenting to the 
Emergency Department with Worsening  Heart Failure: An Adaptive Clinical Trial of 
Furoscix  Infusor  
PROTOCOL NUMBER  scP-01-005 
SPONSOR  scPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT  Furoscix  On-body Infusor drug -device combination produc t (hereinafter referred to as 
Furoscix Infusor ) 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  1. To evaluate differences in healthcare resource utilization  costs for subjects  treated 
with the Furoscix Infusor  outside the hospital (“Furoscix arm”, “Furoscix cohort” or 
“Furoscix Infusor cohort”) compared to  patients receiving intravenous furosemide  
for ≤ 72 hours  in the hospital setting for 30 days post -discharge from the 
emergency department . 
2. To evaluate the safety of Furoscix  administered outside the hospital .  
3. To evaluate and describe quality of life and patient satisfaction for patients who 
receive  the Furoscix  Infusor outside the hospital  setting . 
STUDY DESIGN  This adaptive clinical trial will include a prospective treatment arm (i.e., Furoscix  
administered via the Furoscix Infusor)  administered outside the hospital that will be 
compared to a propensity -matched histori cal control arm of  patients admitted to the 
hospital for ≤  72 hours (i.e., T reatment As Usual (TAU) ) that will be derived from 
administrative claims data. Eligible patients for the Furoscix arm will be patients with 
worsening HF due to congestion who initially present to the emergency department 
(ED) and who are expected to require parenteral diuresis.   
 
The control arm will be populated with claims data for patients  who presented to the 
emergency department  with worsening HF  and are admitted to the hospital for ≤  72 
hours  for the treatment of HF . The filter will be further strengthened by analyzing 
diagnostic codes and resource utilization during their hospital stay to remove patients with  renal failure or those that  c were in the hospital for other reasons. The eligibility 
of patients in the control arm will be determined based on a propensity- matched 
design according to the characteristics of the patients in the prospective Furoscix  arm.  
 
Patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening  HF and meeting all 
study e ligibility criteria may be consented and enrolled in the study to receive diuresis 
outside of the hospital  setting with Furoscix .  
 
Furoscix  will be administered daily via the Furoscix Infusor whereby 80  mg is 
administered subcutaneously over 5 hours in a biphasic regimen (30 mg in the first hour, followed by 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent  4 hours). Within a single 24-
hour period, the 80  mg dose can be repeated at the discretion of the investigator > 2 
hours after the completion of the first dose.  Subjects should be transitioned back to 
their oral maintenance diuretic regimen when clinically indicated at the discretion of 
the investigator (a pproximately 4 doses) . After Subjects have been transitioned to 
their oral maintenance diuretic regimen, additional doses of Furoscix can be 
prescribed during the 30 -day study period as needed based on the presence of clinical 
triggers (dyspnea on exertion, edema, and/or excess weight gain ) as determined by 
the investigator . No more than 7 doses of Furoscix is permitted during the 30 -day 
study period. Additional doses beyond 7 requires approval by the medical monitor.

If subjects receiving Furoscix are hospitalized for heart failure during the treatment 
period,  Furoscix  should be discontinued and the subject treated with IV diuretics as 
clinically indicated.  
 
In addition to the scheduled phone and clinic visits,  the investigator can utilize 
unscheduled clinic or phone visits for additional assessments at any time.  
STUDY TREATMENTS  Study Drug: Furos cix, (Furosemide Injection ), 80 mg/10 mL is a proprietary f urosemide  
formulation that is buffered to a neutral pH to enable subcutaneous administration  
and contained in a prefilled Crystal Zenith® (CZ) cartridge .  
 
Study Device:  The Infusor  is a compact, ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilized, single -use, 
electro -mechanical (battery powered, micro -processor controlled), on -body 
subcutaneous delivery system based on the SmartDose® Gen II 10 mL (West 
Pharmaceutical Services).  
 
The Furoscix Infusor is a n investigational drug -device combination product . The Infusor 
is applied to the abdomen via a medical grade adhesive and delivers a subcutaneous infusion of Furoscix t hrough a  pre-programmed,  biphasic delivery profile with 30 mg 
(3.75 mL) administered over the first hour, followed by 12.5 mg (1.56 mL) per hour for the subsequent 4 hours (Total dose is 80 mg (10 mL) over 5 hours) .    
 
NUMBER OF 
SUBJECTS  Based on an average hospital cost  of a patient hospitalized for ≤ 72 hours with a 
primary diagnosis of HF  (Diagnosis Related Group Code  291, 292 and 293) of $8,600 
(standard deviation: $3,045), 68 patients (34 in each group) are required to have an 
80% chance of detecting a decrease in hospital costs to $6,500 at a significance level of 
5%. The target sample size of the Furoscix  cohort will initially be N= 34 subjects.  
 
Given the anticipated overdispersion of the primary outcome  (i.e., difference in total 
HF-attributable direct medical costs), we will employ adaptive trial design procedures 
for sample size re -estimation.  This adaptive -total information criterion approach was 
taken due to the risk of incorrectly estimating the sample size due to misspecification 
of the cost outcome parameters. This will include re -assessment of the sample size at 
N=34  in the Furoscix cohort by using a group sequential design and testing to allow for 
stopping.  It is not expected that the sample size for the Furoscix Infusor arm would 
exceed N=75, but the maximum value cannot be definitively stated until the analysis at N=34 is completed.  
 
The methodology by which the sample size will be re -estimated and  stopping rule s will 
be implemented will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.

The treatment comprises a 5- hour subcutaneous infusion of Furoscix via the Furoscix 
Infusor. Subjects  will be instructed on the use of the Furoscix Infusor by the 
investigator and/or study staff in accordance with the instructions for use.  The initial 
dose of the study product may be administered  on the day of enrollment . Some 
subjects may not require their initial dose until the next day.  Doses will be provided to 
the subject  for self- administration or administration by a caregiver in the home setting 
as directed by the investigator or study staff.  No more than 7 doses of Furoscix are 
permitted during the 30 -day study period. If a subject uses the allotted 7 doses and 
addition al doses  are required to control signs and symptoms of congestion when oral 
diuretics are not effective, approval by the medical monitor  is required . Subjects will 
receive scheduled at-home telephone calls from a HF nurse, or designee,  on Days 1 
and 7, and one call between Days 14- 21. Unschedule d calls can be conducted as 
needed. Planned in- clinic visits will be conducted between  Day 2-4 and then Day 30 +3 
days . Unscheduled at-home telephone calls by an HF nurse , or designee,  and 
unscheduled in-clinic visits may be performed if felt clinically indicated by the study 
team or the clinical provider.  
 
The study period will be up to 30 days after enrollment. All outcomes will be assessed 
up to 30 days after  the initial  discharge from the emergency department.  
STUDY ENDPOINTS  Primary Endpoint

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 18 of 51 The Furoscix  Infusor  cohort will be monitored for adverse events, and any adverse 
events will be recorded and reported according to Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Reactions at the infusion site and frequency of these reactions will be 
recorded as part of the safety a ssessments.  
 
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  Primary Endpoint  
 
Overall and heart failure related  costs between subjects  treated with the Furoscix 
Infusor 30 days post discharge from the emergency department  for worsening heart 
failure due to fluid overload  compared  to propensity score  matched controls treated 
in the hospital for ≤ 72 hours through 30 days post discharge.  Comparison of these  
data between the matched (paired) cohorts will be conducted via  a t-test or a  
Wilcoxon signed -rank test  depending on the distribution of the data.  
 
Secondary Endpoints  
 Outcomes for the endpoints related to healthcare utilization (i.e., Secondary Endpoints 1-4) will be evaluated by appropriate statistical test dependent on the distribution of 
the outcome.  Health -related  quality of life outcomes will be evaluated for the F uroscix  
cohort only and will descriptively compare KCCQ -12 questionnaire responses at Day 0 
versus Day 30. Change i n BNP or NT-proBNP will be evaluated for the Furoscix cohort 
only and will descriptively compare  values obtained at Day 0 versus Day 30.   Subject 
and/or caregiver satisfaction with Furoscix Infusor will be descriptiv e.       
 Safety Analysis  
 
There are no pre- planned analyses to compare Furoscix versus hospitalized cohort on 
the basis of safety. However, the safety of Furoscix  will be monitored during the trial, 
and identified safety issues (including AEs, SAEs, and adverse reactions) will be summarized descriptively for the Furoscix  cohort. The incidence (number and 
percen tage of subjects) of adverse events will be presented overall and by MedDRA 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term for the Furoscix  cohort.  Reactions at the 
infusion site and frequency of these reactions will be reported. This analysis will be repeated for  serious adverse events, for treatment -related adverse events, and for 
adverse events leading to premature study withdrawal.

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 23 of 51 1.   INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
 Heart failure (HF) affects 6.5 million adults in the United States, a figure that is expected to grow to 8 million by 
2030. In the United States, HF is implicated as the cause of at least 1- 2 million hospitalizations and 700,000 
emergency department visits annually, and HF  admissions generate the highest number of 30 -day readmissions 
among Medicare enrollees. It is also estimated that 90% of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with worsening  HF are admitted to the hospital and approximately 50% of hospital admiss ions for HF admitted from the 
emergency department could potentially be avoided.  
 Intravenous furosemide is commonly indicated for the management  edema which is commonly present in 
worsening HF as the absolute bioavailability of oral furosemide is low, highly variable and is exacerbated during an 
acute  event.  Recognizing this limitation of oral furosemide, national and international guidelines recommend  that 
patients should be administered intravenous diuretics when significant  signs and symptoms of volume overload 
are present. Thus, hospital admission or utilization of an observational unit  is generally required. Admitting 
patients to the hospital, solely for the administration of intravenous furosemide, is expensive and increa ses risks of 
hospital -associated morbidity and mortality. Alternative treatment paradigms that shift HF management  outside of 
the hospital are needed.  
 
Approximately 60% of hospital admissions in patients with HF are due to sodium retention and volume over load.  
While subcutaneous administration of furosemide would enable diuresis as  an outpatient, avoiding  a hospital 
admission, the current commercially available furosemide injectable products have an alkaline pH and poor 
solubility making them unsuitable for subcutaneous administration. A novel, pH neutral formulation of 
subcutaneous furosemide ( Furoscix , Furosemide I njection 80 mg/10 mL  for subcutaneous use )
  has been  
developed to minimize burning and discomfort with subcutaneous administration and is delivered via the Furoscix  
Infusor: a wearable, pre- programmed on-body subcutaneous  delivery system.  
 
Furoscix  administered 80 mg subcutaneously via the Furoscix Infusor , with 30 mg administered over the first hour 
followed by 12.5 mg per hour over the subsequent four hours produce d similar exposures of furosemide and 
equivalent diuresis and natriuresis compared to two bolus injections of furosemide 40 mg dosed over 2 minutes, 
two hours apart.  
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate  the economic impact of hospital  avoidance and  safety  with management of 
worsening  HF due to congestion with Furoscix  administered via the Furoscix  Infusor outside the hospital setting in 
patients initially presenting to the e mergency department.   
 
 Risk: Benefit Evaluation  
 
1.1.1.   Potential Benefits of Participating in the Study  
 The potential benefit to the participants beyond their contribution to the development and testing of this product 
is the potential avoidance of a hospital admission and administration of parental diuretics outside of the hospital  
setting.  
 
1.1.2.   Potential Risks of Participating in the Study  
 
Furosemide has been extensively  studied and used clinically for over 50 years.  It is generally considered a safe and 
effective pharmaceutical product. Subjects  may experience marked diuresis following the placement and 
activation of this drug -device combination product. Subjects  should be instructed to have  ready  access to suitable 
toilet facilities. Marked diuresis may be accompanied by a drop in  blood pressure including orthostatic 
hypotension and associated signs and symptoms.

1.1.3.   Risk Management  
 Subjects will be trained by the study staff  on appropriate use of the Furoscix  Infusor  and will receive specific 
instructions and study materials created for th e study ( based on the Furoscix  Infusor Instructions f or Use)  that 
include information regarding  what to do in case of certain events during the drug delivery period.  
 
Subjects should be transitioned back to their oral maintenance diuretic regimen when clinically indicated at the 
discretion of the investigator ( approximately 4 doses) . After Subjects have been transitioned to their oral 
maintenance diuretic regimen, additional doses of Furoscix can be prescribed during the 30 -day study period as 
needed based on the presence of clinical triggers (dyspnea on exertion, edema, and/or excess weight gain) as 
determined by the investigator. No more than 7 doses of Furoscix is permitted during the 30 -day study period. 
Additional doses beyond 7 requires approval by the medical monitor.   
 
Subjects will receive scheduled at -home telephone calls from a HF nurse, or designee,  on Days 1 and 7, and one 
call between  Days 14- 21. Unscheduled calls can be conducted as needed. The primary purpose of the calls will be 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of diuresis and the need to adjust diuretic therapy.  Two planned in- clinic visits 
will be conducted: the first occurring within Days 2-4 and the second occurring on Day 30 + 3 days.  These visits will 
include laboratory testing of creatine and electrolytes.  
 Unscheduled at-home telephone calls by an HF nurse , or designee,  and unscheduled in-clinic visits may be 
performed if felt clinically indicated by the study team or the clinical provider.  
 2.   STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
The objectives of this study are:  
 
1. To evaluate differences in healthcare resource utilization  costs  for subjects  treated with the Furoscix Infusor 
outside the hospital compared to patients receiving intravenous furosemide  for ≤ 72 hours in the hospital 
setting  for 30 days post -discharge from the emergency department.  
2. To evaluate the safety of Furoscix  administered outside the hospital .  
3. To evaluate and describe quality of life and patient satisfaction for patients who receive the Furoscix  Infusor 
outside the hospital  setting.  
 
3.   INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
 Overall Study Design and Plan  
 
This adaptive clinical trial will include a prospective treatment arm (i.e., Furoscix  administered via the Furoscix  
Infusor) administered outside the hospital that will be compared to a propensity- matched historical control arm 
consisting of  patients admitted to the hospital for ≤ 72 hours (i.e., TAU) . This h ealthcare cost data from the control 
arm will be generated  from administrative claims data. Eligible patients for the Furoscix arm will be patients with 
worsening HF due to congestion  who initially present to the emergency department and who are expected to 
require  parenteral diuresis.  The decision as to whether a patient will be enrolled in the study to receive Furoscix  
will be made collaboratively by an emergency  medicine  physician and a heart failure specialist or cardiologist.  
 The control arm will be populated with claims data for patients who presented to the emergency department for 
worsening HF and are admitted to the hospital for ≤ 72 hours  for the treatment of HF. . The filter will be further 
strengthened by analyzing diagnostic codes and resource utilization during their hospit al stay to remove patients  
with renal failure or those that were in the hospital for other reasons . Furoscix -treated patients  will be matched to

and Pasta 2010.1 The simulations will be used to find the matching ratio at which the level of precision is optimized 
without biasing the variance of the outcome measure. Additional methodological details are described in the prespecifi ed statistical analysis plan.  
 Patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening  HF and meeting all study e ligibility criteria may 
be consented and enrolled in the study to receive diuresis outside of the hospital  setting with Furoscix . 
 
Furoscix  will be administered daily via the Furoscix Infusor whereby 80  mg is administered subcutaneously over 5 
hours in a biphasic regimen (30 mg in the first hour, followed 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent  4 hours). Within 
a single 24- hour period, the 80  mg dose can be repeated at the discretion of the investigator > 2 hours after the 
completion of the first dose. The total duration in days and total number of doses of the initial therapy will be 
determined by the investigator based on an estimated volume of diuresis desired to transition patient back to their 
oral diuretic maintenance therapy. The decision of when to discontinue Furoscix  and switch to oral diuretics will be 
based on clinical judgement.  If subjects receiving Furoscix are hospitalized for heart failure during the treatment 
period,  Furoscix  should be discontinued and the subject treated with IV diuretics as clinically indicated.   During the 
30-day study period, additional doses of Furoscix can be prescribed as needed due to clinical triggers (dyspnea on 
exertion, edema, and/or excess weight gain) as determined by the investigator.   In addition to the scheduled 
phone and clinic visits,  the investigator can utilize unscheduled clinic or phone visits for additional assessments at 
any time.  
 
 Furoscix Infusor  
 
The Furoscix Infusor is a drug -device combination product consisting of Furoscix ( Furosemide injection , 80 mg per 
10 mL ), a novel, pH neutral furosemide formulation optimized for subcutaneous administration and contained in a 
prefilled, Crystal Zenith® (CZ) cartridge, and a proprietary wearable, pre -programmed on -body delivery system, the 
Infusor , based on the SmartDose® Gen II 10 mL (West Pharmaceutical Services) . 
 
The Infusor is a compact, ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilized, single -use, electro -mechanical (battery powered, micro -
processor controlled), on -body delivery system that administers a fixed dose of drug product from a p refilled 
cartridge assembly into subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen. It is intended for use by patients, caregivers, or a 
health care professional (HCP) at home or in a clinic setting.   The Furoscix Infusor is 117 mm x 62 mm x 30 mm (length x width x height) and weighs  appr oximately 80 grams 
without the drug cartridge and 90 grams, with a filled drug cartridge  inserted into the drug compartment.  It has an 
integrated, adhesive patch which attaches the Infusor  to the skin for dose administration. The device with 
adhesive is removed from the skin following completion of the dose and discarded.   
 The system delivery parameters will be pre- programmed as part of the manufacturing process to deliver 80 mg (10 
mL) furosemide  over 5 hours using a biphasic delivery profile  of 30 mg furosemide (3.75 mL) over the first hour and 
12.5 mg furosemide (1.56 mL) per hour over the subsequent 4 hours . The device elements are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Main Components of the Furoscix Infusor  
 
  
The Furoscix Infusor utilizes a primary container, which consists of the CZ cartridge (CZ barrel and elastomeric septum) and elastomeric piston. The primary container assembly is prefilled with the Furoscix as part of the fill -
finish process.   
 Following removal of the Furoscix Infusor from the packaging, the drug compartment of the device is opened by 
the user, which turns the device on, and a built -in self -test is performed to verify the needle/button position, 
correct software parameters, the device was  not operated prior to the current activation and the motor and 
batteries are functional.  
 
The user inserts the prefilled Cartridge into the drug compartment, closes the compartment, removes the adhesive liner and attaches the loaded Furoscix Infusor to the skin of the abdomen. Pressing the activation button 
automatically inserts the  small, 27- guage, 6 mm  needle into the subcutaneous tissue and drug administration is 
initiated. The needle is protected within the device and can only be deployed when the pref illed Cartridge is in 
place, the cartridge compartment is closed, the device is adhered to the patient, the safety latch is closed, and the 
activation button has been pressed. Dose administration stops automatically upon completion of drug delivery or open ing of the safety latch upon the removal of the device from the abdomen.   
 The Furoscix Infusor is designed to administer the entire dose without user intervention. The dose volume and dose administration time cannot be changed by the user. Both visual and auditory notifications provide feedback on the progress of drug administration. In the event of a drug delivery error, visual and auditory notification will 
alert the user. Once drug administration is complete, accompanied by visual and auditory notifications, the user 
removes the system with the administration needle by carefully peeling the adhesive from the skin which automatically opens the safety latch to conceal and protect the administration needle. The empty Cartridge cannot be removed from the sy stem after administration of the drug product and the integrated Cartridge/Infusor are 
disposed of together. The device is battery -powered and enables removal of the battery by the user prior to 
disposal.  
 
The clinical study will include training the subject and/or caregiver in the preparation, placement, activation and 
removal of the Furoscix  Infusor based on the Furoscix  Infusor Instructions for Use  (IFU).  The steps include:

 Selection of Doses in the Study  
 
The dose of 80 mg is the fixed dose of the study product. This was selected on the basis of clinical criteria and physician prescribing and is consistent with the approved labeling  of furosemide injection, United States 
Pharmacopeia. Furoscix  will be administered daily . Within a single 24- hour period, the 80 mg dose can be repeated 
at the discretion of the investigator > 2 hours after the completion of the first dose.  The total duration in days  and 
number of doses will be determined by the  treating investigator  based on a n estimated volume of diuresis desired 
to transition patient back to their oral diuretic maintenance therapy.  
 
 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
 
Furoscix  will be administered daily via the Furoscix  Infusor whereby 80  mg is administered subcutaneously over 5 
hours in a biphasic regimen (30 mg in the first hour, followed 12.5 mg/hour for the subsequent  4 hours).  Device 
removal will occur within 3 hours of completion of drug delivery. Within a single 24- hour period, the 8 0 mg dose 
can be repeated at the discretion of the investigator > 2 hours after the completion of the first dose. The total 
duration in days  and the total number of doses will be determined by the investigator  based on an estimated 
volume of diuresis desir ed to transition patient back to their oral diuretic maintenance therapy.  
 
Patients will be instructed on the use of the Furoscix  Infusor by the investigator and/or study staff in accordance 
with the IFU and subject  specific instructions . The initial dose of the study product may be administered on the day 
of enrollment . Some subjects may not require their initial dose until the next day. Doses will be provided to the 
patient for self- administration or administration  by a caregiver in the home setting as directed by the investigator 
or study staff.  
 
 Procedures for Blinding  
 
Not applicable. This is an unblinded study.  
 
 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 Prior and concomitant therapy will include all prescription medicati ons and therapies  7 days prior to enrollment 
through Day 30 . All information on prior and concomitant therapies will  be recorded in the subject’s source and on 
the subject’s case report form ( CRF). Requisite details will include the name of the therapy or drug and duration of 
the treatment (start and stop dates)  including diuretics and electrolyte supplementation .  
 
 Prohibited Medications  
 Concomitant use of any drugs known to interact with furosemide, including aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, high doses of salicylates, cisplatin, tubocurarine, succinylcholine, chloral hydrate, phenytoin, methotrexate, indometh acin and lithium is not permitted.  
 
 Other Restrictions  
 Subjects will be  advised to not enga ge in  strenuous physical activity or activities that could expose the device to 
moisture such as swimming, bathing , or showering. Subjects will be informed that marked diuresis may ensue after 
activation, and that they should avoid travel, operating a vehi cle, or other situations without read ily available 
access to toilet  facilities.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 32 of 51 The study may be stopped if the Investigator, Medical Monitor, Sponsor or IRB determines that subjects’ safety  
may be compromised by continuing in the study.  
 To avoid biasing the outcomes by artificially restricting the variance, the study will be stopped  once the fixed 
confidence interval width for the difference in the primary endpoint between the prospective arm ( Furoscix  
Infusor ) and the historical control (treatment as usual) is reached.  This will include re -assessment of the sample 
size at N=34 in th e Furoscix cohort by using a group sequential design and testing to allow for stopping.  It is not 
expected that the sample size for the Furoscix Infusor arm would exceed N=75, but the maximum value cannot be definitively stated until the analysis at N=34 is completed.  
  
The methodology by which this stopping rule will be implemented is detailed in a separate statistical analysis plan.  
 
 Study Drug -Device Combination Accountability  
 The study drug -device combination product will be handled in accordance with the procedures of this protocol.  
Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study drug -device combination product, in accordance with 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
  
Study staff authorized to handle and store the drug -device c ombination product must keep an accurate accounting 
of the receipt and disposition of the study products received from the sponsor. Drug -device combination product 
accountability will be assessed by the study monitor during periodic monitoring visits.

6.1.1.   Assessment of Primary Endpoint  
 The difference in the overall  and heart failure related healthcare costs between subjects treated with the Furoscix 
Infusor through 30 days post  discharge from the emergency department  compared to  propensity score matched 
controls treated in the hospital for ≤ 72 hours  through 30 days post discharge . Overall and heart failure related 
healthcare cost s comprised of all direct medical costs attributable to healthcare resource utilization incurred 
overall and for treatment of HF .  
6.1.2.   Assessment of Secondary Endpoints  
 The difference in the measurements listed below between subjects  treated with the Furoscix Infusor 30 days post 
discharge from the emergency department compared to  propensity score matched controls treated in the hospital 
for ≤ 72 hours through 30 days post discharge . 
 1. Number of hospital admissions and duration with -in 30 days post discharge from the emergency department  
2. Number of HF -related hospital admissions  and duration  with -in 30 days post discharge from the emergency 
department  
3. Number of HF -related emergency department visits with -in 30 days post discharge from t he emergency 
department  
4. Number of HF -related clinic visits with -in 30 days post discharge from the emergency department  
5. Description of health -related quality of life using the KCCQ -12 (for the Furoscix  Infusor arm only)  
6. Change in BNP or NT -proBNP (for Furoscix  Infusor cohort only)  
7. Subject and/or caregiver satisfaction with Furoscix Infusor (for Furoscix Infusor cohort only)   
 
6.1.3.   Safety Assessments  
 
The Furoscix  treatment cohort will be monitored for adverse events, and any adverse events will be recorded and 
reported according to guidelines  specified  by the United States Food and Drug Administration.   Reactions at the 
infusion site and frequency of these reactions will be recorded as part of the safety assessments.   
 
 Study Phases and Procedures  
 
The Screening Phase will be conducted in the emergency department in a collaborative effort between the emergency physician and the cardiologist . All Subjects who sign the informed consent form and satisfy the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial on the same day as screening. Study drug administration can start on the day of screening and enrollment, and administration may commence either in the emergency department or at home.  
 
Furoscix  will be administered daily via the Furoscix  Infusor whereby 80 mg is administered subcutaneously over 5 
hours in a biphasic regimen (30 mg in the first hour, followed 12.5 mg/hour for the subsequent  4 hours). Within a 
single 24- hour period, the 80 mg dose can be repeated at the discretion of the investigator > 2 hours after the 
completion of the first dose. Subjects should be transitioned back to their oral maintenance diuretic regimen when clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator ( approximately 4 doses) . After Subjects have been 
transitioned to their oral maintenance diuretic regimen, additional doses of Furoscix can be prescribed during the 
30-day study period as needed based on the presence of clinical triggers (dyspnea on exertion, edema, and/or 
excess weight gain) as determined  by the investigator. No more than 7 doses of Furoscix is permitted during the

Furoscix  are hospitalized for heart failure during the treatment period,  Furoscix  should be discontinued and the 
subject treated with IV diuretics as clinically indicated . In addition to the scheduled phone and clinic visits,  the 
investigator can utilize unscheduled clinic or phone visits for additional assessments at any time.  
 
Prior to leaving the emergency department on Day 0, the subject and/or caregiver will be trained by the study staff on how to prepare the study product and apply it to their abdomen and remove it once the infusion is completed. 
The initial dose of the study product may be administered on the day of enrollment . Some subjects may not 
require their initial dose until the next day.  Doses will be provided to the patient for self- administ ration or 
administration by a caregiver in the home setting as directed by the investigator or study staff.  No more than 7 
doses of Furoscix are permitted during the 30 -day study period unless approved by the medical monitor.  Planned 
in-person follow -ups include a clinic visit occurring between Days 2-4 and a clinic visit on Day 30+ 3 days . Scheduled 
remote follow -ups conducted by telephone by a HF nurse , or designee,  will occur  on Days 1  and 7 , and one call 
between  Days 14- 21. Unscheduled at-home telephone calls and unscheduled in-clinic visits may be performed if 
felt clinically indicated by the study team or the clinical provider.  
 
The Follow -Up Phase will occur on Day 30+ 3 days  for a post treatment follow- up visit completing Subjects’ study 
participation.   
 
Refer to  Figure 2 for an overview of study phases and procedures.  Note that the depict ion in  Figure 2 of Furoscix  
administrations after Day 1 is for demonstration purposes. Again, the investigator can prescribe additional Furoscix  
dosing and administration at his/her discretion as long as this  does not conflict with safe use practices as defined in 
this protocol and supplementary materials.

6.2.7.   Unscheduled Telephone Calls and Clinic Visits  
 There are two forms of unscheduled follow -ups specified in this protocol: telephone call and clinic visit. These may 
be assigned at any time at the discretion of the investigator and may arise from a request by the subject or 
caregiver , a request by the HF nurse , or designee,  conducting telephone follow -ups, or by the judgement of the 
investigator . Note that the investigato r can pre -specify at any time the number and timing of unscheduled follow -
up visits.  
 
If subjects experience worsening signs and symptoms they can be seen in the clinic as an unscheduled visit.  For 
subjects presenting for an unscheduled visit the following assessments will be performed:   
 
• Cardiopulmonary  Exam including NYHA Classification  
• Vital Signs  
• Weight  
• Labs drawn at the discretion of the investigator (including BNP or NT -proBNP)  
• Assess for adverse events  
 
All subjects will have the option to receive unscheduled phone call  by a n HF nurse , or designee,  at any time  
following the initial discharge from the emergency department. The primary purpose is to respond to issues affecting proper use and administration of the Furoscix  Infusor. While these calls will follow according to the 
aforementioned script, the HF nurse , or designee,  will address - per his or her best professional judgement - 
specific issues reported by the patient or caregiver.  
 Additionally, the HF  nurse , or designee,  will ask (and document the responses) whether the subject has since the 
previous follo w-up: 
 
• Been admitted to the hospital  
• Been admitted to the hospital for HF -related issues  
• Been seen at the emergency department for HF -related issues  
• Been seen in an outpatient clinic (including immediate care clinic) for HF -related issues  
• Sought any additi onal or new medical treatment for HF -related issues

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 39 of 51 6.2.9.   BNP or NT -proBNP Assessments  
 BNP or NT -proBNP will be tested at all clinic visits (scheduled and unscheduled) , sent to a local laboratory, and 
values  recorded in the CRF.  
 
6.2.10.   Clinical Laboratory Tests  
 All routine samples will be analyzed by a local licensed clinical laboratory. The clinical laboratory tests are as 
follows:  
• Blood clinical chemistry: Creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, 
magnesium  
• Hematology:  (CBC) : Red blood cell count (RBC) , Total white blood cell count (WBC) , Differential WBC 
(neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), Hemoglobin, Hematocrit (Hct) , and Platelet 
count  
• Urine Pregnancy test: beta hCG test  
 The investigator is responsible for determining if out -of-range laboratory values are clinically significant or not.  All 
clinically significant values will be followed until stabilization , resolution or loss to follow up or until no further 
improvement  is expected.  
6.2.11.   Heart Failure  Symptom Scoring  
 NYHA Functional classes  will be used in this study.  
 
Class I  - Patients have cardiac disease but without the resulting limitations of physical activity. Ordinary 
physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal pain.  
   
Class II  - Patients have cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal 
pain. 
   
Class III  - Patients have cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or 
anginal pain.  
   
Class IV  - Patients have cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without 
discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even 
at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is incre ased.  
 6.2.12.   Vital Signs  
 
Vital signs will include respiratory rate (respirations per minute), blood pressure (mmHg) and heart rate (beats per 
minute). Blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained after the Subject has been resting in sitting position for 5 minutes.   
 
Weight and height will be collected for BMI. Height collected Day 0 only.

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 41 of 51 7.   ADVERSE EVENTS  
 The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definition of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event  (SAE) as provided in this protocol. AEs will be assessed continuously through 
the last study visit unless the nature of the AE or SAE requires continued monitoring.  All AEs are recorded as mild, 
moderate or severe, and as Not Related, Possibly Related, Probably  Related, and Definitely Related to the 
investigational product . 
 
 Definition of an Adverse Event  
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an investigational product  in humans, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product . An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product , and does not imply any 
judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise with any use of the investigational product  (e.g., off- label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
 
A “pre -existing” condition is one that is present prior to a dministration of the investigational product and is 
reported as part of the Subject’s medical history. Pre -existing condit ions should be reported as AEs only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the pre -existing condition worsens during the course of the study.  
 Laboratory or functional test abnormalities generally are not considered AEs unless they are associated wit h 
clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention. A laboratory abnormality (e.g. a clinically significant 
change detected on clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or functional test abnormality (e.g. a clinically 
significant change detect ed on electrocardiogram , pulse oximetry, or spirometry) that is independent from a 
known underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to interruption or 
discontinuation  of the investigational product , must be co nsidered an AE.  
 All AEs judged to be clinically significant, including clinically -significant laboratory, electrocardiogram  and 
functional test abnormalities, will be followed until resolution or return to baseline or until no further 
improvement is expec ted. 
 
An AE does include any:  
 
• Exacerbation of a pre -existing illness.  
• Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic event or condition.  
• Condition detected or diagnosed after investigational  product placement and/or drug administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen following the start of the study.  
 
An AE does not include:  
 • Medica l or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospitalization for cosmetic elective 
surgery, social and/or convenience admissions).  
• Overdose of either study drug or concurrent medication without any signs or symptoms.

 Definition of an Adverse Reaction  
 
An adverse reaction means any AE caused by an investigational product . Adverse reactions are a subset o f all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the investigational product  caused the event.  
 
 Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibilit y that the 
investigational product  caused the adverse event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the investigational product  and the AE . A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty  about causality than adverse reaction.  
 
 Definition of an Unexpected  Adverse Event  
 An adverse event or Suspected Adverse Reaction is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure, product labeling or is not listed at the  specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 
 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
 An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 a. Death  
b. A life -threatening AE  
o NOTE: Life -threatening means that the Subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred.  This definition does not include an event that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
c. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o NOTE: Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization, 
the event is an SAE.  
o NOTE: “Inpatient” hospitalization means the Subject has been formally admitted to a hos pital for medical 
reasons.  This may or may not be overnight.  It does not include presentation at a “casualty” or emergency 
department . 
d. A disability/incapacity  
o NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, accidental trauma (i.e., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent ev eryday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. A congenital anomaly in the offspring of a Subject who received drug  
f. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
conside red an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the Subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospa sm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
department or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in Subject hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
o NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be used in deciding whether prompt reporting is 
appropriate in this situation.

 Severity of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Mild  - The symptom is barely noticeable to the Subject and does not influence performance or 
functioning.  
   
Moderate  - The symptom is of sufficient severity to make the Subject uncomfortable, and performance of 
daily activities is influenced. Treatment for the symptom may be needed.  
   
Severe  - The symptom causes severe discomfort. Treatment for the symptom may be necessary.  
 The severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of each AE  or SAE must be assessed by the Investigator or designee.   
 
 Outcome of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Not Recovered / Not 
Resolved  - One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the event has 
not improved or the patient recuperated.  
   
Recovered / Resolved  - One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the event has 
improved or patient recuperated.  
   
Recovered / Resolved with 
Sequelae  - One of the possible results of an AE outcome where the subject recuperated 
but retained pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.  
   
Recovering / Resolving  - One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the event is 
improving.  
   
Unknown  - Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
   
Fatal  - The termination of life as a result of an AE.  
 
 Assessment of Relatedness to Study Product  
 The Investigator will assess each AE and SAE for causality based on their best medical judgment, the observed 
symptoms associated with the event, and the available information on investigational product . The relatedness 
guidance provided below can be used to assist in determining the relationship of the IP to the AE or SAE. However, 
it is ultimately the investigator’s responsibility to determine the relationship based on their best medical judgment, 
knowledge, and experience.  
 
Not Related  - Based upon available information regarding subject history, disease process, relationship of AE 
to dosing and drug pharmacology, there is no reasonable relationship between the 
investigational product and the AE.  
   
Possibly 
Related  - Relationship exists between th e AE and IP, when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from the 
time of the investigational product administration, but could also have been produced by the 
subject’s clinical state or by other drugs administered to the subject.  
   
Probably 
Related  - Relationship exists between the AE and the investigational product when the AE follows a 
reasonable sequence from the time of investigational product administration, follows a known 
response pattern of the drug class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the investigational 
product and the investigational product is the most likely of all causes.

Definitely 
Related  - Relationship exists between the AE and the investigational product when the AE follows a 
reasonable sequence from the time o f the investigational product administration, follows a 
known response pattern of the drug class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the 
investigational product and no other reasonable cause exists.  
 
 Method, Frequency, and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 AEs and SAEs will be assessed in the frequency and manner as described in Section 6.2 of this protocol.  
 
 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
7.10.1.   Timeframes for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification of the sponsor regarding SAEs is essential so that ethical and regulatory responsibilities and 
legal obligations can be satisfied. The Investigator must report SAEs according to the following time frames:   
  
• Initial notification of all SAEs ba sed on the available information must be provided to the sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of the investigational site learning of the event. (Initial notification within 24 hours of Death 
and life -threatening events is extremely important).  
• Follow -up information when available must be sent to the sponsor or designee within 48 hours of receipt of 
the information by the investigational site.  
 
7.10.2.   Serious Adverse Event Information to Report  
At a minimum, SAE reports must contain the Subject ID, the serious adverse event term, onset date, relationship to study product, and a brief narrative of the event.  Please note that relationship to study product  and causality is 
very important and must be included in the initial report as it may impact expedited regulatory reporting 
requirements for the event.  
 There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested.  However, it is not 
acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the Subject’s medical records in lieu of completion of the 
appropriate AE  and SAE pages. If medical records are submitted, all Subject personal identifiers must be 
completely redacted prior to submission.  
 
7.10.3.   Other Assessments as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator should exer cise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal 
laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
 Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments 
(e.g., electrocardiogram , vital signs) that are judged by the Investigator as clinically significant must be recorded as 
AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an adverse event.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or 
other abnormal assessments that are detected after study product administration or that are present before study 
product administration but worsen after study pr oduct administration should be assessed for AE criteria.  
 
7.10.4.   Documenting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs, including SAEs that occur after dosing of study product must be documented in the Subject's medical 
records and on the CRF. The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs,

SAE term.  
 
7.10.5.   Regulatory  and Ethics reporting requirement  
The Investigator will  comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to 
the Institutional Review Board . 
 
7.10.6.   Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/conta ct that are designated as ongoing will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts.  AEs and SAEs will be followed until the last study visit unless the nature of the AE or 
SAE requires continued monitoring.  If a Subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -
up period, a copy of any post -mortem findings, including histopathology, should be obtained, if available, and 
forwarded to scPharmaceuticals.  New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE 
Report  Form with all changes electronically signed/dated by the Investigator or designee.

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 46 of 51 8.   STATISTICS  
 
 Determination of Sample Size  
 
Based on an average hospital cost of a patient hospitalized for ≤ 72 hours with a primary diagnosis of HF (Diagnosis 
Related Group Code 291, 292 and 293) of $8,600 (standard deviation: $3,045), 68 patients (34 in each group) are required to have an 80% cha nce of detecting a decrease in hospital costs to $6,500 at a significance level of 5%. 
The target sample size of the Furoscix  cohort will initially be N= 34 subjects.  
 Given the anticipated overdispersion of the primary outcome (i.e., difference in total HF -attributable direct 
medical costs), we will employ adaptive trial design procedures for sample size re -estimation.  This adaptive -total 
information criterion approach was taken due to the risk of incorrectly estimating the sample size due to 
missp ecification of the cost outcome parameters.  By using the  adaptive sample size design, which includes no 
penalty for repeated interim analysis, the final sample size will be sufficient to provide adequate power to test the stated hypothesis.   
 
This will include re -assessment of the sample size at N=34 in the Furoscix cohort by using a group sequential design 
and testing to allow for stopping. It is not expected that the sample size for the Furoscix Infusor arm would exceed 
N=75, but the maximum value cannot be definitively stated until the analysis at N=34 is completed.  
 
 We will explore ratios ranging from 1:1 to 4:1 for the number of historical controls to be matched to Furoscix -
treated patients  using methods reported by Millar and Pasta 2010. The simulations will be used to find the 
matching ratio at which the level of precision is optimized without biasing the variance of the outcome measure. Additiona l methodological details are described in the prespecified statistical analysis plan. 
 The method ology by which the sample size will be re- estimated and stopping rule s will be implemented will be 
detailed in the  statistical analysis plan.  
 
 
 Baseline Characteristics and Subject Disposition  
 
Overall Baseline and demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Subject disposition (e.g., the 
number of Subjects enrolled, completed, and discontinued) will be summarized and medical history data will be listed.   
 
 Endpoint Analyses  
 Full descriptions of statistical assessments for primary and secondary endpoints are given in a separate statistical analysis plan. Included herein are brief descriptions.  
 
8.3.1.   Primary Endpoint  
 The primary endpoint analysis  will compare  the difference in the overall and heart failure related healthcare cost s 
between subjects  treated with the Furoscix Infusor 30 days post discharge from the emergency department for 
worsening heart failure due to fluid overload  with propensity score  matched controls treated in the hospi tal for ≤ 
72 hours through 30 days post discharge.  Propensity scoring methods will be described in the statistical analysis 
plan . Comparison of these dat a between the matched (paired) cohorts will be conducted via a t- test or a  Wilcoxon 
signed -rank test  depending on distribution of data .

 Outcomes for the endpoints related to healthcare resource utilization (i.e., Secondary Endpoints 1 -4) will be 
evaluated by appropriate statistical test dependent on the distribution of the outcome.  Health -related quality of 
life outcomes will be evaluated for the Furoscix  cohort only and will descriptively compare KCCQ -12 questionnaire 
responses at Day 0 versus Day 30.  Change in BNP or NT -proBNP will be evaluated for the Furoscix cohort only and 
will descriptively compare values obtained at Day 0 versus Day 30.  Subject and/or caregiver satisfaction with 
Furoscix Infusor will be descriptive.   
 
 Safety Analyses  
 
There are no pre- planned analyses to compare Furoscix  versus hospitalized cohort  on the basis of safety . However, 
the safety of Furoscix  will be monitored during the trial, and identified safety issues (including AEs, SAEs, and 
adverse reactions) will be summarized descriptively for the Furoscix  cohort.  
 The incidence (number and percentage of subjects) of adverse events will be presented overall and by MedDRA 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term for the Furoscix  cohort. Reactions at the infusion site and frequency of 
these reactions will be reported.  This analysis will be repeated for serious adverse events, for treatment -related 
adverse events, and for adverse events leading to premature study withdrawal.

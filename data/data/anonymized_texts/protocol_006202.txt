ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE 
The study will comprise 10 on-site visits AND 9 phone calls:  
 
• Visits: 
 
- V1 screening visit between D -28 and Day -1 
- V2 baseline visit at D1 (first dosing) 
- during the treatment period*:  
- visit every 2 weeks from V2 to V5 - every 6 weeks from V5 to V6 - every 12 weeks from V6 to V8 
- every 16 weeks from V8 to V9 (Week 52; last         dosing) 
- V10 follow-up visit at Week 64 - A time window of ±2 days will be allowed for each visit
 
 
• Phone calls: 
 
- For safety considerations at Weeks 8, 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 48 
during the treatment period and at Week 58 during the follow-up 
period. 
 
*IMP administration being every week. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: Based on prior clinical trial experience in IPF patients, it is estimated that 
the standard deviation (SD) of the absolute change in % predicted FVC 
at 52 weeks is approximately 12%.  Fo r the primary efficacy parameter of 
absolute change in % predicted FVC, 92 patients per treatment group will yield 80% power to detect a 5 perc entage point difference between the 
treatment groups and placebo.  Additional patients will be randomized in 
each regimen to allow for dropouts; therefore, approximately 100 patients 
(electronic  2.0)

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 2  21-Jul-2015 
SAR156597-DRI11772 Version number:  1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 8 will be randomized into each treatment group, for a total sample size of 
approximately 300 patients for the study. 
Analysis sets: 
Safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety population, which 
includes all randomized patients who receive at least 1 injection of 
investigational medicinal product. Efficacy analyses will be performed on 
the modified intent to treat popul ation (primary population), which 
includes all patients who receive at least 1 injection of investigational 
medicinal product, have a valid baseline % predicted FVC measurement, 
and have at least 1 post-baseline % predicted FVC measurement. The 
primary statistical analysis will be performed once all patients have 
completed the Week 52 assessment and the database has been cleaned 
and locked. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
A rank-based analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the 
change from baseline in % predicted FVC. The ANCOVA model will 
include treatment group as the main factor and the baseline % predicted 
FVC as a continuous covariate.  
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Analysis of time to event endpoints will be performed using the log-rank 
test and Cox proportional hazards regression model. 
Safety analysis 
TEAEs and serious AEs (SAEs) (will be summarized for each treatment 
group by primary system organ cla ss (SOC), high level group term 
(HLGT), high level term (HLT), and preferred term (PT), as well as by severity and relationship to study treatment. The rate of potentially 
clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) will also be summarized by treatment group. Additionally, listings of all AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation will be generated.  Clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, electrocardi ograms (ECGs), a selected panel of 
biomarkers, and ADA will be tabulated by  treatment group. These safety 
analyses will be compared qualitatively between the treatment groups.  
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  The study will last 68 weeks per patient as follows: 
• 4 weeks of screening 
• 52 weeks of study treatment 
• 12 weeks of follow-up with no study treatment

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prog ressive, diffuse, and distinct chronic fibrosing 
interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause that is uni formly fatal with a median survival of 
approximately 3 years ( 1). The clinical course of IPF is vari able and not predictable; the rate of 
decline and progression to death may take several clinical forms: slow physiologic deterioration 
with worsening severity of dyspnea, rapid dete rioration, and progression to death, or periods of 
relative stability interposed with periods of acute respiratory decline sometimes manifested by 
hospitalizations for respiratory failure ( 2). Epidemiological data still qualify IPF as a “rare 
disease”, even though international studies seem to report an increasing incidence, with current 
estimates between 4.6 and 16.3 per 100 000 person-years and a prevalence of 13 to 20 cases per 100 000 (( 3), (4), (5)). There is a higher predominance of the disease in men (1.5 to 1.7:1) than in 
women and the frequency increases with age ( 5). The most important environmental risk factors 
are cigarette smoking, exposur e to metal and wood dust( 1), and infectious agents including both 
viruses and bacteria( 6). Genetic transmission occurs in a bout 0.5% to 3.7% of patients with IPF 
(7). The diagnosis of IPF often requires a multid isciplinary approach, involving pulmonologists, 
radiologists, and pathologists experienced in the field of interstitial lung diseases( 8). The 
pathogenic mechanisms are unclear, but a growing body of evidence indicates that the disease is 
the result of an abnormal behavior of the alveolar epithelial cells that provoke the migration, 
proliferation, and activation of  mesenchymal cells, with the formation of fibroblast and 
myofibroblast foci. Activated myofibroblasts se crete exaggerated amounts of extracellular matrix 
molecules with the subsequent dest ruction of the lung architecture ( 9). Pirfenidone (Esbriet®, 
Roche), an oral drug that is hypothesized to i nhibit the synthesis of transforming growth factor-
beta, was approved so far in Japan, China and in the European Union for the treatment of IPF. Very recently, the FDA approved pirfenidone as well as nintedanib (Ofev®),an oral kinase 
inhibitor for the treatment of IPF. Per labeling information, these two drugs were shown to significantly reduce the decline of lung functi on as compared to placebo. No statistically 
significant effect on death was demonstrated. Lu ng transplantation is the only therapy that 
prolongs survival in advanced IPF, although the post-transplantation 5-year survival for patients 
with IPF is about 48% ( 10). Interleukin 4 (IL)-4 and interleuki n 13 (IL-13) are structurally related 
cytokines expressed by T helper type 2 lymphocytes  and are ligands that share in common at least 
1 receptor subunit (IL-4R alpha) ( 11), ( 12). Elevations in IL-4 and IL-13 and their receptors have 
been linked to the pathogenesis of IPF ( 13), ( 14). In IPF patients, IL-13 and IL-4 levels in 
bronchial alveolar lavage fluid are el evated compared to normal controls ( 15). Such evidence 
suggests that therapies capable of suppressing or neutralizing these cytokines have the potential for delaying the progression of fibrosis in IPF patients. SAR156597 is an engineered humanized bispecific IgG4 antibody that binds and neutraliz es both IL-4 and IL-13. It utilizes an innovative 
tetravalent bispecific tandem immunoglobulin form at to combine the antigen binding domains of 
an anti-IL-4 antibody and an anti-IL-13 antibod y into a single molecule. SAR156597 shows high 
affinity for IL-4 and IL-13 from both humans and cynomolgus monkeys, and each antibody has 
binding sites for 2 IL-4 and 2 IL-13 cytokines.

4.2.1 Study design 
DRI11772 study will consist of the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 2 dose levels/regimens 
of SAR156597 administered subcutaneously ov er a 52-week treatment period and, the 
determination of the optimal dose level/regimen for the treatment of patients with IPF. 
It will be a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-c ontrolled, 3-parallel group study 
conducted in out-patients suffering from IPF a ccording to the American Thoracic Society/ 
European Respiratory Society/ Japanese Respiratory Society/ Latin American Thoracic 
Association (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) guideline criteria and confirmed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts in IPF. 
Patients who discontinue treatment during the study will be followed for the full planned 52 week 
duration of the study in order to ensure the collection of efficacy outcomes on all randomized 
patients and minimize the potential for bias in analyses due to missing data. 
4.2.2 Design rationale 
The 52-week treatment duration is based on published data from clinical trials in IPF and also 
from IPF natural history data that respectively showed evidence for treatment-induced changes on surrogate endpoints and significant decline in respiratory function characteristic of disease 
progression over a 12-month period. 
The follow-up period of 12 weeks after dosing for adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis is appropriate taking into account the estimated half-life of about 11 to 15 days for 
SAR156597 from the TDU11325 and TDR11326 studies. 
Dose selection SAR156597 was safe and well tolerated at single SC doses up to 300 mg in healthy subjects as 
well as at repeated SC doses up to 200 mg during 6 weeks in patients with IPF, including at the 
injection site level. No in vivo data from an appropriate animal model of IPF is available to guide the desired 
pharmacologically active exposure of SAR156597.  However, modelling and simulation of the 
inhibition of Stat6 phosphorylation in monkey suggest that its inhibition will be fully achieved. 
Additionally, SAR156597 has been shown to redu ce in a dose dependent manner (up to 200 mg 
once a week) the plasma level of TARC, a protei n biomarker involved in the IL-4/IL-13 pathway, 
after 6 weeks of treatment in patients with IPF. 
As the desired dose frequency for patient conve nience is once every 2 weeks, the weekly dose 
regimen for the 200 mg dose level will be compar ed to the every 2 weeks dose regimen for 200 
mg.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 23 Finally, modelling and simulations based on the PK data from the multiple dose clinical study 
(TDR11326) have confirmed that a 200 mg dose administered once every 2 weeks and once a 
week give an acceptable safety margin in terms of exposure ratio (monkey AUC at 
NOAEL/human AUC) of ~6 and ~3 respectively. 
4.2.3 Rationale for the use of outcome measures 
4.2.3.1 Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) 
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be assessed during the study. Pulmonary function tests, such 
as spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusing l ung capacity (DLCO), are standard evaluations for 
patients with IPF. Changes in forced vital cap acity (FVC) and DLCO have been shown to be 
correlated with survival ( 17). 
4.2.3.2 Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Pulse Oximetry 
The 6-MWT with oximetry will be used in this study. It is a safe and reproducible procedure for patients with IPF. Baseline desaturation during a 6MWT is a powerful predictor of subsequent 
mortality ( 18) 
4.2.3.3 Lung High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) 
A significant correlation between high-resoluti on computed tomography (HRCT) visual score and 
lung function tests both at diagnosis and at follow-up has been shown and reported in the 
literature. The HRCT study is able to identify and quantify anatomic IPF and also to evaluate the progression of the disease. In clinical practice, the HRCT visual score of disease extent can be 
used in association with function tests to mon itor IPF evolution, and to evaluate prognosis and 
therapy ( 19). 
4.2.3.4 St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) 
Impact of IPF on quality of life will be assessed using the SGRQ ( 20). This questionnaire covers 
the measurement of symptoms, activity, and imp acts. It has good discriminative and evaluative 
properties and is responsive to therapeutic trials. It takes 8 to 15 minutes to complete. 
4.2.3.5 EuroQol Questionnaire, 5 level system (EQ-5D-5L) 
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument fo r use as a measure of health outcome.  
EQ-5D-5L is the 5-level system for the 5-dime nsional format of the EQ-5D and covers the 
measurement of mobility, self-care, usual ac tivities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. 
EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by s ubjects, taking less than 5 minutes to complete. 
Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 24 4.2.3.6 Biomarkers 
Peripheral blood will be collected for measurement of protein biomarkers in serum or plasma.  
The protein biomarkers have been selected either based on their pot ential link with SAR156597 
mechanism of action, based on reported association with survival in or pathogenesis of IPF or lung fibrosis. These include, but are not limited to, inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), TARC, periostin and Human Epipidymis protein 4 (H E4). In a previous observational longitudinal 
study (ASY12295), some of these biomarkers show ed a higher circulating concentration at 
baseline in IPF patients compared to healthy controls, with estimated AUROC above or close to 0.8.  On exploratory basis, the correlation between IPF disease biomarkers and lung function 
progression will be assessed at Week 24 and Week 52.  Moreover, in another previous clinical 
study with increasing doses of SAR156597 (T DR11326) promising results were observed for 
some of these markers, e.g. a trend in reduced blood concentration of TARC with increasing doses 
of SAR156597. Drug-related protein biomarkers will be assessed at  baseline, Week 24 and Week 
52 to look for an effect on thes e proteins after 6 months and 12 months of SAR156597 treatment.  
 
Additional blood samples will be archived for potential fu ture assay of protein and mRNA 
biomarkers related to the diagnosis, progression, or therapeutic responsiveness of IPF 
4.2.3.7 Genetic testing  
The genetic basis of IPF is not well understood.  Polymorphisms of various genes encoding for 
cytokines and mucins have been reported to be increased in sporadic IPF.  To obtain a better 
understanding of IPF pathogenesis and disease co urse in relation to th e genomic profile, blood 
samples will be collected to further characterize the genotype of IPF subjects by analysis of a subset of selected genes already associated to IPF including but not limited to IL4 ( 21), IL4R ( 22), 
STAT6 ( 23) and MUC5B ( 24).

Central review of clinical documentation 
Clinical documentation such as patient history, H RCTs, and histology will be centrally reviewed 
by a radiologist and a pathologist specialized in interstitial lung diseases in order to confirm the 
diagnosis of IPF. HRCTs performed during the course of the study will also be reviewed and scored on a blinded basis to appropriately assess the changes over time. 
Data Monitoring Committee 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be charged with monitoring the safety of the patients participating in this clinical trial. This committee is comprised of externally-based individuals 
with expertise in the diseases under study, biostati stics, or clinical research. The DMC will, in due 
time, give appropriate re commendations to the Sponsor on safe ty aspects during the conduct of 
the study, if needed. The DMC is justified by the early stage of development of SAR156597 that 
has gathered sparse safety inform ation in patients with IPF so far  
. The DMC responsibilitie s and the data review processes are fully 
described in the DMC charter. In the above capaci ties, the DMC is advisory to the Sponsor. The 
Sponsor is responsible for promptly reviewing and for taking into account in a timely manner the recommendations of the DMC in te rms of trial continuation with or without alte rations or of 
potential trial termination 
Operational Committee 
An Operational Committee will be put in place for potential consultation on unexpected ethical, 
methodological, or technical que stions that may arise during the course of the study.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
 
A complete description of the Investigationa l Medicinal Product (IMP) and its proper handling 
will be provided in a pharmacy manual. 
• Pharmaceutical form 
o SAR156597 solution for injection at 100 mg/mL: SAR156597 is supplied as a sterile freeze-dried powder for solution fo r injection. Each vial is overfilled with 
125 mg of SAR156597 freeze-dried powder, a nd the final solution for injection is 
obtained by reconstitution of the entire vi al content with 1.1 mL of water for 
injection, leading to an amount of 125 mg  of SAR156597 drug substance in a total 
volume of 1.25 mL, that is a 100 mg/mL of SAR156597 solution. 1 mL of this 100 mg/mL SAR156597 solution can then be withdrawn for dose administration. 2 drug product vials are thus needed to reach a 200 mg dose. 
o Placebo consists of liquid with the same excipients as those of the reconstituted SAR156597 formulation, filled at nominal volume of 1.5 mL. Two vials are necessary, 1 mL will be taken from each vial to prepare 2 mL syringe. 
• Method of preparation 
At the study site, reconstitution of the IMP mu st be done by personnel other than those 
administering the drug and making clinical observations (e.g. pharmacist) to maintain the treatment blind (Refer to Section  8.4). 
o At patient’s home, reconstitution must be done by healthcare professionals (e.g. 
visiting nurse) out of view of patients and their families/caregivers. 
o The IMP should be reconstituted the day of dosing (no more than 3 hours prior to SC injection), at room temperature. 
• Dose of drug per administration 
o SAR156597 qw arm: one injection of SAR156597 200 mg administered subcutaneously every week  
o SAR156597 q2w arm: one injection of SAR156597 200mg administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks altern ating with one injection of placebo 
administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks 
o Placebo arm: one injection of pl acebo administered every week

injection sites should be alternated between th e 4 quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel 
and waist areas) so that the same site is not injected for two consecutive weeks. Exact site of 
each injection will be docum ented on source document. 
 
The IMP is administered every 7 days +/- 2 days from initial IMP administration. This is permitted per protocol to accommodate special circumstances, eg . laboratory results pending, 
ongoing AE, patient scheduling difficulty.   If IMP administration is missed or temporarily discontinued, the initial schedule of injections should be resumed. This does not apply to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
 On days when the patient has a study visit, the IMP will be administered by the Investigator or delegate after clinic proce dures and blood collection.   
 For doses not administered at the study site, the IMP will be administered by qualified site personnel and /or healthcare  professionals (e.g. visiting nurse service).  
 Patients should be monitored by s ite personnel/visiting nurse for at  least 30 minutes after each 
administration for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a hypersensitivity reaction.  
[For Czech Republic only per local requirement: Patients should be monitored at the study 
site by site personnel for a minimum of 2 hours after the first administration of IMP and for a 
minimum of 1 hour after the next 5 administra tions for potential signs and symptoms that may 
suggest a hypersensitivity  reaction. For the subsequent IMP administrations, patients should 
be monitored by site pers onnel/visiting nurse for at least 30 minutes after each 
administration.]   
For doses not given at study site, a booklet will be provided to the patient to record information related to the injections; this booklet  will be completed by the visiting nurse after 
each injection and will be kept as source data in the patient’s  study file. Patients will be 
instructed to bring the booklet back at the s ubsequent site visit for Investigator’s review.

8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
SAR156597 and placebo will be provide d in treatment kits indistinguishable in appearance and 
will be labeled with a treatment kit number. The randomized  treatment kit num ber list will be 
generated by Sanofi. 
In accordance with the double-blind design, study pa tients, Investigators, and study site personnel 
(except the personnel who conduct the reconstitution of the IMP  and preparation of syringes for 
injection) will remain blinded to study treatment and will not have access to the randomization 
(randomized treatment kit number) excep t under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2. 
To maintain blinding, since unreconstituted placebo and SAR156597 vials are not matched for 
appearance, the personnel involved with dose prepara tion will be required to agree not to reveal to 
other study personnel the type of IMP solution (SAR156597 vs. placebo) in the vials/syringes.  
For doses administered at patient’s home, visiting nurses will be requested to reconstitute the IMP 
out of view of patients and their families/caregivers and to sign a confidential agreement for not 
disclosing the IMP box content.  
Also to protect the blind, SAR156597 and placebo will be supplied in a 2 week treatment kit 
containing individually 2 Tamper Evident sealed treatment boxes (2 vials per box / 2 boxes per 
kit).  Each inner box will contain 2 vials and will be labeled as “Box 1” (week 1 treatment) and “Box 
2” (week 2 treatment). Each weekly treatment box will be sealed with a tamper evident seal.   
The outer kit, also tamper evident sealed will contain the 2 inner boxes and extra tamper seals. After administration of week 1 treatment, the pe rson preparing the dose will put the empty vials 
back in the original inner box 1, put the empty box 1 back in the outer kit and tamper evident 
sealed it until week 2 administration. After administration of week 2 treatment, the same 
procedure will be applied for box 2. 
During monitoring visit, the unblinded monitor will break the tamper evident seal to perform IMP 
accountability. The monitor will tamper seal the outer box after performing IMP accountability. 
The Investigator must not open the returned tamper sealed boxes. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected serious adve rse drug reaction unblinding by the

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 35 8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient. If possible, c ontact should be initiated 
with the monitoring team before breaking the code.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by us ing the proper module of the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) and/or by calling any other 
phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpos e.  If the blind is broken, the Investigator 
should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking.   
If the blind is broken by the Investigator, for the above stated purpose, the patient must be 
withdrawn from treatment.  
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
Patient will be randomized followi ng a 1:1:1 ratio to one of th e three treatment arms via a 
centralized randomization system using IVRS/IWRS. A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally by Sanofi. The investigational 
product (SAR156597 or placebo) will be packag ed in accordance with this list. 
At V1 (screening) the study staff will contact the IVRS/IWRS to obtain a patient number for each 
patient who gives informed consent. 
The result from the central reviewer on diagnosis of IPF have to be obtained to validate the 
inclusion of patient before randomization as per inclusion criteria (See section Section  7.1) 
The population will be stratified according to background therapy at the moment of 
randomization: 
- Patient with background therapy with either pirfenidone or nintedanib  
- versus patient without background therapy  
- It is planned to include a maximum of 66% of patients with background therapy. 
Randomization will be performed at Visit 2 (Day 1) by a centralized randomization procedure 
using IVRS/IWRS. 
Patients who comply with all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned before the IMP 
administration on Visit 2 (Day 1): 
• A treatment number in a preplanned orde r following the randomization list, and 
• A patient number according to the chronological order of inclusion. 
A patient cannot be randomized more than once in the clinical trial.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 36 Patients who meet exclusion criteria may be re-scr eened once during the open screening period of 
study; a different patient identification will be issued. Re-screening is not permitted if the patient 
fails to meet inclusion criteria. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen-failure date and the re-screening date. The IVRs/IWRS report will flag re-screened patients. 
Patients that are re-screened must sign a new co nsent form and all Visit 1 procedures must be 
repeated. 
The treatment kits are sufficient for 2 weeks of treatment. As the treatment  duration is 52 weeks, a 
patient will be allocated by the IVRS to several trea tment kit numbers corresponding to the same 
treatment arm assigned  from randomization. 
The details of the centralized randomization pr ocedure and IVRS are provided in a separate 
manual. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
SAR156597 and Placebo will be supplied as a treatme nt box. Each box will contain 2 inner boxes. 
Each inner box will contain 2 vials. The inner boxes will be numbered as “Box 1” and “Box 2”. 
Box “1” or “2” will be used for administration at the instructed time. 
Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
All investigational Product s hould be stored between 2°C a nd 8°C (36°F and 46°F).The  
Investigators or other authorized persons (e.g. pharmacists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specifications, policies, and procedures.  
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature (e.g. refrigerated storage) 
and information on in-use stability and instruc tions for handling the Sanofi compound should be 
managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. 
At home, the treatment kits will be stored by the patients in a refrigerator in accordance with the 
storage conditions indicated on the label of the IMPs. 
After the supply of IMP kits to patients at the st udy site visits, appropria te provisions will be in 
place for transportation of the IMP kits from the study site to the patient’s refrigerator. As an 
alternative to between study site visits, the IMP may be supplied from the site to the patient via a sponsor-approved courier company where allowe d by local regulations and approved by the 
patient.

measured by a central laboratory. 
Note: Two PFTs will be performed within 4 weeks prior to dosing one at screening and one at 
baseline. The first PFT will determine whether the patient qualifies for th e study and the second 
will be averaged with the first one to establish a baseline value.  
9.1.4.2 Pulse oximetry 
Oxygen saturation will be assessed using pulse oximetry (SpO2). 
9.1.4.3 Lung HRCT 
For confirmation of diagnosis at baseline, a lung  HRCT will have to be performed unless already 
done within 1 year prior to screening. The HRCT  will be provided to th e central review panel 
together with histology documentation if any. 
A second HRCT will be performed at the end of tr eatment to measure the e ffect on lung fibrosis 
using a specific scoring system. 
9.1.4.4 6-MWT 
The distance covered by the patient over a 6 minute walk will be measured by the investigational 
site staff at baseline and during th e treatment and reported in meters in the e-CRF. If during visits 
6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, oxygen saturation is less than 88%  under ambient air at re st, the patient should 
perform 6-MWT under 4L oxygen. 
9.1.4.5 Patient Reported Outcome 
The impact of the disease on patient’s Quality of Life will be measured at baseline and during the treatment using the St George  Respiratory Questionnaire and the EuroQol questionnaire. 
9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
The same safety assessment will be applied across all arms. Adverse events will be collected at each visit from the signing of the informed consent to the end of the follow-up period. The investigator will ask the patient how he/she has felt since the last  study visit/phone call. The study 
specific and general safety monitoring are detailed in Section  10.4.1. To ensure the continuing 
safety of patients in this study,  an independent DMC will be res ponsible for reviewing the safety 
data on a periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in Section  6.3.

9.3.1.3 Bioanalytical method 
9.3.1.3.1 SAR156597 assay 
All plasma samples to be tested for SAR156597 samples will be analyzed by Bertin pharma 
(Saclay, France). 
A validated ELISA is used for the quantifica tion of SAR156597 in human plasma. Biotinylated 
IL-4 coated on a streptavidin plate is used to capture SAR156597, which is then detected by 
SulfoTag-IL-13. This format, which uses electr ochemiluminescence detection, is able to detect 
SAR156597 with an LLOQ of 0.05µ g/mL. 
9.3.1.3.2 Anti-drug antibodies 
All anti-SAR156597 antibody sample s will be analyzed by the Bioanalysis and Biomarkers 
domain in DSAR OC Montpellier (France). For the analysis of potential anti-SAR156597 an tibodies (ADA) in human plasma, a validated 
bridging qualitative ELISA using electrochemiluminescence detection will be used. Positive samples in screening assay will then be tested in a confirmatory assay (competition with 
SAR156597) in order to demonstrate the presence of antibodies and eliminate false positive 
results generated from the initial screening assay. 
Interference of SAR156597 in the ADA assay will  be documented so that the highest drug 
concentration that does not affect the limit of ADA detection is known and the interpretation of 
immunogenicity takes into account this parameter. 
Additional information on the bioanalytical method for anti-SAR156597 antibodies will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Samples that are ADA positive will be further evaluated for their potential neutralizing activity 
with an assay currently in development. 
In the interim, the sponsor will store frozen speci fic aliquots for neutralizing activity testing if 
necessary.

9.3.3.2 Protection of subject identity and genetic sample/data handling 
The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting subject confidentiality.   The blood sample and 
DNA that is extracted will be assigned a second number, a Genetic ID (de-identification code) 
that is different from the Subject ID.  This “double coding” is  performed to sepa rate a subject’s 
medical information and DNA data.  The clinical study data (coded by Subject ID) will be stored 
in a distinct database at a different location from the database containing the genetic data (coded by Genetic ID).  The key linking Subject ID and Genetic ID will be maintained by a third party, under appropriate access control.  The matching of clinical data and genetic  data, for the purpose 
of data analysis, will be possible only by using this  key, which will be under strict access control.  
All data will be reported only in coded form in order to maintain confidentiality. 
Any remaining banked blood samp les and associated DNA will be discarded according to local 
regulations and operating procedures within 15 year s of issuance of the Clinical Study Report for 
DRI11772. 
9.3.3.3 Optional stored DNA sample 
For those patients who signed the optional pha rmacogenetic informed consent form, a blood 
sample will be collected at the study visit as specified in the study flow chart and this sample will 
be stored.  
This sample may be used to determine a possi ble relationship between genes and response to 
treatment with SAR156597, how the body processes SAR156597 and possible side effects to 
SAR156597. Genes that may be studied include those for the IL4 receptor, IL4, MUC5B and 
additional genes that may potentially be part of the Th2 signaling pathway.  
This blood sample will be transfer red to a site that will, on beha lf of Sanofi, extract DNA from the 
sample and that is managed by a contractor which can be located outside the country where the 
study is conducted, within or out side of the European Union. 
This blood sample, and the DNA that is extracted  from it, will be assigned a second number, a 
Genetic ID (deidentification code) that is diffe rent from the Subject ID. This “double coding” is 
performed to separate a subject’s  medical information and DNA data. 
The clinical study data (coded by Subject ID) will be stored in the clinical data management 
system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environm ent from the database 
containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by  Genetic ID). The key linking Subject ID and 
Genetic ID will be maintained by a third party, under appropriate access control.  The matching of clinical data and pharma cogenetic data, for the purpose of da ta analysis, will be possible only by 
using this key, which will be under strict access control. All data will be  reported only in coded 
form in order to maintain confidentiality. 
The DNA will be stored for up to 15 years from the completion of the clinical study report.

9.4 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES 
For subjects who have consented to it, 6 samples will be collected at the visit specified in the 
study flow chart and these samples will be stored. These samples may be used for other research purposes (excluding genetic analysis) related to IP F than those defined in the present protocol.  
These other research analyses will help to understa nd either disease subtypes or drug response, or 
to develop and/or validate a bi oassay method, or to identify new drug targets or biomarkers.  
These samples will remain labelled with the same identifiers than the one used during the study 
(i.e., subject ID). They will be transferred to a Sanofi site (or a subcontractor site) which can be 
located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards 
for protecting subject confiden tiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 and  Section 14.5). 
9.5 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
See also Section  4.2.3 
The primary endpoint will be the mean absolute ch ange from baseline in percent predicted FVC at 
52 weeks. FVC is a widely used measure of pu lmonary function and dise ase status in patients 
with IPF. Percent predicted FVC is a reliable, va lid, and responsive measure of clinical status and 
a decline of 2-6% represents a small but clinically important differe nce. Regarding disease 
progression, a decline in % predicted FVC greater th an or equal to 10% at 24 weeks was shown to 
be associated with a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of mortality over the subsequent year, 
whereas a decline of 5-10% conferred a more than twofold increase in the risk of 1-year mortality 
(26) (27). 
Secondary and exploratory efficacy outcome meas ures will address other aspects of disease 
progression and will include rate of deaths, rate of lung transplantations, rate of hospitalizations, 
and rate of acute exacerbations. Finally, the extent of lung fibrosis and the effect of drug treatment 
on fibrosis will be measured using a specific scoring system on lung HRCT.

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
 
It is preferred that all study visits take pl ace in the morning when fasting blood samples are 
required.  The study visits occur on the planned dates (relativ e to the first injection), as scheduled. The visit 
schedule should be adhered to within the ± 2 day visit window.  If a patient is prematurely discontinued from tr eatment, all assessments planned at the End of 
Treatment visit should be performed.  
Prior to all screening assessments, after discussion of participation in the study, the written 
consent form (including voluntary participation in  pharmacogenetic testing and for future use of 
samples) must be signed and dated. 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the heading of a single visit 
in this protocol, it is possible for them to be perfo rmed over more than 1 site visit if necessary, as 
long as the screening visit window prior to Day 1 is respected. Patients that fail screening for 
exclusion criteria, e.g. concomitant medications, required drug-specific discontinuation periods or laboratory tests, may be rescreened for study eligibility 1 additional time (refer to Section  8.4 for 
further instructions related to rescreening). 
10.1.1 Visit 1: Screening (D-28 to D-1) 
Following a discussion of participation in the clinical trial, inform ed consent must be obtained and 
documented. These steps precede any study procedures. 
The following procedures will then be performed: 
• Call IVRS to assign a patient number 
• Record patient demographic information 
• Assess eligibility by review of Inclusion /Exclusion Criteria. This includes the review of 
prior and concomitant medications 
• Commence AE reporting 
• Patients who do not meet these inclusion/ex clusion criteria should not continue the 
screening process and a screen failu re call should be done in the IVRS

• All efforts should be made to reassess in a clin ically relevant timeframe (using either local 
or central lab) the clinical significance of lab abnormalities and corrective actions before 
making a decision of permanent discontinua tion of the IMP for the concerned patient. 
• Any code breaking requested by the Investigator will lead to permanent treatment 
discontinuation 
• At the specific reque st of the Sponsor 
Any abnormal ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for confirmation before making a 
decision of permanent discontinuation of  the IMP for the concerned patient. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to  recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol, whiche ver comes last. 
If possible, and after the permanent discontinuation of treatment, the patients will be assessed using the procedure normally planned for the la st dosing day with the IMP (End of treatment 
visit/Visit 9) and then will be asked to come to the scheduled on site visits for safety monitoring and respiratory function a ssessment (FVC and DLCO). 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the Investigator in the

10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason. 
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end-of-study 
visit (Visit 10). Then, patients w ill receive a phone call from Investigators at week 52 for vital 
status assessment.   
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Inve stigator should make the best effort to contact 
the patient (e.g. contactin g patient’s family or private physicia n, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to dete rmine his/her health status, includi ng at least his/her vital status. 
Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (e.g. times and 
dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
The statistical analysis plan will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary endpoints will be considered. 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessar ily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
Intensity of an AE is defined as: 
• Mild: no modification of daily activities and does not require mandatory 
corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Moderate: hinders normal daily activities and/or requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Severe: prevents daily activities and requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
 Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
 reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
 be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the  patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
 treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

o Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
- Severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. an aphylaxis, allergic bronchospasm [see 
APPENDIX D for the clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis]) 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
o ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN. See A

o Acute exacerbation of IPF 
o Suicide attempt or any even t suggestive of suicidality 
o Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling) 
o Bullous cutaneous eruptions 
o Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study  
o Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study (only if judged unusual/significant by the Inve stigators in studies assessing specifically 
the effect of a study drug on these diseases). 
o If any suspected transmission of an infec tious agent via a medicinal product (e.g. 
product contamination).   
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or non-ser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the Investigator to th e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further pre-specified investigation/monitoring in order to characterize and understand them. 
Adverse events of special interest may be ad ded or removed during a study by protocol 
amendment.

o Defined as an AESI 
o Instructions for AE reporting are summarized in TABLE  2. 
10.4.4 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of a SAE, the Investigator must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after 
approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to 
further document any SAE that is fatal or life threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the 
e-CRF system does not work. 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her  to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team.

10.6.2.1 Local injection site reactions  
Local injection site reactions th at are considered as non-allerg ic events should be further 
characterized and evaluated with the assessment of the severity grading of related symptoms such 
as corresponding for pain, tenderness, erythema /redness, swelling, itching or other (See APPENDIX 
E).  Special e-CRF screens will need to be completed.  If such an AE was to occur, then do not

10.6.3 Systemic allergy reaction 
10.6.3.1 Anaphylaxis 
Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Acute allergic reactions may be defined as allergic reaction-mediated signs and symptoms 
experienced by patients during or shortly after the pharmacologic or biologic agent is given. 
These reactions may present in a variety of ways, including dizziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, 
hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticar ial/angioedema, flushing, nausea, or vomiting. 
Anaphylaxis may represent the most severe form of infusion reaction, but these events may also 
occur via other immune-mediated mechanisms (e.g .cytokine-mediated). Allergic reactions may 
begin within few hours and persist up to 24 hours post dosing. Refer to APPENDIX D “Definition 
of anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical  criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. 
Patients should be monitored by site  personnel or visiting nurse (if injection performed at patient’s 
home) for at least 30 minutes after each administration of investig ational product for any signs or 
symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction.  
[For Czech Republic only, per local requirement: Patients should be monito red at the study site 
by site personnel for at least 2 hours after the first administra tion of IMP and at least 1 hour after 
the next 5 administrations for any signs or symptoms of a hypersens itivity reaction. For the 
subsequent IMP administrations, patients should be  monitored by site pe rsonnel or visiting nurse 
(if injection performed at patient’s home) for at  least 30 minutes after each administration of 
IMP.] Patients should be treated sympto matically if any AEs are obser ved. General Allergic Reaction 
and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form will have to be completed.   Sometimes transient injection s ite reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, requiring no 
intervention and being of dubious significance. Th ese reactions would not be considered to be 
allergic reactions, and should only be record ed on the Local Injection Site Reaction

an allergic event related to IMP. Refer to Section  10.4.1.3 for hypersensitivity reactions to be 
reported as AESIs, and to Section  10.3 for hypersensitivity reactions requiring permanent 
treatment discontinuation. 
10.6.3.2 Allergic adverse event with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic  origin or injection 
site reactions which progress/ex pand/worsen/etc. should be evalua ted by a dermatologist as soon 
as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event.   
The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc.) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs.  An uns cheduled Central Laboratory assessment for 
hematology, chemistry, liver pane l, PK, and ADA should be obtained. If it is possible, the site will 
take pictures of the skin lesions in order to pr ovide the patient with them for the dermatologist’s 
visit. If the photos are obtained, then copies s hould be kept as source documents which may later 
be collected by the sponsor. The Investigator will provide a summary of the patient's case, reason for consultation, and informati on being requested to the consulting dermatologist.   
A full consultation report should be sent by the dermatologist to the Investigator.  The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following info rmation; a detailed desc ription of the skin 
reaction (such as the morphology [lesion type], shape of individual lesions, arrangement of multiple lesions [e.g. scattered, grouped, linear], distribution, color, consistency, presence of 
pruritus or pain, and other clinical signs) a nd, in case a skin biopsy was done based on the 
dermatologist’s or Investigator’s medical judgment , the results of this investigation (including 
histopathology and immunoflurosecence) , with, if applicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE to be 
reported in the verbatim. The Investigator will email or fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring Team Representative within 24 hours.   
10.7 ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 
All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and included in the final clinical study report.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 71 11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately 300 patients will be  randomized in this study, 100 per treatment group.  Based on 
the enrollment in prior studies of this population a pproximately half of the patients are expected to 
be older than 65.  
The sample size calculations are based on the pr imary efficacy variable of % predicted FVC 
change from baseline to week 52, with the following assumptions:  
• A common standard deviation of  12% is assumed based on the data from previous trials 
(26) 
• A 5 % mean difference between each dose and placebo in change from baseline in % 
predicted FVC 
• A 2-sided 5% significance  level with 80% power 
Ninety two (92) patients per treatment group will yield 80% power to detect a 5 percentage point 
difference between the treatment groups and plac ebo.  Additional patients will be randomized in 
each regimen to allow for dropouts; therefore, ap proximately 100 patients w ill be randomized into 
each treatment group, for a total sample size of approximately 300 patients for the study. 
As a rank-based method will be used for anal ysis the actual power may differ from these 
calculations, however, calculations based on the ASCEND study ( 28), which used the same 
analysis method and endpoint confirm that the planned analysis should have at least 80% power.  No adjustment is made for multiplicity since a hierarchical testing procedure is proposed.  
Calculations were made using nQuery Advisor 7.0 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patient who met the inclusion criteria and signed the 
informed consent.  
Patients treated without being ra ndomized will not be considered as randomized and will not be 
included in any efficacy population.   For any patient randomized more than once, only th e data associated with the first randomization 
will be used in any analysis population. The sa fety experience associated with any later 
randomization will be assessed separately.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 72 The safety experience of patients treated and not randomized will be reported separately, and 
these patients will not be in the safety population. 
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
11.3.1.1 Modified intent-to-treat population 
The primary population for analysis will be the modified ITT (mITT) population: ITT population 
with an evaluable primary endpoint. This will consist of all patients who receive at least 1 
injection of investigational medicinal product, have a valid baseline % predicted FVC 
measurement, and have at least one pos t-baseline % predicted FVC measurement. 
11.3.2 Safety population 
Safety population - the population considered for the safety analysis will be the as-treated 
population defined as randomized population who did actually receive at least 1 dose or part of a 
dose of IMP analyzed according to the treatment actually received.   
In addition:  
• Non randomized but treated patie nts will not be part of th e safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately.  
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety  population as randomized. 
• For patients receiving more than 1 study tr eatment during the trial, the treatment group 
allocation for as-treated analysis will be the one received at the majority of injections 
11.3.3 Pharmacokinetic analysis population 
The population for all PK and ADA analysis will be all randomized and treated patients having at 
least one sample. 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by 
actual treatment received within the safety population.

SAR156597-DRI11772  Version number:  1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 73 11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
Duration of IMP exposure is defined as:  last dose date – first dose date + 14 days, regardless of 
unplanned intermittent discontinuations.   
11.4.1.2 Compliance  
A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol.  No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data. 
Treatment compliance, above-p lanned and under-planned dosing pe rcentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, Mean, SD, Medi an, Min, and Max). The percentage  of patients with compliance 
<80% will be summarized. In addition, number and percentage of patients with at least 1 above-
planned dosing administration will be given, as well as the number and percentage of patients 
with 0, (0, 20%), and >20% unde r-planned dosing administrations. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s) 
Due to the non-normality of the endpoint distri bution, a two-sided rank-based analysis of 
covariance (rank ANCOVA) model adjusted for ba seline, will be used to compare the primary 
efficacy variable between each ac tive treatment group and placebo: 
 Change from baseline in the % predicted FVC at Week 52 
The rank ANCOVA will be performed as follows: 1. The first step of the analysis is to compute the standardized ranks of the response variable 
(change from baseline in % predicted FVC at Week 52) and covariate (baseline % predicted FVC)  
2. The second step is to perform the ANCOVA analysis based upon these ranks.  Within the 
ANCOVA each active treatment group will be compared to placebo using a contrast.  
In the primary analysis, Week 52 assessments will be used regardless of whether the patient has 
previously discontinued treatment.  For patients with missing data at week 52, the week 52 value 
will be estimated based on a linear regression using all available % predicted FVC measurements.  Predicted changes greater than zero (increases above baseline) will be set to zero.  For patients with no Week 52 value due to the patients death (or transplant), the value for analysis will be assigned the lowest (worst) rank. Sensitivity analys es including an analysis of the on-treatment 
data only will be described in the statistical analysis plan.

Disease progression, defined as decrea se in absolute % predicted FVC ≥10%, or decrease in 
absolute % predicted DLCO ≥15%, or lung transplant, or death will be analyzed as a time to event 
variable.  Patients not meeting the definition for disease progression will be considered censored 
at the time of their week 52 FVC assessment.  For patients with a missing FVC assessment at week 52 the censoring time will be the time of the last measured FVC or DLCO assessment.   
The time to disease progression will be compared  between each active group and placebo using a 
log-rank test.  The hazard ratio compared to  placebo will be estimate d from a Cox proportional 
hazards model. 
The incidence of all-cause mortality will be calculated, but no hypothesis testing will be 
performed for this endpoint. 
11.4.2.3 Multiplicity considerations 
The overall type I error rate for this study is 5%.  A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the type I error over the two doses.  The qw dose group will be compared to placebo first, 
and only if this comparison is significant w ill the q2w dose group be compared to placebo. 
The same procedure will be used for the diseas e progression endpoint if significance is achieved 
for both doses on the primary endpoint. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
The summary of safety results will be presented by treatment group on the basis of the safety population.  
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population using the following common rules: 
• The baseline value is defined generally as the last available valu e before randomization. 
• For quantitative safety parameters based on central laboratory/reading measurements, 
descriptive statistics will be used to summarize results and change from baseline values by 
visit and treatment group. 
• The analysis of the safety variables will be essentially descriptive and no hypothesis testing is planned. 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined 
criteria/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  the Sponsor for clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG.

H.A. Sampson et al – J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2006; vol 117, n°2: 391-7. 
 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one  of the following 3 criteria are fullfilled: 
Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (e.g. generalized hives, prur itus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING 
a Respiratory compromise (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
b Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula 
b. Respiratory compromise (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy, abdominal pain, vomiting) 
Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic 
BP* 
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's 
baseline 
PEF, peak expiratory flow; BP, blood pressure 
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is  defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg = [2 x a ge]) from 1 to 10 
years and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

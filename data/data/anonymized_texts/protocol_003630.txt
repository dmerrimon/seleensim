Protocol 
Subject Selection 
A total of 100 participants will be selected who are at 35-41 weeks of pregnancy. Inclusion criteria include 
nulliparity and age between 18 and 35. Women with clinical or histological chorioamnionitis, rupture of 
membranes >12h, abnormal vaginal discharge, or positive uterine cultures for β-strep, gonorrhea, trichomonas 
or syphilis will not be considered. Women who are color blind or on any medication that affects the sympathetic 
nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) or with a BMI >35 pre-pregnancy will be excluded. 
Subject Enrollment 
Participants will be recruited by at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital clinical practices and advertising. 
Clinicians will acquire from their patients written or verbal consent-to-approach to be contacted by study staff 
for participation in the study. Study staff will also recruit through internet and newspaper advertising, flyers and 
the BWH Center for Clinical Investigation’s Research Study Volunteer Program (RSVP for Health).  Women 
will meet with study staff at least 24 hours before the inpatient study to review inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
receive answers to questions about the study protocol and sign the consent form. 
Participants will be randomized at admission to blue/green wavelength or red wavelength light by the 
investigator or her designate. We will encourage women to participate in Protocol 2; if they decline, we will 
offer enrollment in Protocol 1. 
Study procedures 
The study will begin at least one week before the inpatient admission. Dr. Klerman or her study representative 
will meet with the prospective volunteer to review the study, answer questions and have the volunteer sign the 
consent form.  At that time or approximately one week before the inpatient admission, Dr. Klerman or her 
designate will (i) give the volunteer a wrist-worn activity and light exposure monitor (actigraph) to wear 
through the end of the inpatient stay; and (ii) give the volunteer a sleep/wake log to complete. If the volunteer 
does not wish to wear the actigraph, Dr. Klerman or her designate will meet with her at least 24 hours before the 
inpatient to review the procedures and sign the consent form. For Protocol 1 only, all subjects will be asked to 
collect their urine at home for the 24 hours immediately before starting the inpatient experiments.  Instructions 
for collection of the urine samples will be provided to the participants. 
The inpatient experiments will be conducted in the inpatient Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) on pod 9A 
or 9B of the BWH Towers. These facilities are staffed 24-hours per day and the nurses and technicians are 
trained in all the procedures to be performed except uterine tocometry and fetal monitoring. Since the uterine 
contraction data are collected and used only for research purposes and not for diagnosing maternal or fetal 
distress, the data collection will be monitored either by a non-clinician member of the research team or an 
Obstetrical nurse or ObGyn resident or fellow. Fetal assessment will be conducted by the physician-investigator 
at admission prior to the start of the study interventions. 
Participants will be admitted in the afternoon and kept in dim light (<15 lux). An IV will be inserted into a 
forearm vein if blood sampling will occur. A small amount of heparin will continuously flow through the IV 
line to keep it patent, per BWH CCI guidelines, and as previously approved for other IRB Protocols (e.g., 
2007P-000566). Hematocrit or hemoglobin levels will be checked; if values are below 30% (Hematocrit) or 
10.8 (Hemoglobin), only saliva sampling will occur. Uterine tocometry will occur starting ~6 hours before 
habitual bedtime through ~10 hours after habitual bedtime. An external uterine tocometer will be applied.   
We will collect blood approximately every 30 minutes and saliva approximately every 60 minutes and 
questionnaires about uterine contractions and subjective alertness will be given. Blood samples will be collected 
through an IV catheter. Saliva samples will be collected by having participants spit into a test tube. Starting at 
most 3 hours before their habitual bedtime, participants will be exposed to up to 5,000 lux blue/green or red 
light source (Protocol 1: random assignment at admission; Protocol 2: all women will be exposed to red light) 
for four hours. Therefore, participants will go to sleep approximately 2 hours after their usual bedtime. During 
this time, we will try to standardize posture (request that she remains seated) and timing of bathroom breaks 
(request that the bathroom use be at a specified time) across all participants; the participant, however, may 
change posture and use the bathroom at any time she desires. We will collect all urine samples produced in the 
CCI.The samples will be used to assay melatonin metabolites. Room lights will remain at < 15 lux until they go
to sleep (approximately 2 hours after their habitual bedtime) when lights will be turned off. During sleep,
tocometer and (if more than 5 contractions per hour) fetal monitoring and IV sampling will continue but saliva
collection and questionnaires will end. The tocometer and fetal monitor will remain until the participant
awakens. For Protocol 1 only, sleep will be monitored using polysomnography. Surface electrodes are taped
and/or glued to specific locations on the subject’s face, head and torso in order to allow the recording of brain
wave activity (EEG), horizontal and vertical eye movements (EOG), heart rate (ECG), and muscle activity
(EMG). The recordings will be collected on an ambulatory digital recorder. The digitized data will be used for
both spectral analysis and sleep stage scoring. Additionally, surface electrodes may be used around the
abdomen to record uterine muscle activity externally. Approximately eight hours later, participants will be
awoken. For Protocol 1, the IV and actigraphy will be removed and the participant will be discharged. The total
amount of blood to be withdrawn should be ~28 ml (14 hours *2/hour*1 ml/sample). For Protocol 2, the IV and
wrist-worn activity and light monitor will remain.  The participant will be free to do as she wishes within the
BWH room until 2 pm.  At 2 pm, the events of the first night will be repeated. The experimental light will be
randomized to red or blue/green light upon admission; this design enables each women to be their own control
(i.e., red light exposure on night 1).  Upon awakening from the second night, the IV and wrist-worn activity and
light monitor will be removed. The total amount of blood to be withdrawn should be ~<50 ml (28 hours*2/hr*1
ml/sample except we will not take samples during 10 am-2 pm).
Approximately two weeks after due date, we will review the medical records to determine the date and clock 
time of delivery and date and clock time of onset of labor.  We will use this information to monitor whether the 
study might have any effect on these measures. 
Biostatistical Analysis 
Primary analyses 
Blood, urine and/or saliva samples will be sent for assay for melatonin and other sleep, circadian rhythm, and 
pregnancy-related hormone concentrations. 
A trained technician, nurse or physician will review the tocometer reading and count the number of contractions 
per 30 minutes after excluding artifacts. 
The actigraph will be reviewed for sleep/wake times and light exposure. 
Secondary analyses 
Statistical analyses will be performed for each of the measures collected every 30 minutes: number of 
contractions from tocometer, melatonin concentration, number of contractions from questionnaires, subjective 
alertness from questionnaires. 
For Protocol 1: 
1.mixed-model longitudinal analyses with light exposure condition (i.e., red vs. blue/green) as the
fixed conditions and participant as the random condition;
2.3-way ANOVA in the 2 hours before light exposure begins vs. 2 hours after light exposure in the 2
lighting exposure conditions.
For Protocol 1: 
1.mixed-model longitudinal analyses with light exposure condition (night 1 vs. night 2) as the fixed
conditions and participant as the random condition;
2.3-way ANOVA in the 2 hours before light exposure begins vs. 2 hours after light exposure in the 2
lighting exposure conditions.

About this consent form  
Please read this form carefully.  It tells you important information about a research study.  A 
member of our research team will also talk to you about taking part in this research study.  
People who agree to take part in research studies are called “subjects.”  This term will be used 
throughout this consent form. 
Partners HealthCare System is made up of Partners hospitals, health care providers, and 
researchers.  In the rest of this consent form, we refer to the Partners system simply as 
“Partners .” 
If you have any questions about the research or about this form, please ask us.  Taking part in 
this research study is up to you.  If you decide to take part in this research study, you must sign 
this form to show that you want to take part.  We will give you a signed copy of this form to 
keep. 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,  as required 
by U.S. Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the 
Web site will include a summary of the results.  You can search this Web site at any time. 
Why is this research study being done? 
The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of light on pregnant women’s uterin e 
contractions and alertness.  Light is known to decrease levels of the hormone melatonin that may 
affect uterine contractions near the end of a pregnancy. We are asking you to take part because 
you are a healthy pregnant woman.  We expect 100  pregnant women to participate in the study.

How long will I take part in this research study?  
The expected time to complete this study is approximately one week at home and then less than 
one day at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH).  You will stay in a room a t the BWH 
from approximately 2 pm on one day through approximately 9 am the next day. 
What will happen in this research study?  
At least one week before your inpatient stay we will meet with you.  We will discuss the study 
with you and answer questions you may have.  If you agree to participate, you will sign this 
consent form. 
Approximately one week before your inpatient stay we will meet with you. We will then give 
you an actigraph, a wrist-worn device that will monitor your activity and light exposure levels. 
You will wear this all the time day and night except when you are in the bath, showering, or in a 
pool. We will also give you a sleep/wake diary to complete about when you sleep (night or day) 
for the week. You will be asked to collect urine samples at home for the 24 hours immediately 
before starting the inpatient stay. We will give you instructions for how to do this. 
On the day of your inpatient stay, at approximately 2 pm, you will come to the BWH.  You 
should bring your urine samples. We will record your height, weight, blood pressure and heart 
rate.  We will ask some questions about your pregnancy and measure the baby’s heartrate. 
Starting about 4 hours before you usually go to sleep, we will put a strap around your stomach to 
monitor uterine contractions; the strap will remain for approximately 16 hours.  We will put an 
IV tube into your arm; the IV tube will allow us to draw blood samples approximately every 30 
minutes. The IV tube will remain until you leave the next day.  A sterile solution with small 
amounts of heparin will flow slowly through the IV tube to keep the tube open. We will ask you 
to provide saliva samples by spitting into a test tube approximately every 60 minutes. We will 
collect all urine that you produce during your inpatient stay. We will also ask you to complete 
questionnaires approximately every 30 minutes about how alert you feel and about any uterine 
contractions you feel. You will complete these questionnaires and the saliva collection until you 
go to sleep and then again after you awaken the next day. 
During the study, we will monitor your sleep using polysomnography (PSG), which measures 
brain electrical activity using electroencephalograph (EEG), eye movement using 
electrooculograph (EOG) and muscle-movement activity using electromyograph (EMG) and 
heart rate using electrocardiograph (ECG). EEG measures your brain waves so we can see what 
your brain is doing when you are asleep and awake.  EOG and EMG measures eye movements

and muscle -movement activity which changes depending on your sleep and wake states and 
allows assessing the different stages of sleep. For the PSG recordings, we will:  
 
 wash your head and face with special soap and with alcohol  
 put small electrodes (sensors) with wires attached to them on your sc alp, face and chin 
which will be used to measure EEG, EOG and EMG.  
 attach the sensors with tape or with special glue.  
 put 2 sensors on your chest for ECG.  
 
We may also apply small electrodes around your abdomen to record uterine muscle movement.  
  
A few hours before you usually go to sleep, we will turn on some lights in the room.  The lights 
appear normal, red or blue/green.  The lights will remain on for approximately 4 hours.  During 
this time, we may ask you to stay seated; if you need to change pos itions you can. We may also 
ask you to have a bathroom break at specific times so that the posture pattern is the same for all 
participants.  After that time, the lights will return to their previous appearance and brightness. 
We will collect all urine sam ples produced during your time at the BWH.  
 
At approximately 2 hours after your usual bedtime, we will turn off all lights and you can try to 
go to sleep.  The IV will remain in your arm and the strap will remain around your stomach.  
Approximately eight  hours later,  we will awaken you, turn on the lights, remove the IV, remove 
the actigraph, and give you a final questionnaire. The study will then end.  We recommend that 
you not  drive home after the study ends; we will pay for transportation or you should arrange for 
someone to pick you up.  
 
The blood, saliva, and urine samples will be tested for the amounts of melatonin and other sleep, 
circadian rhythm, and pregnancy -related hormones.  
 
There are video cameras and audio intercoms in the research area. Thes e are for safety 
monitoring only; no recordings will be made. You cannot use any of your personal light -emitting 
electronic devices including your mobile phone, computer or tablet while you are in the study 
room. You will not have access to the internet or  phones while you are in the room.  
 
We will review your medical records approximately two weeks after your due date (1) on what 
dates and at what clock time did your labor begin and (2) on what d ate and clock time  your baby 
was born. We want to know this i nformation to monitor whether your study visit may have 
affected the time and date of delivery.  
 
We reserve the right to end your participation at any time.  You retain the right to end your 
participation at any time.

What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research 
study?  
1) The risks of light exposure at night are reduced sleepiness when awake and increased
problems falling asleep.  There are no known risks of light exposure related to pregnancy.
The light levels you will see are less than those outdoors during the day.
2) There may be some discomfort or bruising on initial insertion of the catheter into a vein,
but wearing the catheter should not be painful. To help keep the venipuncture site clean, a
portion of the forearm hair may be cut before insertion of the IV catheter. Occasionally,
there is a black and blue mark at the site of the IV insertion, which may last a couple of
weeks; and, rarely, a small scar may remain permanently at the venipuncture site. There
is also the possibility of fainting during or after the procedure.
3) There may be some side effects from the use of heparin; such as bleeding.
4) There is a rare possibility of developing a small blood clot, inflammation, or local
infection around the vein where the catheter is inserted, or in rare cases a generalized
infection spread through the bloodstream as a result of the IV tube.
5) Occasionally, mild discomfort may occur from the IV tube in the vein. If this happens,
we will either reposition it or remove it entirely, asking permission before any subsequent
reinsertion.
6) The amount of blood drawn should not significantly alter blood volume, although there
may be a small decrease in the red blood cell concentration (hematocrit). However, the
total amount of blood drawn over the course of the study (less than 100 ml) is less than
the amount normally drawn during a ~ 1 hour blood donation. Hematocrit levels will be
checked before the study starts.
7) You will be able to read paper-based materials and listen to music; you will not be
allowed to use any electronic devices that might emit light (e.g., TV, laptop, tablet,
mobile phone while receiving the experimental light exposure.
8) After the experimental light exposure, you may experience something called an after-
effect. This is a temporary condition that will last for a few minutes afterward, in which
items viewed in white light may be tinted with the complementary color (i.e., a greenish
tint after red light exposure). After a few minutes, color vision will return to normal. Such
exposure to light of a specific color has no known long-term effects on color vision.
9) The tape and paste used to apply and remove the electrodes for EEG may cause some
minor discomfort and/or skin irritation. The glue used to hold electrodes to the scalp may
leave a flaky material in your hair for several days.
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?

There are no immediate benefits from participating in this research study.  You may experience a 
temporary decrease in the number and/or strength of uterine contractions or you may not.  You 
may feel more alert and/or less sleepy or you may not. 
If light does reduce the number and/or strength of contractions, then it may be a relatively safe, 
inexpensive and easy to use method for decreasing uterine contractions for pregnant women 
before their labor and delivery of the baby begins. 
What other treatments or procedures are available for my condition? 
There are no other treatments or procedures for normal term uterine contractions in healthy 
pregnant women. 
Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don’t take part in this 
research study, or if I stop taking part?  
Yes.  Your decision won’t change the medical care you get within Partners now or in the future. 
There will be no penalt y, and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now or have a right to 
receive. 
Taking part in this research study is up to you.  You can decide not to take part.  If you decide to 
take part now, you can change your mind and drop out later.  We will tell you if we learn new 
information that could make you change your mind about taking part in this research study. 
What should I do if I want to stop taking part in the study? 
If you take part in this research study, and want to drop out, you should tell us.   We will make 
sure that you stop the study safely.  We will also talk to you about follow-up care, if needed. 
Also, it is possible that we will have to ask you to drop out of the study before you finish it.  If 
this happens, we will tell you why.  We will also help arrange other care for you, if needed. 
Will I be paid to take part in this research study? 
You will be paid $25 for wearing the actigraphy and completing the sleep/wake diary for 
approximately one week and $ 500 for completing the 24 hour urine collection and the overnight 
stay. We will also reimburse your reasonable travel and/or parking costs.

About this consent form  
Please read this form carefully.  It tells you important information about a research study.  A 
member of our research team will also talk to you about taking part in this research study.  
People who agree to take part in research studies are called “subjects.”  This term will be used 
throughout this consent form. 
Partners HealthCare System is made up of Partners hospitals, health care providers, and 
researchers.  In the rest of this consent form, we refer to the Partners system simply as 
“Partners .” 
If you have any questions about the research or about this form, please ask us.  Taking part in 
this research study is up to you.  If you decide to take part in this research study, you must sign 
this form to show that you want to take part.  We will give you a signed copy of this form to 
keep. 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,  as required 
by U.S. Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the 
Web site will include a summary of the results.  You can search this Web site at any time. 
Why is this research study being done? 
The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of light on pregnant women’s uterine 
contractions and alertness.  Light is known to decreased levels of the hormone melatonin that 
may affect uterine contractions near the end of a pregnancy. We are asking you to take part 
because you are a healthy pregnant woman.  We expect 40 pregnant women to participate in the 
study.

How long will I take part in this research study?  
 
The expected time to complete this study is approximately one week at home and then  two nights 
(including the day in between)  at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH).  You w ill stay in a 
room at the BWH  from approximately 2 pm on one day through approximately 9 am two days 
later. 
 
What will happen in this research study?  
 
Approximately one week before your inpatient stay we will meet with you.  We will discuss the 
study with you and answer questions you may have.  If you agree to participate, you will sign 
this consent form. We will then give you an actigraphy, a wrist -worn device that will monitor 
your activity and light exposure levels. You will wear this all the time day an d night except when 
you are in the bath, showering, or in a pool. We will also give you a sleep/wake diary to 
complete about when you sleep (night or day) for the week.  
 
On the day of your inpatient stay, at approximately 2 pm, you will come to the BWH.  W e will 
record your height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate.  We will ask some questions about 
your pregnancy and measure the baby’s heartrate.  Starting about 4 hours before you usually go to 
sleep, we will put a strap around your stomach to monitor u terine contractions; the strap will 
remain for approximately 16 hours  between approximately 4 pm and 8 am .  We will put an IV 
tube into your arm; the IV tube will allow us to draw blood samples approximately every 30 
minutes. The IV tube will remain until you leave two days later .  A sterile solution with small 
amounts of heparin will flow slowly through the IV tube to keep the tube open. We will ask you 
to provide saliva samples by spitting into a test tube approximately every 60 minutes  when you 
are awake . We will also ask you to complete questionnaires approximately every 30 minutes 
when you are awake about how alert you feel and about any uterine contractions you feel. You 
will complete these questionnaires  and the saliva collection until you go to sleep  and then again 
after you awaken the next day.  
  
A few hours before you usually go to sleep, we will turn on some lights in the room.  The lights 
appear normal, red or blue/green.  The lights will remain on for approximately 4 hours.  During 
this time, we may ask you to stay seated; if you need to change positions you can.  We may also 
ask you to have a bathroom break at specific times so that the posture pattern is the same for all 
participants.  After that time, the lights will return to their prev ious ap pearance and brightness.  
 
At approximately 2 hours after your usual bedtime, we will turn off all lights and you can try to 
go to sleep.  The IV will remain in your arm and the strap will remain around your stomach .

Subject Identification  
Approximately eight  hours later, we will  awaken you, turn on the lights, stop blood and saliva 
collection, and remove the tocometer strap.  
 
You will then be free to do as you want in the room until approximately 2 pm that day.  Starting 
at 2 pm, we will repeat all the events that we did on the f irst night.  The lights may be the same or 
different.  
 
On the next morning, when we awaken you, we will also remove the IV and the actigraph, and 
give you a final questionnaire. The study will then end.  We recommend that you not drive home 
after the study ends; we will pay for transportation or you should arrange for someone to pick 
you up.  
 
We will collect all urine samples produced during your time at the BWH.  The blood, saliva, and 
urine samples will be tested for the amounts of melatonin and other sleep , circadian rhythm, and 
pregnancy -related hormones.  
 
There are video cameras and audio intercoms in the research area. These are for safety 
monitoring on ly; no recordings will be made.  
 
You cannot use any of your personal light -emitting electronic devices including your mobile 
phone, computer or tablet while you are in the study room  from 2 pm until the next morning on 
both days . You will not have access to the internet or phones while you are in the room  from 2 
pm until the next morning on both days . 
 
We w ill review your medical records approximately two weeks after your due date (1) on what 
dates and at what clock time did your labor begin and (2) on what date your baby was born. We 
want to know this information to monitor whether your study visit may have  affected the time 
and date of delivery.  
 
We reserve the right to end your participation at any time.  You retain the right to end your 
participation at any time.  
 
 
What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research 
study?  
1) The risks of  light exposure at night are reduced sleepiness when awake and increased 
problems falling asleep.  There are no known risks of light exposure related to pregnancy. 
The light levels you will see are less than those outdoors during the day.  
2) There may be some  discomfort or bruising on initial insertion of the catheter into a vein, 
but wearing the catheter should not be painful. To help keep the venipuncture site clean, a

portion of the forearm hair may be cut before insertion of the IV catheter.  Occasionally, 
there is a black and blue mark at the site of the IV insertion, which may last a couple of 
weeks; and, rarely, a small scar may remain permanently at the venipuncture site. There 
is also the possibility of fainting during or after the procedure.  
3) There may be some side effects from the u se of heparin; such as bleeding.   
4) There is a rare possibility of developing a small blood clot, inflammation, or local 
infection around the vein where the catheter is inserted, or in rare cases a generalized 
infection spread through the bloodstream as a result of the IV  tube. 
5) Occasionally, mild discomfort may occur from the IV tube in the vein. If this happens, 
we will either reposition it or remove it entirely, asking permission before any subsequent 
reinsertion.  
6) The amount o f blood drawn should not significantly alter blood volume, although there 
may be a small decrease in the red blood cell concentration (hematocrit). However, the 
total amount of blood drawn over the course of the study ( less than 100 ml ) is less than  
the am ount normally drawn during a ~ 1 hour blood donation.  Hematocrit levels will be 
checked before the study starts.  
7) You will be able to read paper -based materials and listen to music; you will not be 
allowed to use any electronic devices that might emit light  (e.g., TV, laptop, tablet, 
mobile phone from 2 pm until the next morning on both days.  
8) After the experimental light exposure, you may experience something called an after -
effect. This is a temporary condition that will last for a few minutes afterward, in  which 
items viewed in white light may be tinted with the complementary color (i.e., a greenish 
tint after red light exposure). After a few minutes, color vision will return to normal. Such 
exposure to light of a specific color has no known long -term effec ts on color vision.  
 
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?  
 
There are no immediate benefits from participating in this research study.  You may experience a 
temporary decrease in the number and/or strength of uterine contraction s or you may not.  You 
may feel more alert and/or less sleepy or you may not.  
 
If light does reduce the number and/or strength of contractions, then it may be a relatively safe, 
inexpensive and easy to use method for decreasing uterine contractions for pre gnant women 
before their labor and delivery of the baby begins.  
 
What other treatments or procedures are available for my condition?  
 
There are no other treatments or procedures for normal term uterine contractions in healthy 
pregnant women.

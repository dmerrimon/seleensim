TUDY CENTER(S)  This study will be conducted at approximately  60-90 study centers  
located in the United States.  
PHASE OF 
DEVELOPMENT  Phase 3.  
OBJECTIVES  Primary objective  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oliceridine in patients 
with moderate to severe  acute pain for which parenter al opioid 
therapy is warranted.  
 
Secondary objective  
 To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of oliceridine . 
STUDY DESIGN AND 
PROCEDURES  This phase 3, open -label, safety study in surgical and medical 
patients will be conducted in inpatient hospitals, outpatient hospital 
departments, ambulatory surg ical care centers , and emergency 
departments  (EDs) . Patients recruited in EDs may continue  
oliceridine treatment if hospitalized and parenteral opioid therapy is 
warranted . 
Representative  surgeries include orthopedic (eg, total hip 
replacement, total knee replacement, spine), abdominal (eg, upper  
or lower  abdominal, perineal), gynecologic (eg, total abdominal 
hysterectomy), vascular, soft tissue, and surgical procedural pain.  
Representativ e medical conditions include acute pancreatitis, acute 
exacerbation of existing noncancerous chronic pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, sickle -cell disease, inflammatory orofacial

confound the evaluation of oliceridine are excluded, such as acute 
pain without a specific etiology , undifferentiated acute a bdominal 
pain, acute breakthrough pain in palliative “end of life” care, and 
pain a ssociated with advanced cancer (somatic, visceral, or 
neuropathic)  or with concurrent use of chemotherapeutic  or 
biologic  agents  for the treatment of cancer . 
Representative ED conditions include visceral pain ( eg, renal colic, 
upper abdominal pain, abdomin al pelvic pain); nonvisceral pain 
(eg, traumatic and atraumatic acute musculoskeletal pain, chest 
wall pain, burns, orofacial pain/headache, cutaneous  and soft tissue 
pain); procedural analgesia (eg, reduction of orthopedic fractures 
and dislocations, absc ess incision and drainage); acute painful 
episodes associated with a medical condition (eg, sickle cell painful 
vaso-occlusive episode ). Oliceridine  will not be used to 
intentionally suppress a patient’s level of consciousness (procedural 
sedation and anal gesia  as defined by the American College of 
Emergency Physicians [ACEP]).  
The study has four phases: a screening/baseline phase, a treatment 
phase (consisting of a predose period and a dosing period), an 
end-of-treatment phase, and a follow -up phase.  
Scree ning/baseline phase  
Written informed consent will be obtained before any protocol -
related activities are conducted. All screening procedures will be 
completed within 14 days before the first oliceridine  dose.  Select 
standard of care assessments (eg , chemistry, hematology, urine or 
serum pregnancy test , urine  or serum toxicology screen, 
electrocardiogram ( ECG )) obtained before informed consent may 
be used as study data  if protocol specifications and timeframes are 
met. 
When screening and baseline proc edures are anticipated to occur 
within 48 hours of each other, they may be executed as a single 
procedure, unless the clinical condition of the patient has 
significantly changed since screening.  
Adverse events ( AEs) occurring from time of informed consent to 
the follow -up phase will be recorded in source and will also be

Adverse Events ( SAEs ) occurring from time of informed consent to 
the follow -up phase or 7 days after the last dose of oliceridine 
(whichever occurs later) will be recorded in source and eCRF ; 
ongoing SAEs after this time frame will be followed until the 
investigator, medical m onitor, and sponsor agree that the SAE is 
satisfactorily resolved. SAEs considered by the investigator to be 
related to oliceridine, regardless of the time of onset after treatment, 
should be reported . 
Prior medications taken or administered within the 14 days before 
the first dose of oliceridine will be recorded in source and will also 
be recorded in eCRF.  
Treatment phase  
The treatment phase begins with the predose period and ends when 
the investigator documents that the last dose of oliceridine  was 
admini stered  and that the patient will no longer be treated with 
oliceridine . 
The duration of treatment for each patient will be determined by the 
clinical need for parenteral opioid therapy . In current practice , 
parenteral opioids are used as -needed for up to several days . 
Although preclinical toxicology studies support intravenous ( IV) 
administration of oliceridine  for up to 14 days, it is unlikely that 
patients will receive oliceridine for that duration in the context of 
this study.  
Predose period  
Before dosi ng with oliceridine , vital signs (blood pressure, heart 
rate, respiratory rate ), oxygen saturation , and somnolence/sedation 
will be measured . Somnolence/sedation will b e measured using the 
Moline -Roberts Pharmacologic Sedation Scale  (MRPSS) . During 
the pre dose period, an additional, post -surgical ECG will be 
performed only in surgical patients.  Prior medications and 
AEs/SAEs will be recorded . 
Pain intensity  will be measured using a 0-10 point numeric pain 
rating scale (NPRS).  
Predose period procedures will occur within 30 minutes before the

period procedures (except the additional, post -surgical ECG 
performed only in surgical patients ) will be repeated.  
Dosing per iod 
Oliceridine IV infusion may be administered either by 
clinician -administered bolus, patient -controlled analgesia device 
(PCA), or both bolus and PCA, accord ing to the clinical situation.  
During  dosing with oliceridine , vital signs , oxygen saturation , and 
somnolence/sedation will be measured  at any and all times during 
the dosing period consistent with individual patient need and 
institutional standards of care  for a patient receiving a parenteral 
opioid . An ECG will be obtained 60 minutes after the first dose of 
oliceridine , and at every 24 hours of oliceridine treatment . Blood 
will be collected for oliceridine pharmacokinetics  and future 
cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotyping. Concomitan t 
medications and AE s/SAEs will be recorded.  
NPRS  assessments  will also be completed at 30 minutes 
+/-10 minutes after the first dose of oliceridine  and at any and all 
times during the dosing period consistent with individual patient 
need and institutional standards of care  for a patient receiving a 
parenteral opioid . 
End-of-treatment phase  
When the investigator documents that the last dose of oliceridine  
was administered  and that the patient will no longer be treated with 
oliceridine , the treatment phase is complete  and the 
end-of-treatment phase begins.  A physical examination will be 
performed at this time . 
Within  1 hour after completion of the treatment phase,  vital signs, 
oxygen saturation , and somnolence/sedation will be measured, and 
concomitant medications and A Es/SAEs will be recorded.  
Within 3 hours after completion of the treatment phase , blood will 
be collected for clinical laborator y tests . Concomitant medications 
and A Es/SAEs will be recorded.  
Patients will be observed for at least three hours after the last dose

patient to another facility takes precedence over study procedures . 
The Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) will be 
administered to detect symptoms of opioid withdrawal . If the 
patient is discharged or transferred before the time when the SOWS 
is to be performed, it will be performed one day after com pletion of 
the treatment phase and returned to the site by mail or in person.  
Follow -up phase  
A follow -up contact will be made between 2 and  3 days after 
completion of the treatment phase . The contact may be conducted 
in person or by telephone. Concomitant medications and AEs/SAEs 
will be recorded.  
The surgical procedure , medical diagnosis or ED diagnosis for 
which parenteral opioid therapy was warranted will be captured 
using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision 
(ICD -10) terminology.

Depending on the clinical considerations for which parenteral 
opioid therapy is warranted (eg , anticipated duration of therapy, 
clinical site /setting), a patient could receive oliceridine  using 
clinician -administer ed bolus dosing or PCA dosing. A patient  may 
receive both methods of administration.  
As in current practice, patient need, analgesic efficacy , and adverse 
responses will guide oliceridine  use. Consistent with current opioid 
prescribing practices for acute pain, oliceridine  should not be 
administered on a fixed, around -the-clock dosing schedule.  
The oliceridine dosing regimen should be initiated for each patient 
individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, 
patient response and prior analgesic treatment experience.  
Individually titrate oliceridine to a dose that provides adequate 
analgesia and minimizes AEs. Continually reevaluate patients 
receiving oliceridine to assess the ma intenance of pain control  and 
the relative incidence of AEs.  
Clinician -administered bolus dosing  
For clinician -administered bolus dosing, the oliceridine initial dose 
is 1 mg to 2 mg. If clinically indicated, a 1 mg supplemental dose 
may be administered as  early as 15 minutes after the initial dose. 
Subsequent doses are 1 to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours PRN based on 
individual patient need and previous response to oliceridine.  
In settings where rapid analgesia is targeted (e.g., ED or post -
anesthesia care unit ( PACU)), the oliceridine initial dose is 1 mg to 
3 mg. If clinically indicated, 1 mg to 3 mg supplemental doses may 
be administered every 5 minutes PRN. Subsequent doses are 1 to 3 
mg every 1 to 3 hours PRN based on individual patient need and 
previous resp onse to oliceridine.  
PCA Regimen  
For PCA dosing, the oliceridine regimen will consist of a loading 
dose, a demand dose, and a lockout interval without a continuous 
baseline infusion.

 Loading dose: 1.5 mg.  
 Demand dose: 0.5 mg.  
 Lock out interval: 6 minutes.  
If clinically indicated, throughout the treatment phase, a 1 mg 
supplemental dose may be administered PRN, taking into account 
the patient's utilization of PCA demand doses, individual patient 
need and previous response to olicerid ine. 
DURATION OF 
TREATMENT  The duration of treatment for each patient will be determined by the 
clinical need for parenteral opioid therapy. In current practice,  
parenteral opioids are used as -needed for up to several days.  
Although preclinical toxicology studies support IV administration 
of oliceridine  for up to 14 days , it is unlikely that patients will 
receive oliceridine  for that duration in the context of this study.  
PERMITTED AND 
PROHIBITED PRIOR 
AND CONCOMITANT  
MEDICA TIONS  Concomitant non -opioid analgesics are permitted. If a concomitant 
parenteral or oral opioid analgesic is used during the treatment 
phase, oliceridine  treatment will cease, and the patient will be 
discontinued early and will undergo the end -of-treatment phase and 
follow -up phase procedures as scheduled.  
Unless specifically prohibited, other medications are permitted, 
including common treatments of opioid -related adverse effects (eg, 
antiemetics, antacids, stool laxatives) and medications used to  treat 
underlying medical conditions . 
As with conventional opioids, prior and concomitant use of 
anxiolytics, sedative -hypnotics , or other potential CNS depressants

Confidential  Page 12 of 67 requires elevated vigilance, consistent with the Joint Commission 
Sentinel Event Alert for the safe use of opioids in hospitals  (The 
Joint Commission, 2012 ). Similarly, the perioperative use of 
epidural or intrathecal opioids prior to oliceridine  requires cautious 
administration and increased monitoring, consistent with the 
American Society of A nesthesiologists Task Force on Neuraxial 
Opioids and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain 
Medicine Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, and 
Management of Respiratory Depression Associated with Neuraxial 
Opioid Administration ( American Society of Anesthesiologists 
2016 ). 
Patients receiving  medications known to inhibit the CYP2D6 
enzyme or  potent cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors may 
require less frequent dosing of oliceridine . Given that oliceridine  is 
administered PRN , differential dosing instructions are not required 
for these patients.  
MAIN PARAMETERS 
OF SAFETY  AND 
TOLERABILITY  The safety and tolerability of oliceridine  will be measured as the 
incidence of self -reported or observed A Es, including those related 
to vital sign measurements, oxygen saturation measurements , 
somnolence/sedation scores , physical examination findings , and 
clinical laboratory assessments.  
MAIN PARAMETERS 
OF EFFICACY  Analgesic effi cacy will be measured using NPRS at the following 
time points:  
 During the predose  period.  
 30 minutes +/-10 minutes after the first dose of oliceridine . 
 At any and all times during the dosing period consistent with 
individual patient need and institutional standards of care  for a 
patien t receiving a parenteral opioid .

1.1 Background  
Inadequately treated pain has significant short - and long -term consequences, including prolonged 
emergency  department  stays, psychological disturbances, and dissatisfaction with medical care. 
Opioid analgesics like morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone are mainstays of acute pain 
management; however, their use is hampered by well -known adverse events (AEs) , such as 
respi ratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and sedation  (Lubawski, 2008 ) (Philip , 2002 ). 
Ultimately , the unmet medical need in acute pain therapy is an increased level of efficacy with 
acceptable tolerability.  
Beta-arrestin knock -out animals treated with morphine were shown to experience improved 
analgesic efficacy, less respiratory depression and less constipation , compared with  wild-type 
animals  (Bohn, 1999 ) (Raehal, 2005 ). This led to the hypothesis that analgesia and AEs are 
mediated by two distinct si gnaling pathways distal to the μ -opioid receptor and that a selective 
μ-opioid receptor ligand that stimulates G protein signaling without stimulating β -arrestin 
recruitment could be a better analgesic.  
Oliceridine  selectively binds to the μ -opioid recepto r with high affinity; however, oliceridine  is a 
G protein biased ligand at the μ -opioid receptor in that it stimulates G protein signaling without 
stimulating β -arrestin recruitment. In preclinical species, this biased signaling profile has led to 
potent a nalgesic efficacy , with less respiratory depression, slowing of gastrointestinal motility, 
and sedation, compared with morphine.  
To date, oliceridine  has been evaluated in phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. A total of 185 healthy 
subjects have received single intravenous ( IV) infusions of oliceridine  (0.15 mg to 7 mg), and 
40 healthy subjects have received multiple IV infusions  (<=4.5 mg every 6 hours; 4 mg every 
4 hours)  in phase 1 studies . At those dose s, oliceridine  was generally well tolerated. The most 
commonly reported AEs included  dizzin ess, nausea,  somnolence , and feeling hot .  
A total of 296 patients have received IV infusions of oliceridine  (0.5 mg to 4 mg) in two phase  2 
studies. At those doses, oliceridine  was general ly well-tolerated. The most commonly reported 
AEs were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and headache.  
Oliceridine  was evaluated for the treatment of moderate  to severe acute pain following 
bunionectomy in a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, pl acebo - and active -controlled, 
2-stage, adaptive -design , phase 2  study  (Viscusi, 2016 ). A total of 339 subjects received 
oliceridine  (0.5 mg to 4 mg every 3  or 4 hours ), morphine  (4 mg every 4 hours) , or placebo. The 
oliceridine  dosing frequency of every 4 hours was found to be suboptimal in the first stage of the 
study; thus, the frequency  was shifted to every 3 hours in  the second stage . Oliceridine  2 mg

Confidential  Page 23 of 67 (-1.4, P=0.0024) and oliceridine  3 mg (-2.4, P<0.0001) administered every 3 hours  and morphine 
4 mg (-1.3, P=0.0023) administered every 4 hours produced analgesic efficacy , as measured by 
time-weighted average change from baseline in numeric rating scale ( NRS ) pain intensity score s 
over 48 hours , compare d with placebo. In a pre -specified secondary analysis , oliceridine  3 mg 
resulted in significant improvement ( P=0.01 4) in NRS scores over 48 hours compared with 
morphine.  Furthermore, oliceridine  2 mg and 3 mg resulted in significant categorical pain relief 
following the first dose , compared with placebo ( P<0.0001) and morphine ( P=0.0005  and 
P<0.001, respectively). The majority of subjects rece iving oliceridine  >=1 mg reported 
stopwatch -method meaning ful pain relief.  The most frequently reported AEs following treatment 
with oliceridine  were nausea, dizziness, headache, and vomiting. AEs and their severity were 
generally dose related.  
Oliceridine  was evaluated for the treatment of moderate  to severe acute pain following 
abdominoplasty  in a double -blind, randomized, placebo - and active -controlled, phase 2 study.  
Study treatments were delivered by a patient -controlled analgesia  (PCA ) regimen, consisting  of a 
loading dose, deman d dose, and a lockout -interval . For the first half of the study, the oliceridine  
regimen was a 1.5  mg loading dose ( as two 0.75 mg  doses separated by 10 minutes ), 0.1  mg 
demand dose s, and a 6 -minute lockout interval. The morphine regimen was a 4  mg loading dose 
(as two 2 mg doses separated by 10 minutes ), 1 mg demand dose s and a 6 -minute lockout 
interval. As oliceridine  was not previously administered in a PCA regimen, a prespecified 
interim analysis was planned to adjust the oliceridine  PCA regimen after review of existing 
efficacy, safety and tolerability, and utilization data. Fo r the second half of the study, the 
oliceridine  demand dose was 0.35  mg with a 6 -minute lockout interval . Oliceridine  demonstrated 
statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo and similar efficacy to morphine 
(oliceridine  0.1 mg regimen red uced average pain scores [LS mean change in time -weighted 
average over 24 hours] by 2.3  points [ P<0.0001 vs. placebo]; oliceridine  0.35 mg by 2.1 points 
[P=0.0003 vs. placebo]; morphine, by 2.1 points [ P=0.0001 vs. placebo]). The mean oliceridine 
utilizati on over the 24 -hour treatment period for the 0.1 mg group was 7.6 mg, and for the 0.35 
group, 14.8 mg. Rescue pain medication use was similar for both oliceridine  (31% with 
oliceridine  0.1 mg, 21% with oliceridine  0.35 mg) and morphine (25%), and less than  half the 
rate for placebo (64%; post hoc P<0.0005 for all three active groups  vs. placebo ). For the 
purpose of this study, hypoventilation events were defined as apparent and persistently decreased 
respiratory rate, respiratory effort or oxygen saturation.  Oliceridine  had a significantly lower 
prevalence of hypoventi lation events , nausea, and vomiting than the morphine group (post hoc 
P<0.05 for both oliceridine  regimens vs. morphine) :

Oliceridine  preclinical and clinical data are summarized in the current investigator ’s brochure  
(IB).  
1.2 Rationale  
Consistent with the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) requirements for premarketing safety 
databases, the proposed population  in this clinical study  is sufficiently diverse to adequately 
represent the target population  (patients with moderate to severe acute pain for which parenteral 
opioid therapy is warran ted) (Food  and Drug  Administration, 2005 ). 
Consistent with the known pharmacological properties of oliceridine  and clinical observations 
obtained from completed studies  with oliceridine , essentially, only patients with 
contraindications to opioid therapy or other clinical considerations  confounding an interpretation 
of safety , tolerability , or efficacy data have been excluded. Eligibility criteria therefore support 
evaluation of oliceridine  in patients with a range of conditions warran ting parenteral opioid  
therapy , treated across a clinical trial environment characterized by diverse site topologies 
(institutions, investigators) within the United States , for variable durations of treatment . 
Oliceridine  will be administered as-needed ( PRN ) via the IV route. D epending on the clinical 
considerations for which parenteral opioid therapy is warranted (eg, anticipated duration of 
therapy, clinical setting), a patient could receive oliceridine  using clinician -administered bolus 
dosing , PCA, or  both bolus and PCA . 
1.3 Study Endpoint s 
1.3.1 Safety and Tolerability Endpoints  
The safety and tolerability of oliceridine  will be measured as the incidence of self -reported or 
observed AEs, including those related to vital sign measurements, oxygen saturation  
measurements , somnolence/sedation  scores , physical examination findings , and clinical 
laboratory assessments. Somnolence/sedation will be measured using the Moline -Roberts 
Pharmacologic Sedation Scale (MRPSS; see  Section  9.1) (Moline, 2012 ). The MRPSS is 
designed to provide a consistent method of assessing pharmacologic sedation and assist in the 
decision -making process regarding the administration of opioids, seda tives, and other agents 
which produce sedation. For patients receiving a parenteral opioid in current practice , intensive 
monitoring is the standard of care. This monitoring will be used in the current study to evaluate

Sentinel Event A lert for the safe use of opi oids in hospitals  (The Joint  Commission, 2012 ). 
1.3.2 Efficacy Endpoints  
The a nalgesic efficacy of oliceridine will be measured using a 0-10 point numeric pain rating 
scale ( NPRS , see Section  9.2). NPRS was selected given its  frequent use in clinical practice and 
clinical research  (McCaffery, 1989 ). The NPRS may be explained or shown to the patient, who 
responds by indicating a number ( Hjermstad , 2011 ). 
1.4 Risks and Benefits for Patients  
The potential benefit of study participation is  that patients may experience a reduction in pain as 
a result of treat ment with oliceridine . Patients will also contribute  to the clinical data set for 
oliceridine , an investigational product  (IP). No other benefits of participation are anticipated.  
The potential risks of study participation include  lack of analgesic efficac y, known or unknown 
serious or non -serious AEs, and unknown risks inherent in the evaluation of an IP. Additional 
risks are those associated with  medical evaluation, such as those associated with venipuncture.  
Oliceridine  preclinical and clinical data are summarized in the current IB. Investigator s must 
become familiar with all sections of the IB before the start of the study.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This phase 3, open -label, safety study will be conducted in inpatient hospitals, outpatient hospital 
departments, ambulatory surgical care centers , and emergency departments  (EDs) . Patients 
recruited in EDs may continue oliceridine treatment if hospitalized and parenteral opioid therapy 
is warranted.   
Representative surgeries include orthopedic (eg, total hip replacement, total knee replacement , 
spine), abdominal (eg, upper or lower abdominal, perineal), gynecologic (eg, total abdominal 
hysterectomy), vascula r, soft tissue , and surgical procedural pain.  
Representative medical conditions include acute pancreatitis, acute exacerbation of existing 
noncancerous chronic pain, musculoskeletal pain, sickle -cell disease, inflammatory orofacial 
muscle pain , and renal colic. Medical conditions that could confound the evaluation of 
oliceridine  are excluded, such as acute pain without a specific etiology , undifferentiated acute 
abdominal pain, acute breakthrough pain in palliative “end of life” care, and pain as sociated with 
advanced cancer (somatic, visceral, or neuropathic ) or with concurrent use of chemotherapeutic  
or biologic  agents  for the treatment of cancer . 
Representative ED conditions include visceral pain (eg, renal colic, upper abdominal pain, 
abdomina l pelvic pain); nonvisceral pain (eg, traumatic and atraumatic acute musculoskeletal 
pain, chest wall pain, burns, orofacial pain/headache, cutaneous and soft tissue pain); procedural 
analgesia (eg, reduction of orthopedic fractures and dislocations, absce ss incision and drainage); 
acute painful episodes associated with a medical conditio n (eg, sickle cell painful vaso -occlusive 
episode). Oliceridine will not be used to intentionally suppress a patient’s level of consciousness 
(procedural sedation and analg esia as defined by the American College of Emergency Physicians 
[ACEP]).  
The study has four phases: a screening/baseline phase, a treatment phase (consisting  of a predose 
period and a dosing period), an end -of-treatment phase, and a follow -up phase.

screening  
3.1.1 Screening/baseline phase  
Written informed consent will be obtained before any protocol -related activities are conducted. 
All screening procedures will be completed within 14  days before the first oliceridine dose. 
Select standard of care assessme nts (eg, chemistry, hematology, urine or serum pregnancy test, 
urine or serum toxicology screen, electrocardiogram (ECG)) obtained before informed consent 
may be used as study data if protocol specifications and timeframes are met  (see Section  3.6.1 ). 
When screening and baseline procedures are anticipated to occur within 48 hours of each other, 
they may be executed as a single procedure, unless the clinical conditio n of the patient has 
significantly changed since screening.  
Adverse events (AEs) occurring from time of informed consent to the follow up phase will be 
recorded in source and will also be recorded in eCRF if the patient receives oliceridine. Serious 
Advers e Events (SAEs) occurring from time of informed consent to the follow -up phase or 
7 days after the last dose of oliceridine (whichever occurs later) will be recorded in source and 
eCRF; ongoing SAEs after this time frame will be followed until the investig ator, medical 
monitor, and sponsor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved. SAEs considered by the 
investigator to be related to oliceridine, regardless of the time of onset after treatment, should be 
reported.  
Prior medications taken or administered  within the 14 days before the first dose of oliceridine 
will be recorded in source and will also be recorded in eCRF.  
3.1.2 Treatment phase  
The treatment phase begins with the predose period and ends when the investigator documents 
that the last dose of oliceri dine was administered  and that the patient will no longer be treated 
with oliceridine . 
The duration of treatment for each patient will be determined by the clinical need for parenteral 
opioid therapy. In current practice,  parenteral opioids are used as -needed for up to several days.

Confidential  Page 29 of 67 Although preclinical toxicology studies support intravenous (IV) administration of oliceridine for 
up to 14 days, it is unlikely that patients will receive oliceridine for that duration in the context of 
this study.  
3.1.3 Predose peri od 
Before dosing with oliceridine, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate), oxygen 
saturation, and somnolence/sedation will be measured. Somnolence/sedation wi ll be measured 
using the MRPSS. During the predose period, an additional, post -surgical ECG will be 
performed only in surgical patients.  Prior medications and AEs/SAEs will be recorded.  
Pain intensity will be measured using a 0 -10 point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS).  
Predose period procedures will occur within 30 minutes before t he first oliceridine dose. If the 
dosing period is delayed, predose period procedures (except the additional, post -surgical ECG 
performed only in surgical patients ) will be repeated.  
3.1.4 Dosing period  
Oliceridine IV infusion may be a dministered either by clinician -administered bolus, PCA, or 
both bolus and PCA, according to the clinical situation.  
During dosing with oliceridine, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and somnolence/sedation will be 
measured at any and all times during the dosing period consistent  with individual patient need 
and institutional standards of care for a patient receiving a parenteral opioid. An ECG will be 
obtained 60 minutes after the first dose of oliceridine, and at every 24 hours of oliceridine 
treatment. Blood will be collected f or oliceridine pharmacokinetics and future cytochrome P450 
2D6 (CYP2D6) genotyping. Concomitant medications and AEs/SAEs will be recorded.  
NPRS assessments will also be completed at 30 minutes +/ 10 minutes after the first dose of 
oliceridine and at any an d all times during the dosing period consistent with individual patient 
need and institutional standards of care for a patient receiving a parenteral opioid.  
3.1.5 End of treatment phase  
When the investigator documents that the last dose of oliceridine was admin istered  and that the 
patient will no longer be treated with oliceridine , the treatment phase is complete and the end of 
treatment phase begins. A physical examination will be performed at this time.  
Within 1 hour after completion of the treatment phase, vi tal signs, oxygen saturation, and 
somnolence/sedation will be measured, and concomitant medications and AEs/SAEs will be 
recorded.  
Within 3 hours after completion of the treatment phase, blood will be collected for clinical 
laboratory tests. Concomitant me dications and AEs/SAEs will be recorded.

medically -required transfer of an ED patient to another facility takes precedence over study 
procedures . 
The Subjective  Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) will be administered to detect symptoms of 
opioid withdrawal.  If the patient is discharged or transferred before the time when the SOWS is 
to be performed , it will  be performed  one day after completion of the treatment phase  and 
returned to the site by mail or in person.  
3.1.6 Follow up phase  
A follow up contact will be made between 2 and 3 days after completion of the treatment phase. 
The contact may be conducted in person or by telephone. Concomitant medications and 
AEs/SAEs will  be recorded.  
The surgical procedure, medical diagnosis or ED diagnosis for which parenteral opioid therapy 
was warranted will be captured using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision 
(ICD -10) terminology . 
3.2 Study Duration  
The duration o f treatment for each patient will be determined by the clinical need for parenteral 
opioid therapy. In current practice,  parenteral opioids are used as -needed for up to several days.  
Although preclinical toxicology studies support IV administration of oliceridine  for up to 14 
days, it is unlikely that patients will receive oliceridine  for that duration in the context of this 
study.  
3.3 Study Population  
The study population  consist s of patients with  moderate to severe acute pain for which parenteral 
opioid therapy is warranted . 
3.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Patient s must meet all the  inclusion criteria :  
1. Age >=18 years  at screening . 
2. Moderate to severe a cute pain for which parenteral opioid therapy is warranted , defined as 
NPRS pain intensity of >=4 during the pre -dose period . 
3. Able to understand and comply with the procedures and study requirements, and to provide 
written informed consent before any study procedure.

discharge  or transfer to another facility, that the patient will remain under the care of the 
investigator for at least three hours after the last dose of oliceridine . 
3.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Given that the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
oliceridine  in patients with moderate to severe acute pain for which parenteral opioid therapy is 
warranted, imprudent inclusion of unsuitable patients that would unduly increase patient risk or 
confound the evaluation of oliceridine  is not acceptable.  The stated exclusion criteria are not 
exhaustive and prudent clinical judgment must be applied.  
Patients must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria:  
1. Partic ipated in another oliceridine  clinical study.  
2. Clinically significant medical, surgical, postsurgical , psychiatric or substance abuse condition 
or history of such condition that would confound the interpretation of safety, tolerability , or 
efficacy  data in the study.  
3. Hemodynamic instability or respiratory insufficiency ; or requires a tracheostomy or 
mechanically assisted ventilation . 
4. If a surgical or medical patient, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA ) Physical 
Status Classification System score of IV or worse  (see Section  9.3) (American Society of 
Anesthesiologists, 2014 ); if an ED patient, Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage score of 1  
(see Section 9.4) (Gilboy , 2011 ). 
5. If an ED patient, a lcohol intoxication , acute substance impairment  or positive urine or serum 
toxicology screen . 
6. Advanced cancer in palliative or end -of-life care.  
7. Concurrent use of  chemotherapeutic or biologic agent s for the treatment of cancer.  
8. Another c urrent painful condition  (other than acute pain for which parenteral opioid therapy 
is warranted ) that would confound the interpretation of safety, tolerability , or efficacy data in 
the study .  
9. Clinical ly significant , immune -mediated  hypersensitivity reaction to opioids.  
10. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or positive urine or serum pregnancy test at screening.  
11. Hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 2 × upper limit of normal  [ULN], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] > =1.5 × ULN  AND alanine aminotransferase [ALT] >=1.5 × ULN ) 
or renal impairment (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] <= 29 mL/min/1.73 m2

3.4 Early Discontinuation  
All patients will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any  reason, and without prejudice. Every reasonable attempt should be made by the 
investigator to keep patients in  the study; however, patients must be withdrawn from the study if 
they withdraw consent to participate.  
If a patient  is discontinued early , the investigator will make every effort to complete  
end-of-treatment phase and follow -up phase procedures . 
An electronic case report form (eCRF)  should be completed for every patient  who receives 
oliceridine , whether or not the patient  completes the stud y. The reason for the early 
discontinuation should be indicated on this form . The following standard categories  should be 
used to select a primary reason for early discontinuation : 
 Adverse event : clinical or para-clinical  events occurred that, in the medic al judgment of 
the investigator for the best interest of the patient , are grounds f or discontinuation. This 
includes serious and non -serious AEs regardless of relation to the IP. 
 Lack of efficacy  
 Withdrawal of consent : the patient  desired to withdraw from further participation in the 
study in the absence of an investigator -determined medical need to withdraw. If the 
patient  gave a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded in the eCRF.  
 Investigator decision  
 Protocol deviation : the investigator or patient was noncompliant with study procedures 
or the patient did not satisfy the entry criteria for the study  
 Lost to follow -up: the patient  stopped coming for visits and study personnel were unable 
to contact the patient . 
 Other : the patient was discontinued for a reason other than those listed above, such as 
“dosing limit ”, pregnancy  or termination of study by the sponsor.  The reason(s) should be 
recorded in the eCRF .

Manufacturer  Trevena, Inc.  
Vial size  1, 2, 10 or 30 mL  
Route  IV 
Formulation  Injection  
Strength(s)  1 mg/mL as free base  
Oliceridine ( TRV130 fumarate for i njection ) is formulated as a sterile aqueous solut ion 
(1 mg/mL, as free base ) in a pH 7 solution containing L -histidine and mannitol.  
Oliceridine is provided as a sterile, clear, colorless  solution filled in  1, 2, 10, or 30  mL clear glass 
(type I) vials sealed with a coated rubber stopper, alum inum crimp , and flip -off plastic cap. The 
vial size(s) provided to the site will be determined by  vial availability and the planned use at the 
site (e.g., 30 mL vials will only be provided to sites using the PCA regimen).  
Refer to the Pharmacy and Oliceridine (TRV130) Medication Use Manual fo r the drug product 
stability, shipping , and storage conditions, and preparation instructions.  
3.5.2 Oliceridine Dosing  
3.5.2.1  General considerations  
Oliceridine  will be administered PRN via the IV route. Depending on the clinical considerations 
for which parenteral opi oid therapy is warranted (e g, anticipated duration of therapy, clinical 
site/setting), a patient could receive oliceridine  using clinician -administered bolus dosing or PCA 
dosing. A patient may receive both methods of administration.  
As in current practice , patient need, analgesic efficacy, and adverse responses will guide 
oliceridine  use. Consistent with current opioid prescribing practices for acute pain, oliceridine  
should not be administered on a fixed, around -the-clock dosing schedule.  
The oliceridine dosing regimen should be initiated for each patient individually, taking into 
account the patient's severity of pain, patient response and prior analgesic treatment experience.  
Individually titrate oliceridine to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and  minimizes AEs. Formatted:  Font color:  Blue

and the relative incidence of AEs . 
3.5.2.2  Dosing schedule  
3.5.2.2.1  Clinician -administered bolus dosing  
For clinician -administered bolus dosing, the oliceridine  initial dose is 1  mg to 2 mg. If clinically 
indicated, a 1  mg supplemental dose may be administered as early as 15 minutes after  the initial 
dose. Subsequent doses are 1  to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours PRN based on individual patient need 
and previous response  to oliceridine . 
In settings where rapid analgesia is targeted (e.g., ED or post -anesthesia care unit (PACU )), the 
oliceridine  initial dose is 1  mg to 3 mg. If clinically indicated, 1 mg to 3 mg supplemental doses 
may be administered every 5 minutes PRN.  Subsequent doses are 1 to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours 
PRN  based on individual patient need and previous response to oliceridine . 
3.5.2.2.2  PCA Regimen  
For PCA dosing, the oliceridine  regimen will consist of a loading dose, a demand dose, and a 
lockout interval without a continuous baseline infusion.  
Oliceridine  PCA regimen:  
 Loading dose: 1.5  mg. 
 Demand dose: 0.5  mg. 
 Lockout interval: 6 minutes.  
If clinically indicated , throughout the treatment phase , a 1 mg supplemental dose may be 
administered PRN, taking into account the patient's utilization of PCA demand doses, individual 
patient need  and previous response to oliceridine .   
3.5.2.3  Dosing Limit   
For the current study, the dosing limit for oliceridine will  be 60 mg in the first 12 hours. If a 
patient reach es this dosing limit within the first 12 hours , a PK sample will be obtaine d, the 
patient will early discontinue oliceridine and will be managed conventionally.  
3.5.3 Drug Inventory and Accountability  
The investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the numb er of IP units delivered to the site , 
dispensed to patients , returned to the investigator by site staff , returned to the sponsor , or any 
other disposition during and a t completion of the study. The IP must be  administered by an

who are enrolled in this clinical study . Investigators should maintain records that adequately  
document that patients  were provided the doses specified by the p rotocol and reconcile all IP 
received at the site before  final disposition . At the end of the study, or as directed, all study 
drugs, including unused, partially used, and empty containers  will be accounted for . 
3.5.4 Treatment Compliance  
Treatment consists of p arenteral opioid therapy  administered by qualified medical personnel. 
There is no oppo rtunity for self -administration outside of the confines of PCA , and the study 
drug is not dispensed to an enrolled patient  outside of the confines of the investigative site . 
3.5.5 Permitted and Prohibited Prior and Concomitant  Medications  
Prior medications  are defined as those taken before  the first dose of oliceridine . Concomitant 
medications  are defined as those taken after the f irst dose of oliceridine . 
Concomitant non -opioid analgesics are permitted. If a concomitant parenteral or oral opioid 
analgesic is used during the treatment phase , oliceridine  treatment will cease, and the patient will 
be discontinued early and will underg o the end -of-treatment phase and follow -up phase 
procedures as scheduled.  
Unless specifically prohibited, other medications are permitted, including common  treatments of 
opioid -related adverse effects  (eg, antiemetics , antacids, stool laxatives ) and medication s used to 
treat underlying medical condition s. 
As with conventional opioids, prior and concomitant use of anxiolytics , sedative -hypnotics , or 
other potential CNS depressant s requires elevated vigilance, consistent with the  Joint 
Commission Sentin el Event Alert  for the safe use of opi oids in hospitals  (The Joint  Commission, 
2012 ). Similarly, the perioperative use of epidural or intrathecal opioids prior to oliceridine  
requires cautious administration and increased monitoring, consistent with the Am erican Society 
of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Neuraxial Opioids and the American Society of Regional 
Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, and 
Management of Respiratory Depression Associated with Neuraxial Opio id Administration 
(American Society of Anesthesiologists 2016 ). 
Supplemental oxygen will be recorded as a prior and/or concomitant medication.  
3.5.6 Drug -Drug Interactions  
Both non -clinical and clinical data show that oliceridine is metabolized by both CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 , with each enzyme  contributing approximately 50% to the clearance of oliceridine .

  Version 5.0  
  14 Sep 2016  
Confidential  Page 36 of 67 The CYP2D6 enzyme is subject to significant genetic polymorphism which may affect the 
clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. For example, a bout 7 %-10% of the Ca ucasian 
population may have low functiona l levels of CYP2D6 in the liver  and are classified as “poor 
metabolizers”. The clearance of oliceridine  in subjects who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 
substrates is reduced by approximately 50% relative to extensiv e metabolizers. Patients who are 
taking concomitant medications known to inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme (eg , paroxetine , 
fluoxetine, quinidine, buprop ion) will have a similar reduction in oliceridine  clearance  compared 
to poor metabolizers . Patients who are CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers, or who are taking a 
concomitant drug known to inhibit the CYP2D6  enzyme , may require less frequent dosing of 
oliceridine . Given that  oliceridine  is administered PRN , differential dosing instructions are not 
required for these patients.  
Patients  receiving oliceridine concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg , clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ritonavir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfi navir, 
posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir,  telithromycin, voriconazole ) will also show a reduction in 
clearance of oliceridine  of about 50%.  These patients may require less frequent dosing of 
oliceridine . Given that oliceridine  is administered PRN , diffe rential dosing instructions are n ot 
required for these patients .

temperature. Temperature will be measured at screening and baseline onl y. 
3.6.2.3  Oxygen Saturation  
Oxygen saturation monitoring will be continuous but will be recorded at any and all times during 
the dosing period consistent with individual patient need and institutional standards of care for a 
patient receiving a parenteral opioid.  The date and time of initiation and discontinuation of 
continuous oxygen saturation monitoring will be recorded in the source documents.  
3.6.2.4  Somnolence/Sedation  
The MRPSS  will be used to measure somnolence/sedation ( Moline, 2012 ). This scale was 
developed to measure pharmacologic sedation in non -ICU patients, rather than many sedation 
scales that measure goal -directed sedation. Six levels describe the range of sedation from “non to 
minimal” to “general anesthesia”. Additionally, normal sleep is integrated into  these levels, as 
opposed to being positioned as a separate category , easing quantitative analysis  (Moline, 2012 ) 
(Pasero, 1994 ). 
3.6.2.5  Physical Examination  
The p hysical examination will include general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, 
ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, and nervous system. 
Clinically significant changes from screening/ baseline in the physical exami nation for a surgical 
or medical patient will not be recorded as AEs unless they are of greater severity and/or intensity 
than would be expected.

Clinical laboratories include  blood chemistry and hematology obtained using local labora tories 
and local laboratory range values.  
Chemistry includes: Albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
creatinine, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, lactate dehydrogenase, and uric 
acid.  
Hematology includes: h emoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC indices, mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet 
coun t (or estimate), and white blood cell (WBC) count including differential . 
Urine or serum toxicology includes any standard of care analytes at the institution where the 
study is being conducted.  
3.6.2.7  Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale  
Patients will be monitored for symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal. Acute opioid 
withdrawal reflects µ opioid receptor upregulation: pain, autonomic hyperactivity, bowel 
hypermotility, temperature instability, and psychological symptoms. Subjective symptoms may 
include physical symptoms (e.g., myalgias, nausea, diarrhea, chills) and psychological symptoms 
(e.g., cravings, insomnia, fatigue). Objective signs may include: tachycardia, hypertension, 
tearing, runny nose, yawning; vomiting; sweating, piloerection; agitation and restle ssness.  
The SOWS will be administered to detect symptoms of opioid withdrawal ( Handelsman , 1987 ). 
Patients will score each of 16 symptoms on an intensity scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 
(“extremely”).  
3.6.3 Pharmacokinetic Procedures  
PK samples will be collected at two times during the treatment phase : 
 Sample 1 at 30 minutes (+/- 10 minutes) after the first dose ; 
 Sample 2 between 1 and 2 hours after the first dose . 
For all samples, the actual sampling time will be recorded. Drug plasma concentration data  
collected in this study and detailed dosing times for each patient will be incorporated into a 
previously developed PK model in order to predict each individual’s oliceridine exposure.  
In addition to the scheduled PK sampling, an unscheduled PK sample will be obtained under the 
following circumstances:  
 If a patient reaches the dosing limit of 60 mg in the first 12 hours  (see Section 3.5.2.3 )

determination of a serious AE or a severe AE is sometimes retrospective, unscheduled 
PK samples obtained when an event tha t is suspected to be serious or severe are also 
permitted.  
3.6.4 Efficacy Procedures  
Analgesic effi cacy will be measured using NPRS (see Section  9.2) at the following time points:  
 During the predose  period.  
 30 minutes +/-10 minutes after the first dose of oliceridine . 
 At any and all times during the dosing period consistent with individual patient need and 
institutional standards of care for a patient receiving a parent eral opioid . 
3.6.5 Other Procedures  
A blood s ample will be collected for future 2D6 genotyping . The sample will be collected after 
the first dose of oliceridine  and before the conclusion of the e nd of treatment phase . It is 
recommended that this sample be collec ted at the time of the first PK sample .

The investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and SAEs, 
during scheduled safety and tolerability evaluations and whenever such information is brought to 
their attention. This section of the protocol provides definitions and detailed procedures to be 
followed.  
During each visit, the  investigator will question a patient about AEs using an open -ended  
question approach, making sure  not to infl uence that  patient’s answers, eg, "Have you noticed 
any change in your health?” or “How do you feel? .” 
4.1 Definitions and Criteria  
4.1.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient that is temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, regardless of its potential relationship to the medicinal product. 
An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintend ed sign, including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the IP, 
whether or not it is considered to be IP related. This includes any  newly occurring event or 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency from time of informed consent . 
Examples of an AE include:  
 Exacerbation of a pre -existing condition , including either an increase in frequency and/or 
intensity of the c ondition.  
 A ne w condition  detected or diagnosed.  
 Signs or  symptoms of a drug interaction.  
 Signs or  symptoms of a suspected overdose of either IP or a concurrent medication (overdose 
per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE).  
 A new laboratory abnormalit y that results in patient withdrawal from the study or medical 
treatment or further follow -up. 
NOTE : abnormal laboratory values obtained during screening  that preclude a patient from 
entering the study are not considered AEs, but they will be recorded.  
AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures ( ie, invasive procedures, modification of patient’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Symptoms or signs anticipated for a surgical or medical patient will not be recorded as AEs 
unless they are of greater severity and/or intensity than would be expected . Investigators will use

Confidential  Page 44 of 67 their clinical judgment in determining whether the symptoms or signs are of greater severity 
and/or intensity than would be expected.  
A medical intervention to address an AE  is an “action taken” and not an AE in itself.   
4.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A SAE or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
(a) Results in death.  
(b) Is life -threatening.  
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the d efinition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of d eath at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
(c) Requires hospitalization or prolongation of e xisting hospitalization.  
NOTE:  In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or ou tpatient 
setting. Complications that occur d uring hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other serious c riteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the  AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an SAE, nor is prolongation of ho spitalization for non -medically 
driven circumstances ( eg, transportati on issues).  
(d) Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance , such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) , which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
(e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
(f) Is an important medical event . 
NOTE:  Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening , or result in death or hospitalization , but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes

Confidential  Page 45 of 67 listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such 
events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note that the te rms “serious” and “severe” ARE NOT synonymous. The term “severe” is 
often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or 
severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significanc e (such as a severe headache). This is NOT the same as “serious,” which is based 
on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and are usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. A severe AE  does not necessarily 
need to be considered serious. For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may 
be considered  severe nausea but not an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a 
minor degree of disability may be consi dered mild  but would be defined as an SAE base d on 
the above noted criteria. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporti ng obligations.  
4.1.3 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as A dverse 
Events and S erious Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings ( eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments ( eg, vital signs) that are judged by the investigator as clinically significant 
will be recorded as AEs or SAEs , if they meet the de finition of an AE or SAE . Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are detected during 
the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen from time of informed consent  will 
be reported as AEs or SAEs . 
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
Liver chemistry thresholds have been desi gned to assure patient safety. When patients meet the 
hepatic transaminase threshold criteria (AST or ALT >=3 × ULN), the patient should undergo 
close observation, including monitoring for symptoms (clinical symptoms of hepatitis  or 
hypersensitivity, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, 
or rash) and hepatic function (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and fractionated bilirubin) at 
least every  48 hours, until symptoms and/ or hepatic function  abnormalities resolve, stabilize, or 
return to baseline values. This event must be reported to Trevena within 24 hours of learning of 
its occurrence.

traveled outside USA or Canada in past 3 months).  
 Serum creatine phosphokinase and LDH . 
 Record the appearance or worsening of cli nical symptoms of hepatitis, or 
hypersensitivity, fatigue, decreased a ppetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, 
fever, or rash , as relevant , on the AE report form.  
 Record the use of concomitant medications, including acetaminophen, herbal remedies, 
other over the counter medications, putative hepatotoxins, or alco hol on the concomitant 
medications report form.  
 The following are required for patients with AST or ALT >=3 × ULN and 
bilirubin  >=2 × ULN but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries:  
o Anti-nuclear antibody, an ti-smooth muscle antibody, and t ype 1 anti-liver kidney 
microsomal antibodies.  
o Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to 
evaluate liver disease.  
4.1.4 Evaluating A dverse Events and S erious Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed on two  descriptive parame ters: intensity and relationship to  the IP: 
 Intensity refers to the severity of an event and references impact on a patient ’s 
functioning.  
 Relationship refers to the likelihood that the event being assessed was caused by the IP.

Confidential  Page 48 of 67 4.1.4.1  Severity Rating  
Each AE will be classified according to the following criteria:  
Mild   Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated . 
Moderate   Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity . 
Severe   Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity . 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. An event is defined as 
“serious” when it meets one of the predefined outcomes as descri bed in Section 4.1.2 . 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the experience should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of 
days, those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
4.1.4.2  Relationship to Investigation al Product  
For AEs and SAEs, the relationship to study treatment is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions:  
Not R elated  There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and the 
suspected event.  
 
Unlikely Related  It is doubtful that there is an association between the study treatment and 
the suspected event. The event could have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
 
Possibly Related  The suspected AE may or may not fo llow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from study treatment administration. The event could have been produced 
or mimicked by the patient’s clinical state or by other modes of therapy 
concomitantly administered to the patient.  
 
Probably Related  The suspected AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study 
treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and 
cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
patient’s clinical state.  
When assessing the relationship to  the IP, the follow ing criteria will be considered:  
 Positive rechallenge .

intervention or treatment) . 
 Known class effect . 
 Biological plausibility . 
 Lack of alternative explanation —concomitant drug or disease . 
4.2 Reporting Procedures and Requirements  
4.2.1 Adverse Events  
AEs occurring from time of informed consent to the follow -up phase  will be recorded  in source 
and will also be recorded in eCRF  if the patient receives  oliceridin e. All AEs must be recorded 
irrespective of whether they are considered medication -related. All AEs that are potentially 
related to IP will be followed until resolution or database lock, whichever occurs first.  This 
includes any newly occurring event or pr evious condition that has increased in severity or 
frequency from time of  informed consent . 
Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing should be 
reviewed at s ubsequent visits as necessary. If these have resolved, this should be documented. 
Changes in intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as separate events ( ie, a new record 
started).  
The investigator should report all AEs on the AE page(s) of the eCRF and source documents, 
regardless of serious ness, severity,  and causality. Whenever possible, an AE will be reported 
using a diagnostic term, (eg, “common cold” or “upper respiratory infection” rather than “runny 
nose, cough, mild fever”) and should be described with the attributes  described in Section  4.1. 
4.2.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria ( see Section  4.1). If 
the AE is considered serious, the investigator should report this event to the sponsor . 
Additionally , a site using a local institutional review board (IRB) / Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)  will report the event to that  body  according to its standard operating 
procedures.  For sites using a central IRB/IEC, Trevena , or designee, will report to the central 
IRB/IEC . 
SAEs occurring from time of informed consent to the follow -up phase or 7 days after the last 
dose of oliceridine (whichever occurs later) will be recorded in source and eCRF ; ongoing SAEs 
after this  time frame will be followed until the investigator, medical monitor, and sponsor agree 
that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved. SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to 
oliceridine, regardless of the time of onset after treatment, should be re ported .

Confidential  Page 50 of 67 All information about SAEs will be collected and reported via the SAE form and sent by e -mail 
message (contact information will be contained i n the investigator site file). The investigator 
should send the initial report within 24-hours  of becoming aware of the SAE . At minimum, the 
initial report should include the following information:  
 Event  
 Serious criteria  
 Study code  
 Patient  number, initials , and date of birth  
 IP 
 Reporter name and contact information . 
In the case of a “minimum report” (one that solely comprise s the information bulleted above), a 
more detailed follow -up report should be sent as soon as more information becomes available but 
no later than 7 calendar days after t he date of the initial repo rt. Each SAE should be followed up 
until resolution or stabilization and , for reported deaths, the investigator should supply the 
sponsor  and the IRB/IEC with all the  additional information requested (eg, autopsy reports and 
terminal medical reports).  
The original SAE form should be kept at the study site. The sponsor or its representative will be 
responsible for determining and , in turn, reporting SAEs to regulatory authorities according to 
the applicable regulatory requirements.  
Trevena , or designee,  will be responsible for completing the safety report and for notifying the 
relevant authorities of any SAE as outlined in the  International Conference on Harmoni sation  
(ICH) guidelines and per local regulatory requirements. The investigator will also ensure th at the 
appropriate IRB /IEC  is notified of the SAE.  
4.2.3 Prompt Reporting of S erious Adverse Events 
Any SAE, occurring in a patient receiving treatment , or if the investigator becomes aware of any 
SAE p ost-treatment during the follow -up period, must be reported by the investigator to the 
sponsor  within 24 hour s even if the SAE does not ap pear to be medication related. This should 
be done by sending a n e-mailed copy of the SAE form , plus any other related information  to 
SAETRV130@vigilareintl.com . Additionally, it may be necessary for the medical monitor or 
sponsor to directly communicate with the investigator if additional information is required.  
During both business and non -business ho urs, the telephone numbers listed should be used if 
discussion with the medical monitor  is required :

4.3 Special Considerations  
4.3.1 Pregnancy  
All women of childbearing potential who participate in the study will be counseled on the need 
to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avo iding pregnan cy during study 
participation. Women should be instructed to contact the investigator or study staff immediately 
if pregnancy occurs or is suspected.  
Pregnancy testing will be conducted prior to administration of IP on female patients of 
child bearing potential . A woman who is found to be pregnant at screening or baseline will be 
excluded from the study and considered to be a screening failure.  
If a female study patient becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator must report the 
pregnanc y within 72  hours af ter learning of the pregnancy. The investigator should contact the

pregnancy on the designated pregnancy form provided by Trevena or its designe e. 
Early discontinuation visit assessments are required as soon as possible af ter learning of the 
pregnancy. The investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delive ry or 
termination if possible. These findings must be reported on the pregnancy form and forwarded to  
the designated individual(s). The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous 
abortion or a congenital anomaly.  
4.3.2 Individual Patient Stopping Criteria  
Oliceridine is a µ -opioid receptor agonist; therefore, effects on BP and res piration should be 
anticipated.  
As with conventional opioids , oliceridine  will be administered PRN ; for a patient, analgesia must 
be balanced with intolerability. In a situation of significant intole rability, temporary or 
permanent discontinuation may be warranted:  
 Asymptomatic decreased BP, increased HR, or decreased or increased RR may require 
only temporary discontinuation without additional intervention.  
 Symptomatic hypotension, tachycardia, advancing somnolence/sedation , or respiratory 
signs ( bradypnea, tachypnea, decreased respiratory effort, and/or decreased oxygen 
saturation ) require temporary discontinuation and may require additional intervention.  
 Symptomatic hypotension, tachycardia, ad vancing somnolence/sedation , or respiratory 
signs (bradypnea, tachypnea, decreased respiratory effort, and/or decreased oxygen 
saturation) requir ing urgent intervention also requires permanent discontinuation . 
 Possibly or probably related increase in QTcF to >= 500 milliseconds, or increase in 
QTcF of > 60 milliseconds versus most recent pre -exposure QTcF requires: permanent 
discontinuation; urgent clinical laboratory assessment and correction of electrolyte 
abnormalities ( eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hyp omagnesemia); and hourly ECG until 
QTcF < 500 milliseconds.  
Additionally, if a patient receives 60 mg of oliceridine within the first 12 hours,  the patient will 
early discontinue oliceridine and will be managed conventionally. The assigned reason for early  
discontinuation will be “other” and with the comment “dosing limit”  (see Section 3.5.2.3 ). 
4.3.3 Site Requirements to Ensure Patient Safety  
4.3.3.1  Management of Overdose  
Given  that oliceridine  will be administered by qualified medical personnel , and that t here is no 
opportunity for self -administration outside of the confines of PCA , the risk of overdose is 
considered to be low.

Confidential  Page 53 of 67 No specific antidote of oliceridine  is known; however, signs or symptoms of possible overdose 
should be treated supportively. While naloxone reversal of oliceridine ’s effects has not been 
established in humans, some pharmacological effects (analgesia) of oliceridine  have been shown 
to be re versed by naloxone in animals. Should an AE occur that necessitates reversal of 
oliceridine ’s effects, naloxone may be administered at its prescribed dose. Since the duration of

eCRFs  will be employed for this study.  Case report forms are considered confidential documents 
and should be h andled and stored accordingly. To ensure data accuracy, eCRF data for individual 
patient visits should be completed as soo n as possible after the visit. All requested information 
must be entered in the elect ronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The eCRFs may be signed by the investigator or a sub -investigator . These signatures serve to 
attest that the information contained in the eCRF is accurate and true.  
Completed eCRFs for this study will be forwarded to the sponsor , or its representative , where 
editing and construction of a quality -assured database will occur.  Data will be checked  for 
quality  and electronically verified after entry into the database . Queries will be issued for any 
inconsistencies, omissions, and discrepancies and will be resolved by the appropriate parties.  The 
statistical analysis of these data will be performed by the sponsor or its representative . All AEs 
will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA ) (Version  19.0). 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the latest version of the  World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary  (WHODD ) (World  Health  Organization, March 2016 ). Data 
management details will be outlined in a separate data management plan.

in vital sign  meas urement s, oxygen saturation measurements , somnolence/sedation  scores , 
physical examination  finding s, and clinical laborator y assessments  will be summarized  via 
descriptive summary statistics . 
Summary statistics for observed values and change from baseline values for vital sign  
measurement s, oxygen saturation measurements , somnolence/sedation scores , physical 
examination  finding s, and clinical laborator y assessments  will be summarized.  Baseline values 
are defined as the last measurements taken before the first dose of oliceridine . SOWS total scores 
will be summarized.  
Prior and c oncomitant medications will be summarized.  
6.4 Exposure  Analyses  
The total number of patients treated and the perce ntage of the overall sample treated by method 
of administration (bolus, PCA, both bolus and PCA) will be presented. Exposure data including 
date, time, and dose for each administration of oliceridine  will be listed for each patient and will 
include the tot al amount of oliceridine  administered using any method of administration within

with the protocol, GCP, and applicab le regulations and guidelines. The assigned clinical research 
associate(s) (CRA[s]) will visit the investigator and study site at periodic intervals and maintain 
periodic communication. The investigator agrees to allow the CRA(s) and other authorized 
Trevena personnel access. The CRA(s) will maintain current personal knowledge of the study 
through observation, review of study records and source documentation, and discussion of the 
conduct of the study wi th the investigator a nd staff. While on site  or through remote means , the 
CRA(s) will review the following:  
 Regulatory documents  
 Directly comparing entries in the EDC system with the source documents  
 Consenting procedures  
 AE procedures  
 Storage and accountability of IP and stu dy materials  
Examples of acceptable source documentation include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinic and office charts, laboratory notes, and recorded data from automated instruments, 
memoranda, and pharmacy dispensing records.  During the st udy, select eCRF data may be used 
as original data collection tools as long as a description of this documentation process is 
maintained in t he investigator’s study files.  
The CRA will ask for clarification and/or correction  of any noted inconsistencies. Procedures for 
correcting eCRF are des cribed in EDC  guidelines. As representatives of the sponsor, CRAs are 
responsible for notifying project management of any noted protocol deviations.  
By signing the Investigator’s Agreement, the investigator agrees to me et with the CRA(s) during 
study site visits; to ensure that study staff is available to the CRA(s) as needed; to provide the 
CRA(s) access to all study documentation and  to the clinical supplies dispensing and storage

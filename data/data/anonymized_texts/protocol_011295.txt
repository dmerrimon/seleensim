51Introduction
This document is a protocol for a human research  study. This study is to be conducted in accordance  with 
US government research  regulations, and applicable international standards  of Good  Clinical Practice, and 
institutional research policies  and procedures.
1.1 Background
1.1.1 Metastatic  Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is after lung cancer a leading cause of 
mortality in women. The majority of breast cancer related  deaths are a result  of complications from recurrent 
or metastatic disease.  As an initial  presentation, metastatic  breast cancer (MBC)  is uncommon, occurring in 
less than 10% of newly diagnosed cases [1]. However, up to 30% of the women who are initially  diagnosed 
with early stage breast cancer eventually  develop recurrent  or metastatic disease. In the metastatic  setting, 
treatment goals are generally to prolong life, control  symptoms, and maintain quality of life.  Many of these  
patients are likely to have experienced recurrences  after receiving prior adjuvant  chemotherapy  and/or 
endocrine therapy. A major  limitation  of treatments in the recurrent and metastatic  settings  is the high 
incidence of tumor resistance to endocrine  agents. Over the last decade therapeutic innovation has only 
resulted in modest improvements in survival rates [2]. It is therefore  clear  that novel therapeutic approaches  
and/or combinations are needed.
1.1.2. ER/PR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer and treatment options for 2nd line 
endocrine therapy
The majority of breast cancers  are hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancers. The prognostic and 
predictive value of hormone receptor status  has been well established.  Sensitivity to endocrine therapies is 
typically suggested by a long disease-free interval, a high level of estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) 
expression in tumors,  metastatic  disease  confined  to non-visceral sites and the absence of HER2 
overexpression/amplification. Although  there are limited data from RCTs  (randomized controlled trials), 
results from non-randomized trials  regarding the effects  of endocrine sequence  suggest that response to 
first-line therapy predicts response  to subsequent endocrine therapy. 
While there  is no optimized  treatment sequence  for hormonal therapies,  therapeutic options for second-line 
treatment of HR positive metastatic  disease have been  evaluated  in separate RCTs and include anti-
estrogens and aromatase  inhibitors (Table 1). Third  generation AIs are distinguished into non-steroidal  
(anastrazole and letrozole) and steroidal  (exemestane) AIs. With non-steroidal AIs now being widely used  in 
the adjuvant setting for postmenopausal women with HR positive breast cancer, the endocrine  options for 
first-line treatment  after relapse during or shortly after completion of adjuvant  therapy are fulvestrant 500 mg, 
steroidal AI, steroidal AI with everolimus or tamoxifen  (with or without everolimus).
Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist without known  agonistic properties that downregulates cellular levels of ER 
in a dose-dependent manner. In a phase III RCT,  the Comparison of Faslodex in Recurrent  or Metastatic  
Breast Cancer trial (CONFIRM) [3] two different doses of fulvestrant (given by intramuscular  injection)  were 
evaluated—the initially approved dose (250 mg every 28 days) and a higher dose regimen including a day 
14 loading dose (500 mg on days 0, 14, and 28, and every  28 days  thereafter).   Approximately 50% of 
enrolled patients had experienced relapse on adjuvant  endocrine therapy  or were  within 1 year from 
completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy. For patients who experienced relapse after more  than 1 year from 
completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy  or for patients presenting with de novo advanced disease, 
eligibility required a previous treatment  with either an antiestrogen (57.5% of patients) or an aromatase 
inhibitor (42.5%)  as a first-line therapy. High-dose fulvestrant  (500 mg monthly), as compared with standard  
dose fulvestrant, provided only a modest improvement  in median progression-free survival, from 5.5 to 6.5 
months (hazard  ratio, 0.80;  P = 0.006).  This improvement was less pronounced  in patients whose most  
6recent therapy  was an aromatase inhibitor (hazard  ratio, 0.85; P = 0.20) and in those who were considered 
to have had a response to the most recent endocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 0.85; P = 0.12).
Exemestane is an oral, steroidal irreversible inhibitor of aromatase. It did not show a difference in PFS in the 
international EFECT  trial of fulvestrant 250 mg versus exemestane [4]. Enrolled patients  were refractory  to 
letrozole or anastrozole, defined  as recurrence  during or within 12 months after the end of adjuvant 
treatment or progression during or within  1 month after the end of treatment for advanced disease. Prior  
additional endocrine or chemotherapy was allowed  and letrozole or anastrozole did not have to be the most 
recent treatment before randomization, approximately  15% of patients had received an anti-estrogen  (TAM 
or fulvestrant) and approximately  10% of patients had received chemotherapy (max  1 line) in the metastatic 
setting. 
In the fulvestrant versus  anastrozole Phase III trial North  American trial [5] the primary analysis  of time to 
progression (TTP) showed fulvestrant 250 mg to be at least as effective as anastrozole after failing one line 
of endocrine therapy  (96% of patients received  tamoxifen). 
It is therefore  evident that standard approaches (switch  to steroidal AI or fulvestrant) perform poorly  once 
acquired resistance is observed  and novel therapies for metastatic  disease are needed. The 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been 
implicated in HR positive cancers  and endocrine resistance [6]. This has led to studies combining various 
signaling inhibitors with aromatase inhibitors to enhance endocrine  responsiveness and delay, or even 
reverse resistance.
BOLERO 2 [7]: This trial evaluated the addition  of everolimus, which targets  mTOR, to a steroidal AI after 
failure of at least one prior endocrine therapy (letrozole or anastrozole (100%),  tamoxifen (48%), fulvestrant 
(16%) although 26% of patients  had also received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic  setting. The study 
showed longer PFS when  everolimus  is added to exemestane (published as 6.9 months for the 
combination versus 2.8 months for single  agent  exemestane). Final PFS data updated for San Antonio’s 
breast conference  2012  showed 7.8 vs 3.2 months PFS. 
This observed benefit  of the combination exemestane and everolimus  compares favorably with that of all 
alternative options, including fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg with a median PFS of 3.7 months and 
fulvestrant at 500 mg with a PFS of 6.5 months (see table below).   The BOLERO 2 results also compare 
favorably to those achieved by (first-line)  chemotherapy with capecitabine and taxanes or anthracyclines, 
with a median PFS of 6.2 months and 8.2 months, respectively, in patients with HR-positive disease 
(RIBBON-1, arms without bevacizumab [8]. Everolimus (Afinitor) therefore received FDA approval  for 
metastatic breast cancer in July 2012  based on the prolongation of PFS in combination with exemestane.  
However, the combination of exemestane and everolimus  was associated with a higher incidence of adverse 
events than exemestane alone, serious adverse events were  reported in 23% of participants.  The adverse  
events observed with everolimus  plus exemestane include stomatitis,  fatigue and asthenia, anemia, 
diarrhea, cough, dyspnea,  pneumonitis,  fever,  and hyperglycemia. Despite permitted dose interruptions 
and/or reductions, a high percentage of patients discontinued everolimus because of intolerability  (19% of 
patients) or withdrawal of consent (5%). 1% of patients in the everolimus arm died due to an adverse event.

1.2 Investigational  Agents
1.2.1 Exemestane 
Exemestane (trade name aromasin)  is an oral steroidal aromatase inhibitor  indicated  for the treatment of 
breast cancer in post-menopausal women. It is a synthetic androgen  analogue  (6-methylenandrosta-1,4-
diene-3,17-dione), which binds irreversibly to and inhibits the enzyme  aromatase,  thereby blocking the 
conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and the peripheral aromatization  of androgenic precursors  into 
estrogens, the main  pathway  providing  estrogen after menopause. Exemestane significantly lowers 
circulating estrogen  concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on adrenal  
biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone.
Aromasin was originally  approved in the US in 1999 for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in 
postmenopausal women whose tumors have stopped responding  to tamoxifen. On October  5, 2005,  the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration  approved  exemestane for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with 
estrogen receptor -positive early  breast cancer following two-to-three  years of tamoxifen based on the results 
of the Intergroup Exemestane Study [9], showing  superior DFS in a double-blind, multicenter, international 
clinical trial in 4724  patients  randomly  assigned  to either  continue  tamoxifen (20-30 mg/day) or switch to 
exemestane (25 mg/day) to complete a total of five years of adjuvant  hormonal therapy. The most  common 
adverse events on the IES that occurred  more frequently  on the exemestane arm included  hot flashes, 
fatigue, arthralgia, headache, insomnia, increased sweating, hypertension, and dizziness. Cardiac ischemic 
events occurred  in 1.6 percent of patients in the exemestane arm of the IES compared  to 0.6 percent of 
patients in the tamoxifen  arm. Changes  in bone mineral density (BMD)  were evaluated in a sub-study of the 
IES and in a supporting  safety study (027), which  compared the effects of two years of exemestane to 
placebo. Mean  decreases in BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck  were  more  pronounced with 
exemestane than with either tamoxifen or placebo. On the IES, osteoporosis was reported in 4.6 percent of 
patients treated with exemestane compared to 2.8 percent of patients receiving tamoxifen.
1.2.2 Cyclophosphamide
Cyclophosphamide (former trade  name cytoxan,  CTX) is a synthetic alkylating agent chemically related to 
the nitrogen mustards with antineoplastic  and immunosuppressive  activities. In the liver, CTX is converted to 
the active metabolites aldophosphamide and phosphoramide mustard, which  bind to DNA, thereby inhibiting  
DNA replication and initiating cell death.  While  conventional (high)  dose CTX is cytotoxic and a mainstay  of 
treatment in breast  cancer, it causes cytopenias  and is generally  considered as an immunosuppressive 
agent. 
Metronomic cyclophosphamide ("frequent and homogeneously spaced  low-dose"  
administrations)
1.3 Preclinical Data
In contrast, low dose metronomic  CTX can enhance  immune responses. Initially, preclinical models  provided  
evidence of the ability of CTX to selectively  deplete  regulatory T cells (Tregs), thereby improving anti-tumor 
immune responses (summarized in Table  2).

1.4 Clinical  Data  to Date
More recently low dose CTX has been studied in patients based on the preclinical evidence  discussed 
above. Extensive reviews of low-dose CTX in combination with immunotherapies demonstrate an excellent 
safety profile [19-21]. CTX (50 or 100 mg/d) is well tolerated even in elderly and/or heavily pretreated 
patients. Toxicities are usually grade I/II and manageable, only when combined  with bevacizumab, have 
severe adverse events (hemorrhagic complications)  been  reported. 
Several of the clinical trials confirmed immune modulating properties of low dose CTX; relevant studies  are 
summarized in Table  3. Numerous single agent  and combination studies have demonstrated some signs of 
activity, although most clinical studies reported are non-randomized. In small but randomized  studies CTX 
was confirmed  to be effective  and safe as both, single agent in refractory  solid tumors [22] and in 
combination with letrozole in the neoadjuvant  treatment  of ER positive  breast cancers  [23].

1.5 Dose  and Schedule Rationale
The beneficial anti-tumor effects of low dose CTX are mediated  by selectively depleting  circulating Tregs, 
thereby restoring  levels  to those seen in healthy volunteers  [24, 26]. Circulating Tregs are increased in 
patients with cancer (approximately 5% of circulating CD4 T cells) and have a higher proliferative capacity 
compared with healthy individuals [26]. Tregs  can exert functional  inhibition on tumor-specific T cells and 
blunt the innate arm of immunity by inhibiting  NK cell proliferation and effector functions.  Therefore, Tregs  
can limit the induction of anti-tumor immune responses, immune rejection  via innate and adaptive  
mechanisms and promote disease progression, all of which likely contribute  to the positive correlation of 
Treg –especially T cells infiltrating the tumor- with worse outcomes in a variety of solid tumors, including 
breast cancer [41]. 
Treatment of cancer patients with low dose CTX has been  shown to:
1.Selectively  deplete  Tregs, thereby restoring levels  to those seen in healthy volunteers , 
2.limit the suppressive  function  of remaining Tregs 
3.restore NK cell-dependent cytotoxicity (innate killing)
4.restore peripheral T cell proliferation
5.unmask pre-existing  (endogenous) tumor antigen-specific T cell responses
6.induce  T cell responses to endogenous tumor antigens
7.normalize proliferative ability of effector  T cells, especially CD8 T cells
8.increase Th17 cells
9.enhance vaccine  responses
These effects of CTX were  only seen at certain doses (for instance with CTX 100 mg/d but not with 200 mg/d 
as higher  doses depleted  lymphocytes in a non-selective manner and decreased NK cell-dependent  
cytotoxicity and T cell proliferation). 
Treg depletion is usually transient. With the CTX 50 mg daily for 3 months regimen  used by Ge et al [26], 
Treg numbers  were  reduced for 4-6 weeks, then rebounded to pre-treatment  levels at week  8, remaining at 
that level until the end of treatment; the proliferative capacity of Treg recovered as well. Interestingly, 
induced and unmasked anti-tumor  T cell responses continued to increase  throughout  the 3 months treatment  
period (despite an only transient decrease of Tregs) and correlated with clinical benefit.  In a study by 
Ghiringhelli et al utilizing CTX 50 mg BID 1 week on and 1 week off [24], Treg were significantly reduced at 4 
weeks, residual Treg had lost their suppressive function and T and NK effector  function were restored. As 
with continued  treatment  in the study by Ge, Treg numbers also returned to baseline  when measured 2 
months after stopping treatment in the study by Ghiringhelli.
While there  is no documented superiority of a specific immune modulating dose/regimen in patients, in the 
proposed clinical trial we will use CTX at 50 mg by mouth  daily on a continuous  basis, per schedule studied 
by Ge et al, as this regimen has shown a decrease in Tregs for the first 2 months, the induction of breast 
cancer antigen-specific immunity and was exclusively tested in breast cancer patients.  Furthermore  this dose 
and schedule  has been safely and effectively  combined  with an aromatase inhibitor  in the neoadjuvant 
setting for breast  cancer [23].
Rationale for the current  trial and the combination of exemestane with 
immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide  
11There is an unmet need  for therapeutics in hormone-receptor positive metastatic  breast cancer  after failure 
to respond to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors  or an antiestrogen.  The phase III RCTs in this setting (Table  
1) demonstrated that single agent exemestane  as second line treatment has low response rates in the 0.4-
6.7% range and a short  PFS of 2.8-3.7 months. It is therefore evident that standard  approaches perform  
poorly once  acquired resistance is observed and novel therapies  for metastatic  disease  are needed. Notably,  
the addition  of the targeted agent and mTor inhibitor everolimus to exemestane  in the Bolero 2 trial led to a 
significantly better outcome for patients  with a four month improvement of PFS over single agent 
exemestane alone (RR remained low at 7%). The benefit of the combination led to its regulatory approval in 
the US in 2012 and offers a new benchmark for clinical benefit in sequential hormonal  manipulation for 
metastatic breast  cancer. However, the significant toxicity of the combination regimen limits its generalized 
adaptation and patient compliance, with a dropout rate of 24% of patients receiving everolimus  [42].
In the current  trial we will investigate if exemestane combined with low dose CTX, a known 
immunomodulator, which is also the most commonly used metronomic chemotherapeutic and is 
exceptionally well tolerated [21], can provide  a significant clinical  benefit similar to that seen with 
exemestane + everolimus  in the Bolero 2 trial. Both regimens are available orally, but if successful, 
the exemestane + CTX combination would be a favorable  alternative  due to its cost-effectiveness  and 
tolerability, and a larger randomized trial would  be pursued.  
We hypothesize  that low dose CTX in combination  with exemestane  will result in a target  3-month 
PFS rate of > 75% (extrapolated  from median PFS of 6.9 months seen in the combination arm of 
Bolero 2). This expected  improvement  of PFS over exemestane alone is based on the following 
reasons: 
1.Both modalities have a distinct major mechanism of action  (with non-overlapping toxicities)
Exemestane, as discussed  above, is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, which reduces levels  of circulating 
estradiol via inhibition of its biosynthesis from androgen precursors.  CTX at low immunomodulating doses 
selectively depletes Tregs as discussed above, thereby restoring innate and adaptive anti-tumor  immunity. 
2.Both drugs have  the potential to diminish the pool and suppressor function of Tregs 
The Treg modulating potential of low dose CTX has been discussed extensively in Section 2.4; and may lead 
to the induction and/or unmasking of anti-tumor  immune responses  which  could provide a beneficial and 
long-lasting effects on tumor  control. 
Anti-estrogen therapies may also modulate Tregs. Endogenous estrogens at physiological (late follicular 
phase of menstrual cycle  and pregnancy) and pharmacological ranges have been shown to drive  expansion  
of CD4+CD25+ Tregs after their activation,  increase the expression of Foxp3 and IL-10 genes as well as 
stimulate the conversion  of CD4+CD25− T cells (which express  ER) into CD4+CD25+ T cells with similar  
regulatory function as naturally occurring  Tregs  [43-46]. As the conversion of CD4+CD25− T cells into 
CD4+CD25+ T cells stimulated by E2 could  be inhibited  by a specific inhibitor  of ER [47] and numbers  of 
Tregs generally decrease with lower  estradiol levels, it is possible that lowering circulating  estradiol levels via 
exemestane may contribute to a diminished  Treg pool in patients. In a rat model of human  arthritis, 
administration of anastrozole for instance suppressed  the differentiation of naive T cells to Tregs  as well as 
induced IFN-γ and IL-12 (Th1) and decreased levels  of IL-4 and IL-10 (Th2 cytokines) [48]. In elderly  breast 
cancer patients, neoadjuvant treatment with the non-steroidal AI letrozole  decreased intratumoral Tregs, 
especially in responding tumors, which was potentiated by the addition of daily low dose CTX at 50 mg/d, 
albeit not statistically significant [49]. 
3.Potential other mechanisms of action to overcome endocrine resistance  
It is not known if immunomodulatory CTX in combination with exemestane may overcome  endocrine 
resistance, however some  older studies suggest  that non-specific immune stimulation, for instance with IFN-
γ can restore antiestrogen sensitivity  and that the combination of IFN-α and tamoxifen had a greater  anti-
proliferative effect  on ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells than either  drug alone [50]. Pilot studies suggest that IFN-
β can improve clinical benefit in metastatic breast cancer,  and a planned study will test IL-2 and an 
antiestrogen [51]. 
12Importantly, based on two randomized trials performed in the neoadjuvant setting, the efficacy of the 
combination of letrozole with low dose  CTX is similar to the one observed with letrozole and 
everolimus, albeit with fewer side effects necessitating treatment interruption or dose reduction 
(Table 4).

1.6 Research Risks & Benefits
1.6.1 Risk of Study Drug
Expected adverse  events  (AEs) for low dose CTX and exemestane are listed in section 8. While  this is a 
greater than minimal risk study, exemestane (alone or in combination with everolimus)  is a standard of care 
regimen in the proposed setting, and the addition  of low dose CTX to an AI has not demonstrated  a 
significantly increased  rate of AEs in a randomized trial of preoperative letrozole  and CTX in breast cancer  
[23]. 
1.6.2 Other Risks  of Study Participation
Additional risks to study participation  are listed in the consent form and include breach of confidentiality,  not 
deriving benefit from the study treatments,  procedures performed  for research only (immune blood draws 
and tumor FNAs). Privacy protection procedures are in place and good clinical practice  guidelines are 
followed for the study to minimized risks associated with research procedures and participation.
1.6.3 Potential benefits
It is not known if participation in the study will be beneficial for the patient, although  it is anticipated that 
patients will derive clinical  benefit from the combination with prolongation of PFS based on the data 
discussed above. The major  theoretical benefits lie in a potentially as effective but less toxic alternative for 
exemestane + CTX (instead  of everolimus)  and the induction of a long-lasting protective anti-tumor immune  
response. 
1.7 Correlative  Studies Background
If funding is available, we plan to do the following correlative studies in all or a subset of trial participants to 
assess a baseline  status and changes with treatment. 
Phenotypic and functional  profile of peripheral lymphocytes  and myeloid lineages 
Low dose CTX treatment has beneficial  anti-tumor effects which have been attributed to relatively selective 
depletion of circulating  Tregs, thereby restoring  levels to those seen in healthy volunteers [24, 26]. Tregs can 
potentially exert functional inhibition of tumor-specific T cell activation and may also blunt the NK and innate 
13
arm of immunity through suppression of their effector functions. Therefore, Tregs can limit the induction of 
anti-tumor immune responses,  immune  rejection via innate and adaptive mechanisms and promote disease  
progression. It is therefore  reasonable to hypothesize that low dose CTX treatment enhances  anti-tumor 
immunity through selective depletion of Tregs, as has been previously suggested.  However, these studies 
were limited in their analysis  of Treg subsets and corollary effector T cell subsets. Further, the perturbations  
in other  regulatory  compartments, such  as myeloid suppressor cells or impact of CTX on the innate immunity 
could contribute  to its beneficial  effects.  As such, we propose  to assess the immune compartments in high 
resolution before and after CTX treatment to identify a profile that can provide both biomarker  signatures and 
mechanistic insights. These immune profiling studies of Tregs  and other lymphoid/myeloid subsets at 
baseline and selected  time points during treatment to confirm an effect of CTX by established flow cytometry 
based methodology  is described in section  6.3.
Examination of tumor  antigen-specific  CD4 and CD8 T cell responses 
Induction of tumor antigen-specific  immunity would imply  that the treatment facilitates cross-priming and/or is 
unmasked by the inhibition/depletion of Tregs. Antigen-specific immune  monitoring is more feasible than 
autologous whole tumor  cell monitoring and has been demonstrated to correlate  with clinical  benefit  in 
metastatic breast cancer, when Her2-specific CD4 T cell response was examined  during therapy with 
trastuzumab and chemotherapy [52]. Paraffin-embedded tumor  tissue (archived  or study entry)  will be tested 
for the expression  of five antigens:  1. PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen  of Melanoma), 2. WT-1  
(Wilms’ Tumor gene),  3. Her2, 4. NY-ESO-1 and 5. MAGE A3. These tumor  antigens (TAA)  are selected due 
to their expression in breast cancers (frequencies  listed in table below, based on which  >90% of patients will 
express at least 2 of the 5 antigens), inclusion of CTL epitopes and the availability  of overlapping peptide  
pools. In addition, pre-existing immune responses have been observed for some antigens  in breast cancer 
patients [53] and anti-tumor activity has been observed for some  antigens  when used for vaccination [54-57 ].

selected for T cell monitoring for a given patient. 
2Study  Objectives
2.1Primary Objective  
To estimate the median  PFS and PFS rate at 3 months with the addition of immunomodulatory doses of 
cyclophosphamide to exemestane in patients with ER and/or PR-positive, Her2-negative  metastatic breast 
cancer who progressed on endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant and/or tamoxifen.  
Patients treated with exemestane alone in a second line setting have a median PFS of 2.8 months; whereas 
patients treated with a combination of exemestane and everolimus have  a median PFS of 6.9 months with 
added toxicity based on the randomized Bolero  2 trial data. For the current trial a target 3-month PFS of > 
75% (based  on the assumption of an exponential  survival distribution and median  PFS of 6.9 months) is 
considered promising. Based on the data from Bolero  2 summarized above, the estimated PFS at 3 months 
on the combination regimen is 75% assuming that the distribution of progression free survival is exponential. 
[Calculations from PASS, NCSS, 2008, J. Hintze, Kaysville, Ut.]. 
2.2.Secondary  Objectives
14a.To estimate the response rate of the combination of exemestane and cyclophosphamide. 
Published data suggest  that patients treated with exemestane alone  or in combination with everolimus in 
a second line setting have  a RR of less than 10 %. 
b.To estimate  the clinical  benefit  rate (defined as objective response plus stable disease for at least 24 
weeks) of the combination  of exemestane and cyclophosphamide. 
c.To determine the adverse event profile in patients treated with exemestane and cyclophosphamide 
(CTCAE v 4.0).
2.3. Translational Objectives  (if additional funding  available)
i. To assess changes in circulating T regulatory  effector T cells and innate  subsets during combination 
treatment with exemestane and immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide.
ii.  To measure  changes in tumor  antigen-specific  T cells from baseline and during combination 
treatment with exemestane  and immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide.
iii. To assess if tumor-infiltrating T regulatory lymphocytes in archival paraffin embedded tumor 
specimens from either  the primary tumor  or metastatic disease is predictive of PFS. 
3Study  Design
3.1 General Design
This is a Phase II open label non-randomized single  arm trial of exemestane and cyclophosphamide to 
estimate the median  PFS and the PFS rate at 3 months in patients with metastatic ER/PR positive, HER2  
negative breast cancer who progress on at least one line of endocrine  therapy. The median progression-free 
survival estimated from the Bolero 2 trial for a single  agent exemestane is 2.8 months, whereas the 
combination exemestane + everolimus achieved  a median PFS of 6.9 months but added significant  toxicity. 
For the current trial a target  3-month PFS of > 75% (based on the assumption of an exponential survival  
distribution and median  PFS of 6.9 months) is considered  promising. With a single stage  design, we can 
reject the null hypothesis that the progression-free survival rate at 3 months is 50% or less versus that 
alternative that the progression free survival rate at 3 months is 75 % or greater with a alpha  of 0.05 and 
power of 80% with 23 patients enrolled  over 2-2.5 years.  If the number of patients  surviving progression-free  
at 3 months is 15 or fewer, then the regimen  will be rejected.  
3.2 Primary  Study Endpoints
The primary endpoint is Progression-free survival (PFS).   PFS is defined as the time from first treatment day 
until objective  disease progression or death from any cause. Assessment  of disease  progression (eg, tumor 
measurements as per RECIST 1.1) will be performed every 12 weeks on study.   
3.3 Secondary Study  Endpoints
Response rates and clinical benefit rates will be estimated using exact 95% confidence  intervals.  Changes 
from baseline in circulating T regulatory cells during combination treatment and in tumor antigen-specific T 
cells during treatment  will be summarized  using descriptive statistics at each time point and mixed  effects 
regression models to incorporate  repeated observations  within  a patient and missing data.
3.4 Safety Endpoints
Adverse events will be recorded  along  with grade (CTCAE v 4.0), attribution, onset, duration,  outcome and 
treatment if indicated. The proportions  of patients with various type/grade of adverse  events will be 
summarized and reported.

5Study  Drug  
5.1 Description
Cyclophosphamide (former trade  name cytoxan,  CTX) is a synthetic alkylating agent chemically related to 
the nitrogen mustards, which  at the low dose utilized in this study is an immunomodulatory agent.
Cyclophosphamide: Bioavailability >75% (oral)
Protein binding >60%,
Metabolism: Hepatic, CTX is metabolized  by cytochrome P450 (CYP2B6, 2C9 and 
3A4 (with 2A6, 2C8 and 2C19 making more  minor  contributions)), glutathione S-
transferase (GST) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)  enzymes
Half-life: 3-12 hours
Excretion: Renal
Exemestane (trade name  aromasin) is an oral steroidal aromatase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of 
breast cancer in post-menopausal women. It is a synthetic androgen analogue (6-methylenandrosta-1,4-
diene-3,17-dione), which binds irreversibly to and inhibits the enzyme  aromatase
17Exemestane: Bioavailability 42% (oral)
Protein binding 90%,
Metabolism: Hepatic, exemestane is metabolized  by cytochrome P 450 3A4 (CYP 
3A4) and aldoketoreductases. 
Half-life: 24 hours
Excretion: Renal and GI
5.2 Treatment  Regimen
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. A treatment cycle  is defined as 4 weeks (28 days).  
Exemestane: Exemestane will be given  as one tablet (25mg)  daily by mouth  (PO).  The first dose of 
exemestane should be given the same day as CTX. Dosing for patients on concurrent CYP3A4 inducers is 
detailed in section 5.6
Cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide will be given as one tablet (50mg) daily by mouth (PO). The first 
dose of cyclophosphamide  should  be given the same day as exemestane.
Patients who enroll into the study who have received  exemestane  with everolimus and have stopped 
everolimus due to intolerance, may resume exemestane throughout and start CTX once toxicities have 
resolved to Grade 1 or less. The day CTX is started is considered day 1 of the study. 
5.3 Dose  modifications
Exemestane: no dose modifications  planned
Cyclophosphamide: discontinue cyclophosphamide for grade 3 or greater cystitis,  neutropenia,  anemia 
or thrombocytopenia. Patients are allowed  to continue exemestane alone if they had to stop CTX due to 
toxicity
5.4 Preparation,  Storage and Administration of Study  Drug
Both, cyclophosphamide and exemestane are commercially available and will be prescribed by the treating 
physician and can be filled at a pharmacy. Patients will follow the study doctor’s  instruction, take exemestane 
25 mg po and CTX 50 mg po daily. Both, CTX and exemestane tablets should  be stored out of reach of 
children, at room  temperature  (25°C (77°F)); the temperature is not to exceed 30°C (90 F°). 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring
The patient will be requested to maintain a medication diary of each dose of medication.  The medication 
diary will be reviewed by study personnel at all study visits and returned to research staff at the end of study.
5.6 Concomitant  Therapy
Cyclophosphamide is minimally emetogenic when administered as a low daily oral dose. No prophylactic  
antiemetics are needed,  however, patients may be pre-medicated with prochloperazine  or an alternative 
antiemetic if clinically indicated.  Agent Dose Route Schedule Cycle Length
 Exemestane One 25mg tablet PO Daily continuously 28 days
 Cyclophosphamide One 50mg tablet PO Daily continuously 28 days
18No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than CTX,  exemestane and bisphosphonates  
may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.
As both, CTX and exemestane are metabolized  by cytochrome P450, physicians should be aware  of 
possible interactions  with other medicines with metabolism  by CYP450 and patients  should  report  all 
medications (prescription and nonprescription), herbal  remedies,  and vitamins to the study team. 

6 Per the January  2013  exemestane package insert the recommended dose of exemestane  for 
patients receiving a potent CYP3A4  inducer such as rifampicin  or phenytoin  is 50mg po daily.  
No significant effect on pharmacokinetics  of exemestane  is expected for inhibitors of CYP3A4 
such as ketoconazole. Study Procedures
6.1  STUDY CALENDAR
The following guidelines will be followed:
Screening/baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 6 weeks prior to start of therapy. 
Tumor evaluation  (eg, tumor measurements as per RECIST  1.1 by CT scan) will be performed every 12 
weeks on treatment, or earlier if medically  indicated. It is preferred  but not mandated to use the identical 
imaging technique throughout the study period.
Each treatment cycle  is 4 weeks (28 days).  The study calendar shows only 3 cycles, study procedures of 
subsequent cycles are identical (except research  bloods are optional). Patients  should  continue 
treatment until disease progression,  prohibitive toxicity,  or other reasons  listed in section 4.4.

6.2 .MEASUREMENT  OF ANTITUMOR EFFECT  (by RECIST 1.1)
For the purposes of this study,  patients should be re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks.  Confirmatory 
scans should be obtained  not less than 4 weeks  following initial documentation of objective  response.
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the 
revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors (RECIST) guideline  (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-
247, 2009].   Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor  lesions and 
the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST  criteria.
6.2.1 Definitions
Evaluable for objective  response.   Only those  patients who have measurable disease present  at baseline, 
have received  at least one cycle of therapy,  and have  had their disease re-evaluated will be considered  
evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease  progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
considered evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response .  Patients who have  lesions present at baseline that are evaluable 
but do not meet the definitions of measurable  disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease  re-evaluated will be considered  evaluable for non-target  disease.  The response 
assessment is based  on the presence,  absence,  or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
6.2.2 Disease Parameters
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions  are defined as those  that can be accurately  measured in at least 
one dimension (longest  diameter  to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest  x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or 
>10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements  must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal  
fractions of centimeters). Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously  irradiated area are not 
considered measurable. 
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable,  a lymph  node must be 
>15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up,  only the short axis will be measured and followed.
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short  axis), are considered non-measurable 
disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions,  lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal  masses (not followed by CT or MRI),  are 
considered as non-measurable.
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions  up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ  and 5 lesions in total,  
representative of all involved organs, should  be identified as target lesions and recorded  and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions  should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions  with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should  be those  that lend themselves  to 
reproducible repeated  measurements.  It may be the case  that, on occasion, the largest  lesion does not lend 
itself to reproducible  measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion  which can be measured  
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest  for non-nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.   The baseline sum diameters 
20will be used  as reference to further characterize any objective tumor  regression in the measurable dimension 
of the disease.
Non-target lesions.  All other  lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable  lesions over and above 
the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded  at baseline.   
Measurements of these  lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases  unequivocal 
progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
6.2.3 Methods for Evaluation  of Measurable Disease
The same method of assessment and the same technique should  be used to characterize  each  identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during  follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred  to evaluation by 
clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed  cannot  be imaged but are assessable by clinical  
exam.
Clinical lesions  Clinical lesions  will only be considered  measurable when they are superficial  (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g.,  skin nodules).  
In the case of skin lesions, documentation  by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x-ray  Lesions  on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions  when they are clearly defined and 
surrounded by aerated lung.  However,  CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions  on CT scan  based on the 
assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice  the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situations (e.g. for body scans).  
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT  is not always 
of optimal diagnostic  CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, for this study the CT portion  
of the PET-CT  can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably  with conventional 
CT in accurately measuring  cancer lesions  over time.  
Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone  cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical  response.   
Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be used to differentiate  between  partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses  (CR)  in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such  as germ  cell tumors,  
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  The cytological confirmation  of the neoplastic origin of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor  has met criteria for response 
or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response  or stable disease (an effusion  may be a 
side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.
FDG-PET  While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study,  it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression 
(particularly possible 'new'  disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified  
according to the following algorithm:  
a.Negative FDG-PET  at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new 
lesion.
b.No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET  at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up 
corresponds to a new site of disease  confirmed  by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up  
is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT  scans are needed  to determine 
if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG-PET  scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing  site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis  of the anatomic images,  this is not PD.
21c.FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy  in cases where a 
residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis  or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in 
this circumstance should  be prospectively described  in the protocol and supported by disease-specific 
medical literature for the indication.   However,  it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead 
to false  positive CR due to limitations  of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
 
 Note:   A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion  means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice  
that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
6.2.4 Response Criteria
6.2.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response  (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph  nodes (whether 
target or non-target) must  have  reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least  a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters  of target  lesions,  taking as 
reference the baseline  sum diameters
Progressive Disease  (PD):At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target  lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).   
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute  increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
Stable Disease  (SD):Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient  increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference  the smallest sum diameters while on study
6.2.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response  (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level.  All lymph nodes  must  be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short  axis). Note:  If tumor  markers are 
initially above  the upper  normal limit, they must normalize for a patient  to be considered in complete 
clinical response.
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits
Progressive Disease  (PD):Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  of 
existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally  trump target  lesion status.  It 
must be representative of overall  disease  status change, not a single lesion  increase.     
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating 
physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a 
later time by the review  panel (or Principal Investigator).
6.2.4.3 Evaluation of Best  Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive  disease the smallest  measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's  best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note: Patients  with a global deterioration  of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

6.2.5 Duration of Response
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease  the smallest  measurements 
recorded since  the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first 
date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
Duration of stable  disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started,  
including the baseline measurements. 
6.2.6 Progression-Free Survival
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever  
occurs first.
236.3. Correlative studies  
Subjects and sample processing:  Blood  samples (20-40 ml) will be processed at the Unutmaz laboratory to 
isolate PBMC using Ficoll separation as previously described. The PBMC will be counted and viable cells will 
be frozen  in 2-3 vials using freezing media and will be stored at -140 degrees along  with serum for the 
following analysis. Samples will be stored for the intended immune analyses only,  which  may include 
improving methods for analyzing the patient’s immune response,  for instance by culturing immune  cells.    
Samples will not be used nor stored for other research  purposes.
Immune profiling panels:
One vial of cells will be thawed and stained with fluorescently conjugated antibodies for flow cytometry 
(FACS) analysis for immune profiling,  using LSR-II FACS  machine at Unutmaz  laboratory. The data will be 
analyzed using Flowjo  software. 
1.T cell differentiation and activation  panel:  To identify following T cell subsets:
a) Naïve,  central memory, effector and terminally  differentiated and follicular helper subsets  of CD4 or CD8+  
T cell subsets
b) The proportion  of T cells that express activation and differentiation markers  CD38, PD1 and HLA-DR  and 
CD57.
2. Chemokine  receptor panel: To determine the proportion of T cells, including Tregs, with essential 
chemokine receptors, involved in tissue homing. Each chemokine receptor  identifies  tissue  homing as well 
as T cells with different effector functions. For example, Th1 cells express higher  CCR5 and CXCR3, 
whereas Th2 cells are higher in CCR4 expression. Cells expressing CLA home  to skin, whereas CCR6+ 
cells home to mucosal tissues and contain  most  of the Th17/Th22  functional  effector T cells.
3. Treg/Th17 cell subset panel: PBMC  will be stained with T cell marker CD3, CD4 and memory marker 
CD45RO and following  Treg markers. In addition  cells will be stained with newly identified  markers that 
define novel subsets of Tregs and Th17 cells.  In this panel  we perform stainings for intracellular transcription 
factors Foxp3  and Helios to identify Treg cells together with a viability dye to discriminate dead cells.
4. Treg differentiation and activation panel: In this panel we determine recently activated and cycling Treg 
and other T cell subsets, by using a cell cycle  protein called  Ki67 in conjunction with FoxP3, Helios and T cell 
activation markers. 
5. Myeloid and dendritic  cell panel: This panel identifies several myeloid lineages:
a) Monocytes
b) Two different dendritic  cells subsets (CD1c+ and CD1c-)
c) Plasmacytoid DCs, which secrete IFN alpha
d) Myeloid suppressor  cells (monocytic and granulocytic)
6. NK cells, gd-T cells and mucosa homing T cells panel: The goal of this panel  is to determine  the 
proportion of non-classical T cells and NK cells:
a) NK cells (both CD16+/- CD56+/- subsets)
b) Gammadelta T cells
c) Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) T cells
d) invariant  Natural  Killer T cells (iNKT),  which  recognize  CD1d molecules
Potential pitfalls and Quality control:  All of these panels are well-established in the Unutmaz laboratory and 
are routinely performed  on hundreds of human samples. Every antibody in each of the panels is extensively  
tested to ensure optimal staining and reproducibility.  We do not anticipate  any problems. For quality control, 
in each staining we utilize one known  donor for frozen in aliquots for each batch  of staining  to ensure  quality 
of antibodies and FACS  machines. 
24Analysis:  Percent of each lymphoid and myeloid subset will be determined using FlowJo FACS  software and 
entered into spreadsheets. The statistics  and patient correlative data will be performed by analyzing the 
same donors  before and after CTX treatment.  We will first determine statistical changes in the proportion of 
Tregs and other subsets  analyzed above before and after CTX-treatment. In the second layer analysis  we 
will develop  signatures  that correlate with the effectiveness  of the treatment or impact on specific regulatory 
or effector  compartments, by stratifying patients at the end of the study.
Examination of tumor  antigen-specific  CD4 and CD8 T cell responses 
T cell responses to the expressed tumor antigens will be monitored  by intracellular cytokine staining  (ICS) 
utilizing overlapping peptide  (OLP)  pools, as previously described  by our group  and others [67-69]). This 
method is suited for analysis  of cryopreserved PBMCs, allows the detection of CD4 and CD8 T cell 
responses (optimized by use of 15-mer  peptides with an overlap by 11 amino acid residues) and an 
assessment if multiple cytokines are being secreted  by single cells. If antigen-specific T cells are detected,  
confirmatory analysis  (ELISA  in serum and/or IHC for protein expression in tumor) may be performed. If 
outside laboratories (for instance MSKCC, MSSM) are used,  samples will be sent numbered,  without 
personal identifiers and no PHI will be shared.

Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)  are purified from blood  and frozen (by the Unutmaz 
lab) for paired analysis  of ex vivo and, if necessary,  in vitro stimulated (IVS [67]) T cell responses. For the ex 
vivo assay,  thawed pre- and post-treatment PBMCs are washed  in complete R-10  medium supplemented 
with 20 IU/ml  DNase I (Roche) and cultured  overnight at 37C. The following  day, the number of viable cells 
are counted, 5 million viable  cells/ml  in complete R-10  medium are plated at 200 ml/well in 96-well  V-bottom  
plates in the presence  of 1 mcg/ml anti-CD28  and anti-CD49d antibodies (BD Biosciences), and either 1 
mcg/ml TAA OLP (PRAME,  WT-1, Her2, NY-ESO-1,  MAGE A3; Proimmune)  or control  antigen (ProMix  CEF 
and ProMix MOG; ProImmune)  or no antigen. PMA/Ionomycin  will serve as an additional positive control. A 
mixture of Brefeldin  A and Monensin (GolgiPlug  and GolgiStop, BD Biosciences) is added to each  well after 
an 1 hour culture, before culturing for an additional 5 hours. Samples are then washed with PBS, stained for 
20 min at room  temperature with anti-CD8  PerCP-Cy5.5 and anti-CD4 FITC antibodies (BD Biosciences) 
and LIVE/DEAD violet (Invitrogen), washed again with PBS, then fixed and permeabilized for 20 min at room  
temperature using Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences).  Samples are then washed  using 
Perm/Wash solution (BD Biosciences) and stained  for intracellular antigens  using anti-IFNg  AlexaFluor 700 
(BioLegend), anti-TNFa PE-Cy7, anti-IL-2 PE and anti-CD3 APC-H7  (BD Biosciences) antibodies for 20 min 
at room  temperature.  Samples  are washed once with Perm/Wash solution, and acquired on a BD LSR II flow 
cytometer. 7-color compensation  (parallel  controls using cells singly  stained for each color) and data analysis 
are done with FlowJo flow cytometry analysis  software (TreeStar). Boolean  analysis is used determine the 
percentage of single, double and triple cytokine-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells.  The induction or boosting  
of TAA-specific  T cell immunity for an individual patient  is defined  as a post-treatment  value at week 9 at 
least 3-fold higher than baseline that is also 3-fold or greater than parallel negative controls  (and at least  
0.03) [67]. 
6.4 Follow  Up
Following study completion, patients will enter routine  follow-up with their primary oncologist, who may be 
contacted to provide  follow-up information on the patient’s  clinical  and disease status. Patients removed  from 
study for adverse events will be followed  until resolution or stabilization of the adverse  event.  
257Statistical Plan
7.1 Sample Size Determination
This is a Phase II open label non randomized single  arm trial of exemestane and cyclophosphamide to 
estimate the 3-month PFS in these patients.  Based on the data from Bolero  2 summarized above,  the 
estimated PFS at 3 months on the combination regimen is 75% assuming that the distribution  of progression 
free survival is exponential. [Calculations from PASS,  NCSS, 2008,  J. Hintze,  Kaysville, Ut.]. 
With a single  stage design, we can reject  the null hypothesis that the progression-free  survival rate at 3 
months is 50% or less versus that alternative that the progression free survival rate at 3 months is 75 % or 
greater with an alpha  of 0.05 and power of 80% with 23 patients enrolled over 2-2.5 years.  If the number of 
patients surviving  progression-free at 3 months is 15 or fewer,  then the regimen will be rejected.  
7.2 Statistical Methods
Patient characteristics at baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics (for quantitative variables, 
mean, median, quartiles, standard deviations, etc and graphical displays including  boxplots; for qualitative 
variables, proportions and frequency distributions).  The primary endpoint  is Progression-free survival (PFS).  
PFS is defined as the time from first treatment day until objective disease  progression  or death  from any 
cause. PFS will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analyses  will be based  on the intent-to-treat 
population. Patients who drop out prior to disease  progression (eg due to toxicity, non-compliance, or loss to 
follow-up) will be censored at the time of last study visit. 
With 23 patients, the exact 95% confidence interval for the 3-month  PFS will be estimated from the Kaplan 
Meier curve.  
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis
All patients  who have received at least  one dose of study drug will be included in the analyses of efficacy 
and safety.

8.2 Definitions
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others
Any incident,  experience, or outcome that meets all of the following  criteria: 
Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study-related  documents such as the 
IRB-approved protocol or consent  form, the investigators brochure, etc)
27Related  or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related  means  there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the incident experience, or outcome may have been  caused by the procedures 
involved in the research)
Suggests that the research  places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical,  
psychological, economic,  or social harm).
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience  that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course  of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses  or injuries should  be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic  procedures  are considered  to be adverse events  if the abnormality: results in 
study withdrawal,  is associated with a serious  adverse event, is associated with clinical signs or symptoms, 
leads to additional treatment  or to further diagnostic  tests or is considered by the investigator to be of clinical 
significance.
Serious Adverse  Event
Adverse events are classified  as serious  or non-serious.   A serious  adverse  event is any AE that is: 
Fatal, life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospital  stay,  results in persistent  or significant disability or 
incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect or an important  medical event.
Adverse Event Reporting Period
The study period during which  adverse  events  must be reported is defined  for this study as the period from 
the first day of study treatment until 30 days following the last administration  of study treatment. 
Abnormal Laboratory Values
A clinical laboratory  abnormality should be documented as an adverse  event if any one of the following 
conditions is met: The laboratory abnormality  is not otherwise refuted by a repeat  test to confirm the 
abnormality; the abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity or the abnormality  is of a degree that 
requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more  frequent follow-up 
assessments, further diagnostic  investigation, etc.
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as a serious adverse event unless  specifically  instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition  
responsible for surgery  should  be documented  as an adverse event if the condition  meets the criteria for and 
adverse event. 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse  
event in the following circumstances:
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization  for diagnostic or elective surgical  procedures for a preexisting  
condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse  event if the purpose of the 
surgery was elective or diagnostic  and the outcome was uneventful.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization  required to allow efficacy measurement for the study.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization  for therapy  of the target disease  of the study,  unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.
8.3 Recording of Adverse  Events
At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek  information  on adverse events  by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information  on all adverse  events should  be recorded  
immediately in the source  document,  and also in the appropriate adverse event  module of the case  report  
form (CRF).   
All adverse events occurring during the study period  must  be recorded.  The clinical course  of each event  
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed  up to determine the final outcome.   
288.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse  Events and Unanticipated Problems
8.4.1 Investigator reporting: notifying the IRB
This section specifies the NYULMC IRB requirements  for investigator reporting of unanticipated problems 
posing risk to subjects or other,  including  adverse events.  The IRB requirements  reflect the current  guidance 
documents released by the Office of Human Research  Protections (OHRP), and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and are respectively entitled “Guidance  on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated 
Problems Involving  Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events” and “Guidance for Clinical 
Investigators, Sponsors,  and IRBs: Adverse Event Reporting – Improving Human Subject Protection.”
Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working  days:
Researchers are required  to submit reports  of the following  problems promptly but no later than 5 working 
days from the time the investigator becomes aware  of the event:
Unanticipated problems including  adverse events  that are unexpected  and related
–Unexpected: An event is “unexpected” when its specificity  and severity are not accurately reflected in 
the protocol-related  documents,  such as the IRB-approved research  protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed  consent document and other relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling  and package  inserts. 
–Related  to the research procedures: An event is related to the research procedures  if in the opinion of 
the principal investigator or sponsor, the event was more  likely than not to be caused by the research 
procedures. 
–Harmful: either caused  harm to subjects  or others, or placed them at increased risk
Other Reportable events:
The following events also require prompt reporting to the IRB, though no later than 5 working  days:
Complaint  of a research subject when the complaint indicates unexpected  risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by the research  team.
Protocol deviations or violations (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations from the 
IRB approved protocol)  for any of the following situations:  
–one or more participants were placed  at increased risk of harm 
–the event has the potential to occur again
–the deviation  was necessary to protect a subject from immediate  harm
Breach of confidentiality
Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under  Subpart C and the 
investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.
New Information indicating a change  to the risks or potential  benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. (e.g. analysis indicates lower-than-expected response rate or a more severe or 
frequent side effect; Other research  finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; FDA labeling change or 
withdrawal from market)
Reporting Process
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using the form: “Reportable Event Form”  or as 
a written report of the event  (including a description  of the event with information  regarding its fulfillment of 
the above  criteria, follow-up/resolution  and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation). Copies of each report and documentation of IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the 
Clinical Investigator’s study  file.

8.7 Medical  Monitoring
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study. This safety monitoring 
will include careful assessment and appropriate  reporting  of adverse  events as noted  above,  as well as the 
construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan (see section 10).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious  adverse  events. The 
independent medical monitor assigned to the trial (Dr. A. Pavlick) is able to review all unexpected events and 
to evaluate/grant any waivers required for enrollment of study conduct  in accordance to institutional 
guidelines.
8.7.1 Data Monitoring Committee
This investigator initiated study will be monitored by the Data Safety  Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the 
New York University Cancer Institute (NYUCI). The DSMC operates  based on the 2011 National Cancer 
Institute approved Charter. It is a multidisciplinary committee (consisting of clinical investigators/oncologists, 
biostatisticians, nurses and research administration  staff knowledgeable of research methodology and 
design and in proper conduct of clinical  trials)  that is responsible for monitoring safety, conduct  and 
compliance in accordance with protocol data monitoring  plans for clinical  trials conducted in the NYUCI that 
are not monitored by another institution or agency.  The DSMC reports to the Director of the NYUCI (William 
L. Carroll, M D). Per the NYUCI  Institutional  Data  Safety  and Monitoring Plan, this phase 2 trial will be 
monitored by DSMC annually (from the date the first patient is enrolled) and at the completion of the study 
prior to study  closure. This review includes  accrual  data, subject demographics and adverse events. 
Principal Investigators are required to attend the review  of their studies.  Additional reviews can be scheduled 
based on SAE reports, investigator identified issues, external information, etc.
9Data Handling and Record  Keeping
9.1 Confidentiality
The study team will maintain clinical and laboratory data in a designed manner  to ensure  patient  
confidentiality. All study personnel have passed human subject  protection courses. If applicable,  tissue 
samples sent to collaborators outside of NYU/Bellevue will only be labeled  with an assigned protocol-patient 
identification number  without patient  identifiers. Systems used for electronic data capture are compliant  with 
FDA regulations  in 21 CFR Part 11 and applicable local regulatory agency  guidelines. All documents  are 
kept in strictly confidential  files and are only made accessible for review of sponsors, monitors and 
authorized representatives  of regulatory agencies as described in the informed consent document. 
9.2 Confidentiality and HIPAA
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements  of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  (HIPAA).  Those regulations require  a signed  
subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
What  protected  health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
Who will have access to that information and why
Who will use or disclose that information 
The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the event  that a subject  revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator,  by regulation, retains  
the ability  to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made  to obtain permission to collect at 
least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.
309.3 Source  Documents
Source data is all information, original records of clinical  findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical 
trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation  of the trial.  Source data are contained in source  
documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and 
office charts,  laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’  diaries or evaluation checklists,  pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified  after verification as 
being accurate and complete, microfiches,  photographic negatives,  microfilm or magnetic  media, x-rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.
9.4 Case Report Forms
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.   All data requested 
on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.   
9.5 Records Retention
It is the investigator’s responsibility  to retain study essential documents for at least 2 years after the formal 
closure of the study.  
10Study  Monitoring,  Auditing, and Inspecting
10.1 Study Monitoring  Plan
The proposed trial entails moderate  risks to subjects.  
At the NYU Cancer Institute, all investigator-initiated  protocols  are subject  to a standardized  data and safety  
monitoring, which includes  scientific  peer review,  IRB review,  Phase I/II committee  review and DSMC review 
as well as internal auditing. 
The review of AEs and trial conduct for this trial occurs at several levels:
(1) Principal  Investigator:  Adverse events are evaluated monthly by the principal investigator in conjunction 
with the research  nurses, data manager and research  team. 
(2) Internal Phase I/II Committee: Study progress, enrollment and AEs are also reviewed monthly by the 
NYU Phase  I/II Committee. This review includes  nurses and data managers  as well. 
(3) DSMC: See 8.7.1. 
(4) Institutional  Review Board (IRB):  An annual report to the IRB is submitted by the trial PI for continuation 
of the protocol. It includes a summary  of all AEs, total enrollment with demographics,  protocol violations,  and 
current status of subjects as well as available  research  data.
(5) In addition,  the internal audit committee will inspect the source documents, including consent forms for 
randomly selected enrolled participants at regular  intervals throughout  the trial to verify adherence to the 
protocol; the completeness,  accuracy and consistency of the data;  and adherence to ICH Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines. 
10.2 Auditing  and Inspecting
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB/EC, the sponsor,  
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments,  study data etc.).  The 
investigator will ensure the capability for inspections  of applicable study-related  facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory,  etc.).
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential  inspection by government 
regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality  assurance offices.
3111Ethical Considerations
This study is to be conducted accordance with applicable  US government  regulations  and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable  institutional research policies and procedures.
This protocol  and any amendments will be submitted to the NYU Institutional  Review Board (IRB)  in 
agreement with local legal  prescriptions, for formal  approval of the study conduct.   The decision of the IRB 
concerning the conduct  of the study will be made in writing  to the investigator and a copy  of this decision will 
be provided  to the sponsor  before commencement of this study.  The investigator should  provide a list of IRB 
members and their affiliate to the sponsor.
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient  
information for subjects to make an informed  decision about their participation in this study.  This consent  
form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the IRB for the study.   The formal  consent  
of a subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes  any 
study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable  surrogate, and the 
investigator-designated research professional obtaining  the consent. 
The consenting process and documentation will follow Standard Operating  Procedure no 30 (Obtaining 
Informed Consent for Clinical Trials) of the NYUCI  CTO.
